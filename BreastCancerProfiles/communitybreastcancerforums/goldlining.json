Sorry you got this scare. Everyone here has been where you are, but everyone where you are doesn't end up with BC. Even if it is BC, you will be welcomed here into this club no one wants to join and you will find lots of support. I have never seen such depths of strength as I have seen here. People have this amazing capability to meet challenges. I had no palpable \"lump\" (I never did the manual exam, but my MD, the mammo clinic nurse and the breast surgeon all agreed there was no lump), but the mammogram found questionable spots and the magnified mammogram confirmed that they were questionable. Then there was a biopsy which confirmed abnormality of some cells. I then had a lumpectomy after which the abnormal cells were diagnosed as DCIS, a pre-invasive form of BC where the cancer cells are entirely within the milk ducts. I was very happy to have that early opportunity to act on this information. But don't get ahead of yourself. Go one test at a time.",

It is squashable into a shape resembling the natural side, is covered in a nice wicking type microfibre jersey, and has a weight that is reasonably balanced for running.

I am eight weeks out and reading on these boards about people having sunken indentations in lieu of breasts, and I don't. The area above the scar protrudes more than the scar itself. The breast surgeon saw the whole deal last week and was ever so pleased with his work, so it clearly doesn't look unusual to him. My hypothesis was swelling. Looking back, it took a good couple of months for my lumpectomy to form a hollow pit. For the first bit, it did not look like there was anything removed at all (and the removed tissue was the size of a stick of butter). So now with the mastectomy, I do still feel \"puffy\" under the arm, around the back of under the arm, and above the scar. My alternate hypothesis is that I have such spectacular pectoral muscles that the skin over top protrudes more than the area beneath the pecs. That amuses me a little because I have the pec strength of a gnat. ",

I've had quite a few business and personal trips through the US this year and in most cases there was a scanner and I asked for the pat down. They put me aside by a gate and call the female officer. When the female officer arrives and takes me to the pat down spot, I tell her that I have a prosthesis and a hearing aid, and they all have indicated that they get it. Before they get started, they make sure that I have my hand luggage secured or have companions taking care of it so that I don't lose anything. They have always been courteous and before beginning have asked if I hurt anywhere, and I've said \"I just did a half marathon yesterday, what do you think?\" or \"I have to pee, so take it easy.\" They're human. Who knows, they may be family members or BC sisters themselves. I am sure that there is a private area for the pat downs but I figure the positive of doing it openly is that everyone can see that they are proper about it. I have never had an agent pay any unseemly attention to the foob or other private parts for that matter. In all the airports I have done this in, they seem to be conscious of making me comfortable about it. I agree that there may be minimal safety improvement by doing these scans and patdowns, but it's the way it is, and in the case of the flight home from the run, I prefer to think of it as getting a head start on the massage I booked for the day I get home.",

(I'm doing the other side but they wouldn't do the prophylactic in the same procedure, and I did not want to put a knife in the hand of an unwilling man while I'm sleeping.) I was answering urgent emails from lawyers needing expert witness info by 6:00 pm after waking up from anaesthesia at 09:30 and going home at 2:00pm. I was relatively coherent and physically up to typing, even quite a bit, from the outset. But didn't feel up to involving prolonged standing or arm waving (like lecturing) for a couple of months, really, and I did not really feel I had the concentration to drive for a couple of months. Cumulatively, I worked 35 hours a week throughout my whole surgical adventure. Some early days, I didn't do much and I was not efficient cognitively, but as time went on, I could pick up the difference at least in hours if not in efficiency. (Didn't stop my work charging my sick bank at the rate of \"40% sick\" though. I guess they feel entitled to 58.5 hours/week from us despite our contract being for 35!) I am not sure it was recovery from anaesthesia, post-traumatic poor-me-itis, or infuriation at the head-up-the-assedness of my employer that accounts for the most lost productivity, but it was not my physical condition. I attended a conference (and rode roller coasters, ahem) a month afterwards, and ran a half marathon after 10 weeks (15 minutes slower than pre-BC pace, but not a bad deal). I wish I'd had bilateral because I had to run with the stupid beanie foob, but we're doing the other side with the reconstruction later this year. The worst for me was trying to sleep with that damned drain for 15 days. I ended up sleeping sitting up sideways on my sofa as I don't have a recliner. I second the suggestion to get your hairdresser to do the shampoo and dry for you in that first week or two. A professional blow dry stays fresh longer than what you can do even with family help. And I definitely second the stool softeners tip. Do not overeat until they start to work. Initially I wore the surgical camisole with the pockets for the drains, but later found I liked a button up flannel shirt or PJ top or acrylic knit sweater better on my skin. I clipped the drain thingy to the waistband of the pants. Good luck with yours. I'm sure we'll see you here on your keyboard shortly after!",

That was Jan 10. At that appointment, they said come back in 6 weeks. When I asked for that appointment, they gave me March 7. So their calendar math is a little stretchier than mine is. My director said HR requires me to have the \"treating physician\" approve my return to work (RTW) before I do any work, to reduce the employer's liability, therefore I can't \"unofficially\" work before this appointment (despite the fact that I have been, and people up to the VP level damn well know it), and the surgeon's office said he couldn't approve RTW before seeing me. However now HR is crabbing about the calendar math, like I did not notice that it was more than 6 weeks from the follow up to the March 7 date. (It should be said that my sick benefits are ample to cover me to and even beyond March 7 if needed.) I explained to HR that I tried to get an earlier appointment and the surgeon knew my planned RTW date but seems to be away and unavailable at the material times for checking my condition. So HR says \"can't you go to your GP?\" I said, you told me I had to be cleared by my \"treating physician\", plus I don't think my GP has ever seen a DIEP, good or bad. All she would be able to say is \"she says she feels fine\". (And I don't have a lot of confidence in my GP. She is a port in a storm but very not helpful.) I said if you will take hearsay from my GP, why can't I just come back when I want? The other thing that pisses me right off is that I can't refrain from all \"work\" until I see the PS because to be off, I need to prepare more material for my replacements to do, due to the nature of my job. Honest to dog, I have had more stress from freaking HR than I have had from the DCIS or the DIEP.  (And in other Employer of the Year news, I just got a pink :-P flower arrangement from the level one up from my Director. They just realized I have been off since Dec 15.)",

I don't have any enjoyment from anything, just a lot of anger.  It's not the stupid BC or anything treatment and I had no chemo. It's how angry I feel at people not cutting me any slack or respecting the slack I have taken up voluntarily (or under duress) to minimize the adverse impact of my condition on other people and how tired it all makes me, and consciousness of the speculative link between stress and overwork and BC. I do nothing but work all the damned time now, to catch up. Even the psych pissed me off. I'm supposed to relax an hour a day, a day a week and a week a year. \"Can you do that?\" Yeah right. But I know I am supposed to say \"of course you're absolutely right and I shall try my utmost to turn a new leaf\", so that is what I said, but I haven't had a vacation in 12 years and not by choice. BC was the closest thing to a vacation I have had. That 12 hours sleep for DIEP was the best 12 consecutive hours I have had in years. I have pushed myself to go swim for a half hour a couple of times, but I can't run with a stress fracture at the moment, and that was the only \"me time\" thing I have done for the past few years. I have no option not to do the work. I have to figure some way to feel something other than anger, fear, or sadness. So nice to read the good updates and progress from everyone. I get a little vicarious encouragement from good stories, and a little validation from the crabby and glum stories, that  maybe it's not just me and my evil people, but just lingering echoes of what we all went through. Interesting to think about. Hugs to all. ",

I would feel pretty proud of my resilience and fortitude to bounce back and get back in the saddle if only I got respect instead of contempt. Despite the effort input, the output never seems enough.

For the nervous gals staring at the unknown, I second the veteran reports. It truly is manageable. It'll be okay. I was in by 6:00 and home by 2:00. I am looking forward to some inpatient days with the DIEP actually.   The worst of the mastectomy isn't the incision. It's the drain. Just keep reasonably still until the drainage is reduced. Moving the arm around a lot pumps fluid out and into the drain and you're stuck with it until it gets below a certain level determined by the surgeon. Don't try to work ahead on the shoulder rehab timetable thinking it's good to be a keener. Save it for after the drain is out. But then you'll probably feel much better. I was doing an hour at a time on the treadmill in a month (and it improved my overall pain level by a ton!) and did a half marathon only 15 minutes slower than pre-surgery at 10 weeks. Catwhispurrer, I had the wire before the lumpectomy. That went in pre-anaesthesia, unfortunately, and there I was with a wire dangling out of my boob under a bathrobe for 2 1/2 hours while they got their act together. When I got into the OR, I said, \"you know which side you're cutting, right?\" and he said \"the one with the wire sticking out\", which I was glad to hear! It is almost the same as the biopsy, and it is ouchy, but it's only pain, it will be over soon, and you're tougher than you think. I liked several people's comments about mental conditioning. The OR nurse told me to think calming thoughts as you fall asleep in the OR and you will wake up in a better frame of mind. For you it might be prayer or guided imagery; I visualized roller coasters and I woke up feeling great! So habit forming I'm doing the other one ",

My lumpectomy, I was there at 8 for the wire but wasn't in the OR till something like noon but if they explained the reason, I didn't get it. Because the sign language interpreter was booked from 8-10 expecting I'd be in the OR by then and she had another appointment to go to, so she was long gone before I saw any of the doctors and nurses, so I basically had a veterinary lumpectomy. (At least I don't have multiple pairs of breasts like veterinary patients!) New hospital tomorrow, so new adventures. Will I have a gurney? Will I be in the OR at the scheduled time?

Those parts that came open developed keloids (ugly scarring) as well. Honestly, why can they not use proper sutures? My lumpectomy was sutures. My current DIEP is sutures. The staples seem so brutal. Take the time, dude. I was shocked with staples, as the mx was the same surgeon as my lumpectomy. My surgeon was similarly very impressed with his own work, sort of like he was fishing for praise or compliments, and dismissed my \"doesn't seem right\" comments about the tightness and the numbness. I wonder if they are sort of trying to condition patients not to complain when they make those \"only a surgeon could love an incision like this\" comments. My drain for the umx took 2-3 weeks to get under the number of mL for the required number of days but for bilateral DIEP, all my drains were out on day 7. Five days in hospital is better to keep you idle, I guess.",

I completely understand the theory of the caffeine and vasoconstriction, but in terms of empirical substantiation, I wonder how evidence-based that order is. My big progress: my last DRAIN IS GONE. I put out 15 mL in the first day and 12 mL in the second day which is far below the doctor's order of <25 mL/24 hour for two days and the homecare nurse wants to leave it another day because that's what we do based on what we see in the community. I said call the unit if you want clarification. She said \"I can't take orders from a nurse, only a doctor\". I said, well the doctor said it can come out now.

When I found that out, it made sense. It was definitely more the source of the pain than the mastectomy itself. Pain meds as needed. I am using Tylenol for a toothache and an arm-shoulder strain I got when faceplanting in the effort to dash across a busy street, but the upstairs-downstairs incisions of the DIEP are not so bad at 3 weeks. Keeping alert and directing people to the other arm for IV and blood pressure is going to be an ongoing challenge because now that the initial numbess is gone, I sometimes forget. They say LE can start at any time, even years after the surgery, so worth being prudent. This recent surgery, they put a big piece of tape the length of my arm on the old node side saying \"no IV, blood pressure, injections this side\" so that there would be no misunderstandings while I was asleep.  eve, I am with everyone else saying that 6 and even 8 weeks is the norm for mastectomy sick leave. The drainage for me was 2-3 weeks for mastectomy last year and one week for the recent DIEP. It has to reduce to 20 or 30 mL on two consecutive days or they won't take it out. (The target level seems to vary by surgeon.) I was trying to loosen up and do light movements last time, but this time, I have been deliberately idle. Surgeons who say go ahead, stretch, move, are not the ones with a drain poking them. Last time, I was putting away dishes over my head three days after surgery. I could do it, sure, but I paid. Not this time. (I will get physio to catch up the range of motion.) But I imagine the drainage can also be provoked by irritations inside the body like TEs. Fortunately for me, I haven't had that. While I was on the computer the same day as mastectomy and working \"full time\" hours throughout my recovery, I was ridiculously inefficient. The surgeon clearly said 6-8 weeks absence. I required 6 after lumpectomy and 8 after mastectomy to do the physical parts of my job that involved prolonged standing, prolonged talking, animated arm gesturing, carrying materials, and taking any interest in things other than my own physical condition. During the 6 weeks, I did correspondence and other writing, advising people, compiling information etc. and attended the occasional sit-down meeting after a few weeks. This time, with DIEP reconstruction, I was *in hospital* for almost a week. Mastectomy and especially reconstruction is much more physically demanding and the longer the surgery, the longer the fuzzy head from anaesthesia. Anyone who said it was a one-week recovery is out to lunch.",

THIS December, I just call for getting on the OR schedule in January or February, so that I can actually train until the run, and my recuperation will be at a more convenient time for me. I agree with the comment that physiotherapy should be standard orders. I am STILL going every other week, working on strengthening a bunch of different small muscles to balance out the very tight abdominal area post DIEP, and unkinking the shoulders where they take the toll from my wonky posture and the stupid numb node area and occasional LE swelling (chest not arm). Between the physio and the psych, surgery is probably the smallest part of my treatment time!",

I did get a wicked infection from poor nursing technique when she removed the drain, but aside from a week of foul tasting antibiotics, no worse the wear. This time I bought a recliner for sleeping until the last drain is out. This time (tomorrow!) I get a few inpatient days with the DIEP and am supposed to have all drains but one removed before I go home, and home care nurse visits (hopefully a better one). I am in a clinical trial for something that seems to work like the ONQ system and have a 50% chance it will just be saline, but decided to roll the dice. It will be removed before I go home however. I don't think it is conventional standard care in Canada for DIEP although they do use it for other abdominal procedures. I didn't use much of the heavy duty painkillers after I was home. Maybe at bedtime for a little bit. I know the DIEP will be different but I'm hoping for similar good fortunes.",

The bonus to me of doing the second breast BEFORE symptoms are detected in it is no nodes removed. The concern is a risk of lymphedema and limitations on getting blood pressures, IVs, injections, or even cuts and hangnails on the node-removal side. Fortunately although I didn't get the bilateral I wanted last year, I got the other side done before any abnormalities were found. (Fingers crossed there is nothing in the pathology. They do check, just in case.) I had the long-form reconstruction this time, DIEP, and included the prophylactic mastectomy on the other side in the same sleep. So at 8:30 the BS started the mastectomy and at some point the PS arrived and started the bilateral DIEP with his team of fellows and residents, and I woke up very foggy at 7:30. I may have been in recovery for some time but well under. My pinched nerve in my hip is GONE though. What 20 hours of chiropractic and acupuncture couldn't fix, 10 hours of general anaestesia does! So relaxed. Anyway, the two reconstructions were from the same ab flap. Even so, the delayed side used the ab skin for half the breast, whereas the immediate side used the breast skin everywhere except a circle in the middle. If the scars fade, I don't think that will be such a big deal, and if I don't get a keloid (as I did with the stapled incision from my mastectomy last year) I usually don't have very visible scars. They are not symmetrical, probably because of the structural factor the skin provides being different on the two sides. If it doesn't resolve as it heals, we may address it with a \"tune up\". There's no official \"Stage 2\" in this program, but if a tune up is needed, it's done. If I had done a bulateral, I would probably be more symmetrical now, and wouldn't have lugged the much heavier natural boob around all year, complemented with a bigger prosthesis than I wanted to have but needed (and even then, it really didn't match). But I probably would have had a too-tight scar on both sides rather than just one during the wait for reconstruction. I would say at this point 6 days post DIEP that I feel better than the mx last year in relation to the drain and the nodes. The mx drains were in a LONG time, nearly 3 weeks. I will bet that the last drain will come out tomorrow, and the position of the drains was better and less painful. I don't know the reason for the difference but for my mx the drain was on my back but I was supposed to lie on my back to sleep? Cruel. If they could have made my frankenboobs out of someone else's ab flap (and don't we all get lots of offers?) I would probably be in much better shape on the immediate mx/recon side than I was at 6 days post mx without recon last year, just because of the nodes. The mx side this time with NO node removal is piece of cake comfortable. I do feel more physically drained and I do obviously have the tummy tuck recovery. (But I'm glad to say farewell to the baby weight!) So that's my situation. Someone that already had nodes out on both sides might have a different set of trade-offs.",

A bit of a squabble with the homecare nurse that wanted to leave it one additional day, but I didn't let her. So I am tube free: anaesthesia tube, Foley catheter, two TAP block tubes, an IV, and four drains, gone, one by one, in a week post mx/bilateral DIEP! This time last week I was asleep! ",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2011 12:59AM - edited Jul 15, 2011 12:59AM by goldlining I'll hold your hand too. I described it as a mammogram, with extra-special bonus stabbing. Mine was lying on my side. It didn't start as a gurney, if I recall correctly. It was more of a sort of dentist chair that then reclined and then they parked me so that the breast would go between the clear plates for the squash. Your posture depends on the angle they need to get the sample at and where the suspicious bits are believed to be based on the regular and magnified mammograms or the lump if you felt one. The stereotactic part is taking pictures mammograms from two or more angles so the computer can calculate where the target point is.  Your breast is squeezed in immobilized at that point, but my machine was clearly designed by men, so when it moved the camera head to the next angle, it sort of shuddered and that tugged on the breast. Then the images from two angles are compared to compute a 3-D image that tells them where the suspicious bits are. From what I could surmise, they aim what is basically a pistol-sized harpoon against your breast and the computer tells them the angle to hold it and calculates how deep to shoot, and then it takes its bites. They did about 4 for me, went away and came back and did another half dozen. Only one of them was particularly ouchy. The others were about on par with botox or dental work. Much less uncomfortable than cervical bx. Afterwards pain, the stiffness in the neck being in that posture, and in my bottom arm being compressed under my head the whole time was uncomfortable. The lingering discomfort of the stabbing wasn't any worse than, say, nicking your finger cutting vegetables. The hole bled like the dickens for a few minutes and they sopped it up. I got quite a nice bandage and I was pretty good to go. The emotional post traumatic stress was really the worst part. The procedure is over, but the mystery has escalated. Now you have to wait for the path report. During the procedure, the nurse and her compassion is probably a big factor. Does she care about making you at ease? Will she touch your arm or leg in a soothing way while the radiologist does the harpooning? That can make all the difference in the world. Just go to your happy place, ask them to comfort you. It's only pain and it will be over soon. You're stronger than you think. We're here, too. ",

I don't like the sound of heat around any incision site, as for me, that has always been infection. Some infections are only responsive to certain antibiotics. Pains near the incision, especially zappy pains, can easily be the nerves trying to reestablish themselves. I had it with a breast reduction and with mastectomy and DIEP. I feel really tired today but I walked 4 miles on the treadmill yesterday. The amount of sleeping you describe and the fuzziness sounds very different from any of my experiences. Also, if you feel fuzzy, it may be better to use a taxi for your husband to get his arm looked at. Even healing really well, I didn't feel alert enough to drive for well over a month.

I don't think they make that model any more, but a nice fitting, non-underwired sports bra that would fit you now might be a good transitional bra. (At home by myself, I did not wear a bra, but then I was usually in PJs!) But that's the second stage of boob containment. Before you are in the bra, you have the first stage of boob containment during the post-surgery period when the drains are still in and they give you (or tell you to buy) that camisole with the drain pockets. The camisole is useless for large breasts. No support at all. If you have to go out in public before you can put on a sports bra, make sure you have a boxy jacket, practise draping scarves, and such because it's awful. If the drain is still in, you have to hide the bulb somewhere too. I clipped it to my waistband under my jacket in the small of my back and hoped no one would hug me. You can't get fitted for the other kind of prosthesis until the swelling and healing gets a certain ways along, like 6-8 weeks. If you are getting your prophylactic mx/recon soonish, maybe you won't need to go into stage three of boob containment and the prosthesis buffet. You could just use the fluffy fibrefill foob as a stopgap. They come in different sizes and they gave me one of those in my choice of sizes at the hospital. If you're going to be stuck with the asymmetry for some time, you will want to proceed and get a prosthesis/bra.  For CookieMonster (Judy), I think they do make prostheses for matching different sizes because the gals with lumpectomies are sometimes in that position. A beanie foob might be a nice lightweight option for short term. They come in different sizes but the shape is determined by the space they are filling. Fitting is the key to the prosthesis/bra experience and mine was a crappy one. The bra fitter was just beyond highly recommended by my breast centre. Why, it was a veritable \"queen for a day\" experience, I was told. The fitter put me in a C bra. I suppose she was deceived because I have a lot of volume in width rather than projection, but the C cup does NOT contain my entire breast, so it sort of \"floats\". My rubber chicken prosthesis is allegedly the \"light\" variety but despite not even properly filling the pocket on the C bra she fit me in, it weighs about 12 ounces and the weight on my shoulder is making my chiro and massage therapists rich, and all my shirts pull dramatically to the side due to the difference in size between me and the prosthesis. Why not get refitted? For starters, the whole kit of two regular bras, a fancy bra I have used twice in a year, a rubber chicken foob and a beanie foob was about $800, and the insurance in my situation only covered the rubber chicken, not the bras. (Although both the socialized health and my benefit plan reimbursed me for the same prosthesis!) But I decided to proceed with a DIEP recon with the prophylactic mastectomy and just put up with it in the mean time. I thought it would be before now, but it's in December, a year and two days after the first mx. And will be going through the Xmas holidays once again trying to conceal my drains, dressings, and discomfort. If I was doing the fitting again, I would have taken my pre-mastectomy well-fitted everyday bra with me to the prosthesis fitting to show her \"see? See the size? See how it fits the one remaining boob purrrrfectly? I am NOT a C, and I want my future bra to fit as well as my past bra.\" Some surgeons are particular about whether you can use underwires but if you have an eligible bra that you want to continue to use with the prosthesis, the bra fitters can sew pockets in for a small fee. Hope that helped. ",

I don't disagree with taking them and the 0/2 news was better than no news, but I was disgruntled that he didn't even mention it after I complained about the discomfort.",

I had only DCIS as of my lumpectomy in Oct 2010, but the margins were too small so I asked for a mastectomy which they did in Dec 2010. I was completely surprised that they took two nodes (\"level one\" nodes. I am not sure they did any \"sentinel\" testing to select nodes as there was no dye injection involved, but I guess the closest two nodes.) With the finding that the nodes were clear, all breathed a sigh of relief. However, as I say, I did not know they were going to be doing the node excision and my underarm was numb (and still is a year later) and when I remarked on that to the surgeon he just said he sewed it all up really tight or something dismissive like that. Only when I got the pathology report did I see there were nodes removed. I am not opposed to doing it, but I was pretty peeved at the surgeon's lack of information-sharing.  This time, the prophylactic mastectomy on the other side has a clear mammogram and no reason to suspect anything is wrong there, so they will not do nodes (different surgeon, and I did ask this time!) They will do the pathology exam on the removed breast just in case, and I guess if anything is bad, they could always go back and mess up my nodes at a later date.  Good luck with yours and it probably won't be as bad as you think. I'm having DIEP this time, so will be getting the inpatient experience for a few days but the mastectomy alone wasn't bad. (The drain was miserable, however. But it's only pain and it will be over soon.)",

With all due respect to everyone else's world view, I can get used to something sub-optimal but certain easier than I can with uncertainty. And the DCIS had gone from not sure if it is even really DCIS to \"holy crap over 4 cm of grade 3\" in just 6 months. It was getting ready to make a move. The boobs had a good run, but I don't love them that much. I especially don't like having just one. The age thing, I wonder. On the one hand maybe they think younger patients have more self-image issues and are more in need of immediate recon? But the younger you are, the more replacement of implants you have to look forward to, i.e., every 10 years or so. But I think a lot more PS can do implants than flap surgeries and the wait for flaps seems to be longer (but maybe not as long for the gals who still have the cancer not yet removed). You can talk to the PS and find out what he does, but don't feel you have to rush into immediate recon if he only has one option and you're not hot on it. It's probably convenient to do in one sleep but I don't mind the recon delay as much as I mind the prophylactic mx delay.",

They booked a sign language interpreter and ignored my request to know who they use and the person I recommended. My first clue of this derailment was when my recommended interpreter was told she can come but won't be paid. I thought I had it all sorted out and now back to fighting to know the name, and possibly vetoing the person they chose. It isn't the waving of hands or the taking of a fee that matters. They have to be signing exactly and entirely the meaning of what people are saying, and you'd be surprised how often they aren't, sometimes because they simply don't understand it. Plus interpreters are a very small group and I have to work with these people in professional settings afterwards. I don't feel comfortable having just \"anybody\" see me in a vulnerable moment. Even more important with the theft of my hearing aid the other day and no way to get replacement by 15th. The latter also royally buggers up my last minute work loose-ends cleanup for sure.

The upper back/shoulders for me is the primary site for where my stress goes. I had also twisted a vertebra between the shoulder blades in a ballet class in the 80s, and didn't have chiropractic adjustment of it for five years, so it is a lingering weakness. The pain was blissfully g-o-n-e after I woke up from the DIEP surgery (11 hours of paralytic drugs are a wonder) and for several weeks after, but has come back since I resumed my full load of keyboard work and stress of responsibilities. My pain sometimes feels like it is burning, and is unresponsive to robaxacet. Heat feels nice but does nothing for it. Massage likewise. Massage therapist says it feels tight, but the massage does not provide lasting relaxation. I have the upper back worked on when I see the physio (physical therapist for you Americans) when she stretches out my hip joints and shoulders. She stretches out the small muscles as I turn to each side. I was told I might find more relief from cool packs rather than heat but I don't like being cold so I don't. I sometimes put the cold blue goo on it though. I am a side and front sleeper so I just use a flattish pillow so as not to deviate the neck too much.

However I am still waiting to get assessed for LE vest so I don't have a real compression vest, and the spanx camisole did not work. (Well, it was slimming, and comfortable, but not anti-swelling.) I am so clueless about the manual lymph drainage. I try to pay attention, but I cannot make it go on my own. It was absolutely wonderful to be there though. It was like travel back in time pre-BC and if it wasn't for the swelling, I am sure I would not have thought about BC at all the entire time. ",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2012 10:05PM - edited Aug 1, 2012 10:06PM by goldlining Bogie, there are surely some people whose DIEP went sideways, just like with the other options, but with a very experienced surgeon, it has a lot of positives. My foobs are natural tissue and move and shape that way. My surgeon is the superhero of flaps (not just breast recon but faces after oral cancer) with a lot of experience with the microsurgery technique, and at least four \"ducklings\" dedicated to making a positive impression on him, so I had a lot of attention. The length of the surgery was nothing to me. All I had to do was show up on time and go back to sleep :-D It totally fixed backpain that I had been seeing chiro/physio/massage weekly or more often for 8 months as well. The relaxation from the anaesthesia was long enough to relax what was messing me up! I was barely awake that evening and stayed the next day in the step-down unit and had the flaps Dopplered hourly to confirm good blood flow, then they relocated me to the surgery ward where I had a private room. I stayed I think five days. I had a clinical trial painkilling drip (or placebo) self-administering itself in the abdominal incision and a morphine clicker controlled by me. I tried that but it didn't really do anything for the pain that really bothered me which was the damned headache from the germicide in the hospital (virox, which contains formaldehyde, and I am sensitized to it). I had all but one drain removed before going home and the remaining one was not draining anything so it was gone in the minimum 48 hours. I couldn't lift more than 10 lb for six weeks or do ab exercises but I had no other restrictions. I had no dietary limits or special garments to wear. I was able to wash my own hair unassisted the day the drain was gone. I bought a recliner but soon abandoned it for the bed and pillows. I started on the treadmill at 2 weeks, for an hour at 4mph and worked my way up to weekly sessions of 90 minutes +, then ran in a 5K at 6 weeks and did a half marathon 2 days later in 3:07. Work, however, would not let me come back for another four weeks because they did not have the paperwork from the surgeon. Notwithstanding that, I actually was working, and did work starting from about 10 days post op, in a very feeble hobbling-around way, but it was good to get out, too. The flat tummy is a great bonus. Knowing in my head that there is stooping and actually experiencing it are two different things. I really did not do the math that they are taking out, I don't know - 6 inches? - of vertical height on the front, but not of the spine, and it takes time for the skin to stretch out. I was more or less upright, albeit tight, by the time I did the 5K but I was noticeably stooped at 5 weeks. I still am tight but I have been skimping on strength and conditioning in order to catch up on missed work.  I have enough asymmetry that I have a good excuse for a touch-up later and perhaps recycle a little hip fat for that purpose, but I doubt you would notice asymmetry in my everyday attire. My surgeon doesn't go in assuming there will be a \"Stage 2\" the way DIEPs are described on the forums here. The incisions don't require any revision and the shape is pretty good. Not at all the \"hamburger bun\" shape. One has a bit of a dent and the other has a bit of an overhang, largely because the flaps were not precisely divided in half the way you would do if it was dough for two bread loaves. Also, one was delayed and the other was immediate, so the delayed side uses ab skin and just patches it in, whereas the delayed had the flap skinned and stuffed through the porthole with just a circle of ab skin where the areola would be. The shaping and positioning stitches, I imagine, would be different for the two cases.   My only \"complication\" is not from the DIEP but from the hack mastectomy that I had the previous year and the two nodes. Just on the trunk and mild/moderate. That and the stressful work relationships. The surgery was the best part of my whole year, more or less. Your mileage may vary but that was my journey in a large nutshell.",

Some gals wake up in garments, others are told to purchase a specific model of camisole for the trip home, etc. Seems to depend on the centre. For lumpectomy, same-day surgery and home that day, I was just told to bring a sports bra.  Mine does up in the back and there was no problem with that. I can't remember if someone did it for me or I did it. What was key is that it was bounce-proof. I worry the step-in types are stretchy and the poor, wounded breast would be jiggly. You do not want bouncing with a lumpectomy. In contrast, for the mastectomy, I had to purchase a camisole with pockets. The step-in/stretch characteristic is not a problem there because there is no wounded breast to jiggle, but it was a waste of freaking money. It had no support for the other breast. The special feature of the camisole is pockets for the drains. If someone can't figure out how to clip the drains to a waistband, belt, or string, or stick into pyjama shirt pocket, then they can have the camisole. It was the stupidest thing I have bought in this process.  But there was no drain for lumpectomy for me. The healing for lumpectomy was really fast. Too bad that wasn't the end of it.

Both cases, I just said \"I'm stuck in the middle because this has to be done, and I feel badly that the timing is so poor, but I made your case to the doctors and this is the best date I could negotiate.\" They backed off but I keep getting overtones of taking advantage in the official communications. The lingering bitterness I've developed as a result of that makes me perceive them as insincere when they ask how I am doing, even when it might be coming from a good place. So, yeah, I completely hear how you feel. Job security repercussions should be so not on. Not to say there aren't bad companies, but right is on your side.",

I can fit my physio in around the things that are on a fixed schedule. Asthma is bothering me more than the DIEP recovery at this point. I see the LE physio tomorrow to see if she thinks the swelling is LE, and more importantly, if she can fix it if it is. And am all cleared for underwires if I want.

What bothers me is on the flap, not the arms. I had a bilateral DIEP but it is only on the delayed side where the two nodes were previously taken in the mx. He (the mx surgeon) really did a number on it, and I had massive numbness all around the back and under the arm, and I think I may have had some swelling around the back before but while it was pre-DIEP, I noticed the numbness not the swelling. The previous mx scar was painfully tight as well. Now that it has the DIEP flaps installed, the tightness of the mx is relieved and it all looks great. But with exertion, and apparently with flying, one flap puffs up like a balloon, to the extent that the incision scar ends up being a groove. It is creepy. What I want is for someone to confirm whether it is LE and tell me what to do to knock it back and ward it off because I don't want to stop flying, running, etc.",

The winner was undoubtedly home doing her laundry before I finished, but I still beat 5,000 people. My surgeon and med onc referred me to PS for consult on reconstruction and prophylactic mast because I can't see the remaining breast as anything but a time bomb. Because I need all the abs I can get, and have so many allergies that implants just seem like a bad idea immune-system wise, the best reconstruction option is bilateral DIEP so the PS referred me down the road as she doesn't do it at the centre I've been at. Hoping to do that in Sept, after I can do another half-marathon and get my heart and lungs into tiptop shape for the long anaesthesia. So glad that everyone is in good shape. This Dec 2010 group is quiet, and hope that means fairly problem free -- maybe the surgeons didn't want to take any chancy cases over the holidays and only the lucky girls went in December!",

Where I have the most pain now is muscular, in the tension on the front/side and just knotted up something fierce on the back over the shoulder blades. I'm dying to run but have so far just walked on the treadmill with my arms on the frame. Even at that, the endorphins really knocked my pain level down enormously. The path report interpretation is too funny. I'm still ruminating and poring over mine too. After my initial excitement about them finding more DCIS than the lumpectomy had removed (yes! validated asking for mastectomy!) and the clear nodes (yes! dodged a bullet!) I noticed that it referred to the previous surgical cavity being at the \"superior margin\". So, either they did the dissection upside down, misspoke during dictation, or I have the path report on someone else's boob. Of course the first two are more likely, but I'm wishing I'd written my name on it with magic marker before they operated. I feel so fortunate that I got out of it with DCIS (presuming of course that it was my path report!) Oncologist has no oncological concerns with the mastectomy side. I'm letting the other side have one more mammogram, but it feels like it's stalking me.",

First off, I've got this unspoken overtone of \"you claimed you had a mastectomy, yet your chest looks the same as before\" (um, prosthetics? wanna frisk me like the TSA?) More practically, what has stressed me is the Dean in particular acting like I am doing this for the purpose of getting out of teaching. I've ramped up my other duties and in fact never worked less than full time hours, not even the week of my mastectomy last year, nor the holiday break when I'm *entitled* to be off, nor have I taken ANY vacation in the year since, yet because I wasn't doing specific things, they charged 40% of my salary to my sick days, including over the holiday break when NOBODY was teaching, right up to the day my surgeon finally answered the phone and said \"oh yeah, she could go back to work weeks ago\". My retired colleagues told me in the past, other colleagues with BC were just sheltered by their peers in an unofficial redistribution of duties. Not so now. The Trains Run On Time. Everyone does the exact same work allocation. My DIEP OR date was supposed to be right in the middle of the Fall term and there wouldn't have been anyone available at the last minute to cover the end, set the exam and mark assignments on material they've never studied let alone taught. If you'd known since summer and didn't plan for that you'd get appeals up the wazoo, I'd expect, so I raised the suggestion that for quality and continuity for the students, perhaps it would be best to have someone else teach their own version all term and I'd do alternate work despite the standardized workload. But no good deed goes unpunished, and both of my surgeons postponed my OR date, twice, after the contracts for the substitutes were signed. As a result, the powers that be are acutely aware that I could have taught the whole term and didn't and they're exasperated that they can't charge my time to sick leave, but I am NOT sick. I've worked 80-hour weeks but that is not valued because it wasn't teaching. With the OR in mid December, I told the Director I'd plan the courses ahead, let the students read the first bit independently and I'd start 7 weeks into the term. He then pressed the Dean for an interim instructor, and it was great having him, at least, in my corner. I don't want to be the \"problem\" colleague, but I have enough to worry about without this drama. Work to rule goes both ways, so they can stick it and I'm just taking the straight sick time, 8 weeks. End of MY rant. I hope that getting it out will relieve the festering resentment it's been giving me and I can concentrate on facing the looming OR date. Hope everyone's turn in the OR has gone well so far.",

The process is quite like the biopsy, with all the associated squishing and sharp poking, and you're awake. :-( But then once you're asleep, the surgeon removes the tissue around the end of the wire. (I imagined it like the world's worst canape on a toothpick.) It doesn't apply to mastectomy, as they are taking everything. But it would be a bummer to have a lumpectomy and take the wrong chunk. ",

Some ways are bad because of individual personalities and situations. My biopsy result was given in a prearraged appointment with the BS. I don't know if I ever met a radiologist. It might have been that lady who stabbed me. Everyone was giving me those \"9/10 are nothing\" statistics, but I could see on the original mammogram the DCIS, so I just figured it was time until they caught up with reality. My bad-delivery-of-news story is after the magnified views mammogram, I waited almost a month to hear results. I had asked them to send to my family physician because I am deaf and they couldn't call with results or to make appointment. Finally, I got aggravated with waiting and had my husband call the hospital (he can hear a bit, but prefers to make rather than receive calls). It turns out that the hospital, having found that I had no phone number on file, had taken it upon themselves to ignore the annotation on the chart to call the family doctor, deaf, etc. and decided to search through 15-20 year old directories and found the telephone number of my parents' house where I had lived for part of grad school, and were trying to call them to recall me for an appointment. Now, they are both elderly and my father is unwell since his younger brother died of cancer. I had been going out of my way to keep them out of the picture and the hospital clumsily almost outs me. Fortunately I think they thought it was just a fundraising call from the hospital foundation and never mentioned it. Worse, having been unable to reach anyone that way, the hospital was just sitting on the results. Idiots. I like having a communication plan set up beforehand, as we ended up doing with the biopsy. It was reassuring to know that on day X I will have the results, and the information vacuum between now and then has no semantic meaning. ",

Without signing in, I have been benefiting from everyone's experience for several weeks.  I'm joining the December 2010 list already on the \"other side\" after one side simple mastectomy Dec 13. I had a \"suggestive of DCIS\" biopsy in April after a few specs of calcification on a mammogram in February, and I decided to take time to destress and get fit before a lumpectomy in October. By that point, the DCIS had definitely decided to set up shop, and was 4.4cm high grade. I know some think this is just a giant overreaction to \"just\" DCIS, but waiting to see if it becomes something more worth worrying about is not my temperament. I was admitted at 6:00 for 7:45 procedure, woke in post-anaesthetic recovery at 9:30 and was home by 2:30. They seemed very anxious to limit time in hospital to avoid exposure to other people's infections. I'm a little iffy about being sent home a full six hours before I peed for the first time post-anaesthesia, but no harm, no foul I guess. They send me a nurse daily to change dressings and check the drain and I'm hoping the drain goes tomorrow. I am not a back sleeper so I am unhappy with backpain, and it is reassuring to know it is a shared experience. I slept on my stomach the same day after the lumpectomy but the drain is cramping my style. Having learned from the lumpectomy, I did not delay starting the stool softeners and ate minimally for the first three days. All things considered, though, a lot of the pre-op discussion board reading I did made me expect much worse than I got. I've used very little of the Tylenol 3, have been cooking and fetching for myself, doing a bit of computer based work. Someone posted the idea to go for a wash and set/blowdry and that turned out to be a great idea. I even walked and took a streetcar to get to the hairdresser and that was good for my stiffened up body. The crowds were a little scary (especially this time of year) but it was definitely worthwhile because my shoulder is not interested in shampooing. I won't have the path report until I see the surgeon on Thursday. He did not plan to touch the nodes as \"it's pre-cancer, not cancer\", but those spots hurt more than I expected so am mildly worried that he found something during the mastectomy that needed further testing. He didn't mention anything afterwards; he cheerfully said everything went \"boring\". I am hoping for good news, but still a bit anxious. My personal aim (if no surprises) is to heal, do a \"victory lap\" in a half-marathon in February (not for speed just stamina and celebration!), and then go have the second side done and hopefully reconstructed (in a more aerodynamic streamlined format) and get off the mammogram train. Thank you to everyone for sharing what they're feeling and fearing, and what happened to them and how they are coping, and I am sure there are a lot more lurkers who would echo my appreciation.

In addition to the reassuring words that the residual DCIS was low grade and near the lumpectomy site, it also said two axillary nodes were biopsied. So I am NOT crazy. I'd asked before surgery if there would be node biopsy and he said no need, DCIS, not cancer, not necessary. (My surgeon is very insistent that DCIS is NOT cancer, it's PRE cancer. Whatev.

Nevertheless, it was good to see both of the nodes were clear AND that there is a perfectly rational explanation for the insane burning under my arm!

Tamoxifen and watchful waiting on the time-bomb side is possible reduction in an estimated probability of invasive problems upstairs, but possible adverse effects in the basement, plus possibilities of unpleasant symptoms. Surgery is such a well understood process with few uncertainties, a fairly finite period of misery with the drain, and I get off the mammo train. Honestly, right now I am kind of liking the semi-Twiggy silhouette (Yes, the reference dates me.)  The asymmetry is not technically sustainable although in the short term I accept that I'm stuck with it. I am befuddled by the prospect of doing a half marathon next month with a DD running bra with one side empty. And I refuse to reconstruct to match DD so it would seem likely that eventual reconstruction would involve sculpting some happy medium on the time-bomb side. Why not just defuse the time bomb, take it off and reconstruct both? My husband thinks the surgeon is just discouraging surgery so as not to be seen as pushing it, to be sure that if I ask for it, it is really my decision, but all it's doing is making me sit here wondering \"is there some other variable I need to add into my formula? because I am just not getting why he's resisting. Does he know something I don't?\" And I read so many of you had bilateral including a prophylactic side, and I'm just confused by the resistance. That's my highs and lows for the day and now I'm looking forward to a sleep uninterrupted by staple pinches!",
