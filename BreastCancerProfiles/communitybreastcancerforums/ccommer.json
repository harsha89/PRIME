What showed up is an area of focal asymmetry...shows on mammo but not on ultrasound. Oh and can not feel lump. I think with you they went right to ultrasound cuz of your age and density. But must be frustrating that it is not showing up. I am now going for MRI, they wanted to biopsy but with the imaging difficulties, this is the next step for me. Hope they figure something out for you.",
