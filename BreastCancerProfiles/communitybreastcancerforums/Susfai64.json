My cancer was diagnosed in Feb but started chemo (T and C) in May. Surgery was first. 3.6 cm. tumor. All positive. micro metstisis to one of 4 sentinel lymph glands. No on codex testing. My oncologist has been unclear about whether or not to have 4 or 6 sessions. Just finished my 4th and have scheduled appointment in 2 weeks to discuss. He just tells me that it will be 6 if I'm tolerating it hmmm. Just wondering if anyone else has faced the uncertainties of treatment and how they coped and their personal decision making process ",

My mother died from metastatic CA. sarcoma in her leg, not breast cancer, so I told him that I tended to want a more aggressive treatment. Now I am 4 sessions in, and we all know how much fun it is, but I'm still thinking of pressing for the full 6 sessions. No guarantees with any of this. Recurrence had to be a GREAT disappointment. (Understatement). So great of you to offer us this support and return it to you in kind. And others. New topic for my discussion....weight gain! What the heck? Steroids (just 3 days each session). And taxotere are just a great recipe....trying to walk and eat sensibly. Any thoughts?",

I guess that would be according to labs and SE. It seems so many of you contributors have had recurrences. No guarantees that won't happen, but my thought is to go for the six. My symptoms are minor compared to some, but my taste would be as you perfectly described it. Except I'm GAINING weight. Anyone else gaining? I read taxotere can cause this. I guess bad taste can't stop me! Thank you all for sharing your journey",
