I hadn't heard from it, but I've had a look and I'm not sure that's what I have, I don't have the hole, but who knows, it might be a minor form (for now), 'cause just a couple of days ago the irradiated are was weeping (secreting something viscous...), just one day, then got dry and is now peeling again. I'll check with my doctor. Thanks so much!",

But then a few weeks later I had like a rush (lots of mini red spots, itchy like hell) on that area, which finally went away with some cortisone cream. But since, I have had those rushes a few times (3 or 4 at least) in other areas: arms, belly, neck,.. Has anyone else experienced that, this itchiness outside the radiated area? thanks! x Log in to post a reply",
