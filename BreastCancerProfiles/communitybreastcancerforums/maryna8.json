I have noticed that when there is a weather front moving in signaling a change, a day or two before it comes in my whole body will ache as if I've been beaten. sbelizabeth The more active my day is, the more my feet will burn that night. And leg and foot cramps galore too, ugh! I have not noticed symptoms being worse with any particular food, seems to be activity related for me. Does anyone else have weak jelly-legs after walking a while?",

      "Content": "Oct 10, 2018 09:04AM - edited Oct 10, 2018 09:05AM by maryna8 Wrenn The first dose of Taxotere caused my feet to feel like puffy little tingling pillows, and then it went away in a few days. But with each dose it became worse, and the MO started cutting the dose, but I assume the damage was done. When I got home after chemo treatments I would lay on the sofa with my feet on an ice pack. I had the nerve test with electrodes afterwards, and was told I had sensory, motor and peripheral neuropathy. I remember that doctor told me be careful about getting a cold or flu because I would feel worse than I used to; I asked him about the leg weakness and he said the nerves are not signaling the muscles properly, so they don't respond properly. I get tired much easier and he said yes, that's to be expected too. The other thing I have learned is that no doctor seems to know a whole lot about nerve damage, they do know how to prescribe pills. I myself have learned that any pain is amplified. Smells are smellier too! I do think it can be caused by one dose, since it happened to me too.",
