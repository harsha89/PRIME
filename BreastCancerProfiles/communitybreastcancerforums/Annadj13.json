Occasionally I have shooting pain through my nipple into my chest that lasts about 10 to 12 seconds and feels like an icepick going through me. And my nipple is getting very sore. I meet with the Dr once a week and have complained to the nurse about this and she keeps telling me, \"We call those 'little zingers' and it is caused by the nerves growing back after a lumpectomy.\" :-( My Dr told me to fold a tissue down to a couple of inches, coat it with Aquaphor and place it over the nipple. I tried that and it didn't help at all! I believe my pain and hardness of the breast and painful nipple is caused by the radiation itself!",
