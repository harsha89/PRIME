It was more \"uncomfortable\" than I thought.  I am 52, and my arms hurt to hold them in that position for that long.  Once they let me move them, it took me a few minutes to just move them!  Ouch!!  Anyway, I am marked up like a road map.  No way to conceal the marks, unless I wear a turtle neck!!  I am leaving for Florida in 3 days to take my mom to her timeshare for 2 weeks.  They told me to \"try and stay out of the water and protect these marks.\"  If I do go into the water, try and stay only waist deep.  Yeah right.  I have been on this path since New Year's Eve.  Chemo, mastectomy, now radiation.  I am guessing we will be doing this again when I get back, because I am going in the water!!  I need the hot tub, I need the pool, and I need the waves and salt water!!",
