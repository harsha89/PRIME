    "Content": "Jun 24, 2015 01:47PM - edited Jun 24, 2015 01:48PM by Nandanwk I was diagnosed with Stage II Breast Cancer July 2012. I had a partial mastectomy on my left breast with 15 lymph nodes removed and 10 out of the 15 were positive. I had a PET scan done (short time after) and the cancer was then stage IV metastatic breast cancer in the bones. I have been on Hormonal therapy since the surgery and next week will be 2 years in remission :) I'm sorry I can't write more but I will start crying if I continue to write. I am from Newark, NJ",
