It took a couple of tries to get my breast compressed so she could biopsy the correct spot. Once in the proper position, which took about 10 minutes- that is when I got the the numbing shot- actually 3 shots- each time going a bit deeper. No discomfort after the first prick. Good luck!",

They lock the chair in place after they get you positioned and compressedin the machine. I was given a shot first to numb the breast. The compression lasted about 30 minutes, and I was relieved the whole procedure was not as bad I thought it would be.",

I had 6 treatments of TC (taxotere and Cytoxin) every 2 weeks. There were days when I had a low fever- something to be careful of, so I would stay home then. I was glad I could work, as it offered me distraction from what I was going through. I'm almost done radiation now, and feel good. Best of luck.",

Triple Negative is a very aggressive cancer, and should be treated as quickly as possible, especially given the size of your tumor. It grows very fast.Â  I am triple negative and had a lumpectomy within 2 weeks, and chemo was started 2 weeks after that. Good luck and hope your chemo starts soon. Since we can't take hormonals to prevent recurrence, chemo is absolutely important to fight this beast.",
