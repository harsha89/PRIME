The recommendation was have a biopsy but I asked the BS to remove the lump. I had needle localization wide excision last Friday. I received the biopsy results yesterday which said: Mild fibrocystic changes with cyst formation, apocrine metaplasia, duct ectasia and focal atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), completely excised. Negative for malignancy. I have an appointment with my BS this Thursday and would appreciate any tips on what to ask. I am scared what the ADH diagnosis means for me",
