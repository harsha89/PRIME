My hair is naturally stawberry blonde and I decided to have some fun and get a darker auburn wig but regret that decision because it feels too strange. So I can't wait to get rid of it.  I am using more scarves now but looking forward to the day I can ditch it all.  My hair was also looking like it lacked any color at first but now I see more and more color...along with some grey though. I have never dyed my hair before does anyone know how long we should wait before we do this? I don't know if the chemo affects the way hair absorbs color? Thanks, Dawn",

I really believe though that a confident woman is a sexy woman...you are still the same person he knows and likes but you are now even stronger for all you have gone through.  Share what you want about your story...because it is such an important part of our lives but don't spend the night talking about it...you know men love to talk about themselves...haha! Relax and enjoy, I am sure it will all go well!!! ",

I started with that clear stubble as well and it is slowly changing to my natural hair color.  Unfortunately, I just lost my eyebrows and eyelashes this last month...what the heck?  I kept them throughout my chemo, why are they gone now? The eyebrows are already starting to come back in but nothing at all on the eyelashes.  Seems strange!",

Does anyone have a suggestion for an eyebrow dye?  I have been using a darkening powder type product but don't like the results...it seems to color the skin underneath more than the brow hairs. Suggestions?",
