I tried on several, but bought the very first one that I walked right into the shop and picked. My husband really likes it. It is short with some volume. My hair won't have that much volume when I get it cut short, but the transition should still be kind of transparaent to most people. I will probably get one more wig, maybe when I go shopping with my friend on Monday.",

I think he was protecting me so that they did not walk on my chest. Dogs are so cool and what a great companion to help us through this!",

I am in the midst of planning for the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk which is Oct 14.  Today I addressed invitations to all of my local Survivor friends.  The invitation is a letter that I wrote inviting survivors to the Making Strides walk - the Cancer Society folks made it into an invitation! I will be setting up and volunteering at the Survivor's Tent during the walk.  My friend, Tammy and I are making a large sign with the word HOPE.  The survivors will be able to pin a pink ribbon on the word to represent themself.  The plan is that the word will get all filled up with pink ribbons.  Caregivers will select a bead to pin to the background around the word.  It is hard to describe, I will take a pic of it. Ravdeb - the stores already have Christmas stuff out - can you believe it???  It isn't even Halloween yet!  Time already goes too quickly, it is sad that they make it move along even faster!",

Mary - I am so sorry about your friends young and older.  I will keep you and their families and your church in my prayers.... Reno was AWESOME!!!  I am pretty impressed with the American Cancer Society.  I didn't realize how much of the organization is made up by volunteers until this weekend - they have many more volunteers than they do employees.  There were 1,300 people at the Summit and we got to meet the Dr. who started Relay back in 1985.   He decided to walk the track for 24 hours to raise funds for a medical grant.  His friends showed up to support him - they pitched tents and cheered him on.  Voila!  Relay for Life!!!   It is pretty incredible when you think of how powerful just one person can be without even realizing it! We were kept very busy from Friday morning until Saturday afternoon - we learned a lot, celebrated the survivors and their caregivers, remembered those who lost their lives and learned how to FIGHT BACK!!!  Thus this year's Relay theme:  Celebrate, Remember and Fight Back!  I heard some very touching survivor stories, caregiver stories and learned a lot from the researchers and other presenters.  That is about all I have time for right now - but wanted to check in with all of  you.  I have missed you!!",

Paula - I love your pics - what beach is that?  I visited Bondi and Manly (I think that was the name of it).  They were both beautiful!  I loved the Opera House too. It has been a busy weekend for us.  Yesterday the Kiwanis had a beverage booth at the local Boys & Girls club for a Family Day event and I had a luncheon with my Survivor Tent committee for the Making Strides Walk in October. Today we ran errands and I packed for our Canada trip - we leave next Saturday. Fall has definitely arrived in the NW - it rained (poured) all day today.  Well, it is my bedtime and I agree with Michelle - Monday - UGH. love you all! t",
