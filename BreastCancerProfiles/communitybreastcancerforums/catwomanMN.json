I just got my diagnosis of DCIS 2 days ago.  Since I had Hodgkin's Disease with Rad/Chemo 26 years ago(I'm 45 yo) my treat will be a bilat mam in the near future.  I am a nurse anesthetist and provide general anesthesia to patients undergoing surgery on a daily basis.  For me the hardest part is the loss of control.  Anesthesia providers have great medications to relax you as you head into the operating room.  Throughout your surgery anesthetists are constantly monitoring your heart rate, oxygen level, blood pressure and level of anesthesia.  The risk of anything bad happening while under anesthesia is extremely rare, we liken it to the risk of being in a car accident on your way to the hospital(much less than 1%). Some people worry about recall or awareness, this is even more rare and is associated with trauma cases or open hear surgery.  If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to answer them. God Bless you all! Cathy",
