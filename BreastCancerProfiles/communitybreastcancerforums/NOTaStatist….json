My hair has thinned, but I am not bald. The Abraxane is three weeks on, one week off. The Avastin is once every two weeks. I also get Zometa monthly and take Arimidex. I feel GREAT. No more bone pain! I live in a state where cancer patients can legally obtain marijuana. I have benefited from this. This is my third round of IV chemo. I had Cyclphosphmide, Doxorubicin and Paclataxel four years ago. Then I had five months of Ixabepilone with Xeloda.On those drugs, I did experience mild nausea/vomiting and complete hair loss. I also had Xeloda by itself.",
