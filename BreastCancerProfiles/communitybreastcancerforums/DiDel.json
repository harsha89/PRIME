Either go down to the facility where the biopsy and imaging were done and NOT LEAVE until you have a copy of all the reports and films in hand. afterall you have paid to have these tests done and have the right to have copies of all reports and images in your hands on demand. 2. Most BS offices have a patient advocate or a nurse coordinator/navigator. I would ask to speak to her directly and explain how upsetting this has been especially through the holidays etc. Ask her if there is any way she can obtain a copy of your pathology report for you to pick up or if someone could give you the quick and dirty assessment. My GYN ordered my mammo US and biopsy(tuesday) so I got the call from him (thursday evening)that I had IDC..that was it.. I then called a BS who on Friday morning to see if he would take me on as a patient. the BS got a copy of my pathology report (its all electronic these days no paper necessary) called me back Friday afternoon in between surgeries to explain the report a little so at least I knew I wasnt dying. Then he saw me that Saturday and went over everything in detail. These doctors have the ability to get the pathology report within minutes so I would keep barking until someone has the decency to get that report for you and give you some peace. I will say I hope that all this delay is because it is benign and no one feels a sense of urgency. Good luck and hang in there Diane ",

I have no known allergies to medications. With that said, they administer the Taxotere very slowly and watch you during the infusion to ensure you do not have a reaction. I had a mild allergic reaction to it, itchy rash and swollen tongue developed a couple days later. I took benadryl and that worked just fine. After that inital reaction, they did the taxotere VERY slowly and gave me benadryl each time before. Which was fine, I was just a drowsy slurry blabbling mess for the enitre 5 hrs I spent in the infusion chair. To me the reaction was definitely NOT strong enough to switch chemo to a longer treatment. Other than that I tolerated it very well. Be sure to let your doctor AND onc nurses know if you ever have an allergic reaction. Also, the steroids are a very mild dose.

In fact when I was diagnosed my BS said under 40 was young and that they were seeing more and more young women with BC. He said he wasnt sure if it was because technology was better to catch it earlier or something else. Personally I think between that and the fact that so much meat and chicken etc contain hormones surely cant help matters. For so long I am sure I ate chicken with hormones to plump them up but in the last 5 years I only eat organic whole foods. My 15 year old niece asked me last weekend if she could get BC and I said yes and she asked what she could do to avoid it and I said a healthy diet was most important. To avoid meats with hormones and sugar...which as much as Suzanne Somers talk drives me insane ...I do think an over abundence of sugar cant be good for us either.. Interesting topic...just my two cents Diane ETA I was 43 at diagnosis and my doc considered me young also estimated my tumor had been there for 8 years before it was the size we discovered it",

The biggest thing I have learned from my journey is that you know your body better than any doctor. You need to be your own advocate. If I wasn't get the care I deemed I needed from a doctor I would move on. The important thing is you are taking care of it now, but try not to get too ahead of yourself with worry. One test at a time. I had an US guided core needle biopsy and an MRI guided biopsy, my words of advice to you is 1. to make sure you are properly anesthetized prior to them starting the biopsy procedure. Some docs will inject the lidocaine and then start the biopsy immediately. I was not numbed properly at all and it was painful. HOWEVER the MRI Biopsy my doctor was much much better and took her time and i felt nothing no pain at all. 2. take an anti anxiety prior to the test. Ativan is what I took for the MRI and the MRI biopsy and pre op, it was a blessing to calm my frazzled nerves. The docs will not tell you a thing during the procedure although I later discovered from the radiologist report that they suspected from the US that it was cancer. I don't think they want to say anything until they know 100% for sure. I wish you the best of luck for B9 results!!

The most important thing for me was to have a team that understood me and that I trusted with my life literally. You are also young and you sounds ready to fight! all good things. I know the weeks following my diagnosis seemed like they dragged on, but now I am 8 months out from diagnosis, been through surgery, chemo and now getting ready for reconstruction. I look back and now it seems like the months flew by. I know its scary but you are not alone. It looks like you have a beautiful family at home and now you have us!! This site has provided me much comfort and support in the worst of moments. I am 43 and live alone, no kids and at times felt very isolated but since I found BCO if I am feeling lonely scared or angry I reach out. I also got Ativan an anti anxiety which really helped me get through surgery. I had to wait two weeks once I had a final diagnosis to surgery and it was most definitely the worst part. During this time you will make lots of decisions that will not be easy, but you will make them and find peace in them. You will put your life on hold for a little while but you will make up for it in the years and years to come. You will be amazed and proud of how strong you are, and you ARE!!

I waited a couple of months from the time I felt it to the time I went to the doctors too mainly because I already had my GYN appt and it was 2 months away and I honestly was sorta scared and not in a hurry. Those 2 months didn't change anything for me, don't beat yourself up about that BUT you do need to put yourself first for a while.

I am a person who normally has very very high energy. I used to get 5 hrs of sleep and go go go, not after chemo. I was concerned about household chores too because I live alone. The hardest thing for me was to rely on others but I did. I also, prepared a weeks worth of meals in advance, did laundry and a real good house cleaning the Sunday before each treatment and no cleaning etc in between. I just didnt have it in me. I learned to let some things sit. I had friends bring me meals and my friends BF does my lawn every other week and said he'd take care of it all summer, which is quite a chore. At first I felt guilty accepting everyone's offers but then realized my friends' help made them feel like they were helping me to just focus on the battle and recovery. Like they were my little soldiers fighting the battle with me. Even before your surgery do as much prep around your house as you can. Items that you need daily put within reach so you don't have to reach overhead for anything, ask someone to stop by to take your trash/recycling out post op. There was a lot of little things I didn't even think about it till the time came.(like the two blizzards that came back to back that needed shoveling..i was thankful to have a reason not to do that!) Just don't be afraid to ask for help. Where I live there is a charity locally that does housekeeping for cancer paitients. See if there is one in your area, that may be a huge help for you esp with small kids. Good luck to you!!",

I was diagnosed Multifocal IDC Nov. 2009 had RMX Dec 23, 2009 and just completed 4 rounds of TC. THANK GOD!! I remember when I was told a lumpectomy was no longer an option. I thought it would be impossible to make the decision to have a mastectomy. I am single and never had children and just thought about how much I loved them and didn't want to lose one. But then as surgery got closer the reality that I had cancer settled in. In the days before I just cried and wanted it all over with now. All I can say is that the day before I spent with my 12 yr old niece. We got pedicures, our hair done, and over induldge in our favorite foods. The morning of my surgery I was beyond nervous, after my shower I took a much needed ATIVAN. It really helped. My doctor also prescribed Lidocaine for me to put on to numb the area of the SNB which worked perfectly! I didn't feel a thing. It also helped that I had an entourage of friends meet me at the hospital and stayed with me in pre-op (perhaps against the rules but I didn't care) until I went in the OR. I have to say I have/had the BEST doctors both BS and PS. I spoke with both docs pre-op and they answered all my last minute questions. When I woke from surgery honestly I wasn't depressed, I wasn't in terrible pain...I was RELIEVED. The first thing I thought when I woke was THANK GOD THE CANCER IS OUT OF MY BODY. My entourage was still at the hospital and followed me post op to my room where they stayed with me until I went back to sleep. Once the anthestia wore off I won't lie going to the bathroom was not pleasant. Chest muscles so sore lifting yourself up to get out of bed was difficult. Nonetheless, I went home the next morning. Be sure to bring a pillow to hug on your car ride home...take it slow in the car. Once I was home I had about 8 pillows in my bed 2 on either side of me. Keep your arms and legs elevated under pillows you\"ll be bloated for like the first 2 days. Recovery at home was truly not as bad as I thought it would be. I went home on xmas eve, xmas day was my worst then after that I was up and moving around. After the first 2 days home I was able to get myself out of bed ok. I kept on schedule with my pain meds as prescribed for the first week. After that I really didn't need them. I was amazed at how good I felt.I did have friends visit often and help me out the first 10 days. I did my arm raising exercises and completely listened to my doctors with all restrictions for lifting and movement. You will be surprised at how good you will feel. I think just the fact that the cancer is gone, will lift your spririts. Tissue expanders are uncomfortable but fortunately TEMPORARY.  There are days that I think I've lost a lot to this disease, but I feel so thankful that I have a great team of doctors and even better group of friends to love and support me through the whole thing. I am hoping as I completed Chemo that the worst is behind me. I am looking forward to getting these TE's out of me soon and having my hair grow back!! Good luck to everyone...you are stronger than you realize and YOU CAN DO THIS!!! ",

It's all preventative. I happily take my lil T every day along with my vitamins. I feel great!! There are lots of threads that address many questions on AI's or T.

It's nasty...now I know why MBJ is desperately searching for a straightening method. I can only imagine how attractive it will look as it grows out more. I have a bit of a dilemma...sort of a rant...I met with my PS Friday to discuss all my pre op stuff for my exchange surgery. The hospital I am going to will not \"allow\" me to wear my wig during surgery. I know it's stupid but my hair is so ugly..it's bad enough I have 1/2 and eyebrow and 1/3 of the lashes I used to...I've gained probably 5 lbs and I just couldn't feel more self conscious about how I look. I know I shouldn't care going into surgery, but I just feel so ugly its embarrassing. Well, I completely melted down to my doctor. My friend is a surgical nurse at Johns Hopkins and they allow patients to wear their wigs into surgery. I mean they put a stupid cap on you during the procedure. So now I totally don't even want to go, I am completely dreading this day. I know no one cares how I look but me but for GOD sake its all I got...one gorgeous blond wig! I feel so depressed about this and again,,I know it's stupid but I just can't help how I feel. I may try to color my hair before surgery with a semi to see if it at least covers the greys I will feel a little better. Any product suggestions? I am almost 4 months PFC Sorry for the rant, thanks for listening. Diane",

I think that was key for me to keep my RBC up. I am curious about Nelulasta. My doctor said I would only get it if I needed it, which thankfully I didn't. My onc thought by my last treatment I would need it but I didnt. from what I read on the boards it seems a lot of people are automatically doing Neulasta as soon as they start chemo. It did seem like the worst part of treatment I am just curious why so many people had it as part of their regimine?? I wanted to avoid it at all cost thats why i stuffed my face with protein as much as possible. I also was completely healed from my MX ( I started chemo as late as possible from surgery not by choice) so maybe my immune system was nto compromised. Just curious.

I have found tremendous comfort and support from the women on this site. When I woke from surgery I remember the tremendous amount of relief I felt that the cancer was gone and out of my body. I agree with Faith316 above, you will make decisions you never thought you could make; not just for you but your family as well. You will have a tough year ahead emotionally and some days physically, but you must remember the end game, a long healthy life. Every step of the way, I was like I can't believe this is my life, I can't believe I am making this decision, I can't believe toxins are pumping through my body. At the time I thought, surgery would never come, but it did and I got through it no problems. Then the anixiety of final pathology and more decisions. Then CHEMO; I did 4 rounds of Cytoxan and Taxotere and tolerated it very well. I never got sick or had terrible side effects other than hair loss(which was the worst SE) and fatigue like you never knew you could feel. But still the time went by quickly; my hair is growing back and the fatigue has left me. Now I am preparing for my reconstruction surgery which I couldn't be happier about. I had a RMX and I absolutely adore and trust all my docs which is key. It has definitely been a rollercoaster ride and one I will be glad to get off. As much as I've lost; I've learned and gain some things as well. I've got the best group surrounding me friends, family and all the wonderful ladies on this site!! Lean on your friends and family when you need to it will help you and them. It will be hard and trying at times, but you will get through this. You will be amazed at the strength you never knew you had. You will be so proud of yourself when you complete this journey and look back at all you've done. YOU CAN DO THIS!! Good luck tomorrow in your surgery. I will be sending positive vibes your way!!! PM (private message) anytime if you need to talk or ask a questions. Diane",

Good luck, reach out anytime you need Di",

Interesting conversation about the BRCA test.

They did however pay for it the remaining treatments. I also took Compazine at home since ZOfran did not work for me. Compazine and Phenergan sound like overkill and they will both  KNOCK you out. I would take one or the other but not both. I would be asleep for a week if I took them combined. Also, as hard as it is you need to eat. It will help with the nausea. I felt sick some days and just ate plain mashed potatoes or plain baked chicken. You should try to keep up with eating some protein. I feel for you, I only had a few bad days with nausea. I think the Emend was a life saver. You should see if you can get this rx, it's expensive but effective. Hope you feel better soon, Diane",

I will still wear my wig but just in case I get into a fight with the nurse trying to take my wig off for my surgery wednesday if it has to be short and fuzzy it DOESNT have to be grey.  Hope everyone is having a good start to the week! Good night all! Diane",

I have a real wig which I love blond with caramelish lowlights and a synthetic dark brown that itches the crap out of me and of course my Ravens Purple wig for game day! Anyhow, so I said a few post back how my puppy gets sad when I put my good wig on cause he knows that means I am heading out...so last night I had male/friend company so I was wearing it but as soon as he left I took of my wig and set it down on my coffee table..then my kitty started playing with it so I was like I better move this..but of course putting it upstairs on it's stand was way too much effort. So today I am running around then had to head out to meet my trainer (yes getting my butt back in shape if it kills me) . She had not seen me since my surgery so I didn't want to shock her by going in with my curly haired mullet. So I look HIGH and LOW can NOT find the wig anywhere...I am in tears frantically routing through the house in search of it...certain that Sadie or Charlie took it to keep me from going out...as always my pets watched me and must have thought She's completely lost it now! Ohhhh I looked in the ..trash the dryer ..under the sofa..in the cushions of the chairs under my bed in my puppy's crate So after looking everywhere I tried to calmly retrace my footsteps from last night ....and I remembered I put the wig out of reach from the pets...  where was that out of reach place I put it...35 minutes later I FOUND IT on the top shelf inside my bookcase..you know so the pets won't get it!  ! UGH I had to chuckle to myself as I put it on and walked out of the house. My poor puppy and kitty...they were like \"we didn't take it we swear!\" I will put it away properly from now on I can not afford to lose this one. Happy Hair Growing .... Di",

I will say when I go to the grocery store with a scarf on (and during chemo I wore gloves in the store) and people were for sure nicer. I felt half guilty today when my electrician came over (and I was wearing a scarf) to give me a quote on a repair. i could tell he completely took pitty on me and I am fine with that! I am drowning in medical bills so a break on a repair would be nice. I was very happy to have 5 OClock shadow on my eyebrows last Wednesday and today I have lots of growth on my brows so they grew back pretty fast. Mine also held on until after chemo it was so discouraging. My eyelashes continue to fall out. I have no bottom lashes. My PS would NOT give me Latisse for eyelash growth. He said it can change the color of your eyes (unless you already have dark brown) and that as soon as you stop taking it they go back to where they were. He also said it would be and ENTIRE YEAR before my eyelashes were as full and long as before chemo and to just be patient UGH. But I will say once I mastered the application of false eyelashes I've had a lot of fun playing around with all the different styles. Have a good evening, getting late on the East coast...good night!

Great for the top of my hair and my \"bangs\" since that is the shortest part of my hair. I do use my $$$$ Chi flat iron on the longer parts and yes it gets rid of the fuzz but I have absolutely no shape to it. My hair looks a little like Jan's but longer (almost mullett like) in the back. My hair has always been super curly so I am the queen of fighting the curl. and I do have the Frederick Fekkai Glossing cream which works like a charm. I also use Moroccan Oil on my hair. It has lots of proteins etc in it so its more than a hair styling product it strengthens your hair and adds shine to it and it really makes a difference on hair at any length.

I will say prepare yourself for the eyebrow and eyelash loss. Most of us TC girls lost brows and lashes after treatment. They grow back in ...they fall out...grow back...fall out. I use Anastasia eyebrow stencil kit from Sephora and now 4 mos post chemo most of my lashes and brows are in but I still use the brow kit to fill in. Also I am 43 I started chemo 3/17 had my period up until the last treatment on May 17th. I felt crampy and bloated around the time I was supposed to get my period and JUST GOT IT BACK! I never thought I'd be so happy to get my period but I just did not want to be in menopause. So essentially I missed 3 cycles and my period was two weeks later than scheduled if it stayed on track by the 4th cycle. I think they say the longer you have your period during chemo the more likely it is to return. Hope that helps! Good night all!!! Di ",

The synthetic one is itchy and looks like a wig. My hair is very thick curly and completely unmanageable. BUT if I put my wig knit cap on for like an hour after i dry it and then it flattens it out then I add gel and style it a bit with my fingers and helps make it look like hair not complete fuzzball. blow drying it only makes it thicker and more unamangeable. I wonder what my pets think of me as they see me with my fuzzy morning hair, my curly mullett post shower, my knit cap head to flatten it then I put blonde wig on to go out in public.  My puppy gets all sad when I put the wig on cause then he knows mommy is going out!

I have little fuzzy just growing in where my hair recedes if that makes sense. thus the no bangs. the front/top of my hair is slowwwwly growing in and I think that's because the crown of my head took the most abuse from highlighting over the years.

Once I went to my onc and the NP said I can't believe your hair hasn't fallen out yet. Be thankful you're wearing it now and not in July like I was I think I am going to burn all my wigs and little bra inserts I wore to balance me out. I hope I never need any of that crap again!

HA HA HA My friends are thankful I didn't maintain a hair growth journal for all my body parts. I got excited at seeing my nose hairs return!    I was posting on another thread and saw you commented regarding the cost of Acupuncture. Some insurances pay for it..I didn't even bother to check. I am self employed and I am lucky I live in MD or my insurance woulda kicked me to the curb. I didn't want to push it by asking about acupuncture. The inital consultation and treatment was $125 which lasted about 2 hrs. She got my health history and did a treatment. After that it was $80, which I thought was afordable. She also comes to my house which was the best at no additional charge. Check with your cancer center to see if they have an acupuncturist on staff, it may be covered by your insurance. Doesn't hurt to ask. Diane ",

Ok So I sorta have a date tonight with my OLD high school BF!! We flirted at our 25 year reunion about a week before I was diagnosed and have only chatted briefly on facebook in the last year. He has been going through separation etc. I told him over the phone my hair was back to its natural color but he doesn't know what I've been dealing with this last year. I am so nervous! I feel like I need to tell him since it's been such a big part of my life this last year and I obviously did not select my latest hairdo. I've known him since I was 12 so I feel comfortable with him I just don't feel sexy. I guess we'll see what happens.Oh and of course its going to rain all night tonight and my hair is NOT pretty in the rain...even my old hair hated rain. Wish me luck! Happy Friday Diane",

Initially I was not going to do chemo but when the final pathology came back from my MX I had a small tumor that was poorly differentiated. My BS thought that it was likely eventhough all nodes were clear there was the possibility that one single cell could have broken loose and was floating around in my body somewhere. It was a tough decision for me but both my BS and Onc were in agreement. 4 rounds of TC (which I just think is the latest, greatest protocol) I completed treatment in May. I wouldn't say it was easy but it does give me peace of mind that I have done all I could to prevent recurrence. The thought of metastatic cancer scared the heck out of me and most of my friends and family insisted on it. I hate that I lost my hair (that was the worst part of chemo for me) but I do not want to deal with cancer ever again. Remember the BIG picture, you staying healthy. Chemo now is preventative...down the road its a game of catch up. Good luck making your decision and you can always private message if you need to reach out or have more questions. Diane",

I am still so exhausted from surgery that I can barely make it past 10pm. I am going out with friends this weekend so we'll see how long I make it. I am looking forward to a ORANGE CRUSH!! YUM! Now if only I could have grapefruit I'd be oh so happy! Happy weekend!! Diane",

You're not having renovations to your house for the love of GOD!! I would switch doctors office. I went to a cancer center and most CC have a patient advocate that helps get all the insurance approvals and necessary referrals. I hope you have one in your town. There is no reason they shouldn't pay for it. It could be a simple miscoding that is causing problems. Also I didn't get one bill from my oncologist office until a month after I completed treatment. You should always be able to negotiate costs of treatment for what is coming out of your pocket. I did 4 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan. The costs was $5500 the contractual adjustment lowered it to $3500, even though I have a very high deductible my insurance paid for all but $1600 of the first treatment. The insurance company initially didn't want to pay for my pre chemo meds but applied it towards my deductible my first round of pre chemo meds. $410 for 4 pills (Emend) the next time the insurance company paid it. You need a patient advocate to help you fight for what they SHOULD be covering. If your drs office wont help switch!! You could also consult with an atty that specializes in patient rights. Good luck with treatments and with insurance company.",

Congrats to those that finished up this week...to those just starting it will be over before you know it 7of9 I feel the same way you do about doing rads initially. I wished I did that rather than chemo first time around. Plus I was so shuffled from one thing to the next I would have blindly accepted whole breast radiation. My recurrence was in the skin and muscle so they are zapping the tumor bed. I thought wbr was over kill for a 5 mm tumor. Of course as I get to the end I'm nervous about another recurrence and if cells are still in the muscle but I know I can't go there decision made need to move forward. The thing I love about us is that we are strong and it's hard to admit and accept the limitations or life changes of having bc but I feel like when you get to that point you really move forward. I have 2 friends with bc one is going thru chemo now and the other did rads a year ago. Both hugely in denial of the seriousness of their dx. It's so frustrating to see. The one thinks chemo is a weekly party and literally brings 5-6 people with her and goes to lunch afterwards and twice has had infection from eating salad from restaurant that her onc has told her numerous times to avoid . I dont jnow how she's gonna get through rads. She 100% doesnt take tge advice if her mo on how to get through tx. The other one is 68 was on Premarin for 30+ years and I swear she's not taking her Femara and I'm pretty sure she's still taking the Premarin. She's insane...I ratted her out to her mo (we have same Dr and she's like family ) so he ran through stats with her the other day and started crying that he was really mean to her. I was like he's trying to keep you cancer free but your vanity is preventing you from taking the drugs you need to take. It's maddening. Anyhow I'm forever grateful for everyone I've met her and all the support and advice I've gotten.  OK my skin is purple and I'm exhausted . .laying down. Enjoy your weekend everyone!

That's the whole purpose of the test!! I have to say, I have Aetna and I know they are on board with Oncotype DX testing. I received a letter from them before I even had surgery stating approval for the test. They've been great! I don't know if it's Aetna or the State I live in. Also, the Cancer Center where my BS is has a someone in his office that handles all insurance pre-authorizations and battles the insurance company for its patients. You should see if someone in your doctors office can help you resolve this issue and get the test for you. I had reached my out of pocket maximum by the time I had surgery so I didn't have to pay a thing for this test. I was fortunate. Good luck!! Don't give up... Di",

I would imagine you would be able to send your slides etc to any big research facility such as Duke, Mayo or Hopkins. A friend of mine had an abnormal mammo that lead to a biopsy that took 3 months to get a diagnosis. Seems she was so early in the cancer stage she didn't have all the characteristics of CLL (final diagnosis) so it was hard to pinpoint the type of Lymphoma she has. She had the slides sent everywhere and I believe at Duke they have a group of drs that work together and I will have to ask her who specifically she sent it to at Duke and I will ask my BS here in Baltimore. If I can get a name for you I will private message you. You may be having a hard time just because I would guess they dont deem it urgent since there is no diagnosis they don't see it as a life or death situation. I know it's tough but to get it right it just may take longer than you hoped. It actually might be faster and more comforting if you just traveled to the states and had another biopsy done. A facility may also find the samples not good in quality. I've had to have samples resubmitted for my onco type dx score and it was extremely annoying since like you are aware it was 3 more weeks of waiting. Good luck with everything. Stay strong. Diane",

I can't help you with the diagnosis I am not familiar with your situation. I can tell you I had a breast MRI prior to surgery (initially a lumpectomy) an it probably saved my life. An MRI picks up stuff years before a mammo or ultrasound would. Although it picked up more areas of concern and changed my surgery, it did give me peace of mind that my left breast was crystal clear. Plus I only have to have one once a year, then eventually every other year. You get the films right away so there is no real wait time except to have your doc call you with his/her opinion. You should ask your doctor about getting one. Sometimes they have to fight the insurance company to cover it but it is worth it! Good luck to you and try to relax, I know its hard but you can't get yourself all worked up it may be nothing.",

I am joining the group officially tomorrow I had my sim on Thursday and YES had to take a pregnancy test despite the fact that I am 49 and not currently dating anyone and haven't in years! I was first diagnosed in 2009 and went through chemo but not rads..which actually makes me more nervous than chemo. I was dx with a chest wall recurrence in the skin and pec muscle in October and after surgery and many test to make sure no other cancer and abscessed stiches and infection I am finally cleared for rads. Initially my RO wanted to do 4 areas to the chest wall, nodes etc but I saw that as overkill and read many post of regrets over the extensive radiation and the damage to recon etc. I know it sounds bad to have affect of recon as a deciding factor but after 8 surgeries and finally feeling good and having a 5mm tumor in the skin outside the breast pocket I just didn't think it was necessary to be so aggressive. I said I wanted to save that type of extensive radiation as an option in the future if I needed it. (also neg nodes) So with that said I am having the CONE...for a direct shot on the latest incision site (which is approx 6 inches long) and 2cm margin all around it. I am nervous for the usual reasons but also I am worried about how these abscessed stitches will be affected. The stitches essentially didn't dissolve and I still have 3 bumps on my incision. I went through a round of antibiotics and PS says it is no longer infected and stiches could take up to 18 months to pop or dissolve. Has anyone experienced this while going through rads? I am so nervous radiation will cause infection. Also...of course I have rotten luck and my normally sweet cat freaked out over a noise as I was holding her and scratched the crap out of me as she catapulted herself off me and under the bed. The worse bloody part of the scratch is on my neck far away from the radiation field but a small part of the scratch that was just a surface scratch no blood is in the range they are radiating. Tomorrow is my first day and I don't know if they wont do it because of the scratch. Do I sound crazy...I really am not. I am just stressed. This recurrence has been emotionally tougher than the initial dx and I have struggled with it. I am so not looking forward to more treatment and worry about how my skin will hold up. I appreciate all the words of advice I have read and the recommendations for helpful products. It always feels good to know you are not alone on this journey and having everyone here I know will lift my spirits on those tough days. Thanks for being here  Diane",

I was greatly concerned about my skin and pec muscle actually THE reason I didn't do whole breast radiation and the 3 areas of nodes. I think if you don't have breast tissue to absorb the heat from rads you'd burn more. I know they can treat the skin burns but for such a small tumor I just couldn't do it Debbie that's really sweet. My niece did a paper in college on her hero and she picked me!! It makes me cry every time I think about it. Sometimes we quietly go through our battle only complaining here ..and don't always realize that others see our strength and are actually inspired by us. Marijen it's a weird thing...I got scratched on my mx side by my neighbors cat (cats really do like me) I was house sitting and the two got into a fight.,anyhow I am so paranoid about infection so I piled on the neosporin. Then I got a little bump . .I went to my ps and he thought it was a sebaceous cyst. He gave me a rx for antibiotics but it didn't go away. My ps said it had to be removed in a sterile OR..since I'm self employed and was busy at the time I kept putting it off trying everything to make it go away . .fast forward a 18 months later ..I know I know...I had it removed we were all shocked it was cancer. My bs went back looking at previous mri's were it was noted a spot was picked up but because it was in the skin they thought it was a blemish. At surgery it ended up being in the muscle 2 mm skin 5,5 mm. It was on mx side 9th from my primary . .I was multifocal with 4 tumors and no rads initially which my bs is beating himself up over but I don't blame anyone. The tumor was unchanged on my next 2 mri's so if it didn't pop through I'd still not know it was there especially since insurance has denied my last mri  Sorry so long Diane",

Also he did an ultrasound and double checked the area that was biopsied and checked my under arm node area. We spoke most of the visit explaining my pathoolgy results and went into my mammo and US pics to show me what he saw in the films and what the next steps were with surgery and treatments I was most likely to receive. My BS seriously is the best doc and held my hand through everything. Good luck with your visit. Stay strong! Diane",

I remember having to call someone to pick me up from work cause I didnt even think I could drive myself home and I slept for 20 hours straight. I told my onc and he said if you sleep the week away (the week after treatment) there is nothing wrong with that. Your body is going through a lot and resting gives it time to heal. I know what you mean about recurrence I think that is what we all get so worried and depressed about. Everytime someone else gets diagnosed or passes away it reminds us of all we've endured and it feels like we will never feel better again. To me chemo is a diistant memory, I can barely remember how bad I felt. You will get through this and each day will get easier. I am sorry about your husband. It must be extra difficult for you this year...we are here for you whenever you need to vent or rant. Be gentle on yourself during this time.

I had multifocal IDC and after my pathology from mx came back they discovered another tumor 1mm that was poorly differentiated suggesting it was becoming more aggressive as it hopped from duct to duct. Of course, if I had gotten a 12 I would have headed on my merry way. I think I would rather do chemo than rads. Chemo is not an easy road, and you should have a very good support system especially with children. I never got sick but I was soooooo tired. The fatigue was something I had never experienced before. After my last treatment I slept for a solid 25 hours...missed a whole day. I never got sick and maintained a very healthy diet. There are lots of threads here to support you either way you decide to go in your course of treatment,. Good luck!! Diane",

I have been so miserable between the itch and this pain in my back shooting down my right arm that my RO swears is not due to rads. Also have been having lots of palpitations but again RO says not related . I had ekg done today it was normal, he gave me a rx to try to see if palpitations go away. I hope they're really annoying . Tomorrow is my last Friday ! !! I've never looked forward to St Patrick's day so much!! Monday I was in such a bad mood from the pain and itch. They finally gave me some Xeroform which is amazing and why wouldn't you give it to everyone at the beginning of treatment . But really took the itch away and is slathered with petroleum jelly. Just the world of difference . Mdoc glad you got your surgery all worked out. Getting TE's out and implants in is like taking your heels off after a long day and putting on slippers. It's easy breezy surgery and so much of a relief recovery was not painful . Now your ooph is most likely another story. I've been so tired I feel like I have more to say but it's bedtime.

I find it a great source of support and information.  I know the first couple of months..heck year is all a whirlwind of test, doctors appointments, more tests and more doctors appointments. I was diagnosed right after my 43rd birthday...my doctor reminded me we are still on the young side of life. In my case I wanted to do everything I could to fight the beast. I had one big tumor (9.25mm) and was scheduled for a lumpectomy but the MRI indicated 3 more tumors that all turned out to be IDC. I had a unimx on the right side, SNB as well, followed by chemo, reconstruction and tamoxifen. Despite what you may hear about Tamoxifen its not as bad as you might think. I have been on it a year and have not had any terrible side effects (although I am blaming the weight gain on T ) The important thing is no matter what you decide that you have a good team around you, good support at home, rest as you need it and be a peace with the decisions you make along the way. remember you can always come here to talk if needed..no question is ever TMI and you will always find support here. You can PM (Private Message) me anytime if you have a specific question you don't want to post on the board. I also recommend an anti anxiety. I only needed it leading up to surgery then on the nights before chemo (I did 4 rounds of taxotere and Cytoxan which was also very doable. the fatigue and hair loss was the worst SE's I experienced but I have no regrets on doing it) You can do this...you are stronger than you ever imagined and at the end of this journey you and your family will be so proud of your strength and courage you will display.

I got my period for the first time PFC in September andjust got it again this week. I was having really bad night sweats until about a month before my period returned.Oh and I just turned 44. I also did acupuncture for the night sweats and joint pain so I don't know if that helped as my last acupuncture treatment was right before I got my period back but I give it some credit for minimizing my night sweats. Hope that helps and you get some rest soon Diane",

I couldn't wait to just get it all over with. I wanted to offer some advice regarding the SNB. My Breast Surgeon (BS) prescribed me some Lidocaine cream that the morning of surgery (after showering) I wiped clean the area an applied a thick layer of the cream then covered it with saran wrap. By the time I got to the hospital (approx 45 mins) to do the injection; it was so numb I couldnt feel a thing. They also did some injection before the dye injection and I honestly didnt feel a thing. I would have your BS prescribe the lidocaine for you it will be worth it. I know this is hard, but you will get through it just fine. I was worried about how I would feel emotionally when I woke from surgery...all I remember is waking up and feeling so HAPPY that the cancer was gone! I  felt relief. The recovery was not that bad. I would say the first 4 days is tough (esp living alone) getting out of bed. I had lots of friends to help me out and didn't push it. I just finish chemo in May and now waiting for reconstruction surgery in September. The funny thing is how fast the time goes by. I know now you feel like time is slooooowwly ticking by and after surgery it zooooooms along. I can't believe it's been 8 months since diagnosis. That first month was the longest of my life. I feel amazed at myself for how strong I've been and all that I've endured. You will be too!! Good luck everyone...any questions feel free to PM (private message) me I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has.  Hugs to all! Di",

My onc said if you sleep the week away that's ok just make sure you are eating. I live alone so I had friends come by or call to make sure I was getting my nutrition. Water is so critical but then you get sick of drinking it. i drank lots of club soda with lemon or those flavor packets. I really took it easy on myself...some say exercise through the fatigue but I just couldnt'. I slept a lot. I was very cautious to avoid crowds and I avoided restaurants were I couldn't get fresh organic foods and not have it sit around for a while before it was served. I carried hand sanitizer everywhere with me and rinsed my mouth several times a day with baking soda, salt and water....esp after eating. Biotene is also a great nonalcohol mouth rinse that was also a great way to avoid mouth sores.

My primary turmor measured 1.35 cm and overall DCIS was 2.5 cm changing my Stage 1 grade 1 to stage 2 grade 2. I fortunately had all nodes clear. My oncotpye score was 17 high end of low risk for reccurence. So i was like ok no Chemo and went on my merry way. My BS was not happy with the fact that i wasnt doing chemo. I met with two oncologist and one did a mortality rate model using all my informaiton to see how someone with all my data fit into the model...it scared the h$ll out of me. I was told i had only so many days between surgery to start Chemo to get the preventative benefits. I met with BS PS and MO  for two days agonizing over the decision. I was scared of the AC for heart issues family history. All docs agreed on Taxotere and Cytoxan (4x) Grade two and my onco score put me squarely in the intermediate category, but when I asked my docs with my stats if I was your sister what would you recommend. and They both said do the chemo. I did the chemo and just completed it. I hate that I lost my hair. It makes me cry almost every day. BUT i know that I have fought this battle with everything in me. The thought of recurrence or metstatic cancers scares the crap out of my. I am 43 yrs old and look forward to turning 50. You need to do what you feel is the best way to treat your cancer, Chemo at grade 2 invasive cancer is not overkill. Its your body and your choice. I would seek another opinion but maybe TC x4 would work best for your. Good luck in your journey!  ",

Before my surgery they inject a dye that goes through your SN and will light up if there is a suspicous area. They will biopsy any area that lights up or looks suspicious. They inject ...brace yourself...5 needles in your nipple to inject the dye. I was given a rx for lidocaine cream to put on (like frosting a cupcake) then cover with saran wrap before I left my house for the hospital. I was good and numb when I got there and didnt feel a thing with the needles and they also spray some really cold something on your skin right before they inject the needle. Obviously since I had a mx I really can't tell you if you would notice any pain from the procedure as I was in pain from my surgery. Good luck with your procedure! Diane",

Someone came here for advice on something you havent personally experienced so it's my humble opinion that only those comments that are helpful should be posted. Please try to be more respectful of what people are going through before you so carelessly respond with negativity. Going through this journey can be more difficult for some people than others so we should be positive and thoughtful in our comments posted.",
