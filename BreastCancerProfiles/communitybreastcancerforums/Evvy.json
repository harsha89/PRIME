The results from 5/14/08 stated: FINDINGS: There are multiple low-density liver lesions, some are too small to characterize, the largest is seen within the inferior aspect of the left lobe, measuring 2.3 cm, with Hounsfield units suggestive of cysts. I saw my onco on 5/22/08 and told me not to worry too much about the results and they probably were cysts and would redo the ct abd scan in about 3 months. However, he was concerned that I was still experiencing some chest pain off and on and ordered a ct of the chest.  He wanted to make sure no pe since I had developed a clot back in Oct of 07.  I assumed everything was ok when I did not receive a call back from my onc but I was still curious about the report.  I have HPN insurance and we are able to access our lab and diagnostic reports etc.. on line.  So Saturday I checked for the report and it came back negative for pe but I was shocked to see what it stated about my liver: 5/22/07 ACCESSION #: 4118158 - CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is a low-density lesion present within the left liver measuring 7.5 x 1.3 cm. This is a nonspecific finding. Hiatal hernia is identified. There is no pulmonary embolus identified. Lungs are clear. There is no consolidation or nodularity. Axillary regions show some left axillary clips. Right axillary region is intact. IMPRESSION: No pulmonary embolus. How can their be such a difference in size from just one week?!!! Could this be a typo?  My next herceptin treatment is this Friday so I'll see my onc then and I wonder if he is going to say anything to me about it, if not I sure as heck am.  I have been a nervous wreck the entire weekend.  Any thoughts????
