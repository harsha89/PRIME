I had 2/4 drains removed at my first post-op visit yesterday and hope to have the last two removed on my next visit 5/29. I thought I would be in so much pain and not be able to move around much but that isn't the case. I hope everything continues to go as smoothly as it has been. The next big step will be getting final biopsy results and oncotype number to see if I will need chemo. Good luck to everyone who is still waiting for their surgery, it isn't as bad as what you are probably thinking!",
