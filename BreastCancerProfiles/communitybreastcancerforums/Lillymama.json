(Had the simulation session today) I have to decide whether I want to do 21 sessions at a higher dose or 33 , at a lower dose. The dr says 21 and 33 would both have same results and since my breast are pretty small , the 21 would be a good choice.I started wondering about whether the side effects- short and long term would be worse with higher amounts of radiation. Is there anyone that can speak from experience about this? Thanks.",

I have decided to go with 21, as I have read a bunch more positive reports about it vs the longer, traditional method. I spoke with a new friend who went through bc three years ago. She told me aloe was her best friend during radiation. I asked my RO about it yesterday and he said he didn't like how \"sticky\" it is on the skin. He gave me some cream they prefer at the clinic... Chemical laden cream, that is... I will be getting some pure aloe to use, also.( or maybe instead of) It bugs me how there is so much we can do to help ourselves with natural products and foods but the medical community disregards it. ðŸ˜’",
