(This is what it says in my medical records).  I had surgery (bmx), the two spots radiated, ACT chemo for 16 weeks and 30 doses of radiation to the chest wall.  I also had my ovaries removed.  I am on Tamoxifin, Herceptin and Zometa.  I did have a reoccurance on my femur last month that they radiated.",

I hope I can just share my experience without being reminded of the risk I took:) I also know that with lymphedema there will always be a risk and I would rather not be reminded of it. I also know I prayed and prayed for God's wisdom about my decision, and He gave me peace in it. I do want to share my experience though, because I remember looking and looking for stories. I hope I can provide information for Nordy and others who are interested in the procedure. I had my VLNT in February of 2012 at NOLA while having my reconstruction. I didn't know whether I would go through with it or not when I arrived, but had a lot of questions for the doctors. I knew that if I didn't do it then I might not elect to go through with another surgery. I also didn't know until I arrived that NOLA had changed from taking nodes from the DIEP procedure to taking them from the neck. I was not expecting a neck scar, but in the end I decided it was a fair trade for lymphedema. With God's strength I handled a stage IV diagnosis as best as I could, but developing lymphedema on my last day of radiation was about all I could handle. I know if you are reading this you understand the devastation as well, and my heart goes out to anyone who has a lymphedema diagnosis. My case was not severe, severe, (I'd say medium) and was oddly enough primarily in my hand. Dr. Trahan felt that the neck as the donor site did not carry a very large risk (and yes as I have been reminded there is a risk:)). I trusted him. Immediately, I noticed a difference after the surgery. My arm and hand were softer and the pain was gone. To this day I am doing well. I still wear my ring on my right hand, but I am free of my glove and sleeve during the day. I wear a Solaris at night and my garments when I fly. Although I just recently forgot it when I flew and was fine. I have had a few flare ups, but two to three massages have brought it back to my new normal. Also interesting to mention, is the therapist who gave me daily massages after my surgery saw many amazing results as well. Of course, I don't know how it is tracked down the road. Take myself for instance, I have never checked back in to document that all is well. I wish that someone (and maybe they are) would do a study to track that kind of data. That would make these kinds of decisions easier. Please let me know if you have any questions. God bless you all!!!",

It seems like oncologists are divided on the topic, but I didn't learn that until later because my oncologist did not give me a choice. I am glad she didn't, and I would have not had it any other way. She is of the opinion that olgiomets can be treated with curative intent. She never described it to me this way, but it is how she decribes me in my medical records. When I read it, I looked up what the term meant and found the some of studies. I was already scheduled for my masectomy and chemo when we got the pet scan report that I had two spots on my spine. She did not give me the option to opt out of either and said that we needed to roll our sleeves up and get even more agressive. This included Zometa, rads to the spine and having my ovaries out. She said all of the treatment was my best chance of progression free survival and if it ever does come back, hopefully enough time will have gone on that there will be even more options for treatment. She also told me that there is a chance that it will never come back. I am on Herceptin, Tamoxifin (this will change once I do get my ovaries out) and Zoladex. I had rads to my chest wall and did a trial for a breast cancer vaccine. I have developed lymphedema and have a compression fracture from the radiation. It has been a long year and a half, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It sounds like you have done a lot too. Chemo was not that bad for me (ACT for 16 weeks - 4 AC every 2 weeks and 4 Taxol/Herceptin every 2 weeks) and my hair is already grown back. I have still lived since I was diagnosed and enjoyed life. I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old and know I will never have any regrets. I just had reconstruction and the last step is to have my ovaries out. During my last visit with my oncologist (still NED), she told me that I have done everything possible, now just forget about cancer and LIVE! You need to do what is right for you, but I wanted to share my experience. All the best to you and God bless!! Cool Breeze, I would love to hear more about what you know about olgiomets, seeding etc., Even though I am described as such, I don't know that much about it. I am glad you made the decision for the liver resection. How long have you been NED? A question I was meaning to ask my oncologist was whether there was ever a certain amount to time that passed where I might be able to rest easier.",

I went with the intention that they would take from my stomach.They took the nodes on the right side of my neck and put them in the left axilla. Dr. Trahan used to do surgeries in that area of the body before becoming a plastic surgeon. He said if I was a family member that is what he would have me do. He said even though no one had reported it, it did not mean the risk wasn't there for leg lymphedema if they took it from the groin. He also said he didn't feel the risk was small. I wasn't expecting to have surgery in the neck, but now the scar is barely noticable and a good trade for the risk reduction. I don't think that they are even doing the surgery in a different area other than the neck anymore. I had a mild case mostly in my hand, but wore a glove and sleeve. Now I wear something at night, but am mostly free during the day. I still have lymphedema, but it is sooooo much better- the fluid seems softer.  I think scar tissue from radiation is what developed my lymphedema and removing it helped. He said that if you remove scar tissue then you need something in its place or it could grow back. They also said it could be 2 years until results are seen.",
