Many times I need a follow-up ultrasound. 6 months ago I had my mammo and needed an ultra-sound on my right breast. Ruled as a cyst...follow-up in 6 months. Had my follow-up ultra sound yesterday, radiologist compared to my previous ultra-sound and said all was ok. Today, doctor's office called, read the report showing no change, but they'd like to proceed further with a surgical consult (which they scheduled for me) and perhaps biopsy. I've only lived in this area for 2.5 years. Up until then I was in the Chicago metro area. I always went to an accredited breast center. Where I live now, they don't have an accredited breast center or breast surgeons. If I still lived in the Chicago area I'd have more confidence on the process...but being where I am now and knowing that I've already had a difficult time just finding a primary care physician that I have faith in...my worry is a bit higher. My questions that I have off the top of my head: o although these doctors don't have my previous records (though I'm not sure why because I was told everything was sent over), why if I have a cyst (and have had for years now) would things be different and need further work? Has anyone encountered this before? o I'm several hours away from an accredited center and will drive if that's the best course...but at least for Thursday, what questions should I be armed with? (I'm working on the internet tonight to do my research.) o Is a needle biopsy most common in situations like these? What all does that involve? I am sure that things are different in different areas of the country and I know that each person has a very different experience, but if anyone has any insights, advice, etc...it would be greatly appreciated.
