I hope this finds all of you doing well. I know this is a forum for women with stage IV breast cancer only, but tomorrow would be Mom's 50th birthday, and she has been on my mind recently, so I made an account on here in an effort to feel close to her again, and did a search of her profile name. I just wanted to let all of you know how grateful I am that she had you to turn to. It hurt that there were many things she felt she couldn't talk to us about, but she was protecting us. She couldn't act depressed around us or that would worry us, and as usual Mom felt the need to make us all feel better even though she was the one dying. So she turned to women who felt the same-you ladies. And for that I cannot thank you enough, because I knew she was holding back how she felt about everything, except for the precious few times she let me know how she was feeling. I know I'm very late with this, but any questions you have about her death, feel free to message me on here or in private to ask them. My email is cheerhorseon@aol.com. You all deserve answers as much as we did. Thank you for all that you did for my mom, and God (or whatever deity you believe in) bless all of you.",

We plan to make it a yearly thing around the anniversary of her death. It is August 24th, 2013 this year at Delaware Gardens Fire Hall-540 49th Street, Pennsauken, NJ 08110. 7pm-midnight. Tickets are $25/person or $40/couple. There will be a chinese auction, 50/50's, a DJ, and lots of food/beer. All funds raised will be going to the Susan G Komen 3day goals of those of us who are throwing it (myself, my twin brother, and a couple family friends). I know there is a lot of stigma surrounding SGK this year, but we have done our research, and we believe this is the organization that Mom would have wanted us to support in her memory. It will be a lot of fun and 82% of all funds raised by SGK goes to breast cancer treatments and research. If you would like to come, PM or email me (cheerhorseon@aol.com) about getting tickets. They will also be available at the door that night.",

The fact that it was a heart attack that caused it was a bit surprising, but we knew for a month that time was short. She just didn't want anyone to worry so she didn't tell anyone. WBR didn't kill her, it was just too late for it to work. Mom's biggest fear was having people sit and wait for her to die, so she put on a smile and pretended everything was okay. But for those of us taking care of her that last month, it was a relief when she finally was out of pain. I know I can never begin to imagine what it's like having cancer, but I don't want you to worry that you will die suddenly from the cancer \"like Reesie did\". I'm sure that happens, but that was not the case with my Mom, and I don't want it to be a fear on any of your minds. Mom wouldn't either. -Meg",
