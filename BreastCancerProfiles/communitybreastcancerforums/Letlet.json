Plus it was my daughter's 6th birthday and I couldn't just be away the day and come home to pass out on the couch. She was happy to have me (apart from the time that I slept for 4 hours during the day) The side of my chest burns but I have to have to have to make it for 7 more treatments!  We can do this ladies!!!!!",

Can I just say that I am feeling fantastic today?? My fatigue/tiredness from chemo was way, way, way below zero and I feel that recovering from the deep hole of chemo treatment is miles away from \"radiation fatigue\".

My husband made cupcakes and wrote Thank You on them and we gave them away today to the clerks, techs, nurses and my RO. So I thought my skin would hold up...well just over the weekend I developed painful blisters in my armpit..the skin had turned from a deep cherry to pretty much almost grey. Between Monday and last night, the blisters popped open and my skin started coming off! It's really gross, scary to look at, I try not to touch it because it just keeps coming off. They gave me silvadene creme to put on the open blisters yesterday. I asked my husband to help me rinse/clean my armpit before putting it on. I didn't realize how much it would hurt. When he poured the sterile water on the open blister I screamed and I think that startled both of us. After he put the silvadene on my armpit I asked him to slather me with aquaphor. He went over it ever so gently and when it came to other redder parts that look like they might form into blisters, I started trembling from the pain. I'm crying silently, I look over to my husband and I see that he is crying silently too and trying to get a grip on it. We were praying the other night and in the middle of our prayer he suddenly says \"Lord please give it to me instead!\". I was like NO, NO, NO....  As I come home my bottle of Tamoxifen was waiting for me at the door. I'm terrified of taking it but I just said a quick prayer...see you at the other end after 5 years ...and took it.  Big cyber hug to everyone :)))",

Right now at this point Flowerfloosey has not been diagnosed YET. Should we go ahead and talk about treatment, chemo, rads etc?? This could just add more to her anxiety and fear and may be unecessary if that biopsy is negative (which would be great!) I understand Flower was starting to direct her anger at barbe and I agree with her that she should \"channel\" it instead of taking it out on a poster that was in good faith trying to help her. Barbe is usually frank and if she was telling Flower she was \"overreacting and needs to calm down\" she would have said so in those exact words.  Flowerfloosey I hope that your appointments go well and that they will schedule you for a biopsy as soon as possible. ",

She probably has no sensation across her chest as most women who have had a MX experience. I had a mastectomy too and have a silicone implant - I did not have a \"boob job\". When she refers to her scars, it also relates as to how her children see her. Every now and then I jokingly refer to my chest as Frankenboob - it pisses the hell out of my husband but to my kids (8 and 4) its \"Mommy\" and I'm sure her kids see her that way too. She's just telling her story. She doesn't have to breakdown in her article the different types of mastectomies or plan A or B or C or if you are a lady in XYZ situation you can do this, this, this. This is her situation, her story. She is not speaking for other women. She can't talk about huge scars that she incurred because I doubt she had an ALND and I doubt that she had a dIEP. I don't think she was minimizing people's experiences but just telling her story. I endured hellish chemo, radiation burns and the loss of my breast. If someone told me 5 years ago that I had an 87% chance of getting BC and there was a way for me NOT to get it and NOT to go through hell on earth I would probably do the same. She watched her mom die of ovarian cancer as well. I don't think this is a decision she chose lightly.  She made a career on making movies, can you imagine acting out a lovescene?

Yes it is much larger than your mom's so it's not the same case but 2.8 cm is also not considered a \"small\" tumor. I just wanted to say that my breast surgeon said that I would not need radiation because I had a mastectomy. (Unfortunately my nodes came back positive and therefore I needed radiation.) However there was absolutely no doubt because of the size of the tumor that I would get chemo, it didn't matter if my nodes were positive or not. Since she is also triple negative they will most likely be aggressive in treatment which usually means chemo...just my opinion.",

I was scheduled to get my first dose of AC yesterday and I was surprised to be informed that there is a nationwide shortage of Adrimycin and starting Monday10/25/10 my hospital was substituting Epirubicin in its place temporarily until the manufacturer Bedford (?) makes more. They said there is a high demand for the A (so sad) So for my first chemo yesterday I got EC instead of AC. My med onc assured me that they are both anthracyclines and that there is less cardiotoxicity involved and that this was the standard treatment for the women in Europe. I was amazed at how calmly I took this news, all set to get AC and got EC and found out on the day...I guess God just held my hand and prevented a major melt-down...after all those weeks of preparing for AC, research and everything, I got somethine else instead. Anyway, I just shrugged my shoulders and said..let's do it.  You know what, I think one of the nurses said that the supply might come in on November-ish so I would ask the hospital where she is being treated if they have that shortage too.  Hope this post helps.",

Hi Cathy, well it's good that you think yours is most likely benign. I would think that the radiologist is recommending the biopsy for some reason. I am 100% Asian with absolutely no family history, not a smoker but since my diagnosis, I enjoy a glass or two of a nice drink, I had none of those risk factors. My breasts were dense because I was 31 at that time. Since that time BC does not care who you are, what your habits are - there is no rhyme or reason. Anyway yeah, I had a huge tumor that I never noticed, never felt any lumps and got dx with BC. The best \"side-effect\" that I've had throughout this is being alive.",

I checked and saw fine little \"baby chick\" white hairs on it. Peach fuzz I guess. I kept checking my head and thought there was no growth. Again I am now 2 weeks out from last dose and hubby and I noticed the other day that my head did indeed had peach fuzz. I thought this whole time that I did not have any hair growth because I couldn't see black hair growing but the hair that is growing back is very light and soft and it's all over my head, it must have been growing this whole time I was on Taxol.  I am losing my eyebrows and lashes though...it started when I finished my last Taxol .

During my treatment she was there for us. She was always there if we needed an extra hand with the kids (i have 2 young ones). She gave me space, she would offer suggestions but never pressured me into doing things that I didn't feel like doing.What do I remember from that time? She was absolutely there for me, she loved (and still loves me like her own) and she was a huge help with our kids. She might google Young Survival Coalition, its an organization that deals and give support to women dx with breast cancer under 40, she will meet many women around her age and get support with issues that come with the \"young\" category.",

Most women on these boards say that generally the first tx is somewhat the worst because you don't know what to expect from how your body will react. My oncologist gave me 2 anti-nausea meds and they didn't work for me the first time. Bear in mind that everyone is different and that a lot of women go through chemo and work. I was not able to. I got really nauseous when I got home from the infusion, couldn't hold anything down. Ate crackers, small bland things. Also I have acid reflux which made me throw up. I had to go to my oncologist to get fluids later. Anyway my schedule would be EC on Thursday, feel okay Friday, feel okay saturday. On sunday night I would start getting tired. Then from Monday - Wed, Thursday I would be extremely fatigued. Extremely. The period of fatigue would actually get longer as my treatments progressed. My nausea improved so much that by my 3rd EC tx I didn't have to take any anti-nausea meds and was eating fine. When I switched over to Taxol, I had absolutely no nausea at all. I had a bit more of energy than with the EC, the fatigue was nowhere as bad as the EC. I had a lot of bone pain when I got the first Taxol and the pain meds barely helped. My onc gave me some steroids for the bone pain and the difference was night and day. I grew some peach fuzz in my armpit! My eyebrows and lashes thinned and I'm still hoping that they stay. The tips of my fingers and toes are numb. Some ladies take some supplement for it and said that it helps but my onc refuses to have me on any supplement except Vit D. In the middle of my tx my skin grew darker and I got some brown spots on the bottom of my feet and fingers and my nails turned darker. I also had digestive issues all throughout, seesawing between constipation and diarrhea. Anyway, PLEASE don't let this scare of discourage you. This is MY experience. You may not even experience any one of those SE above and if you do at least you wont be up at night googling things like I did (for the brown spots) . After my first tx, the last tx seemed so far away , that it would never come but now I'll have my last Taxol on Thursday. Chemo will be over for you too!",

Or was the doctor who did the biopsy the breast surgeon already (sometimes the radiologist does that). I would really advise you to get a hold of the final pathology report so you can find out what specific type of breast cancer it is because it will basically determine your course of treatment. When you meet with the breast surgeon the discussion will be what type of surgery can take the cancer out - a mastectomy or lumpectomy. If you want a second opinion, there is no need to get a new mammo or any testing that was already done. You can take your films/CD's to this doctor. I hope this helps",

So because the ultrasound tech was unable to get a clear picture, they didn't do a biopsy and you're supposed to wait and see for 6 months??? Unbelievable. I wonder how they would fare if it were the other way around. You don't even need to convince them with family history because bottom line, you have a mass present upon palpation and seen on mammo and your GP is ordering a biopsy. Perhaps you can take your mammo films, ultrasound films/CD and your actual reports (not the letter they give you) to a breast surgeon. Sometimes they will do the biopsy. NatureGirl is right, be the squeaky wheel but nicely. I am 31 too with absolutely no family history of breast cancer yet I was diagnosed last August. Even my breast surgeon told me it could be lumpy or fibrocystic breasts when I pointed to him the hard area in my breast. Nope it was cancer. Not trying to scare you but just empasizing that becaue of our age many in the medical field dismiss our concerns because we are \"too young\".

IBC is a rare for of BC and aggressive. So with that in mind you want to fight this as as hard as you can, as soon as possible. With that being said, you also want to get your treatments, surgery right the first time around. It concerns me that your first chemo class is after your chemo? You need to be informed what drug you'll be on, what side effects, what your schedule is. Also your oncologist needs to go over your hormone receptors, you'll find them posted on other members signature. If you are ER (estrogen)  positive or negative, PR (progesterone) positive and HER2 negative or positive. Those 3 things will influence your treatments down the road as well. Her2 positive patient's will receive a drug called Herceptin which is touted to cut down the rates of recurrence by 50%. I would actually suggest posting your situation and if you would want to share your path report again to the IBC thread that we have. The ladies there are more qualified than I am to give advice about it. I have IDC so it's not quite the same. If the difference of you starting chemo and getting a second opinion is a day, it might be a good idea to go get that second opinion. It may change your outlook and game plan for the disease completely or it may not. It might make a difference if you tell the nurse secretary that your path leans towards IBC. I work in a cancer hospital and when someone presents with IBC we make sure to get up from our chairs and help the lady asap. Doctors will make adjustments to their schedules because it is so rare. Also remember that the Stamford may likely look at your initial path from your first biopsy and reread it as well and it may shed more light and more detail, just because their pathologists are especially trained to look for cancer. This is NOT to frighten you but to empower you with information and let you know that you have choices and although you cannot control what is happening to you right now, you can control your choices. Whatever you decide we are still here with you to support you.",

Also I have had mastitis before and I did feel a lump within a day and after taking antibiotics it resolved, I did have a fever and my breast hurt! . Fever is usually a sign of infection and mastitis is a breast infection. I really hope that you will feel better tomorrow and they will get a defnitive biopsy result.

From what I understand that the the path from your multiple biopsies have been complicated but you are scheduled for treatment at a local hospital on Monday. Some Cancer centers may or may not see you when you have already begun treatment. I work in a cancer center that does not see patients for a second opinion if treatment was already begun. If and hopefully it wont be, IBC which is a rare caner, you really want to be seen at a specialized cancer center and be treated by docs who see these cases much more than the local doctor. Did your doctor tell you if the path showed invasive ducal cancer (IDC) or invasive lobular cancer (ILC)? Did he discuss why you are having chemo first before surgery, it is because they want to shrink it first before surgery? Do you know what chemo regimen you will be on and did they go over the side effects with you? Will you be needing an injection the day after? I don't mean to overwhelm you with questions but is there someone with you when you go to your appointments. Sometimes because everything is just a shock, we hear only what we can hear and the rest tuned out. This is just my own opinion, I mean your local hospital may be wonderful anyway in dealing with your situation and the decision is all up to you. I am so sorry that you have to go through all this and to worry about starting a job on top of it. Please keep us posted. We're here to give support and be there for you. Hugs!",

If you call off your biopsy will you have peace of mind is the question. Will you be worrying about it constantly and wondering what it is?

I myself feel like I have a somewhat lower pain threshold than other women. I think I may have taken Tylenol the next day. About the marker/clip, it's left there so that in the event that your results come out positive then the surgeon knows where to take out the tissue. I have never heard of a woman refusing it but then again I was too shell shocked to even think at that point. So based on that woman who refused the marker, why would you have another core biopsy if you already had one and it already was positive? Trust me if the results were positive you would want to go to the next step as soon as possible and having another core biopsy may seem ridiculous to you at that point. Also in the event that it is positive and you don't have that marker, you don't want the surgeon to take out the wrong spot. All this would be moot if a mastectomy is chosen because everything is taken out including the clip. I have not heard any stories about chest wall perforation. In my experience the needle which was big did not go directly in the breast pointed towards my chest. The radiologist used the ultrasound wand around my breast and when he found the suspicious area he angled the needle sideways and took the sample. Why don't you discuss the issue with the radiologist before the procedure? Ask him how many core biopsies he/she has done and if there was anybody who had a perforation.",

I am not an expert on LE but I go to see an LE therapist and she told me that the number of nodes taken out does not really determine LE. She said that she has seen patients who just had a biopsy of their LN who develop LE. Second of all, the symptoms in your arm is really concerning. I am surprised that your onc does not seem to be on top of it? From what you are describing I am hoping it is not extravasation, which is when chemo goes directly into the tissues of the arm not into the bloodstream. It happens when the needle goes out of the vein into the arm tissues. It causespain, reddening and can be very serious. I would call you med onc again and ask him/her to evaluate your arm asap.",

I have what feels like bruising on my left side behind my armpit, the place between my shoulder blades, my left side (by the expander). I wonder if this is pain from the expander and will go away or if its part of the post mastectomy pain? One thing I know that's not related to it is that on the underside of my left arm is an area that tingles/burns/is numb and its constant 24/7. It is there all the time and it rubs on my clothes, even rubs on myself. Has anyone had this and it went away? Weeks after my surgery I called my BS office and they pretty much said yeah that can happen from the surgery and they don't really know if it'll go away. End of story. For a while I tried lightly wrapping the area with a bandage so it wouldn't rub on anything. It helped a bit but was not the solution.Dang it, the mastectomy site is completely numb, you don't feel anything yet you wish you did. I closed my eyes and asked my hubby to touch all over and of course there was silence as I'm waiting and waiting. I was in tears, of course I didn't feel anything, I walked into surgery knowing this but now my left arm just \"feels\" everything??? There is no happy medium. I am 31 and I cannot begin to fathom how to have sex again when it involves a lot of touching, stroking and my left arm constantly feels like its on fire when it touches something!!! Sorry now I'm just plain angry.",
