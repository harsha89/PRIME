I have a hx of breast augmentation 16 years ago. I found a lump right under my nipple scar a month ago. I had testing on fri and was recommended for biopsy. Looking for any kind of hope ... I have a little boy... I'm a nurse.. Im sobbing... Angela Collected:04/21/2017 Resulted:04/21/2017 Ordered By: Result Status:Final result Narrative BILATERAL DIGITAL DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM WITH TOMOSYNTHESIS History: Palpable lump right breast. Burning sensation bilaterally right greater than left. Comparison: Noncontrast MRI of 07/25/2016 from Nason Hospital. No prior mammogram for comparison. Prior mammogram was obtained over 20 years ago and cannot be retrieved. Breast Tissue Composition: Heterogeneously Dense Technique: Bilateral CC and MLO views were obtained using both implant displaced and conventional technique. Right spot compression views and right MLO view were also obtained. Tomosynthesis images were acquired and reviewed. FINDINGS: There are bilateral retropectoral saline implants in situ. A radiopaque marker was placed over the area of palpable concern in the right breast. There is an asymmetry demonstrated in the right breast lower inner quadrant in the region of concern. There is mild skin dimpling suggested. Ultrasound was done to further characterize and demonstrated suspicious masses (see report below). Biopsy is recommended There is an asymmetry in the superior left breast seen on the MLO view. With spot compression imaging, this has an appearance suggestive for fibroglandular tissue. Given the dense nature of the tissue, ultrasound was done to further evaluate. Subsequent ultrasound demonstrated no suspicious findings (see report below). BILATERAL BREAST ULTRASOUND RIGHT BREAST Targeted ultrasound of the right breast lower inner quadrant was obtained. There are at least 3 irregular masses demonstrated in the right breast 4-6:00 region. They are irregular in shape, hypoechoic and firm with elastography. #1 is seen at 6:00 1 cm from the nipple measuring approximately 8 mm in maximal dimension. #2 is seen at 5-6:00 proximal 3 cm from the nipple measuring approximately 1 cm in greatest dimension. #3 is seen in the right breast 4-5:00 approximately 4 cm from the nipple and measures up to 1.8 cm in maximum dimension. These correlate with the area of asymmetry on the mammogram and the area of palpable concern. Malignancy cannot be excluded. Biopsy is recommended. Imaging of the sub/periareolar region was unremarkable. LEFT BREAST Targeted ultrasound of the superior left breast and subsequent/periareolar region was obtained. No focal abnormality was demonstrated. No solid or cystic masses seen. Impression 1. At least 3 irregular masses noted in the right breast 4-6:00, as described above. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of at least 2 of the lesions is recommended. Biopsy of the 2 lesions most distal from each other (#1 at 6:00 and #3 at 4-5:00) is suggested. 2. The findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient at the time of the exam. BIRADS CATEGORY 4: Suspicious Confirmation of receipt of this report by the referring service is being performed by the radiology department.
