I will be getting Adriamycin/Cytoxan  every 2 wks x4 followed by Taxol/Herceptin weekly x12, then Herceptin every 3 wks for 1 yr total. I will also receive the Neulasta.  I went shopping today based on all of the wonderful recommendations from those who have started this journey before us! I am so ready to get this started! The only thing I am still wondering about is icing hands/feet during infusions? Any suggestions/input would be greatly appreciated!  I have also set up an appointment to have my head shaved :-/ Prayers & best of luck to all of you fellow warriors! We will do this together!!! ~mmb70",
