My IBC spread so quickly that I was knocked completely off my feet in a matter of days after my DX; one day I was perfectly fine and the next I was in the hospital fighting for my life (my family was told I probably wouldn't last two months because it was growing so fast). Although I wasn't completely bed-ridden like your Mom, I slept most of time, needed help with most activities and I considered it a good day when I was able to wash up and change my clothes before laying back down. Then I lost complete use of my right arm when it spread to the brachial nerves. I too was on very heavy pain killers (fentanyl and morphine, plus gabapentin and something else for breakthrough pain) so I was in a complete fog, and I was so miserable that I didn't even want to be around anyone, especially before we got my pain meds dialed in and I was dealing with breakthrough pain. It was a long six+ months before I was back on my feet and felt anything close to somewhat living. The isolation is so very hard and adds to the depression. Both of our families are on the opposite coast, very few friends reached out to help, and it's such a tremendous strain on the primary care giver, especially if he's still working like my husband is. Thankfully my SIL flew out here to help nurse me through those first critical months and keep my household going because my husband was about to have a breakdown and I was too sick and drugged up to see it. I'm so glad that your parents have you to help out, they really need it. And as much as your Mom's health is the priority right now, please don't forget that your Dad is going through a lot too, he's watching his wife fight for her life and he can't fix it. I honestly believe that it was much harder on my husband than it was on me. If you haven't yet, taking him out to lunch or his favorite activity (and hopefully giving him a chance to talk about it) might be a good idea. There are also support groups for Stage IV caregivers. You have a new baby on the way (congratulations!), you have a lot on your hands too! To your original questions - I stopped a chemo drug even though it was working well (and saved my life) before I was stable when I developed an SE that got so bad I was telling my husband and MO that I would rather die than live that way. It's a break from chemo, but my MO said it can't be a \"break\" from that specific drug because when I restart we'll need to try to find another drug that works. It took 2 months for the SE to wear off enough for me to be functional again, and now my super-aggressive cancer will be resistant to that drug. My MO was very much against stopping for that reason. In the meantime I'm still on targeted therapy and keeping my fingers crossed until later this month. If we find out that H&P hasn't been holding the line these past couple months I still won't regret it. I know it was a big risk but I feel so much better and now I'm physically and emotionally ready to go back on chemo if/when I need to. I put weight on, am off the anti-depressant, have made a drastic reduction in my pain meds, getting my exercise, am finally back to living a somewhat normal life after six+ months of hell, and most importantly I'm happy and feel good. I needed to do it because for me, quality of life is everything and I would rather have three good months than a year of being miserable (and making everyone around me miserable) if it can be avoided, so I was willing to take the risk. Other people are willing to go through anything to extend their life, and that's okay too. The most important thing is, how does your Mom feel about taking a break? If treatment is affecting her mentally and emotionally too and it's been going on for an extended period of time, that interferes with the healing process. The whole family needs to be willing to support her decisions about her treatment, and it's important to talk about it. The one thing that meant the most to me is that every single person in my family let me know repeatedly that they will support whatever decisions I make about my treatment. And I also agree with the Ensure milkshakes! I was under orders to gain weight and I had at least one every day. No matter how bad my appetite is I can never resist ice cream. Chocolate Ensure with coffee ice cream was a favorite, and vanilla Ensure with strawberry ice cream is great too. My MO told my family to feed me all the cookies, cake and pasta I would eat. I was concerned about the sugar/cancer connection, but my scan showed that the chemo was working well despite all of the sugar I was ingesting. I think the most important thing is to let her eat whatever she's in the mood for, and indulge any cravings, even if it means eating ice cream all day every day. Now is not the time to worry about healthy foods and a balanced diet. Hugs and prayers to all of you!",

I was fine for the first 2 months of weekly infusions but then I started having an atypical response - excruciating stomach cramps and non-stop diarrhea that lasted for days after every infusion. I started weekly taxol in September of last year, and the first time I had the severe abdominal pain and diarrhea was in December. At first we thought I picked up some kind of bug or virus because my immune system was compromised and my MO insisted that paclitaxel didn't cause that SE. Did a 10-day course of heavy antibiotics coinciding with my week off, it seemed to resolve, but then it started right up again after my next infusion, and it got worse and lasted longer after each subsequent infusion. Stomach pain was so bad that I spent several days each week curled in a fetal position and crying - when I wasn't running to the bathroom, I was on fentanyl and morphine at the time but they didn't put a dent in the abdominal pain. Diarrhea become uncontrollable and explosive lasting for days. Immodium etc did nothing to slow it down. I couldn't leave the house because I didn't dare step more than a few feet away from the bathroom and the pain was so bad. After several weeks of the symptoms getting progressively worse I was convinced the taxol was causing it because of the timing - just when I started feeling better, it was time for my next infusion and then it started all over again. My MO kept insisting it wasn't a side effect of paclitaxel and we continued to look for other causes while I toughed it out. When I switched from weekly to 3-week dosage it damn near killed me - I couldn't eat or even take a tiny sip of water for 8 days straight, explosive diarrhea every 15-20 minutes for over a week (and then only 20x a day for the next two weeks), stomach pain was so intense that I wanted to die. My life was pure hell. I finally told my MO that I'd rather die than live that way. He finally believed that it might be from the taxol and agreed to let me try skipping a dose. Said he had never heard of anyone having that kind of reaction to paclitaxel. I don't know why I tolerated it so well in the beginning, but I guess one day my body decided it had enough. When I finally started improving after skipping a dose, he took me off it completely. Took me over two months to get back to \"normal\" after my last infusion. I'm not really much help to you because we never found anything that would relieve any of my symptoms, just wanted you to know that you're not alone in getting intense stomach pain from paclitaxel, though yours may be due to a different reason. My MO kept telling me that paclitaxel doesn't cause that kind of reaction and I was getting so frustrated. The only thing that worked me was stopping paclitaxel. I tried to tough it out best I could but when I couldn't eat or drink for 8 days straight I knew the next round would land me in the hospital. Nothing we tried was helping and it was only getting drastically worse each time, I had to draw the line after being on it for 5 months. Everyone will tell you that it's not due to the abraxane because it doesn't cause that SE and you definitely do need to rule out other causes, but in my case it most certainly was from the taxol, and both are paclitaxel. At first my symptoms didn't start until a couple days after my infusion so it was hard to pin down the cause, but after several more infusions it was starting within hours and eventually it never let up. I never had the problem again once I stopped taxol.",

If you have a lump and the ultrasound didn't find anything concerning, including the thickening of the skin that is typical with IBC, I wouldn't worry about IBC. The lump and bruising may have just been from banging into something or some other physical trauma, especially since you said that the original bruise has faded. If the lump remains, it could make sense to get a second opinion but I would not worry about IBC. My IBC \"bruise\"/purple discoloration wasn't small multiple bruises. My entire breast looked bruised and the discoloration grew until it covered most of my right torso, from my collar bone down to my waist. It didn't fade until after I began chemo. The symptoms increased dramatically every day while we waited for the results of the biopsy and then multiple scans to confirm staging. My only \"lumps\" were the visibly swollen lymph nodes under my arm and above my collar bone. The skin of your breast would usually feel hot to the touch and swelling of the breast and lymph nodes are usually dramatic because IBC blocks the lymph vessels. There are usually visible signs of inflammation, hence the name Inflammatory Breast Cancer. When IBC is misdiagnosed, it is usually diagnosed as mastitis.If no one has mentioned the possibility of mastitis to you it likely means that your doctors are not seeing symptoms of either. A second opinion might give you peace of mind, but it honestly doesn't sound anything like my experience of IBC. Hope it turns out okay for you.",

Also the fact that the mottling comes and go and changes location. In my experience, the redness only spreads and gets worse, often quite fast. It doesn't come and go. Also the fact that your sonogram didn't show the typical thickening, and that IBC doesn't typically present as a lump. With two doctors leaning toward a vascular issue I'd be inclined to investigate in that direction. All that being said and since you asked, my IBC symptoms were unmistakable and they did three punch biopsies to make sure they didn't miss it. I wish you the best of luck in finding out what is causing your symptoms. Although I'm not a doctor I honestly believe you can put IBC out of your mind unless your symptoms get drastically worse in a short period of time.",

If I don't have any worrisome symptoms we're good with that, our focus is entirely on my quality of life. He also said that he thinks it is lazy (his word, not mine) for doctors to scan every three months, that they really should be spending more time talking with their patients haha! In fairness I've had a consult (and lab work) at least every 3 weeks since my Dx and he spends as much time with me as I need, I know that others don't get to consult with their MO nearly as often, especially if they are on oral meds. Eventually I learned how to relax about my situation, if I don't have any troublesome symptoms I just want to enjoy life, and when I did have signs of progression I knew it and we scanned. No scanxiety because it was only to confirm what I already knew & determine the extent. A friend posted an interesting comment on social media - that her first MO scanned every three months and would change her treatment every time a scan showed the slightest progression. As a result she has run through almost every option in a very short time and now regrets it. Even with things like radiation when a small spot shows up, my RO explained that since there is a limit as to how many times you can radiate a spot, why use that treatment before you have any symptoms and really need it, and risk loosing that option when you may really need it for palliative reasons in the future? I think it all depends on individual situations, but for now I'm glad I'm not on the 3-month scan schedule.",

Andi I'm a slacker with the echos too, although it's been less than a year for me. I know that Genentech wants an echo or MUGA every 3 months, but when I first saw my cardiologist after starting Herceptin he punched some numbers into a computer and said I had only a 1.8% chance of having any problems with it. He did an EKG and an echo and said my heart is so strong and in such good shape that he has absolutely no worries about me at all, there's no reason to see me every 3 months, recommended every 6 months unless I experienced problems. Neither my MO nor my cardiologist has followed up for another one since, I haven't experienced any symptoms that would cause concern, I've been so doctored out these past couple months that I haven't bothered to push for it, then we stopped Herceptin for a month+ while trying to decide on a new treatment plan so I figured there was no need. Now that I'm back on H&P I have been wondering if I should try to fit it in before the end of the year. I think that staying physically active goes a long way toward keeping our hearts healthy and strong (absent any other problems). But if I remember correctly you are currently NED and I am most definitely not, so perhaps I should take it more seriously. Started a 3-week dose of Taxol last week and between the fatigue and a storm I used that as an excuse to skip my Qigong class because I just wasn't up to driving in the pouring rain after dark with chemo running through my body. The class coincides with my \"crash day\" from the pre-meds so it's going to be a challenge to push through the fatigue to drag myself out of the house. The tumor in my axilla is quite large and painful right now, it's growing very fast and I really need the Taxol to kick it in butt soon (it will blow your mind how fast IBC can spread right before your eyes). Still staying physically active but not doing strenuous activities that require using my arms because I'm already losing mobility & the pain is pretty rough. So things like strength training and swimming are out right now, but doing as much walking as I can and this week I'll be back to Qigong with some major modifications. I want to stick with it because I believe that the mind/body connection has been beneficial for me. Staying physically active is just as much about the mental/emotional benefits, maybe even more so than the physical benefits. Lori",

I can't even imagine trying to hike carrying that much weight these days. I'm still working on being able to carry all of my gear again! It doesn't help mentally that when I talked to my doctor about doing strength training again and how much weight was safe for me to use, he said there's no real way to tell how well my weight-bearing bones have healed and how much weight and stress they can handle except to just try haha! I guess that means I'll find out the hard way if I put too much stress on my bones. I've already lost close to an inch in height from spinal compression. My trip was nothing that would impress an outdoorswoman like yourself. I usually primitive (dry) camp in the backcountry of the Mojave, but for this trip I wussed out and rented an RV so I could be comfortable in case I had a bad day and needed to crash. Since it was my first time back out I wanted to keep things as stress-free and comfortable as possible so I could ease back into it and see how I handled everything. We have a friend who lives at the base of the Tetons and we used his property as basecamp for a couple days, then moved to the Colter Bay Campground (not RV park) which was the perfect location for spending time in both Grand Teton NP and Yellowstone. As far as campgrounds go, I was impressed because the sites are large and well spread out with good privacy so it was a good compromise. So many organized campgrounds here in California have small sites that are right on top of each other, crowded and noisy, and I avoid them like the plague. We had driven my Jeep 1000+ miles to get there, and we had fun exploring a few jeep trails far away from the crowds. Hikes were short, never more than 3-4 miles on flat terrain. It was our first time in Wyoming so we did the tourist thing in Yellowstone but spent most of our time exploring Grand Teton NP and Bridger-Teton National Forest. About 4 days in I crashed hard one night in so much pain that I couldn't even see straight or tell my husband why I was going straight to bed, and I realized I just needed to do a better job pacing myself instead of getting frustrated that I couldn't do as much as I used to do, especially since I'm sure the altitude played a role. Still managed to be up and out at 5am every morning and didn't get back to camp until well after sunset each night, but I've been going through a period of getting very frustrated with myself whenever I hit a wall. Camped a bit further down there was an older man with a Jeep. One night he stopped by to ask about some of the modifications on my Jeep and we got to talking. Turns out his wife had recently died of breast cancer, now he takes his RV, Jeep, boat and dog and spends most of his time out in nature. We bonded over Jeeps and breast cancer and talked for hours, there's a certain peace in talking with someone who truly understands what you are going through. Found myself hoping that my husband will be like him after I'm gone, I'm so afraid that he'll spend all his time at home sitting in front of the TV without me. Qigong class last night was painful, d*mn spasms didn't help. Woke up stiff & sore so will do just some light stretching today (Qigong warmup exercises) to try to loosen things up. I can definitely see a difference in how I handle physical activity depending on where I am in my treatment cycle. As we were leaving class my 80 year old teacher said \"Just wait until you're my age\" and I wanted to cry. One can hope, right? The class is hosted by my hospital's Women's Center and almost everyone there is a cancer \"survivor\" but I'm the only Stage IV person and the only one still in active treatment. She's a retired RN and I thought she understood when we talked about the bone mets throughout my skeleton and how that might affect my ability to do certain movements, but I guess she doesn't understand the bigger Stage IV picture.  You all inspire me so much with the things you are doing. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend and can get outside and enjoy some beautiful fall weather! Lori",

I was worried how altitude would affect me during a recent camping trip to Wyoming, afraid I would ruin my first trip since DX by being too sick and miserable to hike. I was skeptical about the Boost, but for $15 for the large can I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. Any time I felt the tell-tale altitude headache start to sneak up or I found myself a little short of breath, I took a couple of hits of the Boost and it was amazing how much it helped. I had absolutely zero problems with the altitude and was able to hike as much I wanted. It's sold almost everywhere at high altitude locations - gas stations, grocery stores, sporting goods shops, even the gift shops in National Parks.",

I really suspect it is due to neuropathy like your MO said, maybe in combination with healing. I had no problem with neuropathy during taxol but since being on targeted therapy which isn't supposed to cause neuropathy it has been getting worse every month. Gabapentin helps with the burning in my feet but I'm plagued with cramps in my feet, shins and hands and thought the intercostal spasms were \"rib cramps\" until a nurse told me what they were. Even though I knew I wasn't dehydrated I tried adding potassium and magnesium supplements and upping my salt intake, but it didn't help. Oh well, was hoping somebody knew a secret trick but I'm not going to let it slow me down. I'm still working on regaining strength and stamina after 7 months off my feet so I need to push through it. Yesterday treadmill and strength training, today is treadmill, crunches and some Qigong practice, tomorrow is Qigong class. You ladies are making me jealous with the beautiful photos of your hiking and backpacking trips. Other than the pool most of my workouts are indoors for now until the weather cools down a bit more, then will be spending as much time as possible camping in the desert. KatyK I can truly relate to the emotions you describe - my 10-day camping trip to Wyoming in July was the first time since my DX that my husband and I were back out doing what we love so much, after being told I probably would never be able to do it again. It was an incredibly emotional experience for both of us. Spending time in nature is so good for the soul. Lori",

I have a really tough time with them, Qigong makes them go crazy and at first I was embarrassed in class, but I explained to everyone what was going on and they were very understanding. When a bad one hits I usually walk to the side of the room and quietly curse under my breath until it releases, and then I rejoin the class. Some days I've had to walk away 10-12 times during a class. So far this round of Taxol seems to be going easier than it was the first time, mainly just major fatigue, but I've only had one infusion so far, second is tomorrow. I expected the SEs to be worse since it's the 3x the dose I was on the first time, but I'm going into it healthier and stronger than I was the first time and if this is as bad as it gets this round I'll be happy but I know that the effects are cumulative. Embarrassed to say that I haven't done any real exercising the past several weeks. The Taxol isn't working yet, the cancer is growing fast and my pain level has increased drastically over the past several weeks, so I'm cranky and miserable. It's been all I can do to get through decorating for Christmas and attending some holiday parties. Social events in particular really wipe me out. Telling myself I'm going to Qigong on Thursday, but with infusion on Tuesday, my husband's Christmas party on Wednesday, and then crash day on Thursday it's going to be hard to find the energy and motivation to do it while I'm in so much pain. Also plan to do a 1.5 mile walk along the harbor to see the Christmas lights this week, I think it will help with my mood. I'm back to taking baby steps again. :( Hoping this next infusion starts working not just because I need the pain relief but because I really need the emotional boost of knowing that treatment is working. *%&# IBC grows so fast that it can really mess with your mind. Both of our families are on the East Coast and I hate to travel during the holidays (and I refuse to deal with an over-crowded airport while on chemo anyway), so Christmas is a quiet time for us. Some years we go camping, but this year will probably just go for a walk on the beach, then snuggle together while watching sappy Christmas movies haha. :) My husband said his best Christmas gift is that I'm still here this year and we're just going to enjoy being together. Hope everyone is doing well and not getting too stressed over the holidays. Illimae hope your scan results bring good news!",

I won't promise you that it gets easier because each of our cases are different and we all respond differently to treatment but don't give up hope, my cancer spread so fast & did so much damage that for six months it was all I could do to get washed up and changed every day, and there were many days I couldn't even do that. I thought that was how the rest of my life was going to be. Then I slowly started getting stronger & set little goals for myself, began with walking, and now ten months later I'm in the gym lifting weights, walking/hiking, swimming, and leading an active lifestyle again. I still have some pain, but it's being well-managed and I can honestly say that my life is good. My husband is also a small business owner who works 6 days a week and we have no family in the area. He missed so much time the first two months taking care of me until we realized that we needed help handling things. Self-employed people understand the reality that too much time away from the business can mean not being able to afford your mortgage payments, health insurance/medical expenses, and putting food on the table. My husband attends all of the important appointments with me and he does things like stop by the infusion center to bring me coffee and a donut, but I know that it's not realistic for him to be at all of my routine appointments if we want to keep eating and keep a roof over heads (not to mention pay for my treatment). At the same time, you can't spend all of your free time doing it because you are going to burn out! You need help.

If you have IBC, your skin WILL show it because with IBC the cancer blocks the lymph vessels in the skin, which is what causes the skin to look inflamed. You may not have all of the symptoms, but you would have some of them, and the symptoms do progress very quickly. Absent any skin symptoms, your doctor would have little reason to do a punch biopsy - if your skin doesn't appear to be affected, there is no reason to biopsy your skin, not to mention if there is no specific area showing signs of it they wouldn't even begin to know where to biopsy. An inverted nipple shouldn't be ignored, but I believe you are doing the right thing by starting with the standard tests and imaging and taking things from there. If you do suddenly develop IBC symptoms - specifically redness and heat (not just warmth), by all means push for a punch biopsy. I wish you the best of luck with your tests and hopefully you'll find that the inverted nipple is due to some benign reason.",

The Aleve is likely reducing the inflammation that arthritis can cause in the joints.",

There are several women here who have been on only Herceptin or Herceptin & Perjeta long term, 7-10 years. As my MO says, it's a maintenance treatment and as long as your mets are stable and not causing any problems (or you are NED) you can stay on it as long as it works. If your mets are growing and causing trouble, then it's time to consider other treatment. That doesn't always mean systemic treatment (chemo), if the rest of you is responding well to targeted therapy there are usually options for localized treatment of mets if they are causing problems. As a general rule of thumb, if the mets are small and not causing any symptoms, there's no need to rush into a change of treatment. At Stage IV it's all about quality of life. You might want to look into Kadcyla (f not now, for the future), which is a targeted therapy that combines Herceptin with emtansine. It seems to be fairly easy to tolerate, more so than a harsher chemo. I'll be moving to that next when I finish this round of Taxol. I seem to be the opposite of you - my mets respond very well to H&P (my liver mets have completely resolved on H&P) but when I stopped chemo I had a primary recurrence. Kadcyla seems to be the best of both worlds (hopefully).",

My labs have never wavered - when I had my first go with IBC with fast-growing tumors, extensive mets throughout my skeleton, liver, chest wall, skin and lymph nodes, my labs were perfect. Throughout multiple rounds of chemo, not a blip in my labs, always perfect. IBC is raging again and still my labs are perfect. The only thing I think they are good for is watching for adverse affects of treatment, or watching for things like a problem with liver function. Lower back pain doesn't necessarily mean that the cancer has returned or progressed, especially for those of us over 50. Since I've had extensive mets throughout my skeleton I recently had a scare when I had lower back pain that lasted a couple weeks. Turns out it was just age-related back pain due to muscles not bone, my MO prescribed a muscle relaxer and in a couple days I was good as new. Any pain is scary when you're dealing with cancer, and it's a good idea to get it checked out if it persists for a few weeks. It's hard to teach ourselves not to immediately think of cancer every time we have some pain, we forget that we used to get aches and pains prior to our diagnosis and hardly gave it a thought, after cancer our minds immediately jump to worse case scenario.

I still get intense itching on my upper arms that drives me nuts,especially when I'm trying to sleep. There's no visible rash on my arms, but many women here have problems with upper arm itching while on H&P so it definitely seems related.Topical benadryl helps with the itching. I figure that as far as SEs go, as long as it's just a mild rash it's a small price to pay for the benefit of H&P. If your rash is really bad, some women drop Perjeta and only do Herceptin. You could always try that and see if it's the one causing the rash, but there's strong likelihood that Herceptin is causing it. If it's mild, try waiting it out and you might stop having that reaction like I did.",

Although mine spread much faster than usual even for IBC and got worse by the hour (there was no mistaking it for mastitis haha!), symptoms typically worsen daily, often dramatically. Any time symptoms stay stable or improve with antibiotics or creams, it's a very strong indication that it is not IBC. If all of a sudden your breast swells to twice it's size and is radiating intense heat, you have a massive purple bruise from your collarbone to your waist, the rash starts oozing and your lymph nodes are the size of golfballs, get thee back to the doctor ASAP whether or not you've finished the antibiotics.

If an abscess or infection heals on its own, that's also a very strong sign that it's not IBC. You haven't mentioned if you've had a mammogram, but that you've seen multiple doctors and none have seen a reason to be concerned? Your sleepless nights could be due to anxiety, but the fact that you were seeing patterns and were nauseous sounds indicative of a migraine. If you had IBC you would have much worse signs of it on your breast after a year (and likely ulceration because IBC involves the skin) that would be impossible to ignore, IBC moves fast, when I was diagnosed I was told I had 60 days if it didn't respond to chemo; I would've been dead well inside of a year.

If the mets are stable and aren't causing trouble, I'd want to stay on H&P until progression. If they are growing or causing problems, truthfully I'd prefer to try Kadcyla (TDM-1) first, which is Herceptin plus a chemo, before going back to Taxol for a few reasons, especially if her other mets are responding to the H&P (some of mine respond well to H&P and some of mine just keep growing as if H&P is a fertilizer). Kadcyla is the standard next line of treatment for HER2+ when there's progression. She may already be resistant to Taxol (which is what happened to me 2nd time around after it worked so well the first time), she wouldn't lose her hair on Kadcyla, Kadcyla doesn't have the neuropathy risk of Taxol, most women find it fairly easy to tolerate, and it would let her save Taxol to try again when she really needs it. Staying on Herceptin and adding Xeloda (oral chemo) is another alternative that wouldn't be as drastic as Taxol. Unless her mets are growing fast or causing her problems, I would hold off as long as possible before retrying Taxol. But that's just my personal feelings.",

IBC infiltrates the lymph vessels of the breast which is what causes the symptoms. It would also be unusual to have pain in a breast that has no other symptoms. You could request a skin punch biopsy for peace of mind, but sometimes a rash is just a rash or it could be something altogether different. Pain in your left chest that radiates down your left arm is serious and should be checked out because that's the warning sign of a heart attack.",
