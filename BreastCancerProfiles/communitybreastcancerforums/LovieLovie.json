Not that it will happen but just be aware.  Any fresh foods that may contain bacteria are a no, no at that point.  I always kept some cans of peaches etc. in the pantry because there aren't a lot of fresh fruits on the list.  As soon as my counts were back up I went back to a normal diet.  I hope I'm not adding too much stuff.  I just want you all to be successful.  With all the money you will be saving on shampoo and conditioner may I suggest getting a bottle of Neutrogena body oil for your shower.  Just put it on while your wet at the end of your shower.  It saved me from drying up and blowing away.  Chemo is very drying to your skin and it will help you manage that.  People will notice how clear your skin is at the end (bonus!).",

LongIsland- Great attitude!  Everyone lives in the here & now, they just don't realize it like we do.  You will have such an appreciation for life when your done with this and that's the gift you will have that others don't.  2 things with neulasta or neupogen, ask the nurse to warm the vial up first with their hands, it only stings when it goes in cold.  I had almost no bone pain.  It made me want to stretch my legs.  I never took Claritin or anything else.  Everyone is different so don't just hear the worst stories and think that is going to be how your body is going to react.  If you are inclined to stay on top of your own treatment, keep an eye on 2 numbers from your CBC and that is your white blood cell count WBC and red blood cell count RBC.  1 neupogen shot would bring my WBC way up but sometimes I would need 2.  I would schedule 3 and cancel that last one if I didn't need it and my MO was ok with that as she knew we were both watching the numbers and was ok with me getting only what I needed.  IF your RBC count drops you will feel puny and the only control you have on it is to keep your protein level high.  Hope that helps cuz I'm all about helping you gals.",

You'll get some great looks from your teenagers.  When your hair comes back in and you have a different style then you did the last 10 yrs+ somehow that becomes cool too.  See, something to look forward to.  Soft hugs to all ",

I realized while I was walking back to the barn near the end of treatment that I felt like I was 100 years old because I had to stop at least 3 times to catch my breath but told myself I was just 'visiting' OLD.  I had to quit scooping poop and tried not to invite trouble.    Ladies, there will be some really good things when you are done with all this.  Like how soft your hair is when it comes back in, how good your complexion is, how good everything taste and how you will never take for granted having energy again!      ",

SE's are all manageable.  Your chemo nurses should have a handout for your particular chemo that can help.  Just don't let them get really bad without asking for help.  This forum is 24/7 too.  Trust me, someone has gone thru your problem (fill-in the blank).  Lovebeingnana - May I suggest you start a thread for your syndrome and go to school off of others with the same thing.  Its worth a shot and it may take away some of the worry.  Now is the time to be nice to yourself.  A little cruising for the next year (no big projects).  What an amazing support group you are!  My best to all of you. This won't be fun, but you can do it.   ",

Chemo nurses are really special people.  Did everyone get emla/lidocaine ( prescription ) cream?  You put it on well before they access your port and it really helps. No need to hurt!  What hurts is pulling off the industrial strength bandaids they use afterwards.  I always asked for gauze & tape.  You will be amazed at the amount of 'normal' looking people that are there...just getting treatment and living their lives.   I worked (just less) and played (more).  Make someone close to you in charge of scheduling 1 fun thing to do each week.  I have a good friend who did this.  Sometimes we would go to the movies, out to lunch or gold panning (in my ratty/frizzy blonde wig perfect for the river ha!). ",

For those of you with sensitive scalps- get the softest and most seamless sleep cap you can find and a silky/satin pillowcase for the nights you don't need your cap.  General knowledge is that while chemo can make you feel tired and crummy so can a low rbc count.  A low wbc count won't. You probably won't know until someone tells you.  If you are low on platelets my Mo considers 25-30 low, you should not be taking ibuprofen which aggravates low platelets.  I watch these 3 numbers on every blood draw result.    Low rbc  = eat more protein low wbc = booster shots plus stay away from sick people and avoid infection. I missed Thanksgiving with my husbands extended family because there were going to be others who were getting over illnesses and I just couldn't risk it.  It was hard but I stayed on track and that was really important.  I used it as a time to start my Christmas shopping online :-) If you have ever heard that no one cares about you money more that you, well, no one cares about your health more than you.  Trust your health professionals but verify!  ",
