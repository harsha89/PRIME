Macrocyclic agents are thought to be safer. The European authorities recently recommended that certain linear agents be banned: https://gadoliniumtoxicity.com/2017/03/12/ema-reco... I have had eight breast MRIs (all at AMI in Bozeman, Montana) and seven of them were with linear agents. For my last MRI I asked AMI to use a macrocyclic agent instead and, after much hemming and hawing, they finally agreed. I have been tested (at Mayo) and determined to have elevated levels of gadolinium so my neurologist has recommended that I not have any contrast MRIs unless absolutely necessary. My breast surgeon agrees. I would also suggest that when making your decision you talk to a medical professional who does not have an ownership interest in the MRI machine. MRIs are a huge source of revenue so don't assume that an imaging center or radiologist has only your best interests at heart. I can also tell you that MRIs are not always accurate. After a year of neoadjuvant therapy I had an MRI before surgery that showed no evidence of cancer. In fact, I had 2.2cm of residual disease. As MTwoman said, there are risks and benefits to consider. Good luck. ",
