I have found it hard to talk face to face to people, but as a writer and blogger have found this the most therapeutic way of off-loading. If you are interested the url is on my homepage link. Just be aware it's personal and my own experiences. They won't be the same as yours. It will also log good and bad days, humour and the darker days. Most of all it will be honest! ",
