I held my ground and the pathology showed more DCIS in the affected breast and LCIS in the unaffected breast. The GS said isn't it good WE did both breasts. Do what is right for you and stand by your decision.",

My PS says nerves rattled in that space and just keep massaging the area and you will eventually desensitize the skin. I do that 2-3 times a day with Aveno moisturizer and at 4 weeks since surgery it us getting better but not gone. She assures me it will go away. Finding much better arm movement as it got closer to a month out. She has me just walking my fingers up the wall but no other arm exercising. HUGS. Kathi",

Fortunately a NP friend who does a lot of Woman's Health told me to consider BMX and not the lumpectomy and radiation. I chose BMX with sentinel node biopsy on the involved breast and in the end the uninvolved breast had LCIS to the surgeons surprise. At first he didn't want to do both and then he was glad he did, all of this with a negative MRI. That ended the worry. Good luck and remember to be the patient this time and let them take care of you. Kathi",

I don't have any pain in my arms and I am only taking Tylenol and valium as needed because I could not tolerate the narcotic. It does take a good week to feel anywhere near normal. I can feel the edges of the expander but all these feelings are new and tolerable. Good luck to all the ladies who are feeling all these new feelings on top of coming to grips with a diagnosis of BC. We are strong, we cry, we laugh, and we keep moving forward. HUGS to all. Kathi",

After four and a half weeks I am going back to work tomorrow and still feel it may be too early. Your pain needs to be managed even if it means taking your Percocet as prescribed and slowly backing off to Tylenol. Why don't you call about that swelling which also may be related to being too active, and ask for something to help you sleep. That, and healthy eating, are super important. Hope you are napping during the day to make up for your lost sleep. Stay in touch. Gentle hugs... Kathi",
