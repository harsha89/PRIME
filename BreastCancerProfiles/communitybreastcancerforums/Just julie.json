I am stopping by the boards actually looking for advice for a family member and thought I would check in on my favorite board.  To all of my beautiful sisters going through or just finishing up treatments, my heart is with each of you.  If you read my bio and it seems I can be of any help in any way, feel free to PM me. STAY STRONG!!! WE are survivors!!! Julie",
