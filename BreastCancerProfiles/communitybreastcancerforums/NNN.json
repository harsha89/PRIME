At the end of the day, the 15% reduction of the recurrence is out of 100 women at the same range of risk but, when you calculate it out of the survival rate (overall  rate) it will be much less depends on each case, in my case it will add up a 1.5% better survival rate where as I might face 1% leukemia and possible ??%  neuropathy and ??% infections...etc...I rather live a better quality life for 10 years than live with pain and sickness for the rest of my life which might be 10 years as well. Some one might say well, what if all the side effects were temporarily ?? well what if the recurrence never happened?? At the end of the day, it's a struggle to decide. I hope and pray every day that my oncotype results come as low risk so I don't have to struggle any more with any treatment..and I wish that all of us find peace and guidance from the lord so we can enjoy few moments in life...Amen!! ",
