I have recently convinced myself ive got breast cancer (again) my anxiety overbreast cancer started 2 years ago when i found a lump in my left breast i went to the doctors and everything was fine,couple of days later the lump was gone but the worrying started as did the increased checking of my breasts. June last year i found a lump in my rright breast which started to hurt,more from the poking and squeezing it took me almost a month to ho the doctors as i scared my self stupid with the help of my good friend google. The doctor checked it and said it wad fine but seeing how anxious i was he referred me to the breast clinic i had an appointment for 2 weeks later it rearranged 3 times and ended up being 8 weeks later had clear ultrasound etc so left happy an couple of days later the lump was gone but since then i constantly stress and check my breasts. I managed to stop for a while but then in october my grandad died suddenly and it started again which brings me to 4 weeks ago when my period came along with tender breasts and i constantly started poking and prodding and a week after my period i started to notice that every so often when i poked and prodded my left breast it hurt a little (like pressing on a bruise) but not every time like i could poke an it hurt but few seconds later prod again and it didn't. I went on google to see what it could ne and obviously cancer was main thing that came up and so the worrying increased. i just want to know if this could be cancer? symptoms are: pain every so often when pressed an d redness that comes and goes every so often.....my husband says as long as he's known me (10years) i always get redness there every now and again. i have no lumps in breast or armpit and no swollen lymphnodes I'm 27 no family history of bc sorry for rambling thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",
