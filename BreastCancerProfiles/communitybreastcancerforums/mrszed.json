    "Content": "mrszed wrote: I found a small (pea-sized, maybe slightly larger) hard, immobile lump in my right breast a few days ago. It doesn't hurt at all, just discovered it during my monthly self-exam. My background: I am 23 years old, survivor of stage IV kidney cancer, had radiation to my chest at the age of 4 and have breast hypoplasia due to that (my breasts did not grow but I do have some breast tissue). I have submuscular implants now. I have never found a lump before. Breast cancer does not run in my family however with my personal cancer history as well as my radiation treatment, I am super paranoid. How do I know if it warrants going to a doctor? Should I wait a few weeks and see if it grows or goes away? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
