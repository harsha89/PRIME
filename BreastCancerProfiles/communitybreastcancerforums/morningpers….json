I doubt mine were related to anything breast cancer-related; this was three years ago and my bone marrow issues have gotten much better. Are you still having periods? If so, are they heavy? Another cause for the bleeding issue could be a liver problem. I do think you need to go to the doctor to get this checked out.",

Other things that might cause the bleeding under the skin are blood thinning medication, excess vitamin E, fish oil, ginko biloba, vitamin k deficiency, anemia, drug reaction, aspirin, nsaids, and lots of other supplements. A few years ago, I noticed that I was bruising and bleeding profusely from any little cut, and my menstrual periods were horrendous. After looking at all my supplements, I realized that the body scrub I was using had 2% salicylate-which is aspirin! I used so much on my skin, that a lot got absorbed and was causing the blood clotting issues! So, the bleeding under the skin can be caused by something very simple and easy to correct. Here's an article on blood-thinning supplements and foods: http://www.livestrong.com/article/484181-herbs-minerals-vitamins-that-reduce-blood-clotting/",

One thing that I've really held onto during this waiting process is to really \"own\" the phrase, \"it's not cancer until they say it is.\" It might be cancer, it might not; my lump is fairly large and I have armpit involvement too, but I'm not going to accept cancer until I absolutely have to. I know this is outright denial; but don't knock it as a coping mechanism.  I've also taken long walks when possible; taken yoga class every day this week, and really just tried to live my life as if the lump doesn't exist. I also try to thing of the ladies on this forum who have been where we are, sometimes several times; for me it helps to know we are not alone. I have an 8 year-old son; I know exactly how you feel. Hope this helps even a little bit.",

And excellent point, Wallycat; there are several types of cancer that do not show up well on mammogram or ultrasound; ILC is one of those types of CA; when it does show up, it can mimic a benign mass. Even if they say it's a cyst, I am going to try to get it removed and biopsied, even if I have to pay out of pocket to do so.",

My uncle is still alive; I do not know if he has had any type of cancer; I've just made contact with him after many years. My sister has has not had any known cancers, although she is a walking train-wreck health-wise. So, my brca risk is extremely small; but I think it was well worth thinking through the family history. Good thing I've stayed thin, fit, and sober; in my family the genetics for heart disease and substance abuse are much more concerning than risk for inheriting brca's, lol.",
