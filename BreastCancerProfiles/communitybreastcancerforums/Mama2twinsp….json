I have been on Ibrance for 6 full cycles now. Last PET I had gone from 12 spots in my liver down to 3!! I had to have my gallbladder out 2 months ago, and one of the spots had started spreading from liver to gallbladder, so the surgeon cut it out. I was relieved to here another one down. My tumor markers went down, but by only a point this month. The ups and downs of this new world are sure hard. Like you ladies above, I have young children I want so much to be here for. My kids are 6, 4,4, and my baby will be 3 next week. My daughter lost her first tooth this week, it was strangely very emotional for me. I think for the most part, I live in daily denial. I feel good, still working, raising 4 kids, with twins and kids so close together I have been really tired for years, so used to fatigue. But then one of my babies hits a milestone, and it really throws me. They are too little to really understand what is going on, so I try really hard to make our days as normal as possible, which in turn helps me I think. Hopefully get scan results today or tomorrow. Wishing all of you ladies a beautiful day!! Alissa",

My sister has been my best friend for years, ,my cheerleader during IVF treatments and by my side through babies, but recently, no where to be seen, hard to get a hold of, as is my dad. My mom says they just can't deal, don't know what to say or how to react. Then I have had casual friends step forth and be my biggest support. The hubby is in total denial, won't even discuss the what if's. I would talk to your loved one and explain the hurtful comment and be honest with how it made you feel, if he loves you, he won't want to be the person causing you pain.

I usually bring my youngest(3) little guy to my appointments, I think it helps my nurse and onc to visualize me as a mother to very young kids and to know how much I am needed. My husband made bracelets when I was first diagnosed, just the little rubber ones, and we gave them to every dr and specialist we saw, and just asked them to put them somewhere they might see them often and to remember me and my family and any possible thoughts or ideas they might have that would help. I did consult with my onc last week about the different SUV values on the 3 spots in my liver, and you guys were right. She thinks it is probably test/reading error and that she considers it a stable scan. I felt immense relief. I know the anxiety will start building again in a few weeks, but for now I will take the break. I hope everyone here is doing well. I am off to catch up on all the posts I have missed!!! Alissa",

She thinks my primary breast tumor is still responding to Ibrance, but the liver mets are no longer because its possible they have lost their hormone receptors!!! I am having a well fought for lumpectomy tomorrow. I thought she would cancel it, but she said new studies she has seen shows sometimes taking the primary makes the mets less aggressive. Then the next day I will be having a biopsy to test and see if they are now triple negative or have picked up HER2. I am on only letraxole right now, which is freaking me out too. Once surgery/biopsy are healed from I will do 8 weeks of Ibrance with Faslodex added in, though she told is she doesn't have much faith this will work. By then we will have new info to use. I am a mess and have not slept much since hearing all of this. Babs and Gramen and anyone else who needs it, sending love and hugs your way!! ALissa",

She had 3 clinical trials in mind for me. The first one was quickly rejected. It was the only one targeted and the newly found Androgen, but was only in safety ie phase 1. The other 2 we are considering right now. The one called TRINITI-1 does not open up until 01/20. It is ribocib plus another AI. It seemed she favored that one. The other is the SOLAR-1 trial that you need to have the pik3 mutation for. The testing for that could take 1-3 weeks. I have already been off treatment for 5 weeks after Ibrance failure and then the lumpectomy and liver biopsy. I meet with my regular oncologist tomorrow and hopefully will get some answers. I threw it out on one of the fb support groups and found 3 people on ribocib doing well, so that helped me get some sleep last night!!! I hope everyone else is doing well today! Hugs, Alissa",

PET scan that week showed little spots in the liver, but nowhere else in the body, so here I am. I had ovary removal 1 month ago and just (today) finished my first Ibrance + Femara cycle. I think it will help me to read back and get some more info for liver mets so I can see what I am up against! I am so new to the bc world, this has been quite the journey allready! I hope everyone is doing well, thanks in advance for allowing me to join you!",

I am on Ibrance 125/Femara and this scan was done at the end of 3 months. I was really worried because my tm's just kept rising. But scans are in and the results are good!! I started with 10+ liver mets and now only have 3! They noted the mass in my breast to be \"significantly\" improved and the lymph nodes in that side are no longer lighting up!! It was so nice to finally get some good news for the first time since dx 4 months ago. So back onto Ibrance for another 3 cycles(I hope). They wrote us a referral to a hospital in WA for a liver consult?? Anyway, I wanted to share my news and let you know I think/pray for you all daily!  Alissa",

I had my PET yesterday and heard the word progression for the first time. I have been on Ibrance/Femara since 09/15 and it is no longer working. The 3 liver mets I had now have tons of company. Luckily it didn't spread anywhere else, but I am devastated. I see my onc on Wednesday and we will discuss a plan. I know we had talked about Xeloda before. I hope everyone is doing ok and hopefully I will get a handle on myself come Wednesday!! Oh, and I had a liver biopsy at diagnosis, it was very uneventful also!! Alissa",

I saw my regular oncologist to see what she thought about this upcoming trial. I specifically asked if they were hopeful this cousin of Ibrance would work after my 16 month run on Ibrance ended. She said that is why they are doing the trial. They are not sure. But the 2 drugs they are pairing it with would have been on the list somewhere for me to take, so we are just moving them up in order, at least this is how it was explained to me. They really don't know. I think they have hope. I had a CT saturday and will have a bone scan tomorrow while they comb through my medical records. My babies are IVF babies and I think some of the meds I took are causing them to dig a little deeper. I should get some results today, I hope! Mom-I am glad to hear Dani seems stable, you are such a great support to her!! LMWL- glad to hear you are getting a new liver biopsy, I just did and that's when I found out I was also AR positive., There is a trial out, but it is too early phase, but coming! Xeloda was also on my onc's list to try with me. It seems like it has great effects on liver. To everyone else I have missed, I hope everyone is doing well and feeling good! Alissa",

I also was prescribed a mouthwash which seems to be helping. I go back 14 days for blood work and then will scan at the 2 month mark. I asked if it would work after failing Ibrance and was told they just don't know yet. I am nervous, but happy to get moving on another treatment option. I hope everyone is well! Alissa",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2018 08:52AM - edited Apr 4, 2018 09:03AM by Mama2twinsplus2 Babs, your family is just beautiful! Thank you for sharing the picture. I had scans that showed slight progression last week(ct scans) and a mammogram Monday that showed the possible return of my original tumor that was removed via lumpectomy 12/16. With this new news I will be switching from X to either a trial or Affinitor+faslodex plus now leaning towards y-90 before TASE. The trial that Huntsman has right now is only a phase 1, so that makes me nervous. It is a prolactin trial that uses that protein to bond to chemo(not sure which ones are in trial) and another that targets HER2 equivocal, which I am. So meeting with the trial coordinator later this week. I am sad to move from Xeloda and confused why the ct scans never showed anything in the breast, it took a mammo to find. I will let you guys know what I find out. Thanks to everyone that has shared their y-90 experience, makes me feel much more prepared. Z, so sorry you are having a rough go right now. I feel much like you do at the moment without a solid plan and many decisions ahead of me. Hugs to all you ladies. I will leave you with a pic of my greatest joy and the reason why I fight so hard! Alissa ",
