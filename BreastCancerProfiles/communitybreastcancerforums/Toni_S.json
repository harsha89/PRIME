Also, for those who have done it, is it fasting one day before, day of chemo, and one day after? Or is it fasting two days before and the day of chemo. Can\u2019t seem to find a straight answer on that. Thanks for any feedback. I\u2019m starting chemo next week Dx 4/20/2011, ILC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 12/18/2018, ILC, Right, 1cm, 1/21 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Field will include supraclavicle nodes as well. I am fortunate to live near a hospital that offers it and that my insurance will cover it. I am told it is more precise and less damaging to surrounding tissues than traditional radiation",

I opted for lumpectomy and radiation only as treatment. Eight years later I am now dealing with a recurrence in one axillary lymph node. Whether having chemo 8 years ago would have prevented that is unknown. But everyone\u2019s experience is unique and I know many women who have skipped chemo with an intermediate score who are fine after many years. Whatever you decide, just make sure you have confidence in your decision and your doctor. We are all justplaying the odds, so much is unknown with this disease.",

      "Content": "Feb 24, 2019 11:14AM - edited Feb 24, 2019 11:17AM by Toni_S SadlyNew2018,I had lumpectomy and radiation in 2011, and then 5 years of Arimidex. The recurrence was found quite by accident. I had a CT scan of the chest to diagnose pneumonia in November of this year, and a very sharp radiologist who looked at my breast cancer history noted as an incidental finding that an axillary lymph node was slightly enlarged, and I mean very slightly, like 1 mm larger than would be considered normal. He recommended follow up and after biopsy the lymph node tested positive for ILC, same cancer as in 2011. It was not palpable on physical exam, and mammograms don't reach the axillary lymph nodes, so all my mammograms were normal. My Oncologist said it would have been a year or longer before it got big enough to be found on my annual physical exam. Fortunately all my scans were clear, there was no distant metastasis. I had an axillary dissection and will have 4 rounds of chemo followed by 5 weeks of radiation to the axilla since that wasn't radiated in 2011. Ultrasound is the only way to screen for this type of recurrence, but it's never done, just mammograms. Don't quiteunderstand why.",
