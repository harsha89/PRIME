I was diagnosed with dcis in may, lumpectomy in June and radiation scheduled for July. Have been pushing for bi mast but keep getting told this is too aggressive. I find out today if I will need rad even if mastectomy due to dirty deep margins. Anyone else decide on mast when lump and rad recommended? I'm scared of sneaky cells creeping around!! Want to evict these bad tenants! Haha",
