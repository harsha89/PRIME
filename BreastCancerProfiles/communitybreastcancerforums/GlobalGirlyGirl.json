IDC at this point, Stage II based on the size 3.6 cm). I was able to see a breast cancer nurse who will be the \"navigator\" on Wednesday. She scheduled my appointments for next week. Surgeon, then oncologist, then radiologist, and plastic surgeon if necessary. After the diagnosis, I was just annoyed. Still am. Really irritated.  I happen to be Bipolar I as well. After being stable, I just went through a hypomanic episode in Dec and Jan followed by depression. My meds were adjusted. It took a couple months, but I'm OK now.  Then this crap. These boards are super cool though. It helped me prepare for the diagnosis when I received the ultrasound and mammogram results. I hadn't gotten the results of the core needle biopsy, but the ultrasound said, Bi-RADS 5. When I Googled it, these boards came up, and I learned all about it (and the 95% chance). When the doctor called me, I said, \"Well, I figured.\" I've gone from \"Screw it I won't do anything and just let nature take its course\" to \"OK, lumpectomy (if it's an option), but not of that radiation crap.\" Then \"OK maybe radiation, but no chemo.\" All over the place. Honestly, I don't want to fight it. I mean no offense to those who are fighting it will all they have. I am just tired. The only reason I am going to, is for my partner, family, and dog. I was thinking of doing more alternative stuff after surgery to replace radiation and/or chemo. That would just make everyone sad - my partner, especially.  I don't know. I'm venting. Anyway, I hope everyone has a nice holiday weekend. bipolarwithatwistofcancer.com \"Sometimes life's hell. But hey! Whatever gets the marshmallows toasty.\" ~J.

My lungs are clear. It's my asthma that's acting up! Really? I haven't had an episode in 2 years, and it decides to act up now? I have been prescribed oral steroids, Advair, Mucinex DM, cough syrup with codeine so I can actually get some sleep. Ugh!!  I hope this all works. If the coughing is still too bad on Monday, we have to reschedule.  bipolarwithatwistofcancer.com \"Sometimes life's hell. But hey! Whatever gets the marshmallows toasty.\" ~J.
