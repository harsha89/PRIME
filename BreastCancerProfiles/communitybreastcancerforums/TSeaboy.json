Stage 4, metaplastic, metastasized to the lymph nodes and liver by the time it was discovered. My sister was tested for 19 panels. Why does the grandmother cause more worries? The odds of genetics vs. coincidence?",

However, I have read a lot of stories about negative test results but families of a mom and multiple sisters getting breast cancer. I understand there are very many genes we know nothing about. My question.. With a history of an immediate sister and a paternal great grandmother diagnosed with breast cancer and the negative test results - what's the best next step? Vigilant mammograms (scheduled already)/breast exams? Just wondering \"what would you do\"s. Log in to post a reply",
