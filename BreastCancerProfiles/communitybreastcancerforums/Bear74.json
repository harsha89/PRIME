Lymph nodes in left armpit are very swollen and past few days I've noticed that my bra causing discomfort on the underside of left breast. Paranoid isn't the word for it. As if to make matters worse my husband has taken Thursday off work \"just in case\"! As worried as I am, I haven't told him I am, so now that I know that he is just as worried, makes me worse! Does that make sense? Sorry, venting on your post! I really hope what you have turns out to be nothing serious. Take care.",

Nothing showed up on the mammogram. I have to back in one year. To say I'm relieved is an understatement! I have gone crazy with worry the past two weeks. The best thing about all of this is it has made me more aware of my body and I will be checking myself monthly. Bryona, I wish you a speedy recovery through this. Thank you for being there! Zennurse I am hoping everything turns out to be fine with you, good luck with your appointment.",

Barely slept last night and now it's the night before my mammogram and us and I'm trying to distract myself. Jerry Maguire on tv keeping me busy! Lol I am so tired but relieved that it is finally the night before and I can get this over and done with tomorrow one way or the other. I will no doubt be on here either way. Thanks again. :)",
