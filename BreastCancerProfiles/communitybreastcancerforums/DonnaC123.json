Falconer, Greenspun came highly recommended by my breast surgeon but I am on Medicare and he doesnt take it. I met with another PS here in CT and did not like him at all. Geez, this process is so arduous. You could spend your life going to these PS's. Would love your opinion friends. I am leaning heavily towards doing mastectomy only, no recon, on right side. I just want to get better and move on with my life( I am 64, my husband retired last year and we just want to travel.) I am thinking, if I want reconstruction at a later date, I can do it. I have lived with a prosthesis for 2 yrs because my 1st lumpectomy was on smaller breast anyway.(I have had a large B cup and C cup my whole life). I barely ever wore the prosthesis because it just didnt bother me to be lopsided. When I wore a sweater or nice dress I wore it. I am retired and wear loose, hippie kinda clothes anyway. Now that I have had 2 lumpectomies, my breast is so small compared to my larger breast, it is not much farther to go for a mastectomy. I am not vain and have discussed this with my husband and doctors and they seem onboard with my decision. I am just getting scared because my MO's here in CT and my breast surgeon said my last lumpectomy was April 21 and they think I should be doing chemo or surgery by now. They said, standard of care dictates treatment 4-6 weeks after surgery. I had been waiting for the second opionions from MO at MSK. I then waited for appts with PS's which I just got last week. Would love to hear opinions on doing mastectomy only with NO reconstruction, at least not immediately. Also, so many women do double mastectomy...am struggling with that decision of one vs both. thanks, Donna",

I live in CT and have had 2 lumpectomies at Greenwich Hosp with a great surgeon there. I am now looking at mastectomy for a local recurrence and will be choosing between Greenwich Hosp or Memorial Sloan Kettering. I need the name of a reconstruction surgeon who you may have used and liked at either hospital. Thanks so much and please excuse my new user errors.
