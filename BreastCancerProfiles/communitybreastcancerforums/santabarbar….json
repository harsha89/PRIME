In my case, it worked incredibly fast-- I could feel it happening even on on chemo #1. I could feel my tumor very easily, as it was located not too deep. A day or two after my first chemo, I felt a strong fizzy sensation in the area of the tumor. Not painful but strong and maybe a second or two long. It made me think to feel the tumor, and when I did I could tell immediately it was smaller! I had a friend with me and she had asked to feel my tumor a few days earlier, so I made her feel it too and we could both feel the distinct difference. Thereafter I could feel it getting smaller and smaller as treatment went on: from a walnut in the shell, to a large almond, to small almond, to a lentil. By chemo #4 I could not feel it at all, and neither could my MO. I think they give it about 3 cycles to see how the tumor is responding. Some tumors take longer to respond but still do. The whole point of neo-adjuvant chemo is being able to gauge the response of the tumor to chemo, so if you have a situation like pesky's they can switch you to something better.",

For example, in some cases they prefer to start chemo to shrink the tumor, then do surgery (this happened for me and I got away with a small lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy due to the shrinkage. An MRI can show aspects that a mammo and US cannot show so they generally want all three. You have not posted the grade of the cancer (1,2,or 3) and other details that can influence the order of things but that should all become clear in the next week or so. One of the things that is highly irritating about Cancer treatment is the amount of times you need to push people and be your own advocate to move things along. For me it was like I was the only one feeling urgency! Maybe the urgency was nerves but it felt like one thing I could do to help myself was move things along as rapidly as possible. For example, getting on the surgeon's calendar before every detail was known so that t did not fill up in the meanwhile. Another thing that helped me psychologically was to eat a very clean healthy veggie-heavy diet with no crap and no alcohol, and to consult an integrative doc to advise me on supplements, complimentary practices, etc. The MD I consulted with (Dr Keith Block) has a book called \"Life Over Cancer\" that has a lot of info based on validated scientific knowledge of practices that reduce recurrence. For one example, many BC patients have low vitamin D status, and bringing it up is correlated with better outcomes. Melatonin is something to use for sleep that also has anti-cancer properties. There are a lot of little things you can do with diet and exercise to assist yourself in getting a better outcome.",

That is just one example. I found a study about anesthesiology practices that are less or more correlated with metastases, and called my anesthesiologist to inquire about what his methods were prior to surgery and made sure he would give me the right stuff. I have been a better advocate for myself with Dr Google helping me. I think the problem is BAD googling, when people do not know how to refine the dates of a search, and look up outdated info, or old stats, or when people can't tell the difference between a BS article and valid science from the NIH. It is not helpful to be misinformed, but it is also not helpful to be UN-informed. I have encountered women on this site who are very uninformed about their own situation. It can be detrimental when one has rose colored glasses on, even if that may be less stressful. TNBC (my form of cancer) is a beast and it is good to know what one is up against and what practices might help. ",

And now I have TNBC. 2 treatments down and 4 to go. Basals look pinker, rougher, shinier or a litlle raw. One of mine was a little growth that was a bit like a mole but not brown, just skin colored. The squamous cancer was like a pimple that would not heal. I grew up in California and have had a ton of sun exposure. Most of my cancer on L side or face and L arm (driving exposure). My understanding is that Basal Cell Cancer is NOT life threatening. Squamous is a bit more serious, but it's melanoma that's the potential killer. I am a DES daughter. DES (diethylstilbesterol) was a synthetic estrogen they used to give in the 1950's and 60's to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage. My Mom took it when pregnant w me. Anyone else here exposed to DES, or exposed to other endocrine disrupter? Zero cancer in my family tree, and lots of 90 year olds. I had genetic testing and it came up with a variant on TP53... but NOT the known bad one. A different one of \"uncertain significance.\"",

The main thing to make sure of is that the article you are reading is recent (last year or so) and from a good source. I am also triple negative. I have had an excellent response to chemo and just had a lumpectomy last week. Waiting for pathology this week. While I really like and respect my oncologist, there are a lot of valuable things I found out from Google, not from my oncologist. I think every patient is different, and doctors respond to what you present to them... Some say \"you are stage 3A\" and some don't even mention stage unless you ask them. I like knowing the brutal truth and I like knowing it up front. I like knowing what I am facing. I am a good nerdy researcher and i am good at synthesizing what I read and I would rather be prepared. When you know there are not a lot of followups beyond chemotherapy, you will get stronger in your resolve to do everything possible RIGHT NOW. It makes you tougher during chemo and more focused. The GOOD news about TNBC is that if you knock it down, it VERY OFTEN stays down. If you get a complete response from chemo, you have a very good chance of dying of something else decades from now. If you are cancer free 5 years after treatment, it is very unlikely to ever come back. That is something pretty rare in cancer! The initial chemo also tends to work the best on TNBC and kill it. You have a lot of control over lifestyle habits that can help or hurt you. You can eat a clean, low carb diet free of sugar and alcohol, you can exercise intensely, take supplements, etc-- all this will strengthen your body and benefit you. I strongly recommend consulting with an integrative or naturopathic MD who is experienced at supporting a person going through chemo... and who knows the nutritional tricks that will help... like Magnesium at bedtime for constipation... There is a book called Life Over Cancer, by Dr Keith Block in Chicago, with a wealth of information. I fasted (fasting-mimicking diet) prior to every chemo because it reduces SEs and fortifies the immune system... and I found out about that on Google. I took Metformin and melatonin (thanks, Google). I ate vegan-heavy ketogenic (w/ low animal products), I took hyperbaric oxygen, and did infrared saunas, and used heat on my tumors intermittently (hyperthermia). These practices are all complimentary to the chemo and can weaken your cancer (making it more vulnerable to chemo) and chip away at recurrence rates. Most physicians do not mention these practices. When I asked my MO to prescribe metformin, he agreed readily, knowing that it was a validated benefit-- and I thought, hey, how come you did not suggest this??? I think an informed consumer does a better job of helping herself! I wish you all the best with your treatment and will be hoping for a complete response to chemo for you!",

Dr Block's approach is to make chemo more effective and safer, and to make the body inhospitable to cancer, using things that have scientific validation (if not always a double blind clinical trial). He has collaborators from MD Anderson and other \"top drawer\" cancer people... He was open to doxycycline and mebendazole when I asked him about them, but as I had a pCR by the time of those discussions, trying them did not seem to be urgent, and I wanted my body to have a rest from meds and recover a bit. I may yet do them though. I am also considering an AR blocking drug, as my tumor was very AR+. My local MO was ok with giving me a Prostate cancer drug off label for this but again, felt there were risks to the drug and would not recommend it for someone NED. I do know that there are likely to be some stray cells in my system and I want to plan my next moves should they be necessary. It seems like everyone needs to make their own risk/benefit analysis... If my outcome had been worse I would be trying all these ideas but I do not want to overmedicate myself, either... Esp not with chemos that can damage my heart, etc. I am pretty comfortable with an antibiotic or a de-wormer as I have actually taken one long ago when my toddler got pinworms and we had to treat the whole family.

He also innovates w chemo delivery, dripping it in over a day or two instead of an hour or two, and \"pulsing\" the drip to coincide with circadian rhythms of the body and the cancer. I tried to mimic this, by splitting my chemo into getting the Taxotere in early am and Carboplatin in the late afternoon, but that was the best I could do in my home area. I only consulted with Dr Block as I do not live in Chicago.... but I found a naturopathic physician in my town who gave me the IVs and did my terrain panels. (Her recommendations were very similar to Dr Block's...) I also take 20 mg melatonin at night and 1000 mg of metformin (500 am/ 500 pm) and a baby aspirin, as well as 5000 IU of D3 prescribed by my MO. I did this all through chemo too. The dose I am taking of curcumin is 6000 mg/day which is 8 pills of 750 mg (4 in am/4 in pm). **Which is a blood thinner, at this dose, FYI...** The others are pretty normal doses of 1-2 pills per day, with 4 capsules of EGCG. He recommends a close-to-macrobiotic diet with veggies, nuts, seeds, complex carbs, and berries/fruit (2 servings/day) with cold water fish as the main animal food. He had me use whey protein isolate as a protein supplement, \"super greens\" organic green juice powder, & reishi mushroom powder in my smoothies. He also had me do a lot of exercise, including interval training, during chemo... \"to give your heart the message that it needs to be in 'build' mode...\" No alcohol, no sugar, no simple carbs. I was already a meditator and not too stressed but part of the consult was mental/emotional self care too. The days of the C IV I would do hyperbaric Oxygen in the am, and go straight over for my IV C after. They enhance one another. I am pretty sure the C had an effect because I could feel some mild pain and a \"fizzing\" feeling in my tumor during and after the C drips. The idea is to make the system hardy, healthy, and inhospitable to cancer recurrence. Lowering inflammation and providing nutritional support to the immune system. My hometown MO was iffy about me doing all the antioxidants & IVs but could not argue with a rapidly shrinking tumor. I decided to do the nutritional & IV support because the evidence *against* it is poor and scanty, whereas Dr Block has a lot of anecdotal and clinical evidence among people in his practice who have had very good outcomes. MANY of his patients arrive in stage 4, very sick, when their doctors tell them there is nothing more to be done, and still they stay alive la lot longer than anyone would expect. In my case (I am 57) I had a few aches and pains that I thought were part of aging, prior to my diagnosis and prior to this nutritional program, that went away... which indicates that inflammation in my body went down under this regime. No more achy hip or knee. Honestly, I feel FANTASTIC. And I withstood chemo very well (no neuropathy, no nail issues, no mouth sores, etc.) Just sucky anemia as my main SE. I did fasting mimicking before each chemo and I also used a huge amount of heat (see \"hyperthermia\") on my tumor and lymph node. I kept a hot water bottle on it at very high heat (which left a mild magenta burn) for several hours per day a day or two prior to each chemo and during the chemo drips. If you can heat your cancer to ~109 for about 45 minutes, it dies, whereas healthy cells do not die from heat unless it is over 111. As I love a 105 degree hot tub, I have a sense of what 109 is.... This was not part of Dr Block's plan but something I did from my own research. Again, I decided it was not going to hut me and might help me. Prior to rads, I talked to the head of hyperthermia at UMD and he told me I had done myself a huge favor with the heat. With TNBC, a large high-grade tumor, and a cancerous 3cm lymph node, I felt I was in a very bad situation, statistically only a 30% likelihood of pCR, and I needed to throw the book at this cancer and do absolutely everything that might help (and would not hurt) me. I wanted to know that if my treatment was not successful or if I recurred, I could look my kids in the eye and say that I did my very, very best to survive. I plan to stay on my diet and supplements at least through the 3 year window of peak TNBC recurrence, and maybe forever. I am open to the fenben, doxycycline, and other off label ideas, even while still NED, so I am following this thread with great interest and hope!   ",

If you want a personalized program from Dr Block you can have your records sent to him and do a few tests he may need, and get a specific recommendation for you/your cancer. People do fly to Chicago for treatment... I found out about him from a friend in Santa Barbara who went to him for treatment (she was originally from Chicago and a family member had been treated there).",

      "Content": "May 20, 2019 10:23AM - edited May 20, 2019 10:24AM by santabarbarian I watched a one hour interview of Jane McClelland, by Chris (of Chris Beat Cancer).... I would not say she is against anti-oxidants at all. She took curcumin in high doses, revasterol, green tea, and I forget which others... I have ordered her book. Maybe she explains the timing of these vis a vis standard chemo better in the book, but she certainly endorsed these antioxidants in her talk. And each specific chemo is different. You can't infer a \"no antioxidants\" position from what she says. Maybe for her specific chemo, it was a no. Both the Fenben and the McClelland protocols seem similar in underlying logic, both are a combination of therapeutics to defeat the varied pathways that cancer cells need to live and self-replicate. McClelland emphasizes that the cancer cell starved of one kind of fuel will convert to using a different fuel, so its important to use a combo of substances that block a bunch of possible fuel pathways. Many of the recommended supplements have activity on multiple pathways of fuel. And it's important to know what kind of fuel your tumor likes. For example, Melanoma prefers fat as a fuel, over glucose. I am going to ask my MO to prescribe a course of mebendazole, doxycycline, celebrex, and a statin... I will see if he will. He did for the metformin I requested.... I think it has probably been good for me to \"rest\" my liver, etc, after chemo and rads, but I want to get out in front of the stem cells now if I can, before a recurrence. I am definitely pushing my MO to the far edge of his comfort zone but so far he's been very responsive to me. When I asked him for his argument against high dose C, he said \"needle sticks can introduce infection\" and after rolling my eyes, I said, \"that's a risk I am willing to take.\" Seems very low risk to take an antibiotic, a de wormer, a NSAID, and a statin. All very common drugs. Along with all my supplements, I still continue to do high dose C, which Jane M also did. I do a weekly session of Hyperbaric Oxygen followed by a C IV as a maintenance program, on the recommendation of my Naturopathic physician. HBOT also causes a rise in natural killer cells (it's an immune system booster). The methods that seem to work block several given pathways of cancer cell metabolism. It is not a matter of how it affects the *person's* system to take the antioxidant, it is a matter of how it affects the cancer stem cell's life cycle, and how well it blocks the various ways they originate and feed themselves.

Some *sidebar* activity of the antioxidant shuts down a survival pathway of the cancer stem cell. This is what makes an antioxidant relevant as a cancer-killer or cancer-weakener. Meanwhile it appears high doses of the best ones don't have negative SEs and don't screw up western medicine approaches either. Fabulous ratio of benefit to risk.",

I do the fasting-mimicking diet for 5 days before chemo (chemo being 5th day) = protects healthy cells, boosts immune system function, and stresses cancer cells. Ketogenic diet can also have these effects but it may depend on the specific kind of cancer. I eat 90% veggies and nuts with small amounts of fish, fruit, and healthy carbs. Zero sugar, wheat, white rice, white potato. Look up Valter Longo at USC, he developed it... I do not buy the premade stuff, I just count the carbs, calories, fat and protein and do his ratios. Magnesium citrate capsules (3 or 4 at bedtime) for constipation the week of the chemo. Colace w Senna is stronger if needed. Heating pad on belly when constipated for pain relief & digestion help (brings blood to area). IV muti-vitamin, IV glutathione, & IV vitamin C (high dose) in between my chemos. Dilutes that \"pollution\" feeling. Insomnia: work up slowly to 20mg melatonin at night. Can start w 3-5 mg. This helps you get sleepy AND it has anticancer properties. Take at the same time and expect to be very sleepy about 20-30 mins after you take it. I have been lucky re nausea. I begin my Zofran the day after chemo when I wake up, and take it every 8 hours for 3 days. That has worked for me to keep my nausea away so far. I found that over-exercising also made me nauseous (panting/breathlessness brought it on) so I am more careful about that. People who do a 30 minute walk daily (one one hour every 2nd day) have better response & fewer side effects, according to stats. Bad appetite... SUCKS to be starving w no appetite.... the only help I can give is have some tolerable foods in stock. My best ones: homemade vegetable soup w fresh ginger sliced into it, Tom Kah thai soup, Udon soup, Bone broth, Gazpacho. Sushi was soft & easy to eat, and wasabi helped me override the metallic taste in my mouth. I do a smoothie every am w a small amt of berries, nutmilk Kefir, cocoyo cocnut \"yoghurt,\" whey protein isolate, green juice powder, and reishi mushroom powder. This is tasty and easy w tons of probiotics to assist the digestive tract... If on taxotere: ice your hands and feet while getting infusion ( also can do ice chips in mouth) to avoid nerve pain. Good luck getting on top of those SEs!!   ",

Yes, he had a photo ID for me... but it still felt good. On my intake appointment a few weeks back, they made a foam mold for me to lie in so I am in the same position each time. They also did imaging to create forms for the beam to shape the areas that get radiated. When I got there, they took me right back, gave me a robe to keep and bring with me, showed me the forms (three of them) that would guide the beam, and asked me what music I wanted. Then they laid me down in the foam mold, positioned the beam, and did 4 or 5 zaps (very brief) with new setups for each one. It was over in about 20 mins. Then I saw my nurse and the RO. I meet with the RO once per week for the duration, which is nice. Feel free to ask me questions if proton rads are of interest to you!",

But Dr Google was how I found out about melatonin and Metformin, both of which I am on with my MO's hearty approval, as well as the current trend towards taking fewer nodes, and sometimes not even doing lumpectomy surgery after imaging shows a pCR-- which, when I brought it up with BS, allowed me to save all but 4 of my level one and two nodes (which she was poised to take). Dr Google let me in on Proton Radiation (which I just got), and provided a list of the less-metastatic anesthesiology drugs that I talked over w anesthesiologist prior to my surgery. It gave me info on Hyperbaric Oxygen and High Dose C and hyperthermia (heat) being cancer-killers, all of which I elected to use after informing myself. Also, a keto diet (with emphasis on vegan whole foods and fish, lower in animal fat). Last Dr Google told me a brief fast prior to chemo *might* lower my SEs and boost my response, as it does in mice (human trial in progress now). These were all significant parts of my treatment, that I advocated for or asked about, that my team approved. Had I not been Googling like a MF, I would not have asked the right questions and **none of this** would have been suggested to me. TNBC is a nasty cancer and I am glad for bringing in these other practices, alongside the chemo. I only had 30% odds of a pCR.... and I got one. Now I have 90% odds of staying well. If I did not vanquish the cancer, or If I should progress later, I want to be able to look my kids in the eye and say, I did absolutely everything I could do to benefit me-- I did my very best to live.",

You could do whatever surgery makes the most sense in the cancer breast, and see how you feel about the outcome. Then you could decide about the other breast based on that. There is absolutely no rush on the 2nd breast. In order to get a less invasive number of lymph nodes taken I agreed to get a second surgery if there was not a pCR. I would have been SO PISSED to wake up with no lymph nodes and then find out 5 days later that they did not need to be taken. I did get a pCR, so there was no need to go back for more nodes. I am very fond of my breasts and they are sensitive, and I was really happy to keep them, and to be able to get a lumpectomy plus Rads. I also told my surgeon, \"if you have to make a choice between appearance and sensation, please protect sensation.\" That was my biggest concern. If I had had to do a MX, I would have definitely kept my healthy breast. Some people are more or less body-aware... I am very body aware and I am pretty sure it would bug me to have an insensate fake breast. I have a semi-insensate finger (almost cut it off years ago) and it took ages for me to get used to it. Personally I would want to do what was medically intelligent and prudent, but no more than that. You need to know the chance of a recurrence in the other breast and weigh that against the chance of recurrence even if you get a double MX (which is not zero). If your cancer is low grade and you don't have a genetic issue that's very different than a high grade, involved nodes or BRCA+. It's great to weigh all your options, and think things through ahead of time. In this community there are women who have experienced all of the possibilities so whatever choice you make you will be fully informed! ",

BUT-- in my case, we knew there was cancer in at least one node when I was diagnosed, and a few others were enlarged at that time too. After chemo my MRI, mammo and US all showed zero cancer remaining, though the formerly-cancerous node was still enlarged. The current surgical protocol for people who have 4 nodes upon presentation is taking all level one and two nodes. But I pushed back a bit, because of the post chemo imaging being so good. (I did not want lymphedema!) I asked, how come # of nodes at presentation is the trigger of this surgery? Am I really in worse shape now than someone who only had two or three nodes upon presentation, but no pCR from chemo? She agreed with my thinking, and mentioned that all the protocols have gradually been changing in a less and less invasive direction... Our compromise was her taking the known bad node + 4 more likely nodes identified by the radioactive (sentinel) injection, and if there was any live cancer in any of it, I'd let her go back in and take them all. I agreed to that and got lucky with a pCR. I was SO HAPPY I had pushed back and had the less invasive surgery. And as it turned out, she only took 3 sentinel nodes as there was not a \"likely\" 4th and she did not want to dig around when she could see that everything looked consistent w pCR. The big node was dead, and upon path report it turned out I had dead cancer in just one of the 3 she took.",

Take a look at the work of Dr Valter Longo at USC. I did 5 days of \"fasting mimicking\" and had a very good response to chemo w few SEs. Did not take any anti-nausea drugs for the last 3 chemos, as I simply didn't need them. Fasting has the benefit of weakening cancer cells while fortifying healthy cells, on top of the benefits to SEs. You can do a search on this forum under my name and read other more detailed posts about it. Mostly you will hear \"eat whatever you want, have a milkshake if you want.\" Fasting is rarely mentioned but there is more and more clinical data, and several of us August chemo people had very good results doing it. -santabarbarian",

Socks with icepacks inside them, & freezable mittens, that worked great for me. I also used cold caps from amazon, that were designed for migraine sufferers. They do not stay cold that long so you need several to rotate, but I think they worked decently and were pretty cheap. I did not use the caps on chemo #1, and most of my hair did fall out, but I used them for chemos 2-6, and I have now got a solid five o'clock shadow of new hair all over my head-- only 2 weeks after my last chemo. I was concerned about maybe being one of the people whose hair does not grow back after Taxotere and I am happy to see that isn't the case. I think the cold caps were useful to reducing damage to my hair. The best news I can share is that my tumors have shrunk away to (apparently) zero. Surgery will be the final word... but imaging looks great. This is the light at the end of the tunnel that it is important to keep your mind on!! Dead tumors! Visualize your immune system breaking down those tumors. I had sensations in the tumor area that felt sorty of fizzy/burn-y... so I imagined the fizziness eating away at the cancer like an alka seltzer. I imagined my body battling to kill those cancer cells. Another thing I will recommend: if your tumor is palpable, you can put heat on it. High heat (~109) kills/damages cancer cells, but not healthy cells. When subjected to heat the cancer cells give off \"heat shock protein\" which makes the cancer more identifiable to your immune system. You might get superficial burns (I did - BRIGHT pink) but those will go away. I used a very-hot hot water bottle. I love a 105 degree hot tub, so I went to a heat that was hard to tolerate. You can read about Hyperthermia for cancer... I did this a few times a week, for about an hour each time. My tumor and lymph node were right at the surface of my skin so I know they were heated. I also put a heating pad on during the infusions, to bring that chemo laced blood right to the area of my body that needed it. I am not positive it helped but it helped me mentally to try it. Hang in there!! You are strong and you can prevail!   ",

I always preferred to drive myself to chemo and space out, noodle on my laptop, or read rather than talk to a companion. Re being scared, try to think of the chemo as your friend. Seriously-- welcome it. It is coming in to clean out the disease in your body. I liked to visualize it as sunlight entering my body and getting rid of the shadows. I think that visualization can be powerful. I also visualized a sort of \"pac man\" action of my immune cells eating my cancer. Finally, I asked my cancer to be willing to die for our mutual benefit (otherwise, eventually, we'd both die!).",

I am going to share a tip from late in my chemo, that I wish I'd done earlier: I got two kittens between #5 and #6! It was sooooo distracting and comforting to have two goofy little beings scampering around... took me outside myself in an easy, natural way. Something to consider, for anyone who is contemplating adopting a kitty anyhow. Once you put away all the breakable objects, kittens are so easy, charming, and cuddly. I got a fishing pole toy so I could just lie there and flick my wrist and they would go insane chasing the toy. They are here with me at the hotel while I do radiation out of town and I am so happy to have them! Just a thought for anyone who is down, because it is impossible to be down with kittens in the picture. :-) ",

You can use ice water or (what I did) a frozen smoothie. Ice your feet and hands too. You can use chipped ice or you can buy little gel-pak socks & mittens from Amazon and freeze them and bring them with you. You'll likely need more than one pair to rotate them. I also brought a heating pad and put it right on my boob while the infusion went in, and for several hours after at home.... I figured, I might as well get my chemo laced blood to the area that needs it! Plus it felt good, to counteract my frozen hands and feet. One thing I got from a MO consult with an integrative oncologist that I believe helped me a lot was to continue to exercise during chemo. Get out there and move. He recommended interval training. I did that, I hiked, and I did pilates 2 x per week. You want to give your body/heart the \"hang on to your strength\" message not the \"convalescent\" message. Interval program was: 30 seconds @ medium intensity (can talk), then 30 seconds @ high intensity (can't talk) x 3 (For 3 mins of up and down intensity), followed by a 3 minute total rest. Do the whole process 3 times. It can be jogging, biking, treadmill or whatever you like. It is very good for your heart health to toggle up and down like this.",

But the 'progressively harder' warning did apply to my recovery from chemo-- my \"bounce back\" between chemos got progressively harder. It was only a teeny bit harder each time the first several, and then the last 2 it got quite hard. So after chemo #1, i was \"back\" in a week and blood work was practically perfect prior to next chemo... but by #5 it took 2.5 weeks to feel normal-ish again with still very anemic blood work, and by #6 it took a full month to be \"bounced back\" enough for surgery (I'm still pretty anemic, but decent). Now 5 weeks after last chemo... I'd guess in another three weeks or so I will finally feel like my old self again. It made me understand why they stop this chemo after 6 sessions!",

I bought the freezable mittens too, as well as the freezable migraine-sufferer caps (mittens and caps were royal blue color; mittens could be heated or frozen.). I've already passed them on, so do not remember the brands but they were the only ones I saw when I searched. You need more than one so they can be rotated when they thaw. If you have dry ice in the cooler they will re-freeze from that. I had 3 pairs of socks, 4 caps, and only 2 mittens since I more preferred a bowl of ice water so I could periodically use my hands to turn a book page, use laptop, or whatever. I did not do the formal cold caps, and I missed out doing anything on chemo #1, because I raced into treatment. So my hair fell out. But I did my homegrown cold caps for chemos 2-6 and my hair actually began to regrow during chemo. I was concerned about taxotere sometimes causing permanent hair loss so I figured I could help preserve my hair over the long run by cooling my scalp even though I was already bald. I am about 12 weeks post final chemo (PFC) and my hair is a length that nobody would recognize as \"post chemo\" - thick brush cut/messy pixie look.",

I was in the August-December chemo group and am on to radiation now. Chemo was no picnic, but it was WAY less horrible than I had feared. In between the chemo treatments, you can feel like your old self, and by the time the recovery starts to become longer and harder, you are nearly done. The anti nausea meds are much better, and there are a lot of other complimentary things you can do to keep side effects from being extreme. One is fasting, or semi-fasting, for a few days each cycle, with chemo as the middle day of the fast. This was developed by a doctor and I did it with great success. If you search \"fasting mimicking\" you will find a lot of info about it. Another is following some easy protocols with over the counter meds like Claritin for bone pain. Another is keeping up with exercise (very important!) which actually helps you tolerate the chemo better and pass through the side effects more quickly. If you read through an old chemo thread, you will learn a lot. I wish all of you the very best in your treatment!",

They put steroids in with the chemo so you float out of chemo feeling pretty decent, and then the steroids wear off. Keep her walking each day. Even when feeling weak/lousy a brief walk will help a lot, for her to pass through the SEs. Lots and lots of water. If water tastes bad from the metallic flavor in her mouth, spike some ginger or kombucha or juice in there to flavor it. Encourage lots of napping. If in doubt, take the anti nausea medicine-- I took it on the dot of every 8 hours for the first couple of days. Many people develop constipation or other gastrointestinal side effects. Magnesium Citrate at bedtime works wonders for constipation and is actually good for you. Hairloss sets in about 3 weeks after chemo. I wasn't mentally prepared to see MYSELF bald, but actually when it happened it just sort of rolled off my back and wasn't a big deal. I bought a couple of cotton beanies off amazon and did not bother with wigs. You are a great daughter! I am sure your Mom is so glad to have your love and care. My 27 year old son flew home to care for me during one of my chemos and I appreciated it so much.... it was honestly one of the pinnacle experiences of my life to be taken care of by my son.  ",

It is a bit of a chore, but WAY easier than barfing, diarrhea, or constipation! It helps a lot. You can do a total water-only fast for 3 days, w chemo day in the middle, or you can do a semi-fast for 5 days with chemo day in the middle. I am an eater, so I did the latter... The formula is 1,100 cals on day one, and 800 cals days 2-5. You do very low protein (10-15% of calories, apx), plus healthy fats (avocado/nuts), and veggies. (In fact, 3 medium avocados is pretty close to 800 cals and the right balance of fat, carbs and protein... but I needed a bit more variety, so I looked stuff up and varied my meals). Fasting kicks your system into a \"preserve healthy cells and kill damaged cells\" mode and thus (per animal studies) actually boosts the effects of chemo while reducing SEs. Part of it is just not having a lot in your tummy when the GI track shuts down. When you \"re-feed\" (important!) eat nutrient dense foods and a good variety of healthy food, including carbs like lentils, sweet potato or quinoa, greens, fruits, proteins, etc. Re-feeding causes an immune system surge, another plus. Google Dr Valter Longo, USC. He developed the protocol and there is a ton of science behind it. A clinical trial is in progress now but I was certain low cals for 5 days would not kill me so I did it. Several others in the August chemo group tried it too and all of us found it much better than not doing it. I plan to do it every 3 months as an immune system tune up throughout my window of recurrence (3 years).  ",

Thats what I did. Honestly, anything not to have the pain of the constipation is worth it. I had high grade TNBC so was also very interested in boosting the effects of my chemo.
