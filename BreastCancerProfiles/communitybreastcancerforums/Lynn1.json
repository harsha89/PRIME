I was over my UTI, all pain was gone, I was feeling good.  Onc said to try the Fareston again and see if pelvic pain came back.  I've been on it about a week now, and dang it if I didn't start noticing some UTI-like symptoms again today.     These are more like \"traditional\" UTI symptoms, rather than the odd pain from before.  I have Googled and Binged (is that a word - lol) and I'm not coming up with anything, so I've come back to the wisest group of people I know.  I know about the typical side effects from medicines (hot flashes, etc.), but I have never heard of one giving you a UTI.  Is this just a conincidence?  I'm thinking not, since I have never had a UTI in my life till now and I'm doing anything else different...the only thing new is the Fareston.  I hate to stop this drug, but I don't think continual UTI's (or symptoms like it) are things I can tolerate long-term.  Do I keep taking the pill and see if it gets worse, or should I stop now before it gets worse?!  I'm so upset and disappointed and well, just plain lost.  I don't know what to do now.  HELP me please wise ladies (and gentlemen)!!  Thank you! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I did Google it, and the only symptom listed that matches mine is the pelvic pain.  I do not urinate more often or feel an urgency to go.  My pain seems to be in two areas.  One is my vagina (sorry to be so graphic) - there is a burning sensation so that is why I was thinking UTI.  The other is in very low in the pelvic area.  Here's a werid thought, but I'm exploring all ideas right now....is there ANY chance this could be consipation pain?  I had it on chemo and it has not got any better on the Fareston.  Is it possible I'm confusing pain in the colon/intestines for bladder/UTI pain? I'll start trying to drink more water I guess in the meantime and see if that helps any. For now, I'm going to keep taking the Fareston. Chainsawz:  I agree! This board is a Godsend!!! :)",

I'm not sure if there is anything else you can do unfortunately since it's already been to the review panel.  Once when I switched to my DH's insurance for awhile, they would not cover PET scans.  We tried and tried, onc talked to them directly, and they would not budge, so we just had to do different scans to get the images he wanted.  Ironically, those several scans cost more than the one PET so it made NO sense to me, but that is how insurance can be.  Frustrating isn't it?!  Best of luck to you whatever your decision is. ",

How nice is that?!  (sorry so graphic).  I really don't want to take a laxative, as that usually sends me waaay off in the other direction and, to me, that is worse.  Today I'm going to try lots water and see if that helps. What do you all think? Could the pain from constipation be causing pain such as this?  Sorry to sound so stupid....I've just never had this before really -- prior to BC, I was always a very regular girl.   What can I do to make it better?  And, do you think this is something I can treat at home, or should I see a doctor?  Thank you!!",

I'm pretty sure if I call the onc, he is going to say that we have to give the Femara the 3 months to work.  I've been on it only about 3 weeks now.  And scans (PET and MRI) were done about 3 weeks ago too, so there is no way he is going to do any more tests now.  It just seems a waste of time to even call so I have not.  I have so much fun stuff planned in the next couple of months so this worries me.  I don't want to cancel anything, but I worry that it will get worse and then I won't feel like doing anything, but on the other hand, the onc isn't going to do anything till June.   What would you all do?  Anything?  Thanks so much for your advice. ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

How can such bad things be going on inside me?!  :(    I guess the other good news is that this is the only chemo I have failed, so there's a lot of options left.  My onc said I might qualify for a study - he's checking on it for me.  Sounds to me like it might be Afinitor.  If I do not qualify, he listed about 10 different chemo names - all of which I've seen on here.  In a way, it's almost like he's leaving it up to me....you have all these choices..which one do you want to try first?  I understand that no one knows if it will work or not , so any one's guess is as good as the other.  He agreed that we should try the more \"gentle\" ones first and leave the \"big guns\" (like Taxol) for later. So what I really really need from you all is some input on what to do!!  If you had your choice, which chemo would you want?  Are there any that don't make you lose your hair?!  I know it's silly to some, but hair is important to me.  But of course so are other se's.....which ones have been \"easy\" for you?  I know everyone is different but just looking for some input here.  I really don't know where to start - it's almost like I have too many options right now (which is a good problem to have, I know), but I don't know where to begin to make this decision.  My head is spinning right now.  Help!!! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

The last one I had was in 2004.  I'm trying to stay positive and remember his words, but I'm still worried. The scan will be on Tuesday and I see him again on Wednesday for the results.

How can such bad things be going on inside me?!  :(    I guess the other good news is that this is the only chemo I have failed, so there's a lot of options left.  My onc said I might qualify for a study - he's checking on it for me.  Sounds to me like it might be Afinitor.  If I do not qualify, he listed about 10 different chemo names - all of which I've seen on here.  In a way, it's almost like he's leaving it up to me....you have all these choices..which one do you want to try first?  I understand that no one knows if it will work or not , so any one's guess is as good as the other.  He agreed that we should try the more \"gentle\" ones first and leave the \"big guns\" (like Taxol) for later. So what I really really need from you all is some input on what to do!!  If you had your choice, which chemo would you want?  Are there any that don't make you lose your hair?!  I know it's silly to some, but hair is important to me.  But of course so are other se's.....which ones have been \"easy\" for you?  I know everyone is different but just looking for some input here.  I really don't know where to start - it's almost like I have too many options right now (which is a good problem to have, I know), but I don't know where to begin to make this decision.  My head is spinning right now.  Help!!! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I guess my plan right now is to wait till Monday and hope to speak with either the onc or a nurse to get more info on my options.  I don't know what happened to me.  I was listening, but I should have taken notes.  I can't remember all the details now.  He was telling me about how some are every week, some are 3 weeks on then a week off, and the infusion times vary of course.  I want to take all those into consideration when making this decision - since I'm being given the option.  I hate that they have to repeat it all again, but I totally spaced out for a bit there I guess.  I just kept thinking to myself \"what?\"....it's all so surreal. Maybe when I have narrowed it down to 2 or 3 choices, I can post and get real-life stories on each one and then hopefully make a good informed decision.   I still feel in shock.  I feel so good and people lately have been telling me how good I look now.  I should have known it was some sort of jinx.  I'm not superstitous, but things have been going so well lately, I guess it was bound to end.  I'm just so sad right now.  I hope I can shake these feelings of despair and get my fighting gloves back on soon.   This just sucks!!",

I can't take pain meds either - they make me soooo sick (vomiting).  If I have to take them, I have to take an anti-nausea med first.  So after my little episode last week, pain meds were top of my list of questions today.   I was talking to the NP (who I just don't like and don't think he's very good) so I'll confirm more next week with my real doctor, but he said pain patches would be the best long-lasting option and people can function on them (no zombies). Then you can take a pill (Percoset, etc.) for any breakthrough pain.  Sorry I don't have more info on them, but hopefully someone else will.  I'm VERY interested in the answers you get!!",

Thanks everyone!!  I am too much of a wimp to just yank them off.  :(   It's still tender there from the bruising I guess, so that's not helping either.  I have been putting baby oil on them and it is helping - slowly but surely.  I keep peeling a little more and a little more.  At this rate, they should be off soon....I hope!  Never seen such sticky things!! It's in a place that I find hard to see too.  How soon did everyone feel well enough to go back to exercising?  I know I should start slow, but last time I tried every \"bounce\" made it feel like something was \"pulling\" in there.  I might have been a bit adventurous and it was too early?  Ok now?....it's been 10 days. ",

The nurse brought me back and told me to change into the \"pretty\" gown and socks.  She told me I could keep my underwear on and I immediately thought of Jennifer sitting there alone in her gown and no underwear. Made me smile.  Not at her situation but that at that very moment, my thoughts turned you all here and it gave me comfort.   I did have to walk from the pre-op area into the OR.  They were very nice though and put down a nice warm blanket so I didn't have to lay on that cold metal, and as soon as I laid down she had another warm blanket on top of me.  Ahhh.  They called this twillight sleep, but I was O.U.T.  He said \"ok, you'll be out in about 20 seconds...enjoy your nap\", and the next thing I knew I was in recovery. Then the \"fun\" began.  They needed a chest x-ray to make sure it was all in the right place.  I thought to myself that now is heck of a time to check - are you going to go back in if it's \"wrong\"?!  Anyway, there was no raising that arm over my head so I ended up leaning against the wall with my hands out in front of me (made me laugh a little though since I figured I looked like someone being arrested rather than x-rayed).  Then we had to wait for them to read it.  I just wanted to go home!  Took forever, but all was well I guess and they sent me home.  I slept most of the day away. It is really sore this morning still.  I don't do pain meds well so I've been popping Advil like crazy.  I think it's worse because it's on my right side and I'm right handed.  I keep reaching for stuff and \"OW!!\".    I hope some of this is just the dressing pulling and it will be better when I can get that off.  I'm taking today off.  All of you who went back to work right away after this are superwomen!! There is no way I could feel safe driving today, much less feel like working.   I am so curious what it looks like and how far it sticks out and all.  They told me not to take off the dressing for 48 hours so that would not be till tomorrow morning.  They are going to call me sometime today to check on me so I'm going to ask if I could do that tonight instead.  I'm supposed to be at the onc for 1st chemo at 8:15am tomorrow.  I need time to put that cream on and all. Thanks again to everyone who supported and encouraged me as I waited for this.  I finally lost it on Tuesday night and cried myself to sleep.  I haven't done that since my original dx, and I guess it helped some to just get it all out.  The surgery itself was not as bad as I thought, but so far I'm still not excited about having this alien in my chest.  Maybe after chemo tomorrow, it will be my best friend like it is to so many of you.  Thanks again - you all are the best!!",

Anyway, finally got it and boy does it feel good to not have all that tape pulling on the skin!  I was very surprised - it is smaller than I thought!  I hope it does not \"grow\" as it heals.  So the onc said to put the EMLA cream on the port itself, not on the incision. Well, they are together!  I only have one incision and it's right above the port from what I can tell.  There are still steri-strips covering it all and it's bruised of course so hard to see.  So I decided not to put anything on it since he said \"not on the incision\".  Thought it might burn or something.  Anyway, I get there and explain what is going on.  They actually used it through the steri-strips.  Said they wanted to just let those fall off.  So of course no EMLA cream.  I jokingly told them to give me something to bite on, but I was very surprised that it did not hurt much at all.  The pressure of her pushing on it hurt worse than the actual stick! It had good blood return and so all seems to be working great!  I will say that I did enjoy having my hands free the entire time.  That was a nice change from \"try not to move your arm\" for 2 hours.  So, hopefully I'm on my way to a friendship with my new alien.  Thank you all soooo much for baby-stepping me through this!! ",

Now I'm rethinking my super short cut.  I do still think I'm going to stop trying to let it grow.  It's at this awkward growing-out stage and it takes me a long time to fix it in the mornings.  Right now, I don't mind that at all, but if I'm tired or weak or just not feeling well, the last thing I want is to fuss with my hair.  Know what I mean?  Plus, I thought the more you mess with it, the more it falls out.  It takes a lot of pulling/straightening etc to get it looking ok right now.  But maybe I just take it back to a shorter cut that is easier to manage (wash-n-go) vs the ultra short I was planning.  I can always go shorter if it thins a lot.  I have a TON of hair right now - came back so thick when it grew back this time, so a little thinning might actually be good - lol.  And, if I get lucky and none falls out, well I can just let it grow again.  Also, right now it's HOT in Atlanta and a shorter cut will feel good for the summer.

Since they had already flushed the port, they couldn't use it, so I still got stuck!  Good grief!!  Otherwise, I guess it's not too much of a pain.  LOL!

That's good to know in a way that this might not show up on scans.  I'd be super upset if they missed this.  But I do remember once a while back my onc saying that bone mets are the hardest to track. I do have a little shortness of breath, but I was assuming that was from the anemia.  When I got my transfusion, that eased quite a bit.  But my red cell count is still not what it should be, so I was attributing it to that.  I have not had any cramping, but I do feel tired all the time - no amount of sleep ever fully revives me like it used to. Yes, I was on Xeloda for a year.  Loved it!  I had some issues at first, but we tweaked the dosage and I had hardly any side effects.  I wish it would have worked for longer.  That is great news to hear about how you feel on the Afinitor.  I hope I get to keep taking it too.  Like you, I have read all the possible nasty side effects and I just keep waiting for them to show up, but you've given me hope that maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones who doesn't have too many.

I'm in a bit of limbo right now - not sure what we are going to do.  He wants to consult with the doctor at Emory who was heading up the trials on Afinitor and see if she has any experience with this and if she thinks the Afinitor will work or do we need to go back to a more traditional IV chemo.  He said he would try and get in touch with her today, but it may be Monday before I have any news. In the meantime, unless he calls today and tells me differently, he wants me to start back on the Afinitor tonight and come back in a week for bloodwork.  Has anyone else had this happen?  He said it was not rare, but I've never heard of this before.  Seems very \"catch 22\" to me -- give me chemo to kill the cancer, but that drops your counts....just seems a vicious circle to me.  I'm trying not to get upset until I know more, but you all know how your mind just races during times like this.  Please send prayers, good vibes, whatever you believe in.  I really need them right now. ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I still feel sore this morning - almost like someone beat me up.  The pain was deep - like my bones were hurting or something - and constant.  This scared me!  Never had anything like that happen before.  I was near tears a couple of times, and very close to having DH take me to the ER.  Has anyone else had this happen? What caused it?  The chemo?....just some crazy fluke??  I did call the nurse line this morning and reported it, but I doubt they will do much since my onc is out of the country on vacation and his NP is a complete idiot.  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I feel pretty darn good right now, so I'm choosing to believe the cancer is still stable.  My life goal has become to sit in that exam room on the 25th and say to the onc \"I TOLD YOU SO\" -- I told you the hormones would work again!!  I want to sit there looking good and healthy and point my finger at him and say SEEE?!!!  You were WRONG!!!   I'm nuts, aren't I?  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

To top it all off, my mom is driving me a little crazy right now.  She has some health issues, but won't follow the doctor's instructions completely so that frustrates me.  She is also on a \"woe is me\" kick right now, and I just so don't need that at this time.  But, I'm an only child and my dad has passed away so that just leaves me.  I am trying to be supportive, but I just feel exhausted after talking with her. Sorry for rambling on. I just needed to get it out I guess, and I knew this is the place where someone might understand.  Thanks for listening.",

This is good for me because I like being \"over informed\" - always feel the need to do lots of research.  Anyway got all my questions answered - almost.  I asked about the Avastin and she said as of today, they are planning to give it to me, but when I come in on Friday, it's possible that may change. If so, I would get the Abraxane only and no Avastin.  Will just have to wait and see - I hate waiting and I hate not knowing. I get to find out right before. Have I mentioned I hate surprises? *sigh* Now that I have asked the question 100 times in 100 ways, it is finally sinking in and I am so very upset about this situation. I've been holding it together pretty well, but now I'm just a crying mess. This is like a bad dream.  I could possibly be on chemo indefinitely and indefinite chemo means indefinite bald and tired and achey and sick.  This cannot be happening. How come no one around me seems to understand..this is huge! Everyone so nonchalant (sp?) - it will be okay. Yeah, really, you know that?!  This is lifechanging. I'm not ready for this. I'm not.  I don't want to go on Friday even though I know I have to.  How do you all DO this? How do you stay so postive and optomistic? I need to go back to DeNile - so much happier there.

I feel pretty darn good right now, so I'm choosing to believe the cancer is still stable.  My life goal has become to sit in that exam room on the 25th and say to the onc \"I TOLD YOU SO\" -- I told you the hormones would work again!!  I want to sit there looking good and healthy and point my finger at him and say SEEE?!!!  You were WRONG!!!   I'm nuts, aren't I?  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

Even though I thought I was being long-winded, it's obvious I have left out some information, so please let me clear up a few things and answer some of the questions raised..... There is absolutely no pressure whatsover.  I can easily say \"no\" and there will be no guilt-trip, etc.  I have worked for this company for over 22 years.  I have worked with the gentleman who asked me at least 10 years.  I promise there is no \"hidden agenda\" in their asking me.  As TheDivineMrsM said, this truly is an honor to even be asked.  I have already made it clear that I will have final say-so over what is used - they are very OK with that. They see me as this extremely brave/courageous person.  There is a whole thread dedicated to that so I don't want to go there, but just saying, right or wrong, that is their vision of me, and they are trying to do something nice for me I think.  It is a corporate enviornment, but it's also happens to be a Christian organization so their \"motivation\" is to motivate people, but not in the traditional sense...more a spiritual sense.  I will be talking also about how God figures into all this.  I know religion/beliefs can be very touchy here, so I don't want to get into that too much.  Just please know that their motivation is positive not negative. They do a video on some topic every year so this is not new.  I also was not as clear as I thought (now that I read my post again) about the \"theme\" of the video.  It is about people who have had \"bad\" things happen to them - not of their own doing - and have taken a positive approach to it/seen the silver lining/battled back (whatever you want to call it).  The lady who was homeless was a not a deadbeat who didn't pay her bills...she had some very tragic events happen to her that she had no control over.  The drug abuser obviously made her own choices, but had extenuating circumstances that complicated her recovery from the addiction.  I have never been totally secretive about my MBC, but I don't blurt it out to everyone I meet either.  Sometimes people find out later, and say \"why didn't you tell me?\", and I tell them it's because I don't want to say \"Hi, I'm Lynn...nice to meet you...I have MBC\".  ;-)   But if it comes up somehow I have never lied about it.  There are many people in my office who do already know my situation.  Having worked there so long, some are almost like family to me.  They know all about it.  Others know to some degree since they have seen me with no hair, etc. in the past.  Even some of our \"big wigs\" are aware and are extremely supportive work-wise, which I really appreciate.  I guess I have a new question.....I think you all are correct that people who did not already know will be likely to \"see\" me differently.  In what ways do you think that will materialize?  Just the questions (how are you?  how do you feel?) or something else?  I guess I'm trying to decide if there is some potential drawback to this that I'm not seeing right now.  Thank you!!!",

Scuttlers:  I think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of the video.  It is not meant to be a PSA on MBC.  I am simply sharing my story, including my religious perspective, and was hoping to use a few minutes of that time to also educate folks just a little on what MBC is. That's all. I think what I need to focus on now is the possible negative aspects....that is where my decision will probably lie.   In what way do you think I will be treated differently?  Do you think there will just be more questions, or will I get the \"sad face\" in the halls?  Those are the negatives,but I also wonder if I might receive more support too?  But is there some \"drawback\" that I'm not seeing that could come back to bite me?",

A short history:  I started Abraxane (and Avastin) on July 23rd.  My hair started falling out in clumps about 3 weeks later, so I had it shaved off.  It is almost like it all just released one day, and then started growing back immediately.  I now have about ½\" of regrowth.  It is sparse and I'm not sure, even if it were 2 inches long, if it would totally cover but it's still growing!! I can tell it IS getting longer.  The coverage is pretty much the same all over - no bald spots. I'm just looking for stories/experience on this.  Did it fall out again after a few more months?  Does it continue to grow longer and fill in?  Will it fill in enough to go without a wig or some type of wrap eventually? Right now I have a wig I'm somewhat happy with and a few wraps I like, but if this is indeed going to be a long-time thing I need to either get another wig I'm more happy with, or invest in more wraps.  Thanks for sharing your experiences with me. ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I can't say anything about the markers because my onc doesn't put much weight behind them, but I know they are accurate for some.  Just think about your good scans and try not to dwell on the markers.  I think you're going to like your new treatment plan!  Best of luck to you!",

This is good for me because I like being \"over informed\" - always feel the need to do lots of research.  Anyway got all my questions answered - almost.  I asked about the Avastin and she said as of today, they are planning to give it to me, but when I come in on Friday, it's possible that may change. If so, I would get the Abraxane only and no Avastin.  Will just have to wait and see - I hate waiting and I hate not knowing. I get to find out right before. Have I mentioned I hate surprises? *sigh* Now that I have asked the question 100 times in 100 ways, it is finally sinking in and I am so very upset about this situation. I've been holding it together pretty well, but now I'm just a crying mess. This is like a bad dream.  I could possibly be on chemo indefinitely and indefinite chemo means indefinite bald and tired and achey and sick.  This cannot be happening. How come no one around me seems to understand..this is huge! Everyone so nonchalant (sp?) - it will be okay. Yeah, really, you know that?!  This is lifechanging. I'm not ready for this. I'm not.  I don't want to go on Friday even though I know I have to.  How do you all DO this? How do you stay so postive and optomistic? I need to go back to DeNile - so much happier there.

When I started Navelbine last week, I did \"allow\" a very dear friend to accompany me since DH was at work.  I was super nervous about them using the new port for the first time and the new chemo and all.  She provided a good distraction and helped pass the time.  She is off on Fridays so this was easy for her.  I think she's going to go with me to the 2nd treatment this Friday too, but then I'll probably be going by myself again most of the time. I have so many friends/family who have said \"anything you need\", and I know they would, but since I still feel well enough to drive myself, etc. I am holding off on calling in those favors till I really need them.",

I can sympathize with your fears of being bald from now on.  I know being bald should not matter as long as we are alive and have QOL, but it is the most unfair part to me.  I wish they would figure out a way to treat the cancer and leave our hair alone!!! I hope today finds you up a few rungs on the ladder basking in some sunshine. ",

Now they have approached me again, but this time they want to use it in a different way, and I can't decide if this is a good thing or not.  I think it is, but I'd like to hear your \"pros\" and \"cons\" on participating please. This new project will have a video portion that will focus on people who have been put in difficult situations and yet have \"stayed the course\" so to speak and are doing ok now.  I know they have one person confirmed who became homeless but is now working again,etc, one who fought back from drug addition, and one who is from another country and faced civil unrest.  So it's a very wide variety of \"topics\" and not sure how many else may join too.  They said they would do a lengthy \"interview\" with me, but then cut it down to a few scenes for the final version. They assure me I will have total editorial control. I will be able to view their draft and tell them \"take that out\" or whatever.  The main \"pro\" that I see is that I can educate some people about MBC - I find that so many have no idea what that really means (no cure, etc.) or what we face every day.  I know having hope will not make my cancer go away, but I know so many just give up immediately - even at lower stages.  If I could help just one person see that having BC, and even MBC, is not always an immediate death sentance, I think that would be valuable to me personally.  The main \"con\" I see though is that EVERYONE is going to know I have MBC now.  At this moment, it is not obvious.  I have hair and overall I know I look like nothing is wrong to the outside observer.  This video is going to be shared not only with everyone at my office (200+ people), but also made available to over 400 field offices and eventually will be on the Internet.  So what do you think?  Is this good or bad?  Good that I can tell my story to loads of people, or bad because loads of people are now going to know my \"secret\"?? I have a week to consider this.  They will start filming those who want to participate soon because they are wanting to premiere this in May. I would love to hear your thoughts.  Thank you for your time in reading this....I think I got a little long-winded there. ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

Cynthia:  Funny you should say that.  I never had any issues with taking my pills, but I've already worried that I'm going to start bawling like a baby when they stick that IV in.  Inside I'm going to be screaming \"noooooooo!!!\"   But, yes, I know...suck it up, quit yer bitching, and just get on with it.  One foot in front of the other.  Good advice and duly noted.  Virtually holding hands with you right now!! Frapp:  What you have said is what I'm holding out hope on.  I know when I started Xeloda, I was having some bad se's and I was worried how I was going to keep on, but over time, we adjusted the dose, and I learned what to expect and how to counteract it, and eventually it all smoothed out and was tolerable.  I know the first time or two will probably be the worst and I will just have to remind myself that it almost always gets better.  That there WILL be more good days, and I'm not becoming a shut-in!!  Move over....I'm coming into your room of denial!! ",

If things are stable, maybe a month off would help?  I'd discuss that option with him too.  I wish I had more advice to offer.  I hope you get some answers soon.  Gentle warm hugs for you!!",

Oh I hate this!!!  You all know that, but I just find this part SO freaking unfair!!   And, another tx today too -- please let this one go better than the last one!! ",

Speaking of the drugs, I joked when she said they were going to run the last saline to make sure I got all the Abraxane in the lines, etc.  I said, oh yeah, I paid for that and that's probably $100 there.  She looked at the lines and laughed and said \"more than that\".  I can only imagine what all this is costing. I am so very grateful for insurance and for having met my out of pocket this year so they are paying 100% right now.  This morning I still feel a bit \"off\", but not too bad.  A little tired, achey, but still no real nausea.  I took another Zofran this morning just to be safe.  So far, everything still tastes the same, but will keep the tips in mind for when that time comes. Thanks! So far, my only complaint is a bit of constipation.  I'm going to get some Colace today - I remember that working last time.  Anyone have any other remedies? FightnF8 - (very clever screen name btw! love it!) thank you for those tips on staying positive.  I really appreciate it.  I want my \"fight\" back and I know it will come..I just feel a bit overwhelmed right now, but I hope this will pass soon. I'm still planning on wig shopping today with my friend.  Not a fun chore, but I chose my shopping companion wisely...she will have me laughing in no time.  Hoping my \"yucky day\" will be tomorrow and I can go to work on Monday.

How in the world are these mets so out of control when I feel so good?  I guess I always figured that when I had progression/failed a chemo I would have some sort of symptom or at least feel \"off\", but I feel great!

So I'm finding it very difficult to wrap my mind around this new news and accept the fact that in a short amount of time all this is going to change.  I know everyone has different reactions to every chemo, but none of them sound very \"friendly\" to me.  All I can think is I'm going to be tired, sick, and bald from now on.  It's like some sick joke.....yes we want you to voluntarily opt to make yourself miserable.  I know that if I don't do anything, the cancer will take over, but it is incomprehensible to me right now to \"do\" this to myself.  Does this make any sense?  I guess I'm just rambling here, venting, whatever you want to call it. I don't recognize myself anymore either - I am a \"glass half-full\" girl - no matter what, I can always see the silver lining, but I just feel despair right now.  I hope that part of me is not gone.  I don't want this stupid cancer to take away the fun in my life...to take away \"me\".  Usually I'm the one being the cheerleader, and I'm trying to take my own advice, but maybe I just need a push in right direction?  Tell me to shut up and shake it off!  Don't hug me because now they make me cry.  I'm my own worst enemy right now and I don't know how to stop!!  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I really hope the reduced dose will help with the HFS, headaches, nausea, and runny nose/watery eyes, while still kicking some cancer a@@!! My bloodwork looked good again so he also said I didn't need to come every week now, which is nice...less visits to his office are appreciated. I do have to go back tomorrow though. I get the pills from them and they did not have enough for the full 2 weeks. They ordered them and they will be there tomorrow. Still a pain to go back. Oh I did ask about that last MRI scan, and he confirmed that he did not say anything about the new bone mets there because it was already in the bones.  He agreed to tell me these things in the future - hope he will. So, keep your fingers crossed that cycle #2 is easier than the first.  Thanks for all your support and encouragement!!! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

How in the world are these mets so out of control when I feel so good?  I guess I always figured that when I had progression/failed a chemo I would have some sort of symptom or at least feel \"off\", but I feel great! I'm working full-time, exercising 2-3 times a week, traveling, and just doing \"normal\" stuff.  I look like the picture of health - my color is back, my hair has grown quite a bit, and I finally lost about 10 pounds.  If you did not know, you would never guess I have MBC. So I'm finding it very difficult to wrap my mind around this new news and accept the fact that in a short amount of time all this is going to change.  I know everyone has different reactions to every chemo, but none of them sound very \"friendly\" to me.  All I can think is I'm going to be tired, sick, and bald from now on.  It's like some sick joke.....yes we want you to voluntarily opt to make yourself miserable.  I know that if I don't do anything, the cancer will take over, but it is incomprehensible to me right now to \"do\" this to myself.  Does this make any sense?  I guess I'm just rambling here, venting, whatever you want to call it. I don't recognize myself anymore either - I am a \"glass half-full\" girl - no matter what, I can always see the silver lining, but I just feel despair right now.  I hope that part of me is not gone.  I don't want this stupid cancer to take away the fun in my life...to take away \"me\".  Usually I'm the one being the cheerleader, and I'm trying to take my own advice, but maybe I just need a push in right direction?  Tell me to shut up and shake it off!  Don't hug me because now they make me cry.  I'm my own worst enemy right now and I don't know how to stop!!  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

My issue with pain meds is they make me nauseous, and I feel a bit queasy this morning still.  I guess I'm going to have to take Compazine or something with the pain pill, but that just seems like so many pills!  I'm at work now and feeling like poo and wanting to go home, so just whining and complaining and wishing it would all just go away!! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

So I talked to the nurse again this mornig and she said my onc wanted to talk to the obgyn on the phone and it was taking some time to get them together between patients, etc.  They finally call back around 3:00 and said he talked to her and she doesn't know what is wrong.  Well, DUH! That is why she referred me back to you!  I asked, well now what?  And she did not know so I asked her to talk to him again and see what I should do now.  At almost 5:00 (so now I've been waiting ALL day), she calls back and says, \"he said that you just had scans in that area a month ago, and there was nothing wrong so there is nothing to do right now. if it gets worse then call for an office visit\".  WTH?!?!?!  Yes, let's just wait and let it get worse before you do anything.  Would it kill you to just order another CT scan or SOMETHING.  DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING.  Argh!  So that was my final straw.  He has done this to me before when I kept telling him my hip hurt and he wouldn't do anything till after I had been to several doctors only to find out in the end it was from mets in my pelvis bone.  So if he does not care about me, then I don't care to see him again.  I've been trying to search for a new one through my insurance website, but I keep getting directed back to him or someone is his group.  I don't know what to do.  I guess there are not a lot of oncs nearby?  I tried once before to go see another doctor in his group and while I was waiting for the other doctor, he saw me and just took over.  I never did get to see the other doctor.  In a way that would be sorta awkward anyway I guess to continue going to the same place but seeing another doctor? And, I don't know what to do about this current situation.  I think I'll call the obgyn on Monday and see if she will either order a scan of some kind or at least refer me to someone.  Right now I have no idea where to go.   Anyway, thanks for letting me vent.  ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

I am going to call his office and see if he is taking new patients and would he take over my care.  I have also heard very good things about another doctor is the current group and so I thought maybe I could call the office manager or patient advocate or whatever they call it there, and explain to her I am unhappy and could she intitiate the transfer or at least tell me what they do in that situation.  Surely I can't be the ONLY one who has not been happy. So, thanks again -- for letting me vent, and for your support.  It means the world to me.  I will keep you all posted as to how things go. ",

After some intital issues, we played with the dosage and I have very few side effects now.  I have been on it about 7 months (will do scans again soon to see if still working).  I love that I have hair too.  I hope I can stay on it a really really long time.  Best of luck to you as you make this tough decision.  HUGS!  PS:   feel free to PM me with any questions!",

That was right before our trip to MN and I got the news the week after we got back.  I haven't been back to the gym since!!  That's 3 whole months!  My membership fee is pretty low.  I called and I can \"freeze\" my account for a few months and can still keep my good monthly fee. This may be my best option?  I guess I am reluctant to give up this part of my life, but I don't want to avoid reality. I would love to go back because, as I said, I enjoyed it so much.  But, since starting chemo, I don't have the same energy.  I've read where it's better to be active than sedentery.  I'm not sure if I should push myself into some formal exercise or not.  I've never been good at working out at home - I've had tons of home equipment over the years, and it always ends up collecting dust.  Do I drop the gym and force myself to work out at home, or do I just give up ever exercising again?  I'm just looking for some advice...a reality check...whatever you want to call it.  I know this is trivial in some ways, but welcome your input.  Thank you! ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

Anyway, just wanted to share my \"brave\" story of leaving the house sans wig with those who can really understand.  :) ~Lynn ER+, HER2- Bone mets: sternum, pelvis, spine, ribs....it's everywhere.

Good luck with your scans today!!  ((((Nancy)))) PS:  I just saw the post above by katbob....I am taking regular Ritalin (not Concerta), and it HAS helped with the fatigue.  You might talk to your doc about one of them next time you see them.",
