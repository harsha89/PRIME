My mom had lung cancer but she was 70 yrs old and I was so shocked to be diagnosed with cancer at 48.  Size of tumors are 2cm and 1cm in a same breast. I have a question about lymph node biopsy. I went to 2 doctors and one doctor told me she will take 1-2 nodes.  Other doctor said she won't know how many she will take until surgery.   My Canadian friend said when she had surgery, biopsy was done at operation room and doctor only took the one which are necessary.  But both doctors said they will need to send it out for biopsy. I just worry about lymphedema and I want minimum number of node taken out.  How many lymph nodes really need to taken out?  And what is the chance to get lymphedema after surgery?   Log in to post a reply",

I spoke to my doctor's assistant and she said there will be a pathologist in operation room if the surgery is for mastectomy.  But for lumpectomy I will know the result later, she also told me that it's very rare to get lymphodema for my case but I have been unlucky for last few years and just worried.   My other doctor said node biopsy is not always accurate and does not change mortality rate, she takes only 1 or 2 ...so why do I want to risk?  But many people are saying they checked if nodes are positive or negative right at surgery... ",

I can't deal with lymphodema on top of rheumatoid arthritis.  It will lower my QOL.  Also yesterday I had a call from BS that they found suspicious enhancement (abnormality) in both of my breast from MRI, one is as big as 4 cm and scheduled for biopsy with MRI. Since radiology department is jam packed I have to wait until 2/20 for that biopsy.  So many things to worry about...",
