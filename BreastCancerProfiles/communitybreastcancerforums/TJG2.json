Even if most things taste awful, keeping up strength is important and Ensure helped with that. Gaterade also helped keep me hydrated and gave me a boost of energy. If you get to a point that one of your drugs causes mouth irritation, your oncologist can prescribe a rinse that will allow you to eat. It cost me $9 but it was worth it, I used it two days out of the entire 6 rounds of chemo. Good luck everyone!",
