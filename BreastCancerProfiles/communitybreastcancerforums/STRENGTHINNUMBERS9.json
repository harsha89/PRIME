    "Content": "STRENGTHINNUMBERS9 wrote: I recently spotted a lump in left breast. went for mammogram and ultrasound. Results state mass with irregular margins and shadowing. no other cystic or solid mass detected. 5 cm from the nipple and worrisome for a neoplasm. An ultrasound guided biopsy is advised for a histologic diagnosis. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: BIRAD 5 - Highly suggestive of Malignancy. That is scary to see in print. I have a appointment with breast specialist on Monday for biopsy (as it turns out, she'll review my images and discuss and THEN schedule actual biopsy). My mom had breast cancer and radical mastectomy at 54. My sister is just finishing chemo for breast cancer (59 yo). I'm 52 and frankly, worried. Trying to think positive, but it seems like almost everything says BIRAD 5 is most likely malignant. Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
