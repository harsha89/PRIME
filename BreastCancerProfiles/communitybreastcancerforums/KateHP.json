I find out my results on Thursday, but I also scheduled an appointment at MGH for the following week.  Even if it is nothing, I want to get evaluated there each year.  I'm at moderate risk for developing breast cancer.  I've watched both of my aunts suffer from this, and one lose her battle.  I want to do everything I can to prevent this or detect it early.   I'm a teacher and head back to school in just a couple of weeks.  This all couldn't have come at a worse time.  Getting to appointments isn't easy once there are a classroom full of kids to teach.   ",
