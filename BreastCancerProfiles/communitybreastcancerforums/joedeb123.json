It took them forever to drain. I was very happy to get down to 1 tube. Mine drained for about 3 weeks. Well my biopsey came back postive lymphnodes 1 on each side. So on 1/3/13 I went back in for lymphnode to be remove (few more) I had one tube moved last week. (1/14/13)  My other tube will not stop draining. 50-80 c (YUK) How ever I have been very active this time around cause I didn't want my arms not to straighten out make it hard to use.  So maybe I am using my arm to much. I guess I will take it easy and not use it much for a few days. I too can't take a shower yet again so I've been taking a bath. my husband has been washing my hair. How ever some hair salons will wash your hair for free. My hair dresser is at walmart in Aburndale Fl. I told her what I was going through and she told me she doesn't charge cancer pt. to wash hair.  Oh my Path report came back on my lymphnodes no more cancer. I do half to do chemo 8 cylcles. Just can't do until my tube is out. I also can't go back to work until tube is out. So I have been out of work since 11/29/12. I am dying to get back to work. Thank god I have disability insurance short term.  Well thank for listing.. God bless  Deb      ",
