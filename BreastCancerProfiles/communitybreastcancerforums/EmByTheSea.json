Operation for lumpectomy July 2016, (one node removed, no cancer) radiotherapy (19 shots) Oct 2016. A few weeks ago I noticed yellow marks on my t-shirt at night, as if something leaking form my nipple. I squeezed a bit and some more came out. I initially thought seroma but my GP said infection and put me on antibiotics - saw my doc at the hosp again and he ultrasounded and said it was indeed seroma and that I had little build ups of it which were tracking along the milk ducts. When it builds up my breast gets warm and sore, at which point I wake up with a patch on my t-shirt at night and squeeze a bit more out to release the pressure. Although the doc said not to worry unless I noticed signs of an infection (it is normal right now, clear and yellow), it bothers me that it builds up and leaks out like this. I'm not sure I should be helping it come out, but it does make it feel better! Anyone else had something similar? And hello, I'm new here :) Log in to post a reply",
