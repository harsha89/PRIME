Then the plastic surgeon took over and she used my tummy fat to form new breasts. So I got a tummy tuck out of the deal. They use flaps from my abdomen and use it for new breasts. I went under with my own breasts and woke up with a tummy tuck and a \"C\" cup (I used to be \"D\") breasts that look very natural. It's a very hard surgery but so well worth it. There are only a handful of surgeons doing this.  I had mine done at the Mayo here in Phoenix.",

When I would even broach the subject with my husband or Mom I would get a chilly reception as if I was being a hypochondriac. About a year later I find out I have breast cancer, was offered a lumpectomy for a 1.7cm tumor. I said, \"NO WAY, take them BOTH off\" and I had DIEP. It's the best decision I ever made.

My hair never did fall all the way out, albeit very, very thin. It wasn't even patchy. I had my hair buzzed with a 2 way back in mid December. A lot more fell out after that, what didn't fall out kept growing and I had it buzzed with a 2 again in February. I have to admit what was growing though never looked good. It looked like pubic hair and it was totally gray! Last week I decided to dye it chestnut brown. I put it in my hair, started doing chores around the house, was waiting on the 25 minutes. Never looked at myself in the mirror until around 20 minutes out. I caught a glimpse of myself and it was bright ORANGE!  OMG I ran to the sink and rinsed the heck out of it. Then when it was done I dried it off and because I was basically bald with this bit of hair I looked like a flipping baby orangutan! Now my real hair is growing back under that mess. Thinking of options here and when I should go ahead and buzz off the orangey color.",

How the heck can I have breast cancer just 9 months after a successful  breast reduction??  I had a breast reduction 8/26/09. Everything was great. Loved my new smaller breasts. Had to have tests beforehand to make sure I didn't have breast cancer which I didn't. They tested all the tissue afterwards, everything was benign. Fast forward to 6/10 just 9 short months later I found a lump in my right breast which I was sure was scar tissue from the breast reduction. I put it off for 2 months then finally saw my doctor. He had me go in for a mammogram and ultrasound. The radiologist called me in her office before I even got dressed to tell me she didn't like the lump and called it \"suspicious\" This was on 8/26/2010 the one year anniversary of my breast reduction surgery! Had biopsy the next week and was told on 9/03/10 that I have IDC. I am still at the very beginning of all of this and a bit overwhelmed but searching out for more information to educate myself Does this mean it's been in there for a really long time and it was there when I had my reduction surgery? Perhaps this means I have some sort of fast cancer that formed immedately after surgery? I did have the tissue biopsied then.   I'm just really confused on the timing of all of this.
