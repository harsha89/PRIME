Some bloating and some gas....but so much better than I ever anticipated. I have a seroma that is filling back up that I will get drained next week, but all in all so far so good. Anticipating the third day to pass and hoping it comes and goes without the flu-like symptoms I've read about. I did take anti nausea meds day of treatment and day after prophylactically. And hoping they've done the job...thinking many many prayers have done the job:) Sleep evades me tonight though.....last night the nurse practioner had instructed me to take an ativan with my anti nausea med at bedtime to counteract the iv steroid I got with treatment. I slept better than I've slept in a month!:) But don't want to get to where I have to have it to sleep....so tonight went to bed tired slept two hours and then can't sleep.....but no big complaints. Just so grateful to be symptom free at this point:) CKK - do you know when you will start your chemo....praying for peace as you wait. LeesaAnn - how's the fever. Does heat intensify the chemo effect just on your hair or should hot bathes be avoided. And if it effects my hair...the closer I get to the time they think it will fall out should I not use blow dryer etc. so much to learn:) Anniebell - I am beginning day 3 (finished 1st treatment on Friday at 1pm) I too am feeling for the most part 100%. Keep wondering if I walking around on borrowed time - if it will hit any moment or if this could be the way it will be. Will be interested to see, I know they tell me some of the side effects are cumulative so they could be worse as time goes on. Grateful so far. Wave - the whole wig thing is somewhat discouraging to me...but I know I will want one..Cut my hair short for the first time on Thursday before chemo on Friday. Have never worn short hair. Picked out a wig that is longer more like my hair was....Just feels funny. Hope I don't look like a TV evangelist wife in it:) Just kidding... Hope you ladies have a GREAT day! So grateful to be able to walk this difficult path with you! Hugs, Kim",

Wish there was something we could say or do to make it better Anniebell how many post first treatment are you today/when you shaved your head? I went to the \"Look Better, Feel Better class today\" I am very anxious about the hair loss and whether I will feel the need to shave my head...in my mind I have not planned for my husband to see me bald...so would need someone else to shave it. Have picked out a wig, it came in today. Not sure if it is the right one. My college age daughter will be in this weekend so I thought I'd see what she thinks. Cut my hair shorter than ever and now my husband likes that, so trying to decide if I should go with a short or a longer wig. Since I will be without hair....I don't really have a preference. I have been achey today head, back, legs and some taste issues......but really nothing to complain about....wondering if I can expect all treatments to be this uneventful. Take Care Ladies",

Also picked our a wig yearsterday it should be in next week in the right color. Curious as we go if I or any of you will feel the need to shave our heads. Think I'm most anxious about the hair loss and the potential for vertigo,nausea/vomiting. Anyone else starting today? So grateful for the posts and input from those of you already on this road.

No weight gain or loss as yet....was concerned about the weight gain due to steroids, but none as yet.

Heather - sorry your hair started to shed today....I'm hoping to be one of those that it goes all at once....as I'm petrified of shaving my head:( Let us kow if you make it to Wednesday and how that goes. lees - hope all goes well for you tomorrow:) ? to you all.
