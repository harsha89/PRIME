It is my mothers mother who had breast cancer and her three sisters. Also my mothers sister died at 27 of breast cancer. I will be having the genetic testing if this lump turns out to be nothing because I have a daughter so I want to know for her sake. Hopefully you're right and my mum and I have escaped the gene. But even if we haven't and even if this lump is BC then I am ready for the fight so I am quite optimistic either way.  I guess I will feel better when I know what I am facing for mine and my daughters sake.",

So our history doesn't bode well for the future. To be very honest if I am going to get this I'm ready for the battle!I kind of expect to get it because of my family history and it's almost like I'd rather 'get it over and done with' rather than keep dreading it. I have PMDD (which is very severe PMS) and have been having treatment for that for 6 years now so I'm kind of looking forward to menopause as awful as it will undoubtable be because then I will be off the rollercoaster that my periods bring me each month. I am under the care of a Gynae for PMDD and it was him that decided the lump needed to be investigated urgently, showed a colleague who agreed and referred me to the breast clinic at hospital on an urgent appt. For months I've felt so tired and had the sugar cravings, I thought it was my thuroid but tests for that showed me being in the normal range. The lump is small and hard.  I just wondered if the sweet craving (and subsequent weight gain) could be a symptom of BC. I've always had a sweet tooth but it's gone into overdrive lately",

So apart from the lump, I have felt so very tired for the past few months, craved sugar like you wouldn't believe and put a stone on (probably related to the sugar) memory problems. People often talk about weight loss but has anyone ever put weight on before diagnosis? I have a deep down feeling that I have cancer but the weight gain thing makes me think perhaps not. Wish my appt would hurry up and get here! Log in to post a reply",
