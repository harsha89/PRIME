I've decided to give myself permission to be a little lazy and self-indulgent until I get my results on Friday.  I took a trip to the library and checked out some good books and I'm going to let the housework slide a little and escape into some good fiction.  I bought myself a new sports bra in a pretty aqua color just because.  I  needed a new one anyway because I'm training for a 10K -- but I decided to splurge on something pretty just so I'd have it to wear after the biopsy. I do feel much more relaxed now about the whole thing because I realize that it really is okay to feel a little scared even if the odds are greatly in my favor.  I'm only human.  I was worried that I was overreacting and reading the posts on here makes me feel more ordinary. Thank you!",

The procedure itself was much better than I thought it would be.  The numbing part was painful.  Not the actual shot, but the medicine burned as it went in.  It wasn't unbearable, but it did hurt.  I didn't feel anything for the biopsy part though.  They took 3 samples and then put in the clip.  Of course, since I am afraid of needles, I kept my eyes closed the entire time.    Then they took some mammogram pics to make sure I wasn't bleeding internally, but it didn't hurt because I was still numb. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I have a lot more pain with my yearly gyno exam than this ... I'm not sure what to think about the actual biopsy.  I won't find out until Monday afternoon.  It is going to be a long weekend.  They took 3 samples and I have no idea if that is normal or not for a complex cyst.  The lady who was doing the ultrasound had done my previous ultrasound 2 days before.  She didn't recognize me by my face but told me she recognized me by my ultrasound image.  What the hell does that mean?  I hope my paranoid mind is reading more into that than I should.  She was probably just making small talk, but still. Still hopeful it is benign, but I'm sure I'll be bouncing back and forth between benign and worst case scenario all weekend long.  At least I don't have to vacuum for a couple of days :)",

I will be so glad to get the results on Monday.  I am really starting to get overwhelmed with worry.  A couple of years ago, I had a scare with a swollen lymph node above my collarbone.  I had a mammogram then and it was fine.  And I saw a general surgeon and he said it didn't feel like anything to worry about and it would probably go away.  We both thought it was caused by an allergic reaction to the flu shot.  I waited a year, went back because it was still there and he pretty much patronized me about still worrying about my little \"peanut\", as he called it.  I left embarrassed and in tears.  I felt like I was a hypochondriac.  Now I'm wondering if I should have been more assertive about it.  I had a normal mammogram this year, too, but because my state passed a new law in July 2012, I was informed for the first time I have dense breast tissue and I was referred for an ultrasound which led to the biopsy.  It could be totally unrelated and the enlarged lymph node may be really have just been from the flu shot.  But it is still there and now I'm starting to worry that I should have had it biopsied 2 years ago. I know everyone goes through this worry and second guessing, but the longer I have to wait for results the more these thoughts keep creeping in.",

My biopsy is at 2:30 and it seems like time is in slow motion.  Will be SO glad when the biopsy is over and I get the results. Irish, good luck with your lumpectomy today.  I can imagine that it is so very stressful to be dealing with two issues at once.  Hope you were able to get some rest and I hope that things go well for you.",

Every single time the phone rings I literally jump out of fear.  I've even been so scared today that my heart has been racing and I've been trembling at times.  If I had any idea how anxiety ridden I would be during this, I would have asked the doctor for some kind of anti-anxiety medicine.  I'm a mess.  I'm a room parent for my daughter's class and, of course, today would be the day that the other room parent has to call me several times to coordinate an event coming up.  I'm sure she thinks I am a total flake because I can't seem to concentrate or make a decision on any of the stuff.  I almost told her about it, but then didn't because I'm afraid her daughter will get wind of it accidentally and then my daughter will freak out if she hears something like that.  Hopefully next week we can have a laugh about what a spaz I was on the phone.

But, at least it said benign.  That is better than the alternative schatziebest, I know exactly what you mean about the worry and the fact that other people tell you it will all be okay doesn't really help at all.  Even though they are very well meaning, it just doesn't help.  I've found the reassurances here to be much more calming because the women here have been through exactly what we are going through and they get it.  It helps tremendously to know I can come here and vent and be scared or mad or whatever without having to care if my feelings are causing anyone else to worry, too.  Praying everything goes well for you, too.  Praying it goes well for everyone here.",
