The Architectural Distortion that showed up in my regular mammogram was a change from last year. Upon doing the diagnostic \u201cspot compression\" today, the AD flattened out and was determined to be normal tissue. The research on AD that I did prior to today's test had me quite scared. I think it's important to share that I learned that Architectural Distortion is a vague term that can end up being a number of things other than cancer. I am 62 years old and have never had a call-back before now, so it was quite nerve racking. I hold good thoughts for anyone going through this same scare; it's good to be prepared for whatever the result may be, but as I was told at my exam, many call-backs for architectural distortion turn out to be benign ",
