      "Content": "Macchick wrote: Hi, I'm about 6 weeks out from a bilateral mx and just this week I noticed multiple cords running down both sides of my trunk (torso).  Interestingly the cords appeared on my prophylactic side (no nodes removed) as well as the cancer side.  I thought I read somewhere that there might be a higher correlation between axillary cording and arm LE, so given this, do or did those of you out there with truncal lymphedema experience cording in your trunk before, during or after your truncal LE diagnosis?  Also, I'm trying not to be paranoid about LE.  It's just something that hangs over you, albeit not as serious as the possibility of recurrence, but still LE is one thing that I feel I can be on the look out for, and possibly prevent. I've really appreciated this board and all you lovely folks out there willing to share your stuff. Log in to post a reply",

What is this?  Would someone mind describing it to me?  I'm asking because I'm having surgery in a couple weeks and had not heard about this before.  Not planning reconstruction ever because I want to have some feeling in my chest.  I'm not a skinny woman but not fat either.  Sort of medium to slightly overweight.   Does this fat shelf, which I'm picturing as not so nice, ever go away?  Sorry if this has been done in another thread but just focusing on the fat shelf topic might be helpful to me.
