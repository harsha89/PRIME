Hope everyone gets to have some fun this summer.  I was afraid to book the Cancun trip but what the heck, trip insurance was only $125 for both my husband and I and I guess it's well worth it. So for today I will say Ahoy Maties as I leave for my boating adventure! (I wonder what the bathrooms are like......) Much love, SusanR",

Friday afternoon I had a CT Scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis and those were all clean.  Of course I'm thrilled for that but am blown away by 5 new bone mets since June.  I'm having trouble taking it in and wrapping my head around it. I always knew I was one of the lucky ones to have a single bone met and now I'm wondering if my luck just ran out? Does this put me in the pool with all the other statistics now? Even though I don't hang on those stats, of course I think of them. I'll be starting on Faslodex this week and will continue the Zometa. I'm scared, I'm sad, I'm having trouble focusing. I'm thinking about giving up the full time stressful job, I think it might be time?  So many thoughts are racing around in my head.  How long before it goes to a vital organ?  What's the average run on Faslodex?  Thanks for being here.  You are all the best!!

I had recently begun thinking about leaving work even before these scans that showed progression.  I've worked for the same company for 25 years and they have been extremely good to me.  I work in healthcare, in an administrative type job that involves mostly patient information and auditing charts so working from home is not a viable option as I can't take patient info out of the hospital.  I also commute an hour each way to work.  Those 2 hours of driving (longer in the winter) and an 8-10 hour day are sapping the heck out of me, even on days when I feel good. Though I have loved my job and have excelled at my career, I found myself living scan to scan and telling myself that I would let work go if I had any type of progression.  It was a bargaining tool I was using to continue in a frustrating stressful job.  Also, I have not wanted to leave the world of work too soon.  You know how you feel like you have a foot in each world? One in the work world and one in the staying home and enjoying whatever life holds for me world?  I don't want to leave either world too soon.  If I leave work and live a long time will it be a financial burden?  If I don't leave work and the cancer progresses quickly for me, will I  miss the chance I might have had to spend quality time with granchildren etc.  So my bargaining tool has come to light.  I find myself having progression and feeling like I need to be true to myself.  Progression has come and I told myself I would stop working and live life outside of work.  I think I've already made the decision, the question is when?  I want to finish things up, I coordinate a yearly medical symposium that is in mid November and is one of the highlights of what I do well.  I'm thinking I'll talk to my financial guy and a benefits coordinator with the hospital to find out if based on any benefit changes it's best to go out before the end of the year or in the beginning of the new year. Just typing this out makes me feel better.  Thanks all for being here. Much love, SusanR",

I'm 56 and after 26 years as a Registered Nurse, went out on disability/retirement in Dec, 2011.  I have one son (33) and fabulous DIL with baby number 3 coming in May.  I am also a surrogate mom/gramdma to my niece (37) and her 2 children since my sister died at 44 and my niece was only 19 and still needed a \"mom\".  She and my son and their families are my joy in life.  I am married, but in name as only he's an active alcoholic and I can't seem to leave him behind after 38 years of marriage and the need for financial and insurance benefits (that sounds terrible doesn't it???) but I'll save that for another post! I was diagnosed Stage IIB in 2002 and had bilateral mastectomy, chemo and radiation.  Had bilateral DIEP reconstruction in New Orleans in 2006 (fabulous!) and in 2008 became Stage IV with single bone mets to hip which was replaced in 2009.  Treated with Femara and Zometa until multiple new bone mets in spine, skull and rib were found in 2011 them switched to Fasolodex and Zometa and have been stable since.  Made the decision to enjoy life after that and went out on permanent Disabiliity in late Dec of 2011 and have not a single moment of regret about leaving work.  I love being home and being a Grandma and doing things with friends and family.  Vacationed in Hawaii, Cancun, Omaha to see my sister and Virginia for my Aunt's 95th Birthday in 2012 and am planning an Alaskan Cruise this summer. Cashed in on a substantial Life Insurance policy from employer using Accelerated Benefits and I am making some financial plans for the future but I'm also enjoying a sigh of relief financially.  If not for this group of ladies I would never have known about the option of taking my Life Insurance early! I am so blessed to have found this group and to have the knowledge, support and compassion of each of them in whatever way possible. Much love, SusanR",

I hope  you have a long run with the Femara as well.  Good luck to you. SusanR",

I have been dealing with a kidney stone that shows up on every CT.  For a few years it was 2-3 mms and not obstructing anything, then it was 4mms, in April it was 8mms and I saw a Urologist who said since it's not bothering anything we could watch it a few more months.  Well it's now 12mms or 1.2cms.  I think the little bas@#$tard is going to have to go soon and I'm not relishing the idea of having it blasted.  Did all of that in 2007 and it was a mess cuz' it wouldn't break up and eventually I had to have surgery to go up into the kidney and blast it from inside.  I guess this falls under the category of \"if it's not one thing, it's another\".   Again, my lovely ladies, thanks for your words of support and hope while I was waiting for my scans, it means the world to me to know you are here.

      "Content": "SusanR wrote: Question for any of you with Pevic Bone Mets.  I was diagnosed with Bone Mets in Dec. 2008 and in June 2009 I had a hip replacement for stress fractures that wouldn't heal.  I am now having serious pain in my lower pelvic bone that feels similar and hurts mostly when I take a step.  I'm not in much pain when I am sitting quietly.  I saw my Ortho  last Monday because of the pain but at the time it was mostly generalized in the hip area and he put me on anti-inflammatories thinking it sounded like bursitis.  When he was looking at the X-Ray he seemed focused on the hardware and hip parts he had replaced to be sure nothing had shifted or moved out of whack.  In fact it wasn't until he was done looking and had shut the machine off that he asked me why he did the hip replacement,  maybe assuming it  was for arthritis.  When I told him it was for Stage IV he said he didn't see anything alarming. I'm thinking I should call the office tomorrow and ask him to look again to be sure there isn't a small fracture in my pelvis that he might not have been looking for. What do you ladies think?  Anyone with pelvic mets have pain that resolves when sitting or lying down?  The anti-inflammatory is definitely helping with the generalized hip pain, but not the pelvic pain, in fact that seems a bit worse with each day and it all started on Mother's Day so that's a few weeks now. I know I'm answering my own questions here and will call tomorrow and see if I get some answers.  Maybe just putting it in writing was enough to sound my own alarms!!  Would love to hear from any of you even if just for moral support!

My Stage IV mets was originally to my right hip and I ended up having the hip replaced due to stress fractures that wouldn't heal.  I got a 3 year run on Femara and Zometa until this past October when I had progression to numerous bones, so now I'm on Fasolodex and Zometa and scans last week showed the bone mets are stable after 12 weeks on this treatment.  I'm hoping for another 3 year run or longer on this combo!!  I recently went on Disability from my full time job and I'm anxious about how it wil work financially, but my faith sustains me.

Being a grandmother to my little ones is what keeps me going every day,  It's why I take treatments and try to stay alive.  If not for them I think I would say never mind, that's enough!

Some financial worries have turned out OK and I am at peace.  I also have to pinch myself some mornings when I don't have to fight to make the one hour commute, find a parking space with 4000 other people, and then make the long trek into my office.  It was brutal and the work pace and stress were brutal.  I am still 6 months later trying to find my rhythhm.  Some days I think I have it figured out and can plan even the simplest of days and then pain or treatments  send everything out the window and I take a nap!!  And you know what?  Taking a nap is just fine and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to do it!  I am convinced that I will live longer because I retired.
