Mostly in my neck, abdominal and chest muscles. I am only taking Claritan and Tylenol for Neulasta shot. My energy has been better with Taxol. No mouth sores or Neuropathy signs. I hope this continues through the next 3 treatments. I have been able to exercise yesterday and today. It is helping with the soreness. Scared I had that really bad indigestion and I told my MO I would not continue to take Dexamethason since he says that was the cause. I have not had any issues since. Not sure if this is your problem but steroids are not required to get through Chemo.  ",

We will see what the next few days bring. I actually feel better at this point than I did with AC. Not so foggy. I spoke with my MO about neuropathy and he said to let him know of the 1st signs of it and he will make the necessary adjustments. I told him my job requires that I use a mouse for 12 hours and need my hands to write logs. I believe he will make sure that it will not become debilitating or permanent. I will stop treatment before I jeopardize my job and he knows that. Keep on going girls. You got this!",

I only had to take a few since that first infusion that was so bad. I also bottomed out with WBC even with Neulasta so they lowered my AC dose. I guess that's why I continue Neulasta with Taxol.

I went to my third IV infusion this week today because evidently I had a bad reaction to the steroid that I took for 3 days following chemo. I had horrible indigestion where it was burning from the pit of my stomach to the back of my throat. I got sick 2 times. Pepcid was not touching it so doc prescribed Prilocec. Ulcers all over my tongue. Pain in all of my surgery sites. On top of all that I got a UTI. My white blood cells are very low so I have been on Antibiotics for 3 days now and told to stay away from the world. I am on the way back up being able to eat now. I lost 5 lbs in less than a week so I got a lot of eating to do. I had no SE's to Neulasta but I did take Claritan. Not sure what next week will bring with my 2nd AC infusion scheduled for the 21st.
