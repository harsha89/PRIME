I went in to see my doctor a month ago when I found a soft lump under my left breast where my bra wire runs.  She did an ultra sound and it was fine.  I went back  last week do to it was still there and hurting me.  I had a CT scan with and with out contrast.  The spot on my left side was nothing but they found other things.  They found round nodular structure anterior to the spleen measuring 17 mm, an astymmetric nodularity in the inferior lateral aspect of the right breast of 1 mm ( arm pit area), a 2.5 cm cyst in the right ovari that is a ovarian cyst and sub-cm hypodensity in the dome of the right lobe of the liver that is likely a hepatic cyst.  I have ultra sound tomorrow on my liver and ovary and a mammo on 12-30-08.  What do you think?  Any advice or comments?  Log in to post a reply",
