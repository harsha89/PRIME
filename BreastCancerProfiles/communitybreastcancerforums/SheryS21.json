First of all I don't want to upset them (and I still don't know the results). And second because they'll make this a very very big deal and I can't handle this right now. It's just hard talking to them on the phone and pretending that everything is fine, or having a bad day or having a cold if I was crying prior to the phone call and sound strange and havingto do this for two weeks until I know for sure which way I'll go. I only told my husband and I'm really grateful because he is really supportive and he offered to help in anyway possible to make me feel better. There was this day that I tried to pretend that everything is going to be fine and to think positively so that I can stay calm and I was able to do that but when I got up the next day I cried all day long. I have to say after reading what you all wrote I feel much better. I'll be meeting with the surgeon this Thursday and biopsy will be the following Tuesday. And if the results come out after three days I'll get them on Friday.",

My pcp told me that I have DCIS and I should meet with the surgeon to find out my options. I will be meeting with one surgeon next week and with another the following week. I put my life on hold waiting for the results and now I'm trying to figure out what I will do next. I feel it's like a nightmare that will never end. My guess is that I'll be getting a lumpectomy and radiation. I hope I can get through everything.",

I'm not sure how I'll wait for the results when I get the biopsy. They told me it'll take only 3 days. But why do they want me to meet a surgeon prior to my biopsy? Anyway I'll be meeting with the surgeon this Thursday. I hope she can make me feel better. When I went to take the mammogram I don't know why I assumed that everything will be fine but I was wrong. I've had this allergy that started a year ago after my first mammogram and especially after their phone call when they told me that I need to come back and do more imaging. I went to a couple of doctors, they don't know where this is coming from.... I wonder if this is from my anxiety or something relating to this. Even though I'm terrified from the biopsy I just want to get over with it",

When I asked her about the needle she told me it's not small so I'm guessing and after research they'll be doing the core biopsy. I'm scared to death from everything. Yesterday I tried not to worry but I can't do it anymore. I even cried at work today and tried to hide myself from my coworkers. This is something that will change my life. The doctor told me that need to meet with a surgeon first before the biopsy and this worried me more. I cried all the time and felt so sick and had a hard time swallowing and when I tried to swallow I don't know how to explain it but as if something really sharp hurting me in the back of my mouth on the left side and so had to take 4 advil and still the pain is present. I don't know if I should go to a doctor or this only came from stress and anxiety. I read my results and it said Bi-rads category 4. It says that my calcification increased from my last screening. I don't know what to do. Please help me. Why do I have to go to a surgeon first? Should I go if they find something. I feel as if I can't breathe anymore.
