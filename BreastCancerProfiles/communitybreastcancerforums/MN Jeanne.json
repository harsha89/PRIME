Seriously I do love to garden, but right now there is so much to do that it is daunting and I don't know if I am up to it. If you really want to garden--plant things, pull weed etc and finally get to enjoy them--you can always come and help me in the spring.  There's always plenty to do. Really, everyone, I am so glad to have all of you to talk with.  It helps me to face all of this.  All the information you have is sooooo amazing. Thank you all.",

I thought my surgery was a piece of cake--just a lumpectomy (or as I described it a small breast reduction surgery on the left side) and I had virtually no pain after it.  I took a week off afterwards and it felt like a vacation with my favorite sister here from California to stay with me.  Three weeks post surgery I was sure that it was all going to be so easy.  I have the patience of a gnat, so I just wanted to start the chemo and get it over with. But now I am not so sure.  If three weeks after surgery one hour of easy garden work exhausted me, what will chemo do to me.  Darn, I HATE BEING SICK!!! I called a friend who calmed me down.  But I think my denial is slipping...",

Lots of good information here. I start Chemo Sept 4th.  TCH X 6 once every 3 weeks then H every 3 weeks for balance of year.  Obviously I don't know all the right terminology.  So far I am not too freaked out, but that may just be my denial mechanism--if I don't think it will hurt, then it won't. To get a port or not get a port, that is the question?  People keep asking me about that.  How do you decide?  I don't relish the thought of of basically having a hole in my chest, but I am not over fond of needles either.",

My friend took me there and stayed for awhile and then came back to get me.  The time in between was good because there were so many people there to talk to. One women went through the same treatment a year ago. She now just has one more Herception infusion--in three weeks.  She was great and gave me lots of information about what happens.  She also has me really thinking hard about getting a port.  She says that it is absolutely the way to go.  She even showed me what it looks like when not in use and it doesn't look scary like I thought it would.  After having the IV in for hours, I found it is quite hampering.  She also showed me one way to tie a scarf, so maybe I will get a new look.  I think I made a new friend today--we exchanged e-mails and telephone numbers.  And we have a love of reading in common--that's how we started talking.  We both read a lot of mysteries. Actually, there were a lot of cool ladies there.  Some just made me feel better because they have so much more to go through than I do. So far there is no nausea, I am just tired.  I'll see what tomorrow brings.  I'll be sure to take my steroids. Did I mention that my friend who took me is also a \"slave driver\"?  After we got home, she and another friend finished the stone walls we have been building.  I wasn't any help though.  I just pottered around and rested--mostly rested and drank ginger ale.  After the walls were done, she decided that I still needed more fresh air (it was a beautiful day) and a little more exercise.  So more weeds were yanked out of the ground.  After all, the weeds don't like very nice in the lovely new planting bed that now resides between the walls.  Sooner or later she will prod me to get it planted  *sigh*.  Oh well, I hear exercise is actually good for me...who knew? Now I think I will retire to my couch and watch my favorite baseball team (Minnesota Twins) lose to the Cleveland Indians.   Sorry I rambled so much.",
