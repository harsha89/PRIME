My husband knows, but he is the first one to admit he doesn't handle people who are sick well. My kids are in their upper teens. Not sure if I should just be honest with them all or wait. And if I wait and the news is not good, will they be mad that I excluded them from everything and not trust me in the future to be honest with them? And if the news is good, would I be putting them through worry for nothing? Log in to post a reply",

I could not even get an answer as to what specifically did they see that makes me a Birad 4. All she would say is that it is a suspicious abnormality. What makes it suspicious I asked? Its suspicious nature. I like to know the whys. And if I cannot get answers or have my mind eased about the simple stuff, she is not someone I would want to put in charge of my treatment. Ultimately everyone has to make their own decisions about how to proceed. I kind of like to do that with information to guide me. And by someone who does not make me feel like I am a big baby for being scared.",

As I sat listening to that doctor, I just kept hearing the phrase \"Run Forrest, RUN!\" go through my head. I asked around and got the name of a breast surgeon from a friend who knows someone who was very happy with her doctor. I was told I will have to wait a long time for an appointment but she is worth the wait. Meanwhile I have an appointment at a thermography place to see what that shows.",

      "Content": "Jun 24, 2007 09:30AM videochicke wrote: I had one done and found the info very useful. As far as the procedure, the room itself is 70 degrees. You have to acclimate in it for a period of time without a shirt on. Not a big deal at all. One thing that can show up on these in angiogenisis--the increased blood supply around a tumor. The cysts the dr had questioned in me are cool on the thermogram. But an area just to the side of my breast showed a 4 degree c difference from one side to the other on the chest wall below my armpit. And when I felt around the area afterwards, there is indeed a little lump there that went undetected by the mammogram as it is just outside the breast and the ultrasound tech didn't scan that area either. So next for me is an MRI to see what is going on in the area missed by the mammogram and ultrasound but detected on the thermogram. A thermogram can see an increased blood flow to an area before it shows up as a tumor or cyst. And in my case, it detected an abnormality that both the mammogram and ultrasound missed. The cost was $275 and was well worth the additional info to me and if something is wrong, might very well have saved my life. And statistically, 65-85 percent of people who are a \"TH4\" end up with breast cancer 5-7 years down the road, so even if it is nothing at this point, I know to make some lifestyle changes now to try to prevent something in the future. Bottom line, there is nothing about getting a thermogram that can hurt you (no radiation, no drugs, no needles, no nothing) so what harm at all is there in having more info than you had before? And mine showed a problem that the other tests missed.",

Had a blood test a couple of weeks ago and I have 6 needle wounds and had much bruising. Then they move it around in there and still can't get it. Then they try a different nurse, different arm etc etc. Did have sedation for one procedure once. It had a weird effect. I still felt everything they were doing to me, but was so out of it I could not respond to anything or tell them something hurt or to stop. It was a very scary feeling not to be able to communicate or to even move your hands, but still be totally aware of what they were doing and feel all the pain. I heard them say how the medicine had calmed me right down, and all I could think it did nothing! Everything still hurt, I was still just as scared but I couldn't tell them. I honestly don't know what I am going to do about this. The person who makes the appointments was out today, so I am supposed to call them back during the week.",

This may sound very stupid, but I am deathly afraid of needles. I passed out holding my own child when she was little when she got a vaccination. (told the dr I am afraid of needles and should not hold her but he didn't listen) I got sick when my dog got a shot in the other room. I have become woozy just seeing a tray of needles on a tv show. I know it is stupid, it has nothing to do with the pain, but I just can't do needles without falling apart. The fear of needles is so paralyzing I won't make an appointment for a biopsy.
