Thanks to everyone that responded to my posts and gave me opinions, comfort and prayers. This has been a very stressful time, and I truly feel that this forum was a tremendous help. I hope God blesses each and everyone of you on this site. I am so happy to report that my biopsy came back negative. I go back in 6 months, and I am going to enjoy life for a while. I'll be thinking of all those I connected with here. I hope you all get the results that I did. Hugs! Log in to post a reply",

I pick up my films tomorrow. I was thinking of looking at them also to do some comparisons, although, I really have no idea what to look for. Good luck to you.",
