    "Content": "Jan 15, 2016 04:39PM - edited Jan 15, 2016 04:40PM by Pattit I'm with you ladies on this one. Although I've finished chemo Dec.1st,my stomach hasn't been the same since. Now on my 3rd day of radiation out of 5 weeks, I've noticed a queasy feeling along with diarrhea. I've always said the dr.'s don't tell you everything. I don't know but I'm tired of feeling tired. This trip has been going on since last June when I was diagnosed with IDC stage 1 grade 3. I had a lumpectomy. We all want to feel good again. Cheers & best wishes to all. üåªüçÄüéÄ",
