Interesting that you are still sleeping in yours. xxyzed, I was only kept in the hospital overnight. Was there any special reason you were in for 8 days or is that just a difference in our medical systems? chemist, I would think another recent major surgery would slow down recovery. That's a lot of stress on your body. My husband attributes most of my brain fog to having had 3 surgeries with anesthesia over a few month period. One thing I am enjoying is my new flat chest.

I'd go without anything but then it rubs against my shirt and also gets irritated. This too shall pass... and most likely be replaced by some new weird sensation LOL.

I had only one sentinal node removed and that was about 6 weeks prior to my mastectomy. Nonetheless, I developed cording in my right armpit. I'm about 3 weeks into PT and it is helping immensely. I'll be interested to hear what your physical therapist says. Great that she has experience with post-mastectomy therapy! notmyself: I am numb in one armpit.

I had a lumpectomy first, followed by a re-excision, but there was DCIS in the margins both times. Had I still opted for radiation instead of more surgery, my risk would have been greater than I wanted. I was told that I can still get breast cancer even with my BMX. The reason is that individual breast tissue cells can be other places in your body. Mine was also HER2 but the tumor was too small to have much proven treatment value (chemo/herceptin) so I did not go that route. I am still waiting for the path report post-mastectomy but it is unlikely I will require radiation. Looking at your stats, your cancer was small, early stage and with clean margins and nodes. Your oncologist can best advise but from what I've learned, I don't believe you will see a statistical benefit for mastectomy. I met with a plastic surgeon but did not opt for reconstruction. My PC told me that a really good result requires dedication and time. I definitely lack the dedication, especially as it requires more surgeries. Age is just a number - my PC recently did reconstruction on a 77 year old woman. Best of luck with your research and decisions.. you'll learn a lot on this forum! Luna   ",

I've had a right breast lumpectomy plus sentinel node removal (for IDC) which was followed by a re-excision. Both times the margins contained diffuse DCIS. Also, mine is estrogen positive and HER2 positive but no treatment for the HER2 because the IDC was small enough that studies don't prove enough value given some of the possible complications at my age/health risks. I am now scheduled Tuesday for a bi-lateral mastectomy (my choice given the options and recurrence risk). No more nodes will be removed and I am not opting for reconstruction. Answering my post-surgery questions, my surgeon said I should be able to wash my hair at the sink and lift my arms to do some quick styling. ( I know, of all the things to be worried about, having my hair clean and fluffed should be the least of it. ) Does anyone have experience with \"simple\".. and does that make much of a difference in post-surgery mobility?
