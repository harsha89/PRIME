If you like your onc, you can tell him to be more upfront with you and make it clear that you do want to know all your blood test results.  There are a lot of good points that have been posted on your thread.  I hope they help you.  Keep posting and let us know how things are going for you.  Warm thoughts.

This week coming up is my week off, so I'll start my 12th cycle the week after. I don't get much as far as nausea goes, but I can get foot cramps if I don't keep well hydrated. Neuropathy is another issue I have, but had neuropathy from previous chemo drugs too. Fatigue is part of my routine, but I nap when I'm tired. I have not changed my diet with the exception of given up milk. I have a small amount of milk in my coffee but that's eat and I go real easy on cheese. Milk can add to congestion, so it was to help my lungs. I hope your regimen goes well for you. I hope you all enjoyed Thanksgiving and have a good weekend. Jean",

Nine years later I had metastatic disease to sternum. Two years into stage IV treatment, a left mammogram showed a second diagnosis of bc in the left breast. I had the option of monitoring or mastectomy. I opted for mastectomy and a hidden tumor was found millimeters away from the chest wall, so I was happy I opted for removal.

Eyelashes filter dust particles from reaching your eyes, so not having those eyelashes means irritated eyes too. And, let's not forget the eyebrows. A couple months ago I had to get my license renewed. I carefully drew on my eyebrows , used a little eyeliner to define my eyes and put on a nice cap that brought out my eye color. By the time I got to the DMV and got my pic taken, one eyebrow had smeared off so now I've got a driver's license with one eyebrow on, one eyebrow off.

I had sternum radiation in 2009 and developed skin mets in 2011 near a mx scar.  I have never had radiation to the skin mets.  Progression other than the skin mets have had me in chemotherapy.  Some of the chemo has shrunk back some of the skin mets, but they have never completely disappeared.  I recently had new mets pop up in the peritoneum so I've just switched to Halaven and was curious as to whether or not Halaven would effect the skin mets.  Onc uses the skin mets as sort of a marker and does examine them once a month.  I don't know what radiation recall is so I can't contribute anything to that.  Sorry you are having to deal with the issue of skin mets.  I do hope your next scans are stable and the skin mets are coincidental.  I don't think they are dangerous but yes \"blech.\"  Jean Edited by Mods to make link hot.",
