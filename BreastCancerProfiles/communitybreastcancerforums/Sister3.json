I agree with you all about the \"cumulative\" thing.  Don't need to hear that one any more. Here's a couple more that are already getting old: \"I knew someone who had chemo & THEY didn't lose their hair.\"  Just what I need right now, a fairy tale. \"You've got to keep a good attitude.\"  Spoken by people who haven't a clue what you are going through.  Better be careful about throwing that remark out at me in a couple months. Oh well, I did pretty well with the first AC yesterday.  Just minor SE's.  Had the neulasta today and seem to be okay there, too.  Or, is that \"cumulative\", too? ",
