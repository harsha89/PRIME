It turned out to be a papilloma (benign--not cancer). During my work up, several doctors and nurses cautioned me that women should NOT to squeeze their breasts or nipples to \"check for\" discharge as it can actually cause a discharge. If you try to leave your breast alone, wear a good bra (tuck a white tissue in front of each nipple to monitor spontaneous discharge), and see your doctor, I'm certain all shall be well. Good luck and let us know how it goes.",

Then when I got the good news, I was relieved. But suddenly I felt all those previous plans, responsibilities, and my normal future (before the scare) come crashing back down on me all at once. It was like, \"Oh, I don't have cancer. You mean I actually have to be a responsible adult again?\" During the diagnosis process, the idea of \"cancer / no cancer\" had been my constant \"thought companion\" and I put everything else, and everyone else, and every thought else aside. The return to the reality was like the ice bucket challenge everyone was doing a while back. So Egads--I know this is a bit of an old thread. But I'm so happy for your good results and totally get the reaction!",

      "Content": "DeepWaters wrote: Hi all, I had surgery under a general to remove multiple pappiloma from behind the nipple in my right breast. The incision was in a crescent shape right along the line where my breast skin meets my areola. The bruising, swelling, and such were not nearly as bad as the MRI guided biopsy I'd had to diagnose the pappiloma. The surgery and recovery went well and I continue to receive the \"bingo diagnosis\" (B9) So now that the swelling has gone away and my skin has returned to it's normal color, I have developed a \"dent\" in my breast just on the outside of my areola. In addition I have an area of tough, thicker skin beneath the surgery area as well. When Iook down, it looks like someone took a bite out of my breast (which I guess is pretty much what happened. My question is, does this dent generally fill in and does the thicker, tough area of skin beneath the dent ever soften up? Thanks in advance! Deep Waters Log in to post a reply",
