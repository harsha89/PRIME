I will try to relax but I dread tomorrow's ultrasound, especially because of the pain. My dr recommended I take 2 percocet and have someone drive me. So I will then be totally out of my mind I guess I wont feel the pain...LOL Thanks again for the virtual shoulder :)",

I also found out that they have been seeing a cluster of cyst which they are calling complicated. I'm confused by this term however the nurse told me after my ultrasound, and the mammogram (Nov 11) I need to come in and see the Breast Dr, they will then have all the result. I asked about the pain I have been having going on 3 weeks now, she said just take Advil. I am not happy with the answers I am getting. I have not been able to exercise, take my Zumba class and I am wearing a sports bra 24/7 because they feel heavy as hell and swollen, almost to having to tip toe. If I keep having pain by Nov 11th, I will not do the mammogram, that is just too much pain. I also asked her, if I have to come back every 6mos because of this cluster of cyst, why not just take them out, so I wont have the risk of the pain I am going thru now? Okay, sorry, Im just confused, maybe im exaggerating....",
