I definitely understand the frustration though when you think it's a good thing and you're told it's not.  I always told my clients not to deny themselves certain foods but remember the three steps \"balance, variety, moderation\" with MODERATION being the biggest point (IMHO).  I know that these days I really struggle with \"proper\" eating and I am very short on my proteins lately.  Nobody is perfect.  I found and excellent book in the library at the cancer centre that I think I will purchase: Eating Well Through Cancer, Easy Recipes and Recommendations During & After Treatment by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello, MD.

Eileen - it will be fine...Really!!  I cut my hair short to begin with, but had my DH buzz it when it because a nuisance (around day 14 I think).  I remember a clump of hair fell in my morning coffee ...NOT COOL ...that was the deciding factor for me.  Like Lago says, you won't be a year without hair.  Mine started to reappear while I was still finishing my taxotere, last chemo was Feb 2 of last year and I went topless Easter weekend which was April 23rd.",

My DH thinks they \"screwed up\" but I think that it's placement depends on what shows up for veins and the way you are put together once they get started.  It's not very hideable, but oh well!",

Edited to add:  I'm in Canada so our regime is a little different, but the medications are all similar.  I am ER/PR- and Her2+ as well.  I did FEC-D chemo x 6, Herceptin x 18 + rads.",

I have been very VERY lazy - don't even bother with a touch of makeup anymore.  Considering I am heading back to work soon I'm thinking I should start getting my look a little more polished!!  Actually...I think like that everytime I see your pics - you always look perfect. Edited to add:  Ok, I'm on my own tonight so for entertainment perhaps I shall get all made up and see if remember how to pull it off LOL!!",

I also found that once my hair was all gone, my scalp was much more comfortable.  I started by cutting my hair to a shorter style, then once it was falling out to the point that it was a nuisance, my dh buzzed it for me and then a day or two later he took a piece of duct tape and removed all the stubble ",

I'm one of the classic cases who walked into the surgeons office and demanded \"just take them both off...\".  My surgeon was excellent - you could tell by her face that she had definitely heard this before.  She talked me down off my ledge and went about explaining all my options, outcomes, etc., and in the end I had a lumpectomy.   My tumour was 4cm and any bigger would have taken my choice away, but after looking at the MRI, my BS felt she could get it all.  That was our deal...if she didn't get clean margins at the first surgery, then I wanted it off.  LOL we shook on it! Since the MRI also showed clear nodes (I still had a SNB), it was a good option and in her opinion, since I was heading into chemo, rads & Herceptin, she said it was in my best interest to go into the treatment as strong as possible, so why over-do the surgery if I didn't have to.  In the end, the choice was mine and I really feel comfortable with it, although there are those who think I made a mistake and it will be my demise. Anyway - you have found a good place, and lots of help and support. We will all help you through. ((hugs))",

I'm glad to hear that you get to keep your hair and won't end up onn perma-chemo.  Good stuff! Edited to add:  Did I mention I LOVE my port??",

It was sore going in, but coming out was nothing and I have a slight line and a dent where it was  but it's not overly noticeable.  I was able to bathe, swim, and maintain all activities which would not have been possible with a picc line - not to mention the risk of infection.",

I had to have the injections for the snb the day before surgery.  For me there were three shots (no dye) and to be honest they were quite painful, but they were quick about it.  They had me in a machine for 20 minutes and then were able to mark my sentinal node location for surgery.  I had two nodes removed along with my tumour.  Luckily, my surgeon was able to do it all with one incision which looks to be about 3-4\" inches long. So far so good, I wasn't really given specific exercises or anything but I am making sure I have range of motion in my arm - but no lifting or excessive movements.  The most discomfort I have had with this surgery was the shots the night before...your procedure may be different, they could have you frozen or under anaesthesia at that point. No worries, big hugs....it will be just fine and over before you know it.",

It also depends on the size of your tumour as well as the pathology of the cancer.  For me, even if I chose to have a mastectomy, because the cancer was an aggressive grade 3 and Her2+++, they wanted to do rads. It really wasn't bad. MUCH easier than chemo, and I guess for me, at least I know that I have done all that I can.",
