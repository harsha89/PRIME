I like your ideas about bringing food to friends, I will remember that.  I don't work, I have been a stay at home mom for 10 years now.  Funny, I used to work in the cytology lab where we would diagnose breast cancer and other things too.  Even used to go on fine needle aspirations and core biopsies, but because I was young and naive, didn't even think about what those poor women were going through.  Just did my job.  Sad.   This site is incredible with support and I feel so much better than before about all this.  Eithe way, what ever happens, there is someone here rooting for you!  Thanks. ",

Can't wait to let know how it goes.   I like your statement, \"hidden badge of courage\"  I may use that with my hubby later on.  I definitely don't want to forget what this feels like, because perhaps, whether or not this is something, I can help someone down the line too. Love you guys, Tiffany ",
