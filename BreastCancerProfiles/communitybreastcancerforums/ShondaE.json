I was in the hospital for 3 days because of having Bi-Lat and ovaries removed at the same time.  No reconstruction yet. My left are where they took 3 lymphnodes out (which were clean)YEAH..still hurts like crazy.  DH has been such a great support and never left the hospital while i was there.  He went back to work yesterday and only worked half a day becasue he dosen't  want me home alone all day yet. I fainted on him on Sunday when he was changing my drains.  I was sitting in a chair and next thing I Knew I was waking up on the floor sobbing hysterically...It's funny now but wasn't so funny when it first happened. I've been doing alot of sleeping, i can't seem to make it thru the day without several naps.  Hopefully that will go away soon. I hope everybody that has already had surgery is doing well, I need to read and catch up on how everybody is doing.  Everybody still going for surgery this month I will continue to send prayers and good thoughts your way.  Shonda",

I saw my Onco today for a 1 week follow-up after chemo and she said she can already feel a reduction in the tumor in my breast after one treatment, Man i was very happy to hear that, funny enough I have been afraid to touch the area that the tumor is on since I started all of this, I guess I didn't want to feel if it was getting any bigger. I'm glad to see everybody is doing pretty good with your treatments,  I will send positive thoughts and prayers your way. Shonda",
