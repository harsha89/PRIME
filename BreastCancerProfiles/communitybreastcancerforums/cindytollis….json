The one thing tht I was scared of was starting chemo. My Dr put me on taxatire, perjeta, an herceptin. The only side effects I felt were being very sleepy, but the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th treatment I didn't feel as sleepy so, if you are going or receiving chemo right now, let me know how you're doing. I've got 2 more to go, my last one is may 22nd..when I first found out my tumor marker was 3000, but after my 2nd round of chemo it dropped to 300..I give god all the credit, if god will drop one more zero, I will be perfect, bc 30 is perfect.
