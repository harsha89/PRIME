The breast where the biopsy was taken sure is sore. I keep taking Tylenol, hopefully it will get better tomorrow. I just wanted to give a shout out for moral support for all of us having to wait.

The only part that hurt was when the radiologist injected the lidocaine. I had my results in 2 days (benign), but the waiting was hard. Try to keep busy, keep your mind occupied on anything else. I still have pain in my lumpy breast too. I am waiting for another MRI. I will keep you in my prayers.",
