    "Content": "21 hours ago Betrayal wrote: dtad My Mo does tumor markers and I am stage 1. I asked why and she said she uses it as an early warning system. It is done in conjunction with other routine blood work so no harm done. So I think the decision to do these, no matter the stage, is based on the MO's experience. In this instance I defer to her decision.",
