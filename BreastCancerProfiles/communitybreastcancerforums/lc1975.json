September 19th I had my appointment and they said nothing but they wanted me to go for a mammo and US.  September 27th I had the mammo and US.  The US tech spoke to the radiologist and they said that it was just a cyst.  On October 4th I had a follow up with my breast specialist and he tried a blind aspiration...no fluid....just cells.  He sent them out for testing.  On October 17th I had my annual appointment with my obgyn and he had the results which were indicative of fibroadenoma and he suggested that I google it.  I did.  I was ok with that and was feeling ok about it...relieved...I had an answer.  .......i thought.  October 20th came.  I had another appointment with the breast specialist.  I went in feeling good.  He informed me that when he tried to aspirate he may have hit a fibroadenoma however THAT was not the lump that we are looking at and he is not comfortable with just letting it go (which is a good trait in a doctor) so he wanted me to have a US guided core biopsy done, which I had on October 26th.  They took about 5 samples.  Apparently I have VERY dense breasts because it wasn't easy to get to the lump.  Then they placed a chip in my breast (for a marker) and gave me another mammo to locate the chip.   I met with the specialist on the 27th and he told me that some of the cells came back normal and some came back atypical so the Pathologist sent them out for further testing.  I did feel better that he commented on how the lump looked different on this US than the last....I had mentioned that the lump felt bigger or more irregular and that it wasn't just my mind playing tricks on me.  He also informed me that he and the radiologist agreed that they want another biopsy done but that an MRI first would help them get a better idea of where in the lump to target.  So I have an MRI scheduled for November 11th. I think that if I KNEW the answer even if it isn't the one that I want that I would be less stressed.....the worst part is not knowing.... But they are cautiously optimistic...

Florid fibrocystic changes with usual type ductal hyperplasia and extensive sclerosing adenosis.  Some areas of the adenosis are associated with myxoid change in the breast stroma.  Focal papillomatosis and apocrine metaplasia with cyst formation are also present.  This lesion is consistent with sclerosing adenosis with foci of intraductal papilloma with secondary sclerosis and entrapment of epithelial elements of the papilloma.  That was in the first sample.  Sample B states there is florid fibrocystic change with extensive sclerosing adenosis, papillomatosis and usual type ductal hyperplasia also evidence of a duct rupture as well as apocrine metaplasia with focal cyst formation.  6 months ago I has another mammo and ultrasound (dense breasts really doesnt show anything)  I just had another MRI on Monday and friday the doctor informed me that there was an area that lit up in the same place as the lumpectomy.  He said that it was small maybe about 6 mm and that it could just be scar tissue and that we will schedule another MRI for february.  I have mixed feelings about all of this. ",

September 19th I had my appointment and they said nothing but they wanted me to go for a mammo and US.  September 27th I had the mammo and US.  The US tech spoke to the radiologist and they said that it was just a cyst.  On October 4th I had a follow up with my breast specialist and he tried a blind aspiration...no fluid....just cells.  He sent them out for testing.  On October 17th I had my annual appointment with my obgyn and he had the results which were indicative of fibroadenoma and he suggested that I google it.  I did.  I was ok with that and was feeling ok about it...relieved...I had an answer.  .......i thought.  October 20th came.  I had another appointment with the breast specialist.  I went in feeling good.  He informed me that when he tried to aspirate he may have hit a fibroadenoma however THAT was not the lump that we are looking at and he is not comfortable with just letting it go (which is a good trait in a doctor) so he wanted me to have a US guided core biopsy done, which I had on October 26th.  They took about 5 samples.  Apparently I have VERY dense breasts because it wasn't easy to get to the lump.  Then they placed a chip in my breast (for a marker) and gave me another mammo to locate the chip.   I met with the specialist on the 27th and he told me that some of the cells came back normal and some came back atypical so the Pathologist sent them out for further testing.  I did feel better that he commented on how the lump looked different on this US than the last....I had mentioned that the lump felt bigger or more irregular and that it wasn't just my mind playing tricks on me.  He also informed me that he and the radiologist agreed that they want another biopsy done but that an MRI first would help them get a better idea of where in the lump to target.  So I have an MRI scheduled for November 11th. I think that if I KNEW the answer even if it isn't the one that I want that I would be less stressed.....the worst part is not knowing.... But they are cautiously optimistic...
