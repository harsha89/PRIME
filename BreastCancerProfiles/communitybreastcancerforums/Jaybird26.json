I bought a bunch of hats and wraps. I'm still on the fence over cutting my hair short or taking it all off before I start to lose it. I hope everyone is having a good weekend.",

Well that was 3 months ago and a lot has changed. Right now I am to start ACT on October 2 after a lumpectomy and positive node biopsy. I have been reading a lot but now searching for assistance from others who have been down or are traveling this same path as me. These are some of my concerns if you can help. 1- waiting for port placement. What can I expect? 2- should I shave my hair before I start losing it? Will it help soften the blow? 3- are all the side effects I've been reading about the normal for the majority? What is the worst part of these? 4- eating habits? what to eat/avoid? 5- will I gain weight? 6- this is the hardest one for me.... How do I stay strong in regards to my son? I will be having a discussion with him very soon that will ultimately change his perfect young life right now. I am so afraid to be sick in front of him. Thankyou in advance for any assistance you can offer and any other advice will be greatly appreciated. 4- Dx 7/8/2013, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 10/2/2013 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",
