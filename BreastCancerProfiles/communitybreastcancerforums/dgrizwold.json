I elected to follow my dreams and get implants.... I always wanted them so well I had my surgery in September of this year... all went well for the first couple of weeks.. my breasts were even.... now... my radiated side is not dropping..... I understand that my left side ( my special side) :) will never look as good as my right..but I drive myself nuts wondering if there is ANYBODY out there anywhere that went through this? I also have a dent on the top of my breast as well where my tissue was taken out.. and I am now reading about fat injections...... I am Grateful to have got my b c early and want to be healthy...I also want to live my life, follow my dreams.. and again implants are something I always wanted... so anybody out there been through this or know of anybody that has it sure would be wonderful to speak with someone...... :) best wishes to all of you on this forum......
