They said I should be sore for a couple days. but geez & its really bad if I do not have my bra on. Was just wondering if it's normal to be hurting still. Log in to post a reply",

Thursday night while in the shower, I noticed this really hard fairly good size lump above the incision site. I called the surgeons office on Friday morning, They said it was normal & just to keep an eye on it. But not what to keep an eye out for. Well now its starting to hurt, I can not lay on my right side & even my arm brushing on it hurts, just touching it hurts. Every great once while there will be like a weird pain feeling in the same spot while nothing is touching it, but not often. It happened twice today. Is this normal or should I call the surgeon again tomorrow ? Log in to post a reply",
