Nan your hair loss experience would have made me cry too, & later I usually laugh at myself for getting so upset over things I have no control over. Kandy, like you, in 09 I went bald overnight. When I came out of my bedroom for breakfast and the shocked look on my 5 sons' faces were priceless, I had to laugh, which seemed to make them feel better. There is something about a bald head to make your dx real. I too hate wigs & am way more anxious this time thinking about it. I wore a pink, Uni of Florida ball cap mostly, I don't remember who gave it to me, but it turned out to be my favorite. I elected to wear it over a wig to my 20 yr HS reunion. My poor oncologist is probably going to drop me as a patient as I question her every move. ",

Your story sounds too much like my own. I did radiation last Oct thru Early Dec for bone mets to left hip & lower back. During treatment I had an episode of left femur pain that was over a 10. I was crying, took pain meds starting at 3 am, every hr with no relief. My mom was taking me to radiation, when I got to facility we got a W/c. RO thought I was having a flair. He put me on steroids, which helped. Fast forward to this past 2 weeks. My left femur & hip are giving me great pain again. I was sent to orthopedic oncologist cause MO said my last pet scan looked like I could fx my left leg just walking around. The ortho dr did plain x-rays & thought I was ok, pin not needed. Now leg pain is progressively gotten worse since I saw him. I have also been very depressed w/my progression. Had port put back in last week so can start new chemo treatment, Halaven, starting this week. Because of my pain & depression, I have spent too much time in bed. Now when I try to get up I become very short of breath, very quickly. I am so tired of all this, it has me wondering if it is time to call it quits. My initial goal when 1st dx'ed was live to see youngest son graduate HS. That happened last May. New goal is get to see grandchildren, which is not happening very soon. Lordy, I wrote more than I intended. Thanks Kandy for sharing your fx experience. I have felt certain something is being missed, I think I need to request an MRI. Su",

Then we ran into each other when I was in college & he in private practice. 30 years later, he is my 4th MO. I was working as an RN in hospital, so no keeping secrets from colleagues when initially Dx. Hated when I walked in lounge & conversations abruptly stopped. I hit it head on back then. 4 yrs later I went on disability & no longer shared info. People thought I was cured. Amazing how little people understand about MBC. I know we bring it on ourselves as we try to be strong, esp'ly for our children, mine were 13, 14, 17, 19, 21 & 24 at time of Dx. Now they are 21-33 yrs. I am so glad I have been around for their major accomplishments so far. Most do not want to talk about my illness, my 30 y/o son, now an MD is very supportive of any of my choices. Liver mets since June is dragging me down . Not sure how long ago, but my DH finally gets how bad I feel & treats me like a queen.

When I text my family that I was having a hard time & was in great pain, my husband text me back saying I was a rock, & out of 6 grown children only 1 responded, my austistic son , w/\"I love you mom\" I called my husband after that, crying & yelling very loudly, \"I am not a rock!!!\" I laugh at it now, but my poor husband didn't know what to say. He finally asked if my son was there yet to pick me up, & I said yes, he just got here, but instead of coming in to get me, my 24 yr old son went across the street to play basketball. I had to hobble to the door to yell at him. One of the downfalls of having 5 sons, 1 daughter & a husband who don't like to talk about my cancer. Thank you BCO for giving me a place to vent & learn from others goingthru similar experience of Stage 4 BC.",

After the grueling year of chemo, bilateral mastectomy, followed by radiation, I was told I had one spot of mets in my right intermammary lymph node , original Ca in left breast only. My mom told most of my relatives I was dying. I have now battled w/bone mets since 2013, fractured pelvis 3 times last year in 3 different spots, more radiation. Last summer a tumor was growing behind my eyeball, more radiation. This past June I was told I have liver mets. My husband & I decided to only tell a few very close friends & a couple of my children. My mom must suspect , but hasn\u2019t said anything. Everyone deserves time to grieve , I call it my pity party. I have only gotten worse, but I am trying to stay positive. I had severe liver pain 2 weeks ago, but it is now minimal. I screen my calls, do not answer anyone who may bring me down or who I am not in the mood to talk to. Those who can\u2019t handle your Dx should be brought in to talk to family. 10 years, I have been fighting, I refuse to give up yet. Reading these boards helps a lot. Stay positive & remind loved ones how important it is for them to do the same. Parents, children & spouses are tough, sometimes u have to just cry w/them. 😪 Sue",

I was Dx w/liver mets end of May after getting septic & had to have port pulled. I had been having a good run w/Halaven up to then. My liver mets since then seems to be moving fast, my markers went from 60 to over a thousand last week. My dr started me on Abemaciclib. After 4 weeks I have woken up today with the most liver pain with referred pain to my right shoulder. A lot of the responses have been very encouraging. My MO has not mentioned Y 90. Does anyone know if you can do Y 90 or SRBT while on oral chemo drugs? JFL & others have been so encouraging as I am still in my pity party stage over this. Thanks, Sue.",

It was definitely rough on the hands & feet, was working for me until I got septic from diarrhea. 4 different bacteria in my blood stream, 104 temp, thought that was the end of my story.
