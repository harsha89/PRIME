The tumor shrank rather quickly, so that by the time I had a lumpectomy on Nov. 1, the surgeon could not find any sign of the tumor, no signs in the surrounding tissue and the sentinal node was clear. I had some more chemo and was on Herceptin til the summer of 06, and all my mammograms, blood tests, etc. since then have been clear! Friday night, though, I was scratching under my left arm (the same side I had the cancer on) and felt a small bump. I went to look at it in a mirror, and it kind of looked like it had a small whitehead on it, like an ingrown hair would have. So that's what I've been telling myself and trying not to get obsessive about it. But you know how your mind goes once it gets hooked on something. I have a port flush on Thursday. But maybe I should call my doctor before then (like Monday) and have it looked at? Anyone had a scare like this? I could use some reassurance.
