I have an appointment with a lymphedema trained PT on Monday and will ask her.  I'll post back if I discover anything outside of the recommendations above.     I wish I would have read this forum thoroughly before having my sentinel nodes taken with prophylactic surgery (pathology indicates only 1 was taken per side). I really love my breast surgeon and she normally doesn't takes nodes with a PBMX.  However, when I expressed concern about finding cancer she said while it was unlikely they would find anything given my clear MRI, she could go ahead and do it because my risk of lymphedema was very minimal given my weight (5'3 105 lbs), no radiation, frequent exercise, and plentiful nodes.  She said I didn't need to take any precautions.     I also consulted a Lymphedema Dr. at a Lymphedema Center prior to surgery and she said I had little risk as well and wouldn't need to take precautions outside of weight lifting. She didn't even take measurements, but said to come back after surgery.   Anyway, so here I am.  I plan to have babies soon, am a frequent flyer (4-5x a month), lift a lot of weight for work, and used to use hot tubs/steam rooms often.  On the bright side, my nodes were clear, I am recovering very well so far (great range of motion, no swelling, no cording, no seroma, no infection), so I'm hoping my risk will remain low.   Last question- Can an MRI tell how many nodes you have before surgery?  Logic tells that me a risk factor of developing lymphedema would be how many nodes a person had before surgery.  However, I haven't seen that discussed anywhere.  Has their been research on this?    Thanks again!",
