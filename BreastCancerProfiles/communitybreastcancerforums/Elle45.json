The nurses and doctors were great. My dr. came into the preop room and showed the mamo pix to DH, DS, and me.Showing us exactly what he was going to do. They inserted the IV needle in my arm and took the blood samples from that. (I had had preliminary blood work a week before.) I loved the gown with the built in heater! Felt like one of those sumo wrestler suits you see. Hated the compression socks,not that they hurt but that I couldn't get out of bed without having someone unattach them. They put them on to prevent blood clots in us older peeps. My Dr has us stay overnite if at all possible, which I did. Like citykitty, I was starving and they brought me some grilled salmon, brown rice and a fresh fruit salad which I devoured. Went home the next AM. With a drain in, but it doesn't hurt and emptying it is a little awkward but NP. The only real pain I had /have is a tightness where the incision is. See Dr this PM for final analysis and to meet the oncologist. Good luck to you and let us know how it goes for you, Deanna. Blessings to you Elle",

Of course I looked at the digital pix, microcalcifications like starbursts in all the duct work on the left breast plus a few on the right, both nipples were also compressed but I didn't see that film. Ultrasound was just showing a few fibrous cysts. Dr called Thursday to set up appt with surgeon and radiologist ASAP. I do see her on Wed AM. Appt with radiologist & surgeon  is Wed PM. I am 65 yrs old and scared to death . Going crazy until Wed AM. DH said don't worry, everything is going to be fine. Please no platitudes just some idea of what's up with the \"girls\" that have been my constant companions for so long.

As long as I don't end up in a rubber room before Wed. I know that just knowing what is happening will help. As to Drs I was a nurse and long ago learned to ignore the ones that don't talk straight. I've also \"fired\" a few that I felt were incompetent. Thanks again Elle",
