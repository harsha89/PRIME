I already have 2 strikes against me in that I had a hysterectomy @ age 32 and have been on harmone replacement for 18 years.  If there is anyone else who has had this type of experience, please, please post something.  I do have an appointment with the surgeon who did my biopsy on Monday, but not being able to sleep or eat--need info.

God Bless, Beryl",
