Has ANYONE had issues with getting swollen bumps appear on the rims of their lids? I am seeing tiny little black hairs appearing slowly and am thinking that the new growth is irritating the hair shafts. Can't seem to find anything anywhere on this. Woke up this morning to a swollen right lid and a tiny little white bump that appeared right on the rim of my upper lid.",
