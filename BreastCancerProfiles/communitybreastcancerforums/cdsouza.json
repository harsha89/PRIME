I would ask in your area again. Good luck",

I am BRCA1 positive and 38 but did not find out until 2 months ago. There is no one in my family with cancer today....only 30-50 years ago, so no one really expected there to be a hereditary link, especially since I am the granddaughter....I got the mutation from my father. I think if I had found out earlier I would have been preoccupied. I have 4 kids now and now can focus on this with my husband, but I imagine it would have more difficult to go about my daily life had I known so young. My grandmother died at 44, so age of a relative with cancer has a lot to do with when you should think about having things done yourself. Personally, unless you have family with cancer under 30, I personally would say you could wait until you are through your 20s before worrying. Please check out the link above....there are so many similar stories! Cathy",

I do not have breast cancer but I have met with a surgeon in New York who is one of very few doctors who does a nipple sparing mastectomy. As he explained it to me, there is a way to remove all the tissue and leave the nipple, but there is no sensation left there since most if not all of the nerves are removed with the breast tissue. I am not sure if this type is recommended if you already have had cancer....I am BRCA1 positive and I was told by others that I could not have a nipple sparing surgery, so it is always good to ask someone else. He also said that your breast size and body type make a difference....smaller breasts and narrow frame are good since there won't be extra skin after the removal...aslo recopnstruction is often done sumultaneously and an expander is not always necessary....depends on your before and after sizes as long as the recon is done at the same time. I have 4 children, so for me I am weighing timing....I feel like a time bomb, but with 4 kids between 11 months and 9 years, I am afraid to get the surgery right now.",
