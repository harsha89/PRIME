    "Content": "seattlemamabear wrote: Hi all--question about sentinal node biopsy, after lumpectomy. Had several blue nodes removed---do normal nodes ever turn blue? Getting pathology results back soon but I'm not quite understanding if normal ones sometimes turn blue or if they never turn blue/have increased uptake of that radioactive stuff. I know that the final proof is in the pathology report, but I just wondered if normal ones COULD also turn blue. Make sense? Log in to post a reply",
