My oncotype score was 25 and initially my dr said she did not recommend chemo because the benefit was only a 5% improvement in terms of keeping cancer from returning. But she consulted with her colleagues and got back to me with a different opinion. She said I should do Taxotere and cytoxan. My husband doesn't want me to do chemo at all because the benefit is so small and the side effects are so horrible. I'm scared to death about the permanent hair loss side effect of taxotere. I've been googling constantly, worrying like crazy. My oncologist says it's extremely unlikely that I would have permanent hair loss, but honestly how does she know? I have been completely consumed by worry about just the thought of it happening. If I really did lose my hair permanently, I know it would be life altering, and I have a husband and three young kids who need me, need me to not live in a state of depression constantly. Have any of yall felt like you had a \"choice\" about chemo? Or a choice about taxotere? If you could go back and redo or undo taxotere, would u? Thanks for any advice!",
