I found the lump in the beginning of April and went to my OB. She had me laying on my back so I am almost certain she didn't even feel the lump I'm talking about because my breast tissue was pushed to that side. She said I have Fibrocystic breast and she sent me for an ultrasound to be sure. While I was getting the ultrasound, the tech told me she couldn't find the lump. I told her where it was and said it felt deeper into the tissue and it is the width of what I would say is a coffee stirrer. I got a call from my OB saying nothing was found and I just had dense breast. I don't feel anything else on either breast that feels like this palpable cord thing. I feel like my OB isn't really giving me the time of day and doesn't really answer my questions because I'm young. Am I being crazy? I feel like I want a second opinion. It doesn't sit right with me that they said they couldn't see it on the ultrasound. I read online that sometimes lumps aren't seen on ultrasound and that scares me. None of my friends say they have this kind of lump in their breast. Has anyone else had a corded lump in their breast and gotten a diagnosis? I can't stop thinking about it. I have to press on my breast to feel it. It's nothing that can be seen. Thanks so much in advance. Log in to post a reply",

A lot of the stuff online (which I have come to realize is not always accurate) kept showing pictures of women where the vein is showing through their skin. So I am hoping you are right about the modors and maybe mine isn\u2019t just presenting a little differently. Again, thank you so much for replying. I will continue to keep an eye on it to make sure it isn\u2019t growing and try to stop stressing so hard",
