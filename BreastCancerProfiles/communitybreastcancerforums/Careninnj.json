I have an MRI next week to make sure its all good. But i have googled, checked this site and i have put myself into a complete panic. I keep reading statistics. And bad outcomes for woman that had stage 1. Co workers keep asking if i will need chemo, and inappropriate questions. I just want this to go away. I think about the cancer every nano secind of my day. I have lost weight cause i can't eat. Im just feeling very uneasy. Thank you for listening to me.

To say i was nervous would be an understatement. I cried, panicked, threw stuff, everything leading up to surgery. I was scared of everything. The IV. The anesthesia. The needles. Pain. But most of all the sentinel node check to see if my cancer spread to the lymphs. The anticipation of it all is the worst! I asked god for a sign the morning of my surgery that everything would be ok. My mom passsed away from breast cancer over 20 years ago. When i got to the hospital my nurse comes to greet me and says \" good morning caren, im your nurse eileen and were going to take care of you\".eileen was my mothers name! At that point i felt a calmness i have never felt since my diagnosis. I knew i was going to be ok. And let me tell you. My recovery has been pretty darn good. Sure it hurts. But its surgery. Its going to hurt. But i. 4 days out now and im feeling so much better everyday. And as soon as i woke up my doc was there to say \" your nodes were all clear!\". You can do this. You will do this. And you wil live and be awesome.",
