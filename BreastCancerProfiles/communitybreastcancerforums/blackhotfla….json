I know that the opinions of indivudials on here are not a replacement for a Dr, or an OBGYN, though I am just trying to look for anyone opinion or ideas of what it may be right now until I do have the appointment set up.  When I went to the hospital, the doctor told me since I do not have insurance that I can not have the untrasound then, that I needed to find community assistance to get temperary assistance for the procedure. I was able to get the temperary assistance of County Insurace for this month. I have tried to see how long an appointment with a doctor would be and it is 2 weeks on up. So that does not leave much time for much. When I had the ultrasound of the breast, I asked the tech who preformed it and she instructed me to call in 2 days and talk with radiology to find out how to get my results read or what to do.  When I called two days later, all they could tell me was no one will be able to read them, because it was an ER doctor that ordered it and I do not have a PCP right now.  The reason I did not make an appointment with a regular doctor is I do not have the cash on hand to pay out for a doctor concidering at the time of ER I had no insurance. I am going Monday afternoon to get all set up with Medicaid after I get out of my classes, and hopefully something will get set up soon. The thing with medicaid is that, I make too much (As an adult as I was informend you can make no more gross income of 500 a month to qualify for Medicaid unless pregnant) I know unfortuantly I am jumping around a lot, my brain is in all different directions with all the stress. I have never known anyone who has gone through this kind of stuff, so I am a bit at a loss of information which is why I came here. It is nice to know that there are a lot of people who have gone through it. Thanks for the responses. Anyother questions, or comments are welcome! *~*Ash*~*",

Thanks for the ideas on what it says, it is nice to hear in real tems a meaning Lol. Would it be safe to do a biopsy right now concidering I am pregnant?
