I also made an appt with an opthalmologist for tomorrow. But I feel like they cant get the tests scheduled fast enough and then I feel like I already have a death sentence. The only thing that is a tiny bit reassuring is that I did have a brain ct scan in May 2015 due to a car accident, (for what thats worth) I cant stop crying.",
