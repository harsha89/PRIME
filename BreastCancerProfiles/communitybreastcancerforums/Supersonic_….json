I too have a red patch on one of my breasts and just got up the courage to post my info tonight.  Hopefully someone can help us.  All I ask is don't plan to make an appointment with your GP - do it please!",

Maybe I should be listening to Queen's song \"I'm Going Slightly Mad\".  And I will try and stay off google.  I feel so much better already after having posted last nite because I have not talked to anyone about my fears.  I've talked to my neighbour but I have just laughed it off and said if there is a problem it will keep me busy in my retirement.  I'll keep you posted!",

My appt is on Tuesday for my mammogram, which is not that far away. So, I will have a good weekend, lunch with my friends on Monday and then deal with things after that. Que sera, sera.",

Can't believe that with everything going on in your life that you have time to reach out to someone that has not even received a diagnosis. I just can't believe everyone on this site. You folks are amazing. Please know that I am thinking about you and sending you back a hug! Take care of yourself please. There appear to be a lot of good ones on this site but you seem to be particularly caring.",
