I have been called back for diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound and meeting with radiologist. The earliest they can get me in is next week, and I have made the mistake of googling while waiting. Articles I've read state that 1/2 to 2/3 of women with this finding have a malignancy. I also have a family history of breast cancer ( mom ) Does anyone here have personal experience with these particular findings ?  Or ideas on how to get through another weekend of worrying without going crazy :-)  Thanks for reading.  Log in to post a reply",
