Went for mammogram and they called me back for another diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. Said there was 2 areas of concern. One is a 1.7 ovoid area of nodular tissue and the other area (over the rash) is described as vague fibroglandular tissue. Follow up test say:  Left breast US: In spite of extensive interrogation of the left breast by the sonographer and radiologist, no discrete cystic or solid mass could be identified in the left breast to correlate to the developing density seen on the mammogram. The density in the medial aspect of the left breast appears to underlie a localized rash on the skin and could perhaps be related to parenchymal inflammation. Alternatively these findings could be related to hyperplastic glandular tissue. Since no definitive sonographic correlate is identified and there does appear to be a change compared to the mammogram from 2015, breast MRI is advisable for further characterization of this tissue. So, they couldn\u2019t find anything on the ultrasound and the radiologist wasn\u2019t concerned. I \u201cinsisted\u201d on a breast MRI and have it scheduled for this coming Tuesday. I haven\u2019t had any increase or change in symptoms since the start of them. I have read that IBC is aggressive and symptoms progress over days and weeks.  My five year old son has leukemia and we are right in the middle of battling for his life. I don\u2019t even know what to think! Log in to post a reply",
