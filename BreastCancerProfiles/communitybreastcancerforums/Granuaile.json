Routine follow up CT came back from Radiology with \"possible early lymphangitic spread\" and \"possible metastasis.\" A couple of chest lymph nodes were enlarged. I was totally freaked out. Upper left lobe, 3mm nodule (it's been there since my first CT). My husband was crying when he read the report, which prompted me to request a meeting with my onc. He kindly went over my CT with me, and explained why he's not particularly worried. He feels the lung issues were caused by radiation, and may take months to resolve. He said there's no sign at all of any cancer anywhere else, and since I'm still on treatment (Herceptin/Tamoxifen) he thinks it's highly unlikely that I have mets. But we're doing follow up scans anyway, for my peace of mind. I know my mind can play tricks on me!!! Hope this makes you feel better.",

Yes, there is the issue of the Benadryl in case of reactions, but my side effects were so much fewer, I was very relieved. I've had carpal tunnel syndrome, so I was prepared for the type of neuropathy I might face. I do have a little numbness in my feet and fingers (mostly my thumbs), but it doesn't really bother me. I type all the time & the neuropathy hasn't affected my ability to key at all. And I only had an issue with one nail - a toenail which ended up falling off. The others just got a little more brittle and ridged.  I wish you the best of luck and some peace of mind!!! Kate ",

It seems like a really potent combination, but I'd definitely be looking at mitigating SEs. I'm so sorry to hear about your recurrence. I'm just waiting for it to happen too, being Stage and Grade 3, and Her2 positive - just had some enlarged chest nodes show up, so that could be because of the cold I have, or a regional recurrence! I'm sure plenty of others will be along to share their experiences, and I absolutely will be thinking about you.",

I only ask, because you don't post details of your diagnosis (you didn't get a path report, right - just decided to \"treat\" your \"cancer\" by yourself?) I have to say I'm somewhat skeptical about the nature of your post. Too much anecdote, too little fact. For example, your supposition that the majority of cancers are slow-growing - where did you get that? And then I went to your blog, only to discover that you have a store... The women on this site are suffering and looking to each other for support, and considering this is your first post, supposedly a year after your \"diagnosis\", I have to wonder about your intentions. Stay well. ",
