Even if it did increase my chances slightly, I wouldn't change my choice to go through IVF and having my amazing kids for anything.  As a woman who went through IVF, I can tell you it is an emotional and difficult journey and hearing a loved one voice any sort of concern regarding using this medical assistance to bring a child into life would have been unbareable to hear- even if coming from a place of love... So I would try not to transfer your worries to your loved ones... Just be supportive through whatever she is going through and the choices she is making.",

He appreciated the fact I was educated in my approach, and wasn't refusing treatments, but wanted to have a good understanding of why a protocol would be selected, and be assured that he understood and respected my areas of concern. After a 4 hour first appointment (including time with the nurse clinician and pharmacist) we came up with a plan where I could be 100% on board, and my MO did not feel efficacy was deminished. I am not using any steroids in my plan, and eliminated taxanes as well. Because of my concerns about AC's impact on ones veins and heart, I am being monitored by an cardiologist to spot any changes immediately, and had a power port implanted. I am thankful for this site as it prepared me with knowledge and confidence to have a really great conversation with my medical team. My MO actually thanked me at the end for the great dialog and now I am confidently moving forward!",

I remember reading some of your prior posts, and your whole story is making me sad. Your BS needs to provide you with your pathology report- you had mentioned in a prior post that you tumor was 9cm but that aside from that, you didn't have much info. There are many variables that could influence the urgency of your treatment.... And you need to have all the information and be able to talk through all of that with your BS. Not liking your PS isn't going to make this easier.. So get a new referral. If that means getting the BMX and working solely with a BS to start if it's urgent, and then consulting a PS later- so be it.... The cancer and your BS relationship is important and they should refer you to someone else who honours your needs.",

I will not be that patient who nods and accepts whatever is suggested- thanks to this place, and a lot of medical journal reading this last 2 months since diagnosis, I am definitely going to be more active than passive in the conversation. Just hoping he listens and is willing to work with me to develop a plan I can be confident in! Wenchlori, one of the protocols that are on the table has the additional taxol for me as well) I preordered my wig and its sitting waiting for me until the day I need it, I have very long hair and suspect the day I start losing it will be very traumatic... So I'm thankful that they actually provide the support to shave my head and fit the wig there in a private and comforting setting, since I don't think I could do it myself, and I can't imagine wanting someone else there as it happened.

In fact they wanted me completely healed from BMX so they wouldn't consider starting before 6 weeks. I think there is some research to show that within 60 days post surgery is optimal (though I have only seen that research here- not via my MO)... But making sure tests, port placement etc are all completed is more of a priority. Don't panic if you go an extra week if necessary to have everything done!",

I was realistic and still wanted to go at this with everything. I assumed I would be adding a taxane at the end and simply wanted it to be taxol or abraxane, but MO felt that was overkill based on my specific case, and was happy with 4 cycles. As for the steroids, they are prescribed only for SE in the AC protocol... And he respected that I didn't like how hard they were on ones system- and found an alternative... I was actually prepared for a harder fight on that one- but he fully respected my thoughts on it. Let's hope I can manage!! I have actually seen quite a few get through AC relatively ok.... I'm working full time through treatment (just as I did post BMX) and plan on taking infusion days off and then taking weekends to get through those first few hard days....

I do labs 2 days before infusion, and have my MO appointment 24hrs before to go through results and make adjustments where necessary. Since neulasta is only given if labs show a necessity, he will also make a determination if it will be added for round 2 at this appointment. Feeling better already but boy did my MO nurse read me the riot act about taking care of my body even if I'm feeling well! She said 2 litres of fluid a day minimum. Soups, juice, shakes and even pudding count... So not drinking water is no excuse. I know better now and have smartened up! My head/scalp is officially hurting... And my long hair is starting to come out. Sad day... But this physical manifestation of what's happening inside my body may stir me to remember all the things I gave to do to stay healthy. I have an appointment at the compassionate care/wig store Friday for the head shave and fitting. I was going to hold off until Tuesday, but it's so itchy and tender I don't think I can. Caligirl- hope you feel ok today and the effects of the reaction don't last long!",

Glad that you can save yourself from IVs though! I have prepped 8 Dixie cups in my bathroom for washes... 4 have dry baking soda, and 4 have a great mouth rinse that you can get here in Canada that comes in a packet and you simply add water right before rinsing... I figure I'd prep them every am, and it will remind me to do this constantly over the first few days. For any Canadians here whom are interested, it's a Shoppers brand (life) and is called oral wound cleanser and comes in a small box with 20 sachets. I have used it in the past with a tooth ache or a canker sore and they clear up right away.",

He was \"warned\" by his nurse who met with me initially that there were some drugs i would not accept as part of my protocol (unless he could provide a great reason why I needed to reconsider), and had some questions and opinions that I wanted to contribute to our discussion. Some MO's may have not liked this approach- but mine welcomed it with open arms... in fact, I think he actually appreciated that thanks to these boards, I arrived the fact based concerned and real concrete understanding of not only my pathology, but how it is often treated. He started by simply saying \"You sound like you have a lot of information- how about you share with me what you know, and how you believe this part of our treatment will look, and then we can talk about that and make a plan. In the end, after lots of discussion- we came up with my treatment plan= 4 rounds of AC followed by Tamoxifen therapy. He listened when I voiced concern about taxanes and their severe side effects- and agreed that although he would traditionally order DC for my pathology, he respected my concerns. When he knew that as as single mom of twin boys that works full time, not dragging out this step of treatment into endless weeks of chemo; he agreed that CMF or FEC-D would only result in additional cycles that would simply be over kill... and even when I raised concerns about the anthracycline and its possible impact on heart health and leukemia, he talked me through the risk, and agreed to have the cardiac oncology team monitor me via EKG to ensure my heart was strong. Most of all, he was on board to make the best choice for me giving me the best chance at being here for my young kids for a long time. One difference to my prototcol that he is supporting me on, was my choice to eliminate all steroids from my treatment plan. I hate the SE from them, and I simply didnt want to add that to an already overwhelming amount of toxicity. I was concerned however, pain and nausea. He assured me that AC would be far easier to handle from a pain standpoint than the original plan of DC... so he felt confident that would be fine- and if necessary, he would call in a prescription if pain was terrible- but didnt see this happening. He did however, provide me with 4 different nausea meds which he thinks will easily replace the steroids! Thrilled! I will have my port placed some time in the next week, and my baseline EKG on the 4th.. and will have my first transfusion on August 19th. Looking forward to getting things going, but thankful for the next 3 weeks to ensure I am ready for the next 3 months! Thankful that there will be a group of us all going through this together.",

And in oil form you mix it in food or even a Juice... Or plain in the mouth (it's mixed with coconut oil and it's like an eye dropper. The type I am looking at is called CBD... So none of the trippy effects, and doesn't produce estrogen...but great for the SE of chemo. I am a bit nervous, but there have been so many stories of it helping with treatment and management of SE during chemo- I figured it would be good to have if needed.

Sometimes I wasn't sure I could do it, but I did! I need to work full time through this all both for financial reasons as much for my own sanity. I have a pretty high profile job that requires me to be in the public \"spotlight\" so I hope I can manage when the chemo SE kick in! I sometimes envy those of you with husbands/partners who are supporting you and nurturing your soul during this process... But that serves me no purpose- and I quickly change my mind set. Sure, friends step in to offer help- but it's not the same as someone you know loves you to the core who can just hold you when you feel like your heart is breaking in fighting this.I am a fighter... Always have been- I have young kids who need me and who look at me to be strong.... I need to give this everything I have got, even if I am crying in my pillow when the house is silent and no one knows. That's why I am so thankful for you all... You are my place to turn when I feel like this is too hard... So THANK YOU!! Together we can get through this.",

We will start in 7 months- mostly some shaving off of the infamous \"wings/side fat\" that were left (and always spilled out pre-BMX so taking this off will be awesome! Haha)... And then just some fat grafting from my stomach and waist area, to fill in my breasts to make them a bit more full (650cc implants were immediately placed at BMX which took me to a C, but he's hoping to get me back to a full C or D. It's not that I look forward to more surgeries... But knowing I won't be left hating my body is a Godsend! his is a little happy news I needed today!",

Dealing with a TMI issue and hoping some here can relate. Since Friday, when I pee it hurts like madness. I wipe and see blood. My urine is clear of blood, and I had a hysterectomy 5 years ago... So not related to anything there.... Has anyone had torn/raw skin down there? I'm thinking somehow I gave torn skin there that is burning/stinging when I pee and causing blood to get on the toilet paper. Sorry.... I know- gross...

She said that when you arrive for transfusion day, you let the nurses know you want to ice, and they will show you where the ice machine is. Bring some ziplock bags along and fill them with ice... And then she suggests oven mitts! Place a bag of ice in each, and then your hands inside making the ice concentrate on the tips of your fingers... Do the same with your feet either laying bags on top of your toes, or finding some big slippers and doing the same as the mitts. She suggested chewing on ice too, as it helps with mouth sores. Also said that chewing gum or sucking on a candy helps mask the taste that can occur when drugs get pushed into port. Also painting nails dark helps save them apparently. My oncologist said less oxygen to them the better so is fine with my continuing to get gel overlays so long as my manicurist is very careful with sanitizing and not using cuticle cutters.

I already have my Aloxi and Ranitidine scheduled for \"am\" (so I plan on taking them an hour before my 9am infusion)... And then the ranitidine again at night on day 1... But for the Emend I haven't been given a specific time! It just says once a day for three days (with a larger dose day 1). Anyone else taking Emend? Is it best for me to take this in the am before infusion as well? Or afterward? I also have metonia to take as needed every 4-6 hours... Which I will probably take automatically for first 24 hours just to be safe. Hoping one of you already through infusion 1 can help tell me when best to take my Emend!",

An iconic band (the tragically hip) from my youth is being live streamed from their final concert all across Canada (and the world via online stream) without interruption and it's so powerful. The lead singer has stage 4 inoperable brain cancer and as a gift back to his fans, toured one last time, with his MO alongside and sharing his music and love to all those of us who used his music as our soundtrack of our late teens and 20's...

The synthetics are much cheaper but can not get wet, or close to heat (open oven can melt the wig) as this causes damage. The two synthetics I got are purely for errands and quick use... And my natural hair wig is for work and events. It is frustrating that wigs are so expensive!  Many cancer centres have wig banks where past patients donate their wigs but when I visited I was really disappointed in the choices!

This weekend my cousin is getting married- a big formal affair. I'm scared about my hair! It's slightly itching but that's it... Though I don't want to play with it too much. I'm thinking of wearing it up just so I don't pull on it all night. Since I won't be able to have a fancy up do for some time afterward... Why not! Yeah, the wig price was really hard for me to swallow for sure. As a single mom that was a big chunk of money! But seeing that I bought two cheap styles to wear 90% of the time, the $2300 one will last me the full 18 months, (and will hopefully be in good enough shape that I can donate it to a future patient in my community once I don't need it) and I really needed it for work as I am in the public eye at high profile events getting photographed etc a few times a week and I really just wanted to try and look as much like me as possible. It was a big investment... But there weren't really other options (Canada always pays more uggg). Maybe once I'm more comfortable wearing a wig I will buy some fun options online- but I wanted to be fitted this time so I went to a store who specializes in working with cancer patients. (They also do the shave when it's time... Which I am thankful for) The emotional toll of this journey is starting to get me at times. I had just started enjoying dating and putting myself out there prior to my diagnosis, and that all came to an abrupt stop. How can I possibly meet someone knowing I'm about to lose my hair, and that my chest has horizontal scars and missing nipples that would scare anyone away! The thought of not having companionship for.... A long long time is so hard on ones self confidence! I wish I had someone to tell me I'm beautiful...

But once your \"C\" is started, you can simply wheel your IV tower into the bathroom with you! 2) hair- totally personal decision. For me, I want to hang on to my long hair as long as possible, so I scheduled my shave for day 18 after first chemo (consensus says you start losing between day 14-17... Which for me happens over a long weekend and my shop is closed, so 18 days it is! 3) frozen Popsicles are sometimes used, so it doesn't need to be ice chips, but I fear a slush may not be cold enough. It wasn't so bad doing the ice (I also did fingers and toes and the shock only lasted for the first minute, after that it was no problem,.)... I would probably opt for something solid ice during your infusion.... Mouth sores are one of the biggest \"pains\" in SE and I'd hate for you to use a slush and it not work! 4) blankets... My centre provides heated blankets that are so cozy, so no need to pack one! I'd check at your chemo class if these are offered at your location! 5) as for Nulasta, I'm in Canada so different answer I'm sure. I'm not offered it unless blood tests show I need it. That being said, my 20% copay from my employee prescription plan is waived by my cancer centre which has an alternate coverage for the copay amount because of the cost if needed. I would also suggest you join the September group as well as our August group... That way you can be within a day or two (likely) with others whose first infusion is close to yours!",
