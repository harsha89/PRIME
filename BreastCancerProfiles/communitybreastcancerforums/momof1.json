I haven't gotten the copy of pathology yet (hopefully next week) but I think mine was either a fibroadenoma or a pappilloma (sp?) However, whichever one it was, it was extremely painful. I can't tell you if the removal helped because I'm still fairly swollen and the excision sight is still very tender. As with Kibbles, mine also fluctuated with my menstrual cycle. I'm a high risk so I chose to have it removed just to be positive. My theory is that if it's not suppose to be in there then why leave it?",
