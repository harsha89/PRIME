My question to you all is- can you have pain and or tenderness in a breast and the cause not be cancer? I am 41 years old- I was hoping hormonal possibilities? Do or did any of you have these symptoms without it being serious? Log in to post a reply",

I posted earlier that no lump has been felt by my primary care but I know that doesn't mean anything. Also I have had tenderness in one specific spot- that I know the mammo place is going to zoom in on. I am 41- my mom passed away from breast cancer at 48 and my maternal grandmother had breast cancer at 78- she passed from unrelated causes 20!years later. My anxiety is getting the best of me. I am trying not to overthink this but I know how I am during mammograms- For example I will watch every facial expression of the mammo tech- any inkling in their voice that there may be a problem- also if they have to zoom in on an area- how will I not freak out? Should I ask them anything? They probably won't be able to tell me? Help! Log in to post a reply",
