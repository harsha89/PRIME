Since I had my first scare ever (I'm 44, hispanic, with no family history) 4 weeks ago I have been lurking because that scare made me realize that I really shouldn't take something like breast cancer so ...... well, my distant thought back in the recess of my mind, was that BC just is not something that will happen to me...... lightly.   After reading so many posts of woman who also had no history but developed BC I realized this really isn't something I will take for granted again.  Once I turned forty and started getting yearly mamograms, almost a right of passage for turning 40, I became lazy doing the once a month breast check.  OK, who am I kidding I was never very good at doing it anyhow.  I do know that before children I had very dense breasts.  I even had an aggravating hurtful fibroidadnoma removed when I was 24.  The children came and my once dense perky boobs became flat floppy pancakes.  I'd feel them and reflect that once upon a time they were pretty.  Eight years ago I got a breast augmentation.  Yay they were pretty again. Fast forward to 4 weeks ago.  I'm in the shower and thought well ya know I should probably feel.  So, I did and wow I actually felt something.  Not a little something but kinda big.  That was a scary feeling.  But, ya know no family history I told myself, so it's really not anything, not to mention I just had a mamogram 11 months ago.  I had my hubby feel it.  That is when I think it sank in that maybe I shouldn't be so unconcerned.  He certainly wasn't. The whole process from making an appointment to finding out the biopsy results happened very quickly.  Had diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, and then bam, the radiologist asking me if I could stay for a biopsy.  Uhhmm, yeah.  That all happenend within 4 hours.  Ladies I am not sure how I got so lucky to be seen so quickly because reading the posts that is certainly not the norm.  The hardest part was waiting the 48 hours to get the biopsy results back.  Yes, they came back B9.  My mass was 2.1cm and the result was: benign fibroepethelial lesion consistant with fibroidadnoma.  The follow up is to go back again in 6 months for another DM/US, but, to call if there are any significant changes with the mass or if I feel anymore \"lumps\" Four weeks later I do feel another spot.  Very small compared to the biggy that started me feeling my boobs once a month now.  Went to the gyn and he said lets observe for a month.  If it is still there then I will go in for another ultrasound.  Well have to say the rollercoaster of concern is starting to ascend again..... So ladies!  Thank you for listening to all of us.  You have all been through your own ordeals yet you are reading our posts and helping us feel better. Log in to post a reply",

Just to err on the side of caution I contacted my breast surgeon who performed my excisional biopsy to ask her if I need to really be concerned.  Not sure about \"just doing a biopsy during my explant\". So, when I here back from my BS wondering what questions to ask her make me feel better about these cysts, especially the one \"that might have an infection\".  I know cysts aren't cancerous.  But, I read all over this site where women got theirs aspirated.  Why and when should a woman do that?  Should I be concerned about my enlarged lymph nodes.  I also had blood work done and my Vit D levels came back \"severly low\", drs words - at 12.5. That was definitely a long story.  I guess making this request is also a way to vent. Thanks for listening :) Log in to post a reply",
