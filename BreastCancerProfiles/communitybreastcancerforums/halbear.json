I'm just 1.5 weeks out from a lumpectomy and a lymph node ressection (19 removed!).Â I too have a seroma in my arpit (feels like an orange has grown there!) and was eager to read all your advice. I noticed some talk about massage to the area that really helped, and thought I would see if anyone can add to that -- what kind (circles, kneading, downward motion, etc.) and any other details. My best friend has been a bag of frozen edamame (great ice pack!) tucked into the armpit, but obviously I can't go through life with that as a fashion accessory! Good luck to everyone and thanks for sharing. Hallie",
