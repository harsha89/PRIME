I've tried shrinks and haven't had much luck. ",

They just found cancer in two new places--the cervix and in the parotid area of my face--there's a small tumor you can't even see above my jaw. My doctor's been EXTREMELY reassuring about this latest turn--says, \"you're not dying of breast cancer,\" \"you will continue to do well,\" \"the biology of your cancer is at the extreme end of the spectrum\"--meaning, you have a kind that is extremely slow growing. I've had this for nearly 20 years now. All the same, tonight I'm REALLY scared. What do people tell themselves to get through the fear? What kind of things do you do to help yourself?  Log in to post a reply",

I bet a lot of other people on here are too. To h*ll with pink ribbons and the sense that the October pink splurge gives the country that we're blazing forward with cancer research. We're not. I have a question for everyone: what can we do? Any suggestions? Is there some protest that, together, we can lodge?  A march on Washington?  I really really wish that Barack O'bama's mother hadn't died of cancer, but perhaps that fact would make him amenable to this problem.

It's of the Canadian Indian actress Lisa Ray, an otherworldly beauty, who was diagnosed last July at 37 with incurable cancer--multiple myeloma, to be exact, but she's in the same boat we are. She was immediately put on some kind of steroid treatment and the weight piled on; she's got the steroid moon face. And now, because she has a film coming out, she has to get out there and promote a movie she made before all this happened, when she was still lithe and a world class-beauty. She's by no means ugly now, but she's not the same. And just watch how she handles it in this video. That's her on the right in the film clip at the beginning and then that's her now talking, and she just doesn't seem cowed by this. She seems sparkling and unbeaten and unapologetic, and every time I look at this, I take strength from it. It can't be easy to have been called one of the ten most beautiful women in the world last year, and to have the press now saying, \"The glamor is gone\" (someone wrote that about her weight gain), and yet, she just gets out there and doesn't hunch down embarrassed.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKxAQJ... ",
