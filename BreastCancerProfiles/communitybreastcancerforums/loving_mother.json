I have been given the difficult decision of choosing between a mastectomy or lumpectomy. My surgeon says that both surgeries have the exact same 10 year survival rate and that if recurrence does occur after a lumpectomy and radiation, then a mastectomy will be just as effective as if it had been orginally done instead of a lumpectomy. I have also read that after a lumpectomy and radiation, there is essentially under a 10% chance of recurrence. So I was wondering if anyone could give me some feedback on which treatment they took for a similar situation to mine to mke my decision a little easier as I am really overwhelmed with my diagnosis and I appreciate all of the responses that I will get Thanks Diagnosis: IDC, 2.5cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I felt a bit nauseated right after my treatment but am thinking that might been from anxiety. On average, does it occur within the first couple of days? After a week? Or when? Also, do chemo treatments usually get better in terms or side effects or worse? Or do they pretty much remain the same all throughout?
