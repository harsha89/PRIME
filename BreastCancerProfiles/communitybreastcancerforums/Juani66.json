Just miserable..doing better now but no one told me to massage breast during shower and I am pretty sure there is liquid inside I have tried to massage but pain and tenderness are umbereable. Tomorrow I see the RO so hoping he can tell me what to do. Also, something weird happened after removal the nurse was massaging the breast and cleaning that area then she said \" oh there's a piece of tissue sticking out of your wound, don't worry just leave it there\" . I could see it coming out of the hole. Not sure if this is why I still have that hole pretty much open. I have followed everything they told me to do but quite honestly the first two weeks after removal were so painful. Also my breast is red and it feels like major sunburn. No oozing, no pus in wound or bad smell. Just an open cut and blisters are healing finally after using Silvadene.",
