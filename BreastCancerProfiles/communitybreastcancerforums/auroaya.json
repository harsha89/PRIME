Nobody asked me if I wanted it removed they just did. Then last  year I was dx stage IV while undergoing femur surgery and the anesthesiologist could not find a good vein on my good arm so they finally used the surgery one even though it had a warning not to. They say its because I was loosing a lot of blood and had no time to put in place a central line. In any case there was infiltriation in the IV and they permanently injured my right hand. I am now suing the hospital. This would all have been avoided with a port. I now have a new one and planning on keeping it forever or for as long as it doesnt need replacement. I understand this is an extreme situation and don't mean to scare anyone unnecesarily but if you have hard veins I suggest keeping it in. Aurora",

In fact, recently the experts have started recommending that oncologists refer all cancer patients to get evaluated for depression and given treatment if need be. I myself take medicine for depression (it's called Cymbalta) and it really helps with my sadness. I also take another medicine called Risperidone which is a mood stabilizer. I'm not a doctor so I can't recommend it for you but I would talk to your doctor and maybe he can refer you to a specialist. Also talking to somebody that understands helps. Feel free to come here often and release your tears on us your sisters, we understand like no others can because we all go through the same emotional roller coaster.

A few months ago I ran out of insurance and stopped taking them but  continue taking the anti-hormonal Arimidex which is what I take for cancer. The se's of the Arimidex went through the roof! hot flashes, mood swings depression and it all went away when I started taking my psych meds again. The new standard of care is urging oncologists to screen their cancer patients for depression and refer them to a Psiquiatrist when appropriate. Depression is a chemical imbalance and cancer medication and chemotherapy affects that balance (in my opinion) so I would suggest to get screened by a professional and maybe get into some type of medicine. We need our energies to deal with cancer and depression undermines those energies. Hope you can get help. Take care Aurora",
