It's been almost 2 years since my BMX and I knew this would be the most difficult part of the process. It took me 6 months from dx to surgery because I just couldn't do it and cancelled my first surgery one week prior to schedule date because I knew I would miss my breasts every day. I was devastated to have to loose my breast to over 6 cm of DCIS on my very first mammogram. I do feel fortunate to not have had invasive cancer but I still miss my breasts.",
