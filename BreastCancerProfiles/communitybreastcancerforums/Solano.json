I'm in the second week of my second round of Taxol and my ankle has swollen overnight. It started with my wedding ring. I've always had long skinny fingers and toes and now my one finger, my ankle, and my toes on that foot all look like sausages! To make matters worse - the chemo has dried my eyes out so much that it has affected my vision - never for the better, of course, they had to increase my contact strength so much that now I need glasses to read. As if I'm not freaky enough - let's add glasses. Not that there's anything wrong with glasses - but, jeez, bald, boobless, swollen AND glasses!!! Doctors always act so surprised to hear about these weird side effects - I told mine that my scalp hurt when my hair fell out and she \"had never heard of that.\" Really, give me the adriamycin any day.",
