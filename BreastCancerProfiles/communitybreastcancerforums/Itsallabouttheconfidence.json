I had a scare exactly 6 years ago in my right breast, I found a small, hard lump and was referred. I had a mammogram on BOTH breasts and the radiologist commented on how strange my LEFT breast mammogram looked and that she had never seen anything like it before and asked if I had ever been in a car crash (I haven't). I didn't give it anymore thought as I was there for the other one. I had a biopsy done on my right lump, went back for the results a week later and was referred for an MRI scan. Thankfully I got my results and it was clear. Fast forward 6 years to just over a week ago. I found a lump in my left breast quite a bit larger than the on the right side. There is also a ridge underneath the lump and it's definitely all new. Immediately I remembered what the radiologist said about my left mammogram. The GP said she could feel a thickening but not the lump. The way she examined me though I can't feel the lump from underneath the breast either, just from the top. Referral to the breast clinic and the endless round of waiting and worrying ðŸ˜¢ I am 47 so I guess I could be premenopausal but my biggest worry is that after the mammogram was done last time nothing else was said about my left breast. My husband is trying to be as understanding as he can but after reading some of these forums I can see you are all very caring and reassuring so that's why I have decided to post. Also, my husband keeps telling me to leave it alone, easier said than done when every 10 minutes I keep checking to see if it's gone! ðŸ˜‚ Thanks for reading xx Log in to post a reply",
