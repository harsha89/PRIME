I was a C cup with mild droop from breastfeeding and really wanted to go smaller, was not concerned wit lateral scars and so I chose the 1 stage reconstruction to avoid TE and 2nd surgery. I had to go to many PS in LA to find someone who \"got it\" that I wanted A/small B cups. I am 10 days post-surgery and very concerned that I am too large. PS said he used teardrop shaped 250ccs but I think I still look like a C. I am small build 5/10\", 125 lbs and narrow build. Anybody else had small Direct to Implants? And how long do they take to settle into their permanent size?

I had 3 good sessions with the owner/therapist, then was sent to another MLD therapist in the office who performed very aggressive manipulation way under both armpits. The next day I had a cord that went from armpit to elbow. Later in the day, my prophylactic side (no nodes taken out) began to ache & I had stabbing pains when I moved it. Felt around and feels like a guitar string in there, too. Can you even get cording on side where no nodes were removed? I was able to get my arms to 105-120 degrees on each side. Now I am down to ~45 degrees with pain. Feeling defeated to say the least. Not sure if I can go back to PT. Maybe the cords were going to happen anyway but it feels like that one aggressive PT/massage made things worse.",
