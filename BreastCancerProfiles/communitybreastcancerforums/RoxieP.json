I went to my Doctor asap. She said it is most likely a cyst but was not sure so she wants me to get a mammogram and a RT breast ultrasound. I have an appointment for them next Monday. It will be my first mammogram so i don't know what to expect. eeek. I was doing fine until this weekend when i noticed a swollen spot on my right armpit. I left it alone for two days thinking i was over thinking it, but by the second night i decided to check it. It was swollen and a little hard. It does not hurt. This morning when i woke up it was still there but the swelling has gone down. I called my doctor but i have not heard back from her. Is this something i should be worried about? Thank you, Roxie Log in to post a reply",
