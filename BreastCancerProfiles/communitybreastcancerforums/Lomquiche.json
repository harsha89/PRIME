I had right breast mastectomy at c 26 weeks, then 10 weeks later had son by elective C-section before chemo & radiotherapy. Never wanted reconstruction & it was impossible at time of mastectomy because of risk to baby if under general anaesthetic for many hours. I have a prosthetic (part gel, part foam) I sometimes wear but usually I just put on a bra & tough if anyone feels I'm odd. I swim without prosthesis. New breast consultant tried persuading me that my sporadic flipped rib feeling could be lessened by having reconstruction but I don't like idea of implant. We have agreed he will no longer raise the topic ;) I adapt wired bras which often rub scar area, by taking out wires by cutting hole in channel between cups (rather than under arm) & pulling out wire. Gives me wider choice of funkier colour bras, but would horrify bra specialists. Like some other respondents, I use the void to store things like house keys, when fetching son. I miss a \"proper\" cleavage but as I was never a Playboy Bunny type, I suppose I have been less traumatised. Husband, son and I just happy I am alive",
