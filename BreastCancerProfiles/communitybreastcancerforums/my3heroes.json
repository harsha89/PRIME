    "Content": "my3heroes wrote: Hi everyone... I'm basically posting to hopefully get a clearer picture on information that has been given to me and also hear if anyone has had a similiar situation, any advice helps right!? I'm a 25 year old female and come from a family with a STRONG maternal history of Breast Cancer.   A little summary on that probably helps.  My Great Aunt was diagnosed with BC in her 50's and fought the battle and won, thankfully!  I was a young baby when this happened so I don't have any more information other than she had the disease.  My mother (1 of 5 sisters) youngest sister was originally diagnosed at age 38 and was rediagnosed at age 44 with Stage IV Mets to the Spine, Lungs and Brain.  She is still with us and is one of the bravest fighters I know.  My mother at age 50 was diagnosed 2 months after my aunt was diagnosed for the second time.  My mother's diagnosis was a Stage 1 DCIS Triple Negative BC.  A month after that diagnosis, my family found out that another sister (my aunt, age 52) was given the news that she too had BC and so there we sat starting out 2008 with THREE sisters (my mom and 2 aunts) all with BC.  A sidenote as well, my maternal grandmother, died from Ovarian Cancer.  So overall, Cancer dominates my maternal medical history.  As far as Genetic testing goes, my mother and her sister (52) have been genetically tested, my aunt with the Stage IV Mets has not been tested (for reasons unknown to me).  Both my mother and aunt have come back with BRCA1 negative, but BRCA2 shows a mutation that can not rule out a negative or positive on that gene.  It is described to us as there is a mutation there that does not fit the standard definition as being a BRCA2 positive result, but it is a mutation they have seen in other individuals and one that is being studied with no confirmations currently.   My main concern, and reason for posting this here, is because I recently went to an appointment with my PCP to discuss my desire to start receiving mammograms and/or Breast MRI's due to my family history for BC.  She informed me that she would not order either of those tests until I was genetically tested.  I was a bit confused because 1.) I felt that my family history was strong enough to see that starting the annual tests would be necessary and 2.) can my PCP really force me to be genetically tested?  Does anyone think I should call my insurance company and explain the situation?  Also, can genetic testing and having those results affect any type of insurance coverage in the future?  Any information anyone can provide, even if it's just a similar situation your in would be great!  Thank you so so much!
