Assuming he knows you're in treatment for cancer and wearing a wig, he is a) already prepared for you being bald and b) probably cares much less than you do about your hair loss.   I know that doesn't help with your own sense of discomfort, but maybe you can try to see yourself through his eyes.    I mean, the guy LIKES you.  Kick some a** on the golf course.  We're rooting for you!  ",

If the ultrasound shows that you have a cyst, it'll be crystal clear that it's a cyst, and you can breathe a sigh of relief!  Cysts show up very distinctively on an ultrasound because they're filled with liquid.  If it's a cyst, there's really nothing to biopsy - it would be like doing a biopsy on a blister.  You might want to have it aspirated if it gets big, but they usually go away on their own (I know because I had one). Biopsies are done on solid masses of tissue that appear suspicious.  If your radiologist sees something solid that's suspicious, believe me - they'll biopsy it.   ",

This study reassured me that, if nothing else, I fell into the category of women who were most likely to get a big absolute payoff, conditional on the very low probability that I'd have a second primary in the other breast.  But, yes, that's a  big assumption.  Mastectomy doesn't eliminate the risk of recurrence completely.  It just lowers it. What this all boils down to is that making decisions about cancer treatment eventually boils down to a very complicated crap shoot at some point.  Which raises an interesting problem... where we get the information to inform our decisions is a very challenging issue for most of us, and problematic as the medical community puts more of the treatment decisions into the hands of the patient.  I think that's a GOOD thing, very empowering; but it also brings its own stresses.  For example, most of us struggle to understand the math and logic that underlies risk and decision making.  Reading this discussion board, I think it's easy to assume that recurrence in the contralateral breast is common.  There are certainly many women who will read this thread and say, \"I wish I'd gotten mine off the first time, because it came back!\"  For the women who've been through a recurrence, the nightmare is very real, and the low risk doesn't matter any more - it's become 100% for them.  That's where statistics intersect with reality, and finding onself in the tail end of the distribution must be very scary place to be.  However, the women posting to this board represent only a tiny fraction of the total number of people who are diagnosed with breast cancer.  Studies show that most women diagnosed with BC won't have a recurrence in the other breast.  It would be interesting to know WHY that is the case, so that we could be peaceful in our decision to leave or remove the contralteral breast.  However, no one knows what makes one breast go postal while the other is perfectly happy to be normal; and that's the multi-billion dollar explanation for why cancer occurs.  Which, of course, we don't have, so we all muddle along as best as we can.    Anyway, blah-blah-blah...   it should be reassuring to many women that the decision to keep one's healthy breast is a fine decision - just keep up with that screening.  Laura  ",

Now that all my dressings are off, I massage my skin every night with very nice almond oil to help desensitize the nerves, and that has helped immensely too.  It was very uncomfortable at first, but now it feels kind of nice and I'm actually kind of surprised at how much sensation I still have.  I recommend gentle skin massage to anyone getting a mastectomy - a PA told me to do this and it's really helped with the skin/muscle sensitivity.

You can also ask for photos of the very best AND the very worst outcomes, so you know what to expect.    Laura",

If they did a lumpectomy, and got good margins, your cancer isn't dancing anywhere except for maybe on the slides in the pathologist's office.  Did they do a sentinel node biopsy?  Also, you're ER/PR positive - that's a GOOD thing, because tamoxifen is pretty powerful against those cancers.  I chose the double because a) there's BC in my family and b) I was ER negative...  I mean, like zero estrogen receptors.  Nil, nada, nix, naught, nothing... and c) I have super dense breast tissue and didn't want to be going for mammograms every six months and freaking out for the rest of my life.  Lastly, I loved my plastic surgeon and he promised me he'd do a great job, and he did!  So it worked out really well for me.  As for sensation - I should clarify that the sensation isn't pre-mastectomy normal.  I don't think I've got phantom sensation, but I can feel pressure on my skin and nipple.  It's definitely duller than it was before; and my nipples aren't responsive.  However, to be perfectly frank, my breasts were never a huge erogenous zone for me anyway and I just don't miss them.   Weird, huh?   If I lost sensation in the back of my neck or along my spine, I'd be extremely sad.  There's where my buttons are...  :) I think you probably need to talk to your surgeon and get your questions answered by her/him; and if you're still having issues, then get a second opinion about what to do. If two surgeons tell you that you've done enough for now, and you want to keep your breast, you can probably relax with that decision and know you've done everything you can.   Ultimately, we all have to make the decision that seems best at the time for us.  For a lot of women, that means saving the breast. The research indicates that, for most of us, prophylactic mastectomy perhaps offers more psychological benefit than survival benefit.   As long as your implants aren't obscuring breast tissue where other cancers might grow, of course.... and THAT IS WHERE YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR SURGEON, not to those of us who have experience but no medical degrees!  I wish I could offer you a map to the best outcome for YOU. Wouldn't it be great if we had that crystal ball??",

If you want to PM me about the mastectomy experience, feel free - I made the same choice; and even if I weren't in the category that benefits, I'd be thinking of mastectomy too.  It's a very personal decision and your psychological well-being is perhaps the most important element of your treatment.  Also, it's not that bad...  I was amazed at how little pain I had.  Laura  ",

Also, DE Miller is right - don't troll the Internet, and don't assume that the doomsday scenarios are crystal balls for your future.   The fact of the matter is that early stage breast cancer is darned close to being curable. Most women go through diagnosis and treatment once and they're done.  If you are reading this, and you've just been diagnosed, it is highly likely that you'll be in that \"most women are fine\" camp.  So, gear up to fight, get it over with, and then rest.  Rest.  Rest.  Before you know it, you've got enough hair for a ponytail and you can get through an entire week without needing a nap, and people will look surprised when they hear that you had cancer.  \"You???  But you're so healthy!\" Yup. ",
