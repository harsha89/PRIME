Did anyone radiate the supraclavicular area because of LVI? I had BMX with clear margins, SNB negative. So initial plan was to only radiate chest wall - but given my LVI, rad doc said it's up to me if I want to radiate the supraclavicular area . I haven't been able to find much information on this and was wondering if anyone had similar experience/diagnosis and wouldn't mind to share. Thank you. Mina.",

Double mastectomy clear margins, T2N0M0, no nodes, Grade 2, but one thing different is they found a rare LVI. I was put in the grey zone whether I need rads or not - and too, the radiation oncologist left it up to me to decide (I really think its to cover their behind, so they can say they've offered and explained everything to the patient but the patient decide to .....) Anyhows. I decided on rads. Primarily because of age, large size tumor, and (this stupid) LVI. I too am terrified of the side effects - but I thought I'll give this monster my all and hopefully done everything to get rid of it. A question for everyone - since my nodes were negative, she only suggested chest wall radiation (no axilla). But for the LVI, she said i could do the supraclavicular area if I wanted, but not necessary. (See again, leaving it up to me !!!) But she also stated there's a low risk of esophageal cancer, lymphadema, and/or brachial plexus damge . Has anyone done rads to supraclavicular area because of LVI, not because of positive nodes?",
