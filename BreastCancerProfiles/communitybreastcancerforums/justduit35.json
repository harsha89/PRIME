Then I will go to the chemo lab at 10am.On Friday, I get the neulasta injection. I will take 6 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan.  I am nervous about it. I have a lot of people praying for me. I will let you know how I do. Good luck to others starting chemo today. I hope it all goes smoothly! God Bless, B",

The only difference is your tumor is slightly bigger than mine and you have to undergo radiation.  I somehow wiggled my way out of radiation. Did you have a bilateral mastectomy? Britainy",

Please add my treatment regimen to the list. 6 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan every 3 weeks. 1 down 5 to go! Hello Everyone, The last 2-3 days have been hell for me. I drove to work Monday thinking I could work and as I was driving felt light-headed and thought it was a bad idea. I worked for about and hour and a half and then drove home! It all went downhill from there. I felt like I was out of my body, very weak, light-headed, nauseous, anxiety, and then had 24 hours of diarrhea. On Monday, I was concerned that it would not get better and wondered how I was going to tolerate 5 months of this.  I am bouncing back today. Hopefully, tomorrow I will get back to work. I called the doctor today to get a new anti-nausea med. Phernegan did not work for me. I also have taken the lowest does of Xanax twice for a just in case I need it moment. Both times Xanax has not worked for me when I needed it. He gave me Ativan to help with both nausea and anxiety.  For those of you that have made the full round of your first chemo, does it get much better? Do you feel normal again? Thanks! Brit",

I ate something then took my dexmethasone. I later went to get my neulasta shot. I got it in my stomach (I recommend the stomach). I did not feel a thing except for the initial pinch. It all went great! Overall I am good and alive! I have experienced some side effects and just took my first phernegan to relieve the mild queasiness. I have also experienced off and on all day moderate joint pains, moderate body aches, some dry mouth, mild teeth pain (they feel a little tight). I swished with Biotene which helps a lot for the dry mouth. I am eating very healthy. I drink lots of water. My face was a little red this morning but I think it went away. I am about to take some ibuprofen for the body pain. My face and stomach is a little puffy from the demethasone but the bonus of the steroid is that it gives me some energy even when the rest of me is not feeling well!!! LOL. I am listing all of my side effects to give you an idea but I will tell all you about to undergo chemo not to be afraid. So far this queasiness feels like a pregnancy. But when I was pregnant, I threw up every day!!! I have not vomited once and I have been able to eat. As of today, food tastes the same. The biggest thing after chemo is to relax and go with the flow. I hope everyone keeps doing well! This will all pass!",

I have been swishing with Biotene and drinking a lot of water. I can feel my mouth on the borderline of forming sores so I am doing everything to prevent it. The most annoying part for me is the joint pain in the hips, tailbone, and knees. I could use a butt massage! Ibuprofen is not helping so I took my first Percocet tonight. I am no longer on the steroids so my energy level has dropped. My body does not feel like my own. It's all doable, though. I hope everyone else is doing well! Take it easy! Britainy",

I had a BMX with expanders on May 25th. I was originally told that I had one 2 cm tumor and DCIS in the right breast. After the pathology came back after surgery, they found another 1cm tumor and the 2cm tumor was actually 3.3cm plus the 3rd area of DCIS. I have multi-focal IDC Stage 2A Grade 2. I had 3 lymph nodes removed and they all showed no lymph node involvement. My left \"healthy breast\" pathology came back from lab as pre-cancerous. I am so happy that I made the right decision to remove both breasts! I just had a feeling about it. I was terrified of the surgery but I did way better than I expected. My only complication was an infection 3 weeks post surgery which I believe happened as a result of the saline injections. It did set me back a couple of weeks and my last drain did not come out until July 8th! The drains were the hardest part of the surgery for me. I am now up to 820cc in each tissue expander. I have 2 more expansions remaining so I want to wait until after chemo to finish it up.  Because my drain came out so late, my oncologist wants to let me heal before I start chemo which is why it was pushed back to August 19th.  I am nervous about chemo. I will be taking Taxotere and Cytoxan for 6 rounds every 3 weeks. My doctor has prescribed me dexmethasone for the night before and the morning of chemo. I will also get a neurlasta injection the day after.  Is there anyone else out there with no lymph node involvement that is getting chemo? I am 36 years old and my doctor says that because of my age, the size of the tumor, and the fact that it was multi-focal, it is necessary for me to have chemo. I would love to hear from those of you with similar treatments this month. It is good to know that I am not the only person going through this. Take Care, Brit",

I was nervous about the Taxotere but no reaction! This morning I am feeling a little tired and mildly queasy but I am due to take dexmethasone soon which will wipe that out. It is hard to believe I just had chemo because so far, I am doing great!!! I slept last night and also took my first xanax ever. I had the lowest dosage possible so I did not notice much. One thing that did occur with the dexmethasone is my blood sugar went to 240 before I started the chemo. I never have high blood sugar. I believe high blood sugar is a side effect of the steroids. I will be taking dexmethasone through Sunday, 8mg a day. I have an online journal with much more detail of my experience with breast cancer. Feel free to check it out and sign my guestbook. www.caringbridge.org/visit/britainy Sweeney, your shaved head looks fabulous! I am starting to look forward to shaving my head! It is so hot here in Texas. My long hair adds to the heat! I hope all of my fellow August 19th starters are doing well today! I go for the Neulasta shot today! B ",
