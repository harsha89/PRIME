I had an agitation reaction to Taxol which was quickly fixed by Ativan, Pepcid and Benadryl. I received the on-body Nuelasta injector. I decided against icing my head as my toes, fingers and mouth were quite enough.Day 1 after chemo was perfect, no issues. Days 2-6 have intermittently been hard. Tons of bone pain on Claritin and ibuprofen, hot baths even in the middle of the night are the most effective! Weakness but insomnia with strange dreams plague me every night. Mouth sores and dulled taste are the only other SE.Overall, it hasn\u2019t been awful and as a single mom, I\u2019m still able to parent her even if I moan through some of it!",
