When I was about 22 I found a small lump a few days before my period. went to my doctor on campus and she wasnt worried about it due to the size and the fact it could be moved. It started to grow overtime only hurting around my period or if I had heavy amounts of caffeine. I took my nipple ring out and while the lump grew my nipple began being pulled inward. I went to see a doctor and they ordered a mammogram and ultrasound. A 4.73x2.77x5.45 cm mass was found. Swollen lymph\u2019s as well. This has I\u2019ll defined margins with punctuate microcalcificarions within. Highly suspicious for malignancy. Bi-rad 5 I was thinking it could be a fibroaderma. Because I got these results in less than 5 minutes. I go in for a biopsy this Friday. But I\u2019m very nervous. I really am hoping for the best but it\u2019s not looking too good. I haven\u2019t had the chance to live. Has anyone had this sort of issue and it has turned out not to be cancer. Or if it was cancer is this something that sounds familiar. Anything to help me worry less please. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I\u2019m just so scared and this is my first time dealing with something like this and my parents aren\u2019t in the states so that\u2019s even harder for me. If anyone wants to take a look at my results and maybe give feedback a PM would be nice thank you ladies",
