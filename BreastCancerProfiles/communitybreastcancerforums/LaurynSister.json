In fibrous breast tissue, the tumor infiltrates as individual cells, cords, cell nests. Focal intermediate grade DCIS is present. Immunohistochemical stains show tumor cells to be focally positive for E-cadherin. Pattern may suggest a tubulo-lobular differentiation of the tumor. Solid mass -- 16x14x16 cm, 1.5 cm from nipple. SIZE - 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 1. focal intermediate grade DCIS, cribiform type, is present but not extensive. Estrogen and Progesterone strongly present -- hormone fed She has an MRI on Thursday to check lymph nodes, etc. Surgery will be in a week or so. Any words of encouragement and truth would be appreciated! She is a precious wonderful woman -- 55 yrs old. Has grandkids and lots of animals. Loves to ride horses with me! Dx 8/31/2012, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
