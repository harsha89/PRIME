I am hoping to make others aware that it does not always show. I have had cancer for 7-8 years or more and it went undetected for 10 years of mammograms and a few ultrasounds. Chances are you are perfectly fine but please pursue it until you are 100 percent positive especially with your family history  Sending you good luck and hugs",

I was diagnosed January 2012 did all treatment and now today I do zumba , belly dancing, zumba toning , ellipitical machine 5 or more days a week. I think it is important to take care of yourself and eat well through out this -exercise even just walking (I could barely do that for about a year I had a pretty bad go of it and was very sick) but now time has passed my body is stronger now and I am doing great. As momime said in her post- live your life- I agree those are great words to live by. It is hard to get that mindset in the beginning but as time goes by she will gain strength of mind and understand what we are all saying. One other very important part is for you to - live your life- as well I found it easier on me when I saw my family doing normal things with there lives - day to day usual stuff- it made me feel more normal as well. Hugs to you and your mom",

I joined this online group and a local group and immediately felt better. Just to see people living normal lives after cancer DX and treatments was inspiring. And on this site I have met up with other ladies with almost the exact dx as me - same large tumor, same amount of nodes etc...same treatments. And that meant the world to me I was not alone and could talk to people that were or had experienced exactly the same things as me.

And how long have i had cancer and then my next thought was am i dying. But getting on here and reading everyones stories have given me soooo much hope for my future. I realize i am not alone and all of you are going through this cancer too. And there are so many options to try.

I suppose it is true about people being their worst enemy sometimes.

I had 2 tumors in my nodes 1 cm and 2 cm and the broke open and I think its called extracapsular or something like that. and I had a 9+ cm tumor in my breast. Mine is not exactly like yours but was a pretty tough way to start as well. I find most ILC ladies do not get found early and lots of us have a lot of nodes or large tumors or both as ILC is sneaky and not always detected early. They found my cancer 3 years ago but said it was probably there about 8 or more years undetected since my 30's. I had surgery double mastectomy  the same chemo as you and the same amount and radiation. I am on hormonal therapy now. Anastrazole. I did not have my ovaries removed but they did shut them down. It has taken them awhile to find something that would work as my body was not co operating but finally is okay. I am 95 % er +  pr+  her2 -  because I am 95% estrogen positive it was one of the most important parts of my treatment. They gave me tamoxifen then needles for months then anastrazole. They had said if they could not make my ovaries shut down they would have to remove them. I was told I will probly always need treatment but that's fine if im still alive so as long as it works I will do it. I have hit 3 years now since diagnosis and lead a pretty normal life right now. On this site you will find many woman with the same amount of nodes as you and many been alive along time much longer than me - its a glimmer of hope to me I hope it is to you too. If you have any questions please feel free to message me. Take a peek at the ILC board or stage 3 board in your drop down menu I am sure you will feel better after hanging around there awhile Hugs to you -Beth",

I told them i hardly notice the pain in the day at all . They have me set up for bone scan already it is monday i called on friday afternoon. Anyone know about night time bone mets pain? Has anyone had this. I am just a bit surprised by their reaction.  Crossing my fingers and toes its not.",

I did find it was at the time not so bad in beginning a bit harder near the end as your body is weaker but as YATCOMW said they have drugs to help with all sorts of symptoms. I did have a hard time for awhile of not feeling so great but it did pass once I was stronger. And I did have some heart issues it can be quite normal and that too did pass after some time. I know doing the heavy duty chemo was a scary thought for many reasons - but - thinking I did everything I possibly could to fight my cancer gave me strength and determination. And I am still here almost 5 years later. Good luck - Beth",

It seems everytime she finishes one test she decides to try a different test to  see. I am now headed to my third set of tests. First test i think was ultrasound and cat scan Last test they said they thought they saw a blemish or something that is why they said they redid  test with ultrasound again. This time they said the blemish is fine but now they really should do an MRI and scan as well and that a meeting is needed. Needless to say i am getting a bit worried. When they told me my bone scan was fine i was told on the phone why do i need a meeting for this. I know i had alot of cancer in me but i like to think it does not mean i have mets for surre. I dont think i have any type of symptoms but i guess i am not sure exactly what symptoms there are. The only odd thing i have noticed is my belly looks a bit swollen all the time but i also had both my breasts removed so i suppose it should look bigger. I guess i am sorta scared and unsure what to think right now.",

I do try not to over worry myself or let my large amount of cancer effect the way i think about everything but once in awhile i fall over thye edge it can be abit overwhelming.  I would be very surprised if your lesion is not related to breast cancer. Hopefully either way they can help you. Barsco1963 its almost scarier to think there could be no symptoms to warn us. Did you have them long before they found them? I guess i have unfortunately learned here that finding mets early does not neccasarily mean we will be cureable from what i have read here. Chrissy i remember  you messaging me when i first got here in January. I think you replied to my first post if i remember right -thank you  i needed that more than most people could imagine.

I appreciate you letting me know that is what yours felt like I try to not think about pains etc.. unless they do not go away so I don't over react. I am a bit worried but hate all the testing as we all probably do so just needed a opinion whether thought it was needed. I appreciate the information letting me know about meds and treatment - I always find the more you know sometimes it is a bit less scary because there may be treatments. My doctor has said from start they could never say I was cancer free or that if I was I would not stay that way because of cancer amount and aggression or something like that so I do try to keep on top of things and be observant of my body changes but at the same time try not to be a hypercondriac ether - its tricky sometimes. I will be requesting a bone scan at next appointment to check this out. Again thanks for taking the time to answer my question I appreciate it Hugs to you -Beth",
