      "Content": "Feb 4, 2013 05:12PM bottkota wrote: All great questions....let's see if I can do them any justice!  ;) 1.) Can you tell us a little about where you live in South Dakota and what would you recommend as some of the tops things to do there and in the surrounding area? I live in the southern eastern tip of South Dakota...close to the Minnesota border.  On our half of the state there is pretty much nothing to do nor any sites to see....it's boring over here!  BUT....on the western half of the state is BEAUTIFUL!  It is covered with hills and trees...hence the name it gets...Black Hills!  They look black!  I love it over there.  My brother lives there and so we have a chance to visit him and also sight see if we choose!  There is Mount Rushmore, Bear Country, Reptile Gardens, the Badlands...ect.  There is also the Sturgis Bike Rally in Sturgis every summer (huge attration for motorcycle lovers).  There is also skiing, snowboarding, hiking and camping that you can do.  If I could....I would live in Western South Dakota!  But my husband's job is here so we just visit and dream about living there! :) 2.) You have young children. How old are they?  How have they handled the different stages of your cancer journey from initial diagnosis, to mets and now NED? Any advice to other moms of young kids/teens? My kids are 17 (Briana), 12 (Mikayla), 10 (Colby) and 8 (Keara).  They were only 9, 4, 2 and almost 1 when I was first diagnosed!  Keara was just 10 days away from her 1st birthday.  And actually her first birthday I was in the hospital recovering from my double mastectomy!  So they were really young to understand what having cancer was all about.  I did the chemo and all that and we went on with our lives until Nov. 2009 when my cancer returned, by now they were 14, 9, 6 and 5.  They were scared now....we shed many tears....and my son feared that he was losing me.  We just took it one day at a time and put our hope and trust in the Lord and lived each day to the fullest.  It took almost 2 years before we reached NED and they have been excited that each scan has proven no cancer!  They are hopefully....but still have their fears....but I guess there is always that fear.  My husband and I have always been up front and honest with what goes one with me.  We don't want our children to ever wonder why we didn't keep them informed of things.  So we do our best to keep them up to speed in terms that they can understand.  Like last month when we sat them down and told them that I had quit chemo and was just doing the research drug.  They all had that scared look in their eyes....to them quiting chemo means death.  We told them that was not the case.  I needed a break and let my body heal itself so that when it comes back I will be a lot stronger to endure chemo again. Again we live each day to the fullest and enjoy each moment and memory! My advice to other moms with young kids/teens....love those kids as much as you can while you can!  Make LOTS of memories!  But don't be hard on yourself when you don't feel well enough to do something or be there for an event.  They will understand...probably not right away but when they are older they will get it!  Hugs, kisses and everything else! 3.) For which TNBC drug or combination of drugs have you been on a clinical trial?  Are you still on one?  What was your experience like? I started a clinical trial of Avastin, Abraxane and Gemzar when I was diagnosed with mets in Nov. 2009.  It really put a sock on my mets....nearly wiping it all out except for one stubborn node in my brachial plexus.  I was removed from Avastin in June 2010 due to a bladder infection and I truly believe that is why I progressed just 3 short months later.  The cancer got funny and moved to my liver with two small lesions.  I knew there was a PARP inhibitor trial down in Sioux City, Iowa that I could possibly qualify for.  So began my waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  This was no normal trial, instead it was an expanded access protocol with a \"lottery\".  Which meant my name went into a pool and was randomly drawn.  in the meantime....my cancer went out of control.  My liver was starting to be over taken with new tumors and the node in my brachial plexus was breaking out of its capsule.  So I did radiation to my chest and braxial while I waited.  My name was finally drawn and I started Carbo/Gemzar/Iniparib (BSI-201) in Nov. 2010, two months after we learned the cancer was in my liver.  That is the protocol I am still on today.  I acheived NED in Sept. 2011 and have remained that way since.  In Sept. 2012, we had to drop the gemzar because of low blood counts and just last month I chose to drop the carbo.  I will have a scan next month to see if the Iniparib alone has been enough to keep me NED!  I don't mind clinical trials...and they monitor you very carefully!  The only downside....taking a break is pretty hard to do, without getting off the trial.  So while I am doing someone in the future something good....some days are hard.... 4.) What is your favorite dessert and if it's something you make yourself, can you share the recipe? HMMMMM.....my favorite dessert would be my mom's homemade brownie recipe!  I LOVE chocolate and these satisfy the sweet tooth.  What is the best with them....warmed up, with some vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup!  YUMMY!!!  here is the recipe:                        Bring to a boil: 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of water and 4 tablespoons of cocoa.  Then add 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar and mix well.  Then add 1/2 cup buttermilk (I make my own buttermilk, 1 cup milk with 1 tablespoon of vinegar, let sit for about 10 min), 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon soda and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Mix well.  Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes in a greased cookie sheet.  :) The Brownie frosting is made this way: in a small saucepan heat to a boil: 1 stick butter, 1/3 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup cocoa.  Remove from heat and add 3 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Spread on brownies! THESE ARE THE BEST!!!!!  :) FATTENING....BUT TO DIE FOR!!!! 5.) If you were to win a prize of the party of your dreams, where would you hold it and what specifically would you request for type of food and entertainment? Well.....let's see....this is a tough one!  I guess a party of my dreams would be on the beach somewhere (I am not picky as long as it is a beach with an ocean).  Food would be lots and lots of dessert...cake, cookies, brownies and anything loaded with sugar but even more....smores over an open campfire....oh yeah!, along with that probably finger sandwiches with ham and turkey in them, pototao salad, plus lots of alcohol!  Beer, wine and Mike's Hard lemonade...mixed winter berry!  And entertainment would have to be some good dance music so we can dance and party under the stars all night long!   I hope that this gives everyone a better idea of who I am.  I don't post a lot but I sure do read a lot!  I have found some very inspirational women on this board!  I think I know who my next pick is....if she is ok with it!  Will need to PM her and ask her!  Plus come up with some questions!  It will probably be tomorrow afternoon before I get some questions done!  Thanks HeidiHill for the opportunity!  I appreciate it!

My onc also opened up a clinical trial in her office for me to get this drug. That is why it has taken months for approval. We have been trying since the first part of October.

It worked for 10 months and the cancer spread to my liver. I found a new onc who fought tooth and nail to get me into a trial with then PARP Iniparib along with chemo. That was my saving grace.

I was dropped from the trial and did carbo/gem alone for 6 months while my onc again fought tooth and nail to get me compassionate use veliparib, which I started in April 2014. She felt strongly that PARP's were good for my cancer she also feels that my BRCA status also plays a role into why they work so well for me. I am still on veliparib as a single agent for just a little over a year. I am grateful for my onc because I honestly believe I wouldn't be here still if I hadn't fought for myself and what I wanted. And a PARP is what I was wanting to get on for a long time before I did actually get on one.  Cathi",

How can they keep track of what your counts are doing. I just don't know what to do, I am very confused.

Just need to know what the right thing to do would be. And I don't have a lot of time to make that decision. Do you regret your decision to go on the drug? Thanks again for letting me know. Sorry again that it stopped working for you. :( what are you going on now for treatment?   Cathi",

I truly believe in the platinum drugs....carbo has done wonders against my cancer of course it has been with Gemzar too. Have you has those two as a combo??  I think carbo is way gentler on counts then gem. So here's to a little luck with it. Side effects are pretty good too. A little nausea the first 2 days after chemo a slight headache and that is about it. Pretty mild. 20+ months is a long time on a drug....that gives me a little bit of hope. I have to make my final decision by tomorrow so the research nurse has some time to get the drug to the cancer center by the following week. I am hoping that if I make the decision to go on the drug that it will be nicer to my platelets than the chemo was.  Thank you so much for all your input....it has been very helpful. I wish you the best of luck with carbo!!! I hope it kicks ass HARD!!!! Cathi",

My youngest daughter LOVES pink and will be decked out in pink, my two oldest don't like pink for other reasons, so they will have the ribbon as well. I didn't want to go buy pink but really wanted to honor her in some way, so a pink ribbon is the best i can do. It is about her and only her on Saturday. I will keep my thoughts and opinions to myself unless the door is opened for a discussion. And yes, she died because of the IBC. her last scan earlier this month showed tumors all over her body, plus she was going once a week or so to have her lungs drained. She entered hospice last Friday and died on Sunday. So fast...but such a fighter all the way!! Thanks again for the advice. Cathi",

Just last night we had a 'round table' discussion with our 4 kids. I have been on the same clinical trial for almost 2 years and we are now seeing the chemo taking its toll on my counts. My platelets were 34,000 yesterday, have to take another week off of chemo, my body just can't recover anymore in one short week. We asked what the kids thought about me going off one drug or both drugs and just getting the research drug. There was mixed thoughts of course. Kids think no chemo....mom dies. We have a huge decision to make and not an easy one at that. I truly hate this disease and what it does to us and our families. Those of us that walk this road...get it. Others.....not so much. So hard.....chin up girl and keep on fighting. I believe my children are worth the pain and suffering...to get one more day, week, month or year to see them grow. Cathi",
