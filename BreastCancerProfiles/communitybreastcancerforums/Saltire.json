She had a mammogram-negative.ultrasound-negative.and eventually an MRI and she a 9mm by 4mm mass. She ended up  having a double mastectomy . I am not meaning to scare you but i think all tests etc possible are done when there is a symptom which could turn out to be a cancer before a definate diagnosis is made. Good luck and i hope all turns out ok.",
