I had my lumpectomy and now I am in radiation.Â  I have been okayed to just have 4 weeks of rads - 20 treatments. They are giving me a higher dose every time so that after the 20 treatments I will have the same radiation as if I had 30 treatments. Has anybody else had this regime and if so are the side effects any worse. So far I am fine, a little tired, but only have had 3 treatments.",
