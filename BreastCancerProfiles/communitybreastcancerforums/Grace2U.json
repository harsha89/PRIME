      "Content": "Grace2U wrote: Daughter's CT guided bone biopsy did not find cancer. Her MRI and CT scans showed a 2cm lytic lesion on her spine, but when the doctor did the biopsy he said her bones were very strong and hard. I understand \"lytic lesion\" to be destroying the bone not make them strong. Anyway, her oncologist who initially said he was not convinced from the MRI that it was cancer is now saying that perhaps they didn't take enough sample. Daughter's tumor markers are normal, her blood work is also normal and she did have an auto accident a few weeks before this all happened and started experiencing back pain which could be showing as a hot spot on her back. So what now? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Grace2U wrote: My 36 yr old daughter was recently diagnosed with BC and within 2 weeks was told she had bone mets. It has been quite an ordeal and very scary but from reading these forums I can see that there is hope and that my daughter will be able to control her disease. We are still scared and confused. The nice onc has given us hopes that my daughter will be ok. I have one question, my daughter has RA and she also had a minor car accident before her diagnosis. The bone scan and MRI are showing the hot spots in 3 areas and one of those is the spine. Can the accident and the RA be the reason for the hot spots? The onc said he was not absolutely sure is was cancer so he wants to do biopsy to confirm. We got a second opinion and the onc said the same thing, wanted to do biopsy.....so is it standard procedure to do a biopsy? Thank you ladies and God bless all of you. Log in to post a reply",
