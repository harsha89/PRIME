We are all BRCA negative. Previous to my start of the drug, my doctor had told me she wanted me to lose weight. I am seeing a nutritionist and following her plan, but the weight is hanging on. I am VERY active so this is a bit troubling. Anyone have this issue? Have you figured out a way to \"get around this\"?. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

You can sign up and \"learn\" other thing about weight loss, but I'm already seeing a nutritionist. I am VERY active (workout 5-7 times a week, including running). The weight is just hanging on. I \"think\" I've lost a little bit in body mass since my clothes see a bit looser. I see my oncologist in 6 weeks and have my thyroid checked next month. Just going to soldier on. If you want the link, PM me and I will get it to you.",
