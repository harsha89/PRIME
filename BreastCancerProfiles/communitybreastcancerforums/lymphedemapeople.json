    "Content": "lymphedemapeople wrote: Good Morning everyone One of the important focuses of Lymphedema People and all our blogs,support groups and sites is education on ways to help prevent lymphedema.   With the many new and more accurate radiological tests and procedures, there simply is no excuse any longer for doctors to simply go in and yank out lymph nodes. Below is a brand new abstract on the accuracy of fine-needle biopsy.  I had one of these on an inguinal lymph node.  The good thing is that (1) it did not cause any problems at all for my leg lymphedema and (2) it was accurate enough to achieve a correct diagnoses of lymphoma. I hope this can be helpful to someone you might know that is facing testing.

Cancer. 2008 Feb 19 Alkuwari E, Auger M. Department of Pathology, McGill University Health Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of axillary lymph nodes is a simple, minimally invasive technique that can be used to improve preoperative determination of the status of the axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer, thereby serving as a tool with which to triage patients for sentinel versus full lymph node dissection procedures. The aim of the current study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of FNA cytology to detect metastatic breast carcinoma in axillary lymph nodes. METHODS: A total of 115 FNAs of axillary lymph nodes of breast cancer patients with histologic follow-up (subsequent sentinel or full lymph node dissection) were included in the current study. The specificity and sensitivity, as well as the positive and negative predictive values, were calculated. RESULTS: The positive and negative predictive values of FNA cytology of axillary lymph nodes for metastatic breast carcinoma were 1.00 and 0.60, respectively. The overall sensitivity of axillary lymph node FNA in all the cases studied was 65% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity of FNA was lower in the sentinel lymph node group than in the full lymph node dissection group (16% vs 88%, respectively), which was believed to be attributable to the small size of the metastatic foci in the sentinel lymph node group (median, 0.25 cm). All false-negative FNAs, with the exception of 1 case, were believed to be the result of sampling error. There was no 'true' false-positive FNA case in the current study. CONCLUSIONS: FNA of axillary lymph nodes is a sensitive and very specific method with which to detect metastasis in breast cancer patients. Because of its excellent positive predictive value, full axillary lymph node dissection can be planned safely instead of a sentinel lymph node dissection when a preoperative positive FNA result is rendered.
