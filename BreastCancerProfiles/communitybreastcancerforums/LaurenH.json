I get contact dermatitis all the time and it looks exactly like that. Try an OTC hydrocortisone cream and see if it clears up. I don\u2019t think skin Mets are likely to show up on a leg. I have only ever read about them on or near the scar and perhaps also on the scalp. Maybe ask your MO or a dermatologist.",

Waiting for those results was torture and I am one who likes to have a clear plan in place. Deanna - you were dead on in your analysis and My MO is treating it as oligiometestatic (sp?). He wants to radiate it even though I have no pain, along with hormonal and targeted therapy. Thanks so much for your support! Lauren",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2018 09:56PM - edited Feb 14, 2018 10:10PM by LaurenH Hi - I am new here and posted in another thread and thought I'd also post here. I've read about 80 of the 144 pages here and have learned a lot. Thank you all for that. My question is - has anyone ever had a bone biopsy after a suspicious MRI and PET for a bone met? I am 15 years from a Stage 2a, 1.5cm 1/23 node IDC ER/PR/HER2+ dx. Did surgery, AC+T, rads, 18 months of Herceptin and 11 years of Arimidex (lupron then complete hysterectomy). I was 33 when dx and am 48 now. My annual Breast MRI showed a spot on my 2nd anterior rib so Onc ordered blood work (all normal) and a PET scn. Rib was bright on PET but all else clear. It is a 5.1cm x 2.1 lesion. Onc thinks it odd to have only 1 met and for it to show up first on a rib. Also odd to be this shape and size. Hence biopsy this past Monday. I will see him tomorrow for results and I'm just looking for any hope that this might not be Mets. Dr Google has not been helpful in finding a reasonable alternative. ☹️ Also - Ihave no pain there, no matter how hard my Onc pressed on it.",
