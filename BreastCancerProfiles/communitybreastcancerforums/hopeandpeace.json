      "Content": "hopeandpeace wrote: Hello everyone, I am 41 years old. I have experienced breast pain in one small area of the lower section of my right breast for about 1 year. Sometimes during the month, it's worse, but it's not necessarily affiliated with my cycle. It's randomly more painful than other times, but the pain is always there, especially if I touch the area with even a smidgen of pressure. The pain sometimes shoots right through me. YYEEOOOOWWW! Sometimes when I take my bra off, I feel like I did when I was pregnant. But, just in my right breast and just in that one small area. That nipple of that breast will randomly go dark purple, too. I also have a lump at the very bottom of that breast just below and to the left of the painful area. I went to PCP yesterday for physical and asked her to feel. She feels around and immediately says the right breast tissue is 'noticeably different than the left'. She felt the lump and wonders if it's a cyst and isn't sure if it's actually in the breast tissue or not because it's right at the bottom of my breast. She had me set me up a screening mammo which I go to on Tuesday. Has anyone had an experience like this before? Thanks a lot for your help. H&P Log in to post a reply",
