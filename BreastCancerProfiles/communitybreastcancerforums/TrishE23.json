I have finally bounced back from chemo and have so much energy. It is so nice to feel good again. I hope this doesn't zap my energy too. So far I haven't had any redness or itching. When does that start?",

I gained 24 pounds and lost 9 about 2 weeks after my last chemotherapy. I am finally starting to feel stronger so I am going to start walking more and riding my bike. I know what you mean about Uncle Fester. My face was so bloated by the last chemo that my husband called me his apple dumpling...funny for him..not so funny for me. I hated it. It's easy to get down over it. We are bald, scarred, bloated, and tired! I also don't have any summer clothes to wear. I went and bought 2 pairs of capris that don't cut off my circulation and I rotate them. But I think people are on to me..I think I need to go get more..lol",
