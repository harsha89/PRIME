My husband is the opposite. he is taking it hard, but he tells me everyday that I am not going anywhere, so don't get all upset.. I am very strong and anyone who is going through this is very strong. You will find that strength to fight. Tell your husband to not focus on all the negative articles because there are really alot of people who live very long at this stage. The only difference is that we have to live with this diesease the rest of our life. We can have a quality life. it is up to you. When you feel like breaking down it is okay to do so. As far as telling the kids, I told then that mom is sick, but mom is very strong and she is going to be around along time but I will have to take better care of myself. Cance society sent me some coloring books etc that kids can understand in terms of explaining what cancer is and what mom has to go through. i know it sems like it is not fare, but from the sounds of things, you seem like you are very strong. You seem like you will have alot of support. Remember it is about you now and you have to take care of you if you want to be there for your little ones. It is important to continue to do the research and stay aware of the latest trials etc. take care, Monica",

I was told they got everything six years ago.I was checked in 2007 and everything was fine.  In 2008, I had test done and nothing showed up until later in the year when I started having pains. Being in this stage does not mean that it is over for us, so please do not claim that at all. We can live long as long as we take away the stress and  other things in our lifes that do not matter. I have very young children as well and I believe that I will be around. I know for sure that this time around I will not only rely on the doctors opinion about my cancer. I will make the decisions. I started hormonal treatment in Jan and have been feeling fine. you will too. If you continue to fight it will work out. You will have a long life. Stay around positive people amd enjoy doing what you like to do with your family. We can do it! Monica",

My cancer spread to my bones, so it hurst in several areas, but so far no cancer to any major organs. that's a blessing. I am premenopause. I take morpphine around the clock, but I m feeling fine.
