It is absolutely God's will to heal!  We were healed by the stripes of Jesus.  The only way to get through is to stand on God's word. I had to pray my way out of a tree today!    I'm very concerned about some fluctuations in my tumor markers, and I have to have a PET scan, something that I haven't been ordered for since I was diagnosed 3 years ago.  It's hard to not be afraid, but the Lord is our Comforter. Hang in there, and please keep posting.  There's lots of support here.",

Original Onc:  does bloodwork every 3 months when he meets me for my lupron shot, plus a physical exam.  Did mammos with ultrasound every 6 months and MRI every 6 months. Second Onc:  began seeing him just shy of being two years post-diagnosis because I moved out of state.  No scans, no blood work.  Mammo/ultrasound every 6 months, and breast MRI every 6 months. Third Onc:  hired her after I fired Onc #2 because I just HAD to have some bloodwork.  Her protocol is bloodwork every 3 months + exam, chest Xray annually, mammo/ultrasound every 6 months and breast MRI every 6 months; vaginal ultrasound annually Fourth Onc:  not sure but will meet her next month. I have moved out of state again.  I hate onc shopping. Don't feel dumped.  A lot of docs go very light on a stage 1 or 2 in order to reduce (statistically) unnecessary anxiety  and radiation exposure.  If you want more, you can ask for it, but it's ok as long as you're getting a good exam at least annually IMHO.",
