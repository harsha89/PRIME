All three oncologists said I was eligible to take the Oncotype test. Even my surgeon mentioned it - and this was three years ago. It seems to be standard practice at this point. HOpe this helps.",

My prognosis was good, no node involvement, low oncotype but we all know that cancer is a very unpredictable disease and sometimes will defy the statistics. that is always in the back of my mind.  And i also feel that if my body produced cancer cells once, it can certainly do it again. I try NOT to worry about every ache and pain - the Tamoxifen makes me very achy. I struggle with what I should worry about, when I should call the doctor, what are menopause symptoms, and what are side effects from the medication???  It is never ending in the minds of BC patients. I know!  I try to keep my mind busy so that I don't spiral downward into the worry zone. Good luck to you......I pray that you can deal with this diagnosis and move on with your life. ",

Not to mention the headaches and body aches from the Tamoxifen. I wish I could have my life back before the BC - when I didn't have to feel guilty about everything I put in my mouth for fear it will bring back the BC; when I didn't have to feel guilty about not exercising.....when I didn't have to just plain worry about cancer......I want that life back....

I would appreciate any input on this.......should I be concerned?

I have no desire to be busy constantly......I work from home part time, I take yoga classes, and I'm taking a college course in music. I also pray a lot and God listens.  Just because you don't hear from people frequently, it does not mean they are not thinking of you and loving you. You also have support here!!!
