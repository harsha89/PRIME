I have had tenderness for MONTHS that never eases up. It is there all day like a headache that is threatening to strike, you know, subtle but there. The other day my breast just 'felt heavier' I cannot explain it. It is no larger and no different in shape but it feels heavier as I go through the day. I am super small too so I never feel weight in my breasts.  She began the exam and said, \"This is a mass, right over here\" (Not same place I found the lump but same place I have had extreme tenderness). She  went right on to talk about my need to have another mammo and this time an ultrasound and then to the surgeon to remove it. None of that talk to ease my mind, you know, \"Just need to rule it out. No reason to be alarmed, etc...\" I am dumbstruck! I am kicking myself in the behind too because you know, that 'mass' she felt? I felt it a year ago (also the first year that I have missed a mammo since I was 20). I blew the mass off because I always think, 'Tumors must be round'... More than likely I just did not want to deal with the whole thing and went right into denial. I ignored it and explained it away just like with my breast pain, I just kept saying to my husband, \"It must be from the push up padding in the bra.\" Though the other breast is fine.  This mass is on my left breast in the upper left quardrent. Between the arm pit and nipple and sorta feels like it might extend under the nipple. It feels very irregular and somewhat bumpy. I know that statistically, the chance is low to be cancer but it is in my family. I am 41 with very dense breast which can conceal masses (the last 3 mammos I had, before the one I missed last year, required repeat pics because of tissue that had become very dense for those 3 consecutive years. Upper/outer quardrent on left breast. Blah, Blah, Blah. I know DRs dont just immediately tell you she is making you an appointment with a surgeon. I know they tell you how low the probability for cancer is. So, it knocked the wind out of me! Anyways, I want to just skip the darn imaging - but I wont. I am just fearful that once I know, then I know and my life is forever altered, and the lives of my children and husband. Just wanted to share. Thank you  Log in to post a reply",

I appreciate your cooments. Hard to talk to my husband about any of this.FIrst thing he did was run around the house yelling the C word and how much money it will cost us to take care of it. Right in front of my 12 year old, who did not need to know about this, not until we know.  He did this only because he is filled with fear. He is not a bad guy just self centered. And so, I cannot talk to him about any of this. I do have a strong network of female friends who will be able to help me as much as I need them. Rides to appointments, help at home if I do have BC and I get really sick. Emotional support, etc... But none of them have BC and I am sure I will need you all too. Thank you so much for being willing to share your experience, strengh and hope. ",
