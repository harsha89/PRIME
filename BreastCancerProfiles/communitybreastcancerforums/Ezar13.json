      "Content": "Dec 1, 2016 07:38AM - edited Dec 1, 2016 07:39AM by Ezar13 I know exactly how you feel. I'm 27 and going through something similar at the moment but went through it previously when I Was 25 Newley wed on my honeymoon. I found a lump at the beginning of our honeymoon and because we would be overseas for 3 months I didn't want to wait until I go back home to check it out. Long story short i saw numerous drs and one professed (one of the best in England) who all told me I had cancer (they said they were 99% sure and \"never wrong\") based on my mammogram, ultrasound and MRI. Had the biopsy and it came back all clear. Returned home and had the lumps removed last year in September and they were tested. They were benign scar tissue. The biopsy didn't hurt it was just more scary thinking about it than the actual procedure. One month later I was pregnant and in July this year I had a babyand I'm currently breastfeeding. Now I've felt a lump in my other breast and had an ultrasound the other day but they couldn't see anything suspicious because my breasts are lactating so now I need an MRI next week. I am terrified and can't help thinking negative thoughts. I just had a big cry to my husband that I'll have cancer and die and our 4 month old will grow up not knowing her mom. I'm heartbroken. I truly hope all goes well for you. Please let Us know how you go.",

I went through the exact same thing a few weeks ago (if you click my name, you can find my posts!) so long story short, I'm breastfeeding my 5 month old Bub and noticed a bunch of small lumps right next to my left nipple kind of underneath and also some lumps in the upper outer part of my breast. Sounds similar to yours, like a bunch of rice grains. I freaked and immediately thought the worst! Particularly when my dr took it seriously and asked me to do an ultrasound, then the breast specialist reviewing my ultrasound told me to do an MRI. I felt the same as you and cried and cried every day. I cried at the ultrasound, MRI and the doctors appointment. My husband had to calm me down so many times. I had mastitis twice in my left breast and a nipple infection and due to supply issues I pumped that breast until it was sore and bleeding. I had my MRI and it was all clear! No cancer, just normal lactational change. I also think all the infections I had may have inflamed the tissue which made it feel lumpy. I know it's easier said than done, but please try not to stress yourself out. You'll just burn all your energy over something you might not even have. Your lumps may just be due to lactational changes like mine were. Our boobs do some crazy things while breastfeeding. Even before breastfeeding I had a suspicious lump in my right breast which turned out to be scar tissue. It could be so many other benign things! Good luck with everything and hope you get some good news soon.",

I am here for you too if you ever need a chat, or a vent. Im sorry your biopsy didn't go so well. They are so yucky but at least now it's over and you won't need one again. I know what you mean when you say you don't feel yourself afterward. I remember my breast was hurting to much I needed my husband to help wash my hair in the shower I felt so weak and useless and just down. Im glad to hear you had your mother there for support though, it makes a world of difference. Im sincerely hoping your tests come back in 15 days all clear. It'll be a long wait but I find that spending time with Bub makes me feel a million times better. Keep us updated on your results and I'll do the same. I have an MRI on Tuesday. Praying everything will be ok for the both of us. It just has to be. We have to be okfor our babies.",
