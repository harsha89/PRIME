I relied too much on the docs and nurses and they scared the crap out of me. I remember the time between my diagnosis and my surgery and how hard my heart pounded...I thought it was going to pound out of my chest. I had so much fear. Anyway, the day of my surgery, as I was sitting in the waiting room, I picked up a TIME magazine. On the cover of the magazine, the story title was \"Are we overtreating breast cancer?\" and it was about DCIS. I think it was an omen to me...but one that I didn't listen to. I called my doctor down before my surgery and she took the magazine away from me and told me that it didn't apply to me as I was grade 3. So I went ahead with my surgery. I had no history of cancer in my family (that I know of). My DCIS was found on a routine mammogram. I went to a support group which is led by a retired M.D.. By this time I had done more reading up on DCIS and really wished that I hadn't done my surgery. The doctor told me that they did a study in another country (I think Sweden) where they did an autopsy on everyone after death. They found that somewhere near 50% of the women that died of a cause other than breast cancer had DCIS in their breasts. Finding that info out after the fact really sent me over the edge. I have been battling severe depression over this for about 18 months now. I have since found out that there was a study about 20 years ago that found that 25% of women that undergo mastectomies have depression. I guess that I am in the 25% group. It is my opinion that DCIS (especially low grade) is overtreated. However, everyone must do what they think is best for them and their own fear factor. I totally understand how you feel but remember, once you have the mastectomy, you live with it for the rest of your life. And no one ever told me about the depression. It is hard to believe that the mind can make you feel so bad. I am starting to do better finally, but for a while I wasn't sure that I was going to make it. The depression (for me) has been much worse than the fear. Good luck to you what ever you decide.",

There are other things I would like to discuss regarding chemo topics but I don't dare because it would anger others.

They don't want to hear that the way that they eat contributes to animal cruelty, health issues and environmental issues. I know that you are writing from your heart and I thank you for it but you will be blasted if you say it anywhere but on the alternative thread. Come to think of it you will probably get blasted there too. Imagine what Dr. Campbell goes thru. I met him earlier this year and he said that spreading the word about nutrition has been a battle. He has lots of followers but also a lot of outspoken skeptics which like to argue. And the meat and dairy industry hates him. I just want you to know that I have your back.

To be honest, that info really made me spiral down to a dark place. He probably shouldn't have told me but I begged him for his opinion. He also doesn't think that I should be on an anti depressant because my depression is too specific. And it isn't just depression, it is major regret. I was just pointing out to cariboob that it is something to think about because I never did. I wouldn't recommend a mammogram to anyone, not even my girls.

I had my first breast removed in 04' due to a routine mammogram which showed that I had DCIS in 2 and probably 3 areas of my left breast. I was told that I needed a mastectomy because my breast had a lot of DCIS in it and I wouldn't have a lot of it left after the DCIS was removed. I didn't want to lose my breast but I didn't want to keep the breast and be put in a position later of having a later stage of cancer which is harder to manage. I kept having mammograms and 2 years later I have a scare. They do an u/s and tell me that they see a cyst. (I freaked out when I got a bad ultrasound). So my next mammo is ok and the one after (08') they find b/c again. The nightmare starts continues.. The doc told me I could have another mastectomy or a lumpectomy with rads. It was a hard decision but I didn't really like being lopsided. I could have had a lumpectomy with rads but this time I chose a mastectomy because I thought it was the smartest thing to do for my health (but I have since wondered about my decision). A bilateral mastectomy was much tougher on me that a unilateral. I had one breast for 4 years and handled the situation reasonably well. I figured I would be able to handle the loss of them both but it has not been easy. You are not far from me. I am in Key West. I know exactly how you feel. You can pm (private message) me anytime. If you want to talk, pm me your phone number and the time I should call you and I will do that.",

I have had early stage bc twice and have been researching it like crazy for the past 6 months. Like you, I have lost some trust in doctors and want to be my own advocate. May I suggest that you consider reading \"The China Study\" by T. Colin Campbell. Dr. Campbell is a researcher that has studied nutrition for many years. His specialty is nutrition and cancer. He has proven that certain foods promote cancer. And yes, these foods are animal based. To simplify his findings, he compares cancer cells to grass seed. If you plant grass seed and give it no water and no sunlight, it stays dormant but when you add the water and light at a later time, the seeds begin to grow. He has proven the same with cancer. I have met Dr. Campbell and he is not trying to sell anything, he is just telling what he has learned. I hope I have been helpful to you in some small way. Many people don't believe nutrition has anything to do with cancer but it makes a lot of sense to me.",

I do know that I have some body image problems that recon would help with but it is still not right for me.  Anyway, you can always get recon later if you change your mind. I hated my scars and got tattoos over them. It makes it easier for me to look in the mirror. The bottom line is that there needs to be some other cure besides cutting off breasts.

So I suggest that you eat healthy, maintain a healthy weight, exercise, check out nutrition books about foods that specifically fight cancer and do self breast exams. I know that you are scared but it is very emotional to lose your breasts. I am finding that my joy and happiness is seriously affected by the loss of my breasts. I think your doctors are right. Please don't consider this surgery at this time. I am afraid that you will regret it deeply. Good luck to you.",

Sex is still the same for us. The big problem is within my head. I feel disfigured and I am depressed. I also lack confidence and I cry easily. Our marriage is not as good as it used to be and it is probably entirely my fault. I have a bad attitude and I know it but I am just not a happy person anymore and I don't seem to be able to fake it for any length of time. I don't feel sexy and I wish I had never had the mammogram. See what a downer I am?? And I have a great life that I am doing my best to ruin. I used to be a positive person. I felt a spirit leave my body shortly after my mastectomy and I am convienced that it was my positive life force. I am a negative shell of who I used to be.  Sorry for the negative feedback but it is the truth. ",

You can probably find some info on google under \"seeding from biopsy\" and you can also check the search feature on breastcancer.org under key word and type seeding. It makes sense that it is possible. Good luck to you.",

I had an incident with my eye about 2 years ago. It hurt and made me crazy. I figured it was pink eye and tried various ointments before I finally went to an eye doctor. Turns out is it was \"iritis\" which is a medical emergency and you can lose your vision. It is serious!!! It has to do with the iris. I don't mean to scare you, but please get it checked.",
