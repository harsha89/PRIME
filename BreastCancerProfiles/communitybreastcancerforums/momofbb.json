You never know, so please don't worry.  I worried and decided on what type of mastectomy,etc. I would choose.  Had told my teenage kids.  He was so absolutely certain.  You never know! I'm definitely not out of the woods, but it's a little better picture than he painted.  My prayers are with everyone.  Take care.",
