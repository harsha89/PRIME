    "Content": "curioustls wrote: I have always been told to look for lumps in my right breast, but what I feel isn't really a lump.  It is more of a thickening in one area of my breast, it doesn't hurt or move and I can't feel it if I am lying down.  It is more noticeable when I am standing and my husband can feel it also.  It is right in line with an area I had biopsied  last October, during a routine mammogram microcalifications showed up and concernced the dr enough for it to be biopsied.  The biopsy was on the inside of my breast (turned out to be nothing) and the area I feel is on the outside.  I am concerned and my Dr. understands enough to order another mammogram to check it out, even though she didn't really feel anything.  I have a mammogram this friday, but stumbled on this site doing a little research.  Could this be something serious or am I being overly dramatic because of the earlier microcalifications?  Any information would be appreciated.
