I am still having chemo.  I lost my hair a couple of weeks after my first AC - buzzed it once it started coming out in handfuls. I've now completed 5/12 weekly Taxol treatments and my hair is growing back.  It started a couple of weeks ago and I'm completely obssessed with it!  I wonder will it continue to grow?  Will it fall out again?  I'm just happy to think I might have hair for Christmas ... that is my goal. On the rest of my hair.  I have a few lashes on top (not many) and haven't had any lower lashes for a couple of months.  My left brow is hanging in there but the right one is looking odd and missing a chunk in the middle.  Thank goodness for makeup!",

I'm not being tested as I have no family history.  My onc wants to do Ooph when I'm done with Rads.  I'm 40 and concerned about what this means and SEs. How are you finding it? Are you in Chch? I can't imagine how stressful and unsettling it must be.",

Yesterday I noticed lots of hair coming out after my shower and when running my hands through my hair I pulled out lots of strands. Today it has increased to a good handul when I pull. Apart from that I've not noticed itchiness or tenderness that others have. I'm planning on shaving it off on Saturday. I can't face the thought of it falling out more and more each day. Good luck!",

It sounds like you are doing great Solacetea.  I was interested if there was an increase in any side effects (hot flashes).  I already suffer from hot flashes quite regularly so I figured it would be status quo.",
