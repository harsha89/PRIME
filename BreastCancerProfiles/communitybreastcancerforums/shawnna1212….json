You dont know there stories or what they had going on at home or what they have dealt with. When i was first dx with bc it was a stage 1 i had to do chemo, rads, had lymph node involvement, had a double mx i also had to have shots in my belly 6 days a week, the shots were what made me so sick, I couldnt get out of bed, the pain in my whole body was excruciating i had to take pain meds to keep it under control i couldnt even hardly walk. I did charities as well. excersized and took care of small children at home like you- but i had to have help and yes i did cry often from the pain and with what i went thru- because i had a right to, it didnt define me as a wimp or some one who couldnt handle the pain it just was, and i would of given any thing not to have gone thru that ever....Not every one is alike, and not every one has the same side effects or reactions to any illnes, but when it happens it cant be helped and it is ours not any one elses to own but no one should ever have the right to say weather we should or should not be able to handle things, i commend you for being so brave and able to work and do all the things in our normal life, glad you were one of them that didnt have the pain so bad you couldnt get out of bed if your life depended on it.. yes i too applaud the stage4 ladies they are my inspiration, but they dont criticize us for what we are going thru and neither should you- Im angry for my new dx i have now, but would never belittle any one who has a lesser dx they are still suffering and going thru there crisis as little as it may seem to you it is real to them. Im not angry at you at all, just wanted you to know how i felt too and was hoping i can help you to see the whole picture- sending good wishes!",
