Out of all the woman in my family I am the only one who still has her real breasts. For 3 years I have put off the genetic testing for the gene. About 4 months ago I felt like God finaly spoke to me, I need to get this test done sooner then later. The company where I live that does the mammograms and MRIs told me because of my age they would not do the mammogram that my doctor requested. Only way they would is if I had a positive genetic test. So I am about maybe 3 weeks away from the test getring done and it is scary. I have over a 50% chance of being positive for the gene that will change so much in my life and I am lost.",
