Rapid heart, flushed face and a feeling of fullness in my midsection. They stopped the drip and  I was  given more steroids and benedryl.  They restarted the drip and continued it on a slower rate.   The third dose TAC they reduced the  taxotere by 15% and I tolerated it ok but was still having discomfort so they reduced the last 3 doses of taxotere by 25% of the original dosage. That was the lowest they wanted to go so I could get the benefit of the drug.  They also slowed the rate of the taxotere drip and I tolerated it better and they followed the taxotere by more IV fluids to better hydrate me and get the drug flushed through my system faster.  I never switched treatments.  I hope you can finish yours without much difficulty Best wishes MarciaA.",

In case any of my TAC Sisters visit this thread over the holidays, I just want to wish all of you a Happy Thanksgiving.  I am personally thankful to still be here.  I hope all of you are doing well.  I will always be thankful for this thread and message board and those of you who helped guide us all through treatment.  Our treatments must be working because it appears as time goes on,so does our lives and we have less and less time to leave messages.  That is a good thing! Happy Holidays ladies and to those just beginning treatment, keep the faith that as time goes by, one day soon you too may feel good again and  be too busy to type on the message boards. Hugs to all!

I take gabapentin at night and it helps.  I also take vitamin E, B6 and Caltrate and Vitamin D... I notice if I don't take the vitamins for a day or so the flashes get worse.  My gyn told me my hot flashes could last forever....UGH!..  I have my next mammogram in January.  We are getting close to 4 years from diagnosis!   I still feel excited to be able to see every season!  I will never take that for granted anymore.  I would love to hear from other TAC sisters too.  Have a good holiday Season Leigh!...

I too hate seeing all the new bc cases.  So frustrating!!!  It has been two years since we began this thread but it really really helped me get through some rough times.  I am still holding my breath.  I am still keeping my fingers crossed that I will be NED with every check up.  It is wonderful to be alive.  Spring is coming!  What a joy each day is.  Keep posting so we can rejoice and celebrate still being here after TAC! Everyone take care ! MarciaA.",

He counts survivorship anniversaries when I completed my chemo which was in July of 2006.  He told me recurrences for my type were most likely during the first three years so I am really looking forward to a good report.  I think often about my TAC sisters on this site and how you all got me through such a rough time.  I am trying to find my new wellness, not like I used to be but still I am here.  Would love to hear from you.  You are among my thoughts and blessings.

Take care marciaA.",

I know what you mean about stress.  Seems like I don't tolerate it as well as I used to. I hope you find some part time work you will enjoy.  Sorry to hear about your surgeries. I hope you are about finished with them. I have yearly mammograms and am now on an every 4 month schedule with my hemo/oncologist where I get tumor markers and blood work done.  I still get a bit nervous and kinda brace myself before I get the results. My hair  has gotten  a little thinner than it use to be in the past few months. For me maybe it is a menopausal thing since Chemo threw me into it.  Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.  I hope all our TAC sisters have a happy healthy new year as well. Best wishes MarciaA.",

It was a blessing to celebrate a 3 year survival anniversary.  My oncologist counts my survival date when I finished Chemo which was the end of July 2006.  I remember thinking I wouldn't be one of the lucky ones to survive very long.  But here I am three years later.  I still have a bit of neuropathy at times but its livable.  I still have hot flashes.  Every pain or abnormal symptom still causes me to wonder if I should get it checked out.  I had a CT in November which saw a thyroid nodule., I had a Ultrasound of my thyroid today so I am wondering if I will have the cyst biopsied.  (Im reading a lot about the connection between thyroid and breast cancers).  But I am happy to be here.  It sounds like you haven't slowed down a bit!  Thats great news and I hope all the tests you had in August were clear!  Keep in touch and I hope others who read our posts who are taking TAC can be encouraged that it is working for us so far!  Keep in touch!

Hope everyone else is doing well and Perhaps PeeJay or others from this TAC sisterhood will check in and let us know how they are. Take care MarciaA.",
