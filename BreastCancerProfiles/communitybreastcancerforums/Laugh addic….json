I had some surgery to remove some \"unhappy\" tissue yesterday.  I love my PS!  He is just so calming and assures me that all will be well! I didn't feel a thing.  Just a bit odd to have someone working on you while you are awake, but I really got to know him in that 1-1/2 hours!  I am hoping my tissue is \"happy\" now! My original 2 drain tubes are still in.  He is thinking maybe next week.  I was starting to feel crunchy about it and then became thankful that there is only 2 and they are serving a very important purpose.   I can't believe we are already at December 15th.  Half way through the month.  Soon we will be those that the January gals will be looking to for support. This community is so amazing! Thank you all!! Tina ",

I still have one drain tube in....30 days and counting.  Also have been having trouble keeping wound closed.  I guess I start to feel good then do too much. My visit on Tuesday only needed a couple stitches.  I guess it's progress huh? :) Today my break down was caused by wanting to shower.  My boyfriend found me in the bathroom crying with almost a roll of tape on me trying to cover my stitches and drain.  I felt so silly!  But he got me laughing and is on his way to the store for some supplies.  I meet with the oncologist on Tuesday to get Oncotype Dx test results then off to PS for drain removal.  Bring it on 2011!  Take care and rest easy everyone! Hugs.... Tina ",

Everything went very smoothly.  I was nervous about the sentinel node injections which were no big deal after all.  They did numb with spray before hand.  I had a BMX with TE's.  I am sore but doing great.  Never got sick from pain meds and was up and around the next morning. My spirits have been up and I had the nurses laughing the whole time.  I think if you can keep a smile on your face it makes all the difference.  There were times when I may have put on a happy face for the benefit of others, but it ultimately felt good to wear the smile! :)  I know everyone is different and will deal with this in their own way.  Just try and reach deep down and find the positive and remember we are alive....that is why we are in pain, or fear.   Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions.   I hope my our November 30, Dec,1st, 2nd and 3rd girls are doing well.  Wishing you all the best and look forward to hearing how you all are.  Remember to laugh between the tears!  Tina :-) ",
