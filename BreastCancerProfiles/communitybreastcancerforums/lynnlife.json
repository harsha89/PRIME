I have never had a mamogram.About five years ago asked my NP for  basically a screening for my risk of breast cancer and/or other reproductive cancers.I didn't get very good information or support.Also insurance didn't seem to cover much as far as getting tests done.A mamogram it covered,but  my NP said that for women under 50 they are too inaccurate. Fast foward to about a year ago when after I had puposefully lost about 60lbs and (not purpusefully)gained about 40lbs back I noticed both breasts had really sagged and in relaxed postions both nipples are pointing straight down at the floor.I got kind of worried but having no health insuance at this time I went online and researched sagging breasts and saw pictures of breasts looking a lot like mine after pregnancies,weight loss,gain age etc.It calmed my nerves some. About a month a finally got health insurance again and I have  since been trying to work up the nerve to go see a doctor(I am so scared) again, when one week ago I discovered a lump in my right breast.I don't easily feel it with my fingers,but when I put my right arm over my right breast i feel something push forward.My husband was able to feel it with his fingers last night.He is not real worried,but does want me to see a doctor.He did some  reseach and wants to see if it goes away after my cycle. For me though I've been examining my breasts more and more and the right one dose seem to have more of a flatness to it than the left. I am making an appointment first thing Monday morning. I can't stop thinking about this.I pretty conviced of the worst.If I started noticing a year ago ,how far could this have progressed?HELP!Any words of comfort or any more questions about this? Thank you so very much!  Lynn Log in to post a reply",
