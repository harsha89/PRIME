As for cause, from what I've read in the medical literature, capsulation is about 30-50% among BC pts., much higher than cosmetic pts. Much of that is due to the tissue changes due to rads. On the other hand, encapsulating is \"independent of surgical skill\" from what I've been reading and what the medical literature terms as \"idiopathic\" (rough translation, depends on the pt. and a major medical \"go figure\"). My first PS (I gave up and went to another for DIEP) recommended massage after the exchange, then put me on Accolate to try to reduce the encapsulation. Neither worked. In the interest of full disclosure I have a crappy immune system due to chronic allergies and asthma. To me, my body responded to the implants like a foreign body. My original PS said that there's \"anecdotal evidence\" to support that but nothing in the medical literature (and I've also done that search).  This is just my $.02, but from your post your biggest risk is your rads. Heavy lifting will possibly increase your risk of lymphedema if you had any nodes removed, but nothing on your list should increase the risk of encapsulation from my experience or reading. I'm very physically active, but my encapsulation started before I had been released to exercise.",

MRI is scheduled for Wednesday, and I should know the results of that w/in a couple of days. I'm wondering what folks in this situation were advised (yes, I'm playing the guessing game for the holidays). Wait and see if the ADH moves to DCIS? Tamoxifen? Surgery w/or w/out rads? I will say that I'm at Hoag in Newport Beach w/an excellent team. My appt. w/my onc is scheduled for the 2nd week of January unless he moves it up. My onc and I agreed that I would not take tamoxifen after my mx. Unless he (not my surgeon) convinces me otherwise, my gut feeling is to continue to reject tamoxifen. I honestly think that I'd prefer additional surgery than to tolerate the side effects.",

First, my surgeon showed me what I'd be left w/after a lumpectomy (I'm a 32B, and it was about half of my breast). Then, when he read the pathology report to me, I was sure that mastectomy was the answer. Not only was it throughout the ducts (they're very, very, small and radiate through the breast) but the path report indicated DCIS in a \"buckshot pattern.\" There is no way that they could have gotten all of it w/out a mastectomy. There are some that say that DCIS might never turn into invasive cancer, but I was unwilling to take that chance. I hated having the mastectomy, but now that I've got an excellent recon (DIEP flap) it's not that big of a deal. I certanly didn't want to risk my life over a breast.

That gives you a lot of strength--information is power. My dean also gave me a semester off (there's no such things as subs at a univeristy) and the checks kept coming. So that helped tremendiously. The treatment after all of my research and consults was a no brainer. What is more difficult is the choice of reconstruction--if you decide to go that route. Had I been bilateral, I might not have. After a horrible experience w/implants, I'm very pleased w/my DIEP. I really feel back to normal, especially since my bra size has stabilized and I can buy some normal clothes. Oh, and the stats? The latest article I pulled up on Medline indicates that I have a cumulative risk of 0.4% per year for a recurrence, though I'm double the risk of a new cancer on the other side (11% to 22%). That said, I can live w/those odds especially since I have a wonderful oncologist who is encouraging lifestyle management rather than tamoxifen. If I live to my mid-90s you're talking about a 20% chance of recurrence or new cancer w/out treatment w/tamoxifen, and my exericse and diet regimen reduces that risk substantially.  I think that I'm going to be around for quite a while annoying my students.

The BS I consulted w/locally said that the skin-sparring mx that I wanted and recon just wasn't available in the IE and I should go to Hoag in Newport or City of Hope (I think that's Duarte).

The research has only assessed its effectiveness w/women w/DCIS and higher grades of cancer. That's more of an onc's judgment call than a surgeon. And, BTW, my onc and I decided not to go w/the Tamoxifen. You're not paranoid--you're vigilant. You'll be amazed at the technology at the MD's fingertips at Hoag. It really is worth the drive.

From where I am  it's less than an hour's drive.I was very unhappy w/the diagnostics here in town w/my ADH dx and still having to wait 6 weeks for a stereotactic biopsy and then Redlands Community wanting me to return for the 2nd spot. I flat out refused to leave the table and told them to keep going. Hoag's comprehensive breast care center has available right there ultrasound, MRI, digital mammograms, etc. I've never gone back to my MDs in town since my experience at Hoag. My DCIS was found 6 months via stereotactic biopsy after my ADH dx--not to scare you, but to emphasize the importance of vigilance and high quality care. Dr. Snyder now performs my annual mammos and either he or my onc orders an MRI either every year or every other year, depending on how things are going. I get all of my breast care out there, though I still get an annual w/my family practice guy here. Another thing about Dr. Snyder is that he is very, very good about discussing options especially in cases like ADH and DCIS that are very complicated. Feel free to PM if you'd like.Frankly, w/PPO I won't deal w/treatment in the IE for this.",

My decision might be different if my cancer were more aggressive and if it were bilateral. As I told a friend of mine, I just couldn't go w/the \"Amazon look\" and I have a low risk of recurrence. I did get pushed toward saline implants at first--I had researched the BS and the comprehensive cancer center thoroughly, and though the PS was well recommended by the BS and the RNs (always listen to the RNs), it failed. I have been delighted w/my DIEP reconstruction, though I had it a year later due to work obligations. If I do have a recurrence, I'll have an autologous reconstruction in a heartbeat. That said, had the cancer been diagnosed in both breasts, I might very well have opted for no reconstruction.",
