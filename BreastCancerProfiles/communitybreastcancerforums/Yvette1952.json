Sternum lit up on PET scan that has not been confirmed as met but is definitely a fracture. I had liver lesion ablated in December and have just got results, another met is showing up. The liver specialist has said that as the met has shown up so soon after the ablation that chemo is required to treat the whole body. I am waiting for a call from the hospital and then oncologist appointment. I feel scared and anxious about more chemo. Any thoughts on questions for oncologist",

I am not very happy with him as I find him to be very negative, I have asked about changing oncologists and it is an option but don't know if I will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire! How often and how do you get your treatment? I am currently on Tamoxifen, will fill out medical history when I have looked up dates. Mets have not been biopsies and sternum is still an uncertainty.",
