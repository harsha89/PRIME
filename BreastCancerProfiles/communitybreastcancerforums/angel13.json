I normally do not drink but these past few weeks I have taken a sip and it helps for about oh 2 sec.. My husband is going back to work in Saudi next week ..depending on my results so we have been doing things around the island here..lots to do and see..I don't hardly know anyone here because we just moved here but I do volunteer work 1 day week so that really helps. I know what you mean about not telling anyone they do not know where I volunteer and it is a close knit group..and I keep thinking ..and I shouldn't..what if it is bad news then how do you begin to tell people. This will come out of left field for them and for my mother in law and father in law. I just felt that I was doing enough worrying for everyone and did not want to be a bother or a burden. All I would say if any should ask is thank-you for your asking not bad..and I think anyone that knows you will know by your tone of voice and how you say it and then change the subject back to them and How are you doing? Actually it happened today to me and it went very well by me approaaching it like that..Good Luck with that okay. I wish I also had mine also so I can feel a spark of happiness again. When are your results Leneza? Take Care the best you can and A Big Hug Andrea",

I have not tried digital but I love doing it it sure takes your mind and thoughts to another level. I was suppose to get my results on the 20th but they could not get me in so it is the 24th.They do not give that info on the phone no way no how..I know what you mean about other aches and pains and it is funny how we can prioritze in a heartbeat. Thank-you for letting me know about the Path Report..I will look at that also.. It takes me a long time to fall asleep and it usually ends up in tears and a prayer. How I wish this was a dream but it is very real and we have to try and deal with this the best that we can..and is it easy..no..but we will get through this togeather one way or another. The kids must be a blessing for you they can take one's mind off if only for a while and every bit and every minute helps. My fingers crossed for you and you know I will be thinking about you!

Also I hear you about wanting this all over..I don't know if this happens to you or anyone here but just those few moments when your mind has 1 or 2 minutes piece something cancer related will pop up and....boom back at the worry again. I feel sometimes like a yo yo up and down and then of course thanks to my mind I start looking at other parts of my body if something hurts and I think is that something also...but I am quickley learning to put that the farthest away from my mind otherwise I will need a straight jacket. Besides this wonderful group I have 2 friends that I kinda confide in but in some ways I feel like I am pushing them away like I have done with some of my other friends. It is nice to talk to them but they do not understand what really..we are going through and bless them for trying to care. Does your family know at all Sue? My husband knows but I feel he is either acting like this is a flu/cold and it will be over soon and so I do not talk to him at all only abou this wonderful site I have found and all of you which if we could could not bounce off each other I don't know where I would be right now. Did they say when they plan on getting this done for you? Hopefully the sooner the better. You are in my thoughts and let me know when they have a date and of course chat anytime for support.

You just look at life a wee bit differently and want to be like that normal person on the street or at work or shopping..but you can't. The waiting is very hard and I am doing my best to keep my chin up. I hope one day that I can wake up and have a smile on my face that I have lost since June 2011.
