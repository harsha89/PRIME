It is great that your DH can communicate his problems to you. It's a pitty that your trip will not happen. If you guys are up to it, maybe you can have a picnic at home since the weather doesn't look that great for NY (take out food, put down a big blanket, maybe play some games with the boys, then sent them to bed and have dessert by candle light or watch a movie if you are not to tired). I sure will say prayers for you and hope that your weekend will be nice despite all the set backs.... Happy Anniversary Diane, God Bless",

Having read good things about Femara, I wanted to be able to take it, that was my drug of choice. I had a bladder lift when I had my hysterectomy and stayed one night. I walked 2 miles the day I got out. It was an easy surgery compared to the mast. Don't get me wrong, you need to listen to the doc. I just want to say as scared as I was before, it wasn't as bad as expected. Maybe it was just such a great feeling to nip the possible cancer cells remaining (if any) in the rear....(if you know what I mean) and depriving estrogen. I still feel \"young\" enough, I take Biotin for the hair and nails, I try to eat healthy and the weight comes of slowly if I don't go overboard with the chocolate ;) God Bless",

While I never had to endure what you have to go through and this is not a comparison since I had only IDC, no mets, it is the one thing I hopefully never have to take. I had to talk the doc into lowering the dose and it helped. Don;t know if this is possible at all for you. I am so sorry you have to go through this. Lots of prayers!!",

The AI's are known to do something to the bones....who knows? not everything is figured out yet. Are you taking Fish Oil? I am so sorry it affects your feet now too....what a bummer....I swear by fish oil, my daughter has so much reduced pain and more mobility since she also takes it for her hip, yet it is now going into an osteo necrosis... Peggy, thank you for rallying over and over!! Tina, Yipee for the last treatment and good luck with your CT. You must be so relieved!!! Susan, I know how you feel, I started to read the beginning of our chemo thread and it is weird to see us all write these lines. Hope you do well in L.A.!!! Leanne, you've been to hell and back. You are your best advocate and if that means going until you know for sure, then so be it. Keep fighting for more and better scans. As for the anger, the only thing I can recommend other than switching meds is exercise to exhaustion. Excersise does boost serotonin. Take the time when the kids are in kindergarten. Sorry to hear your partner makes it a bit difficult. That must not be easy either and can cause big frustration. But that is not your fault. He did seem a bit selfish at times and needs to learn to deal with it better. He could be on the receiving end too some day (meaning cancer for him like testicular or prostate...like my DH....it's a \"blessing\" that he was first if I may say that without sounding mean...you know how I mean that?) I wish the best and hope there is some doc out there that knows more. Linny, hope all is well? Nicole, same for you? Lynell? I need to go for another colonoscopy and canceled the first one....I keep doing the austrich thingy....(stick the head in the sand and don't want to know, deal and see) out of panic.... I don't want to do Thanksgiving since the 2005 one was so horrible (my DH and DD were at the neighbors and I was at home after Taxol treatment, in pain and feeling lost and alone) that did me in for all Thanksgivings to come LOL I know it was not the holiday's fault but the chemo and yet...I don't want to hear the Thanksgiving word, ha!!! Hope you all will have a good holiday dispite my misgivings with that particular one :) God Bless",

We've done some rafting after my lumpectomy but before my mast. That feels sooo long ago..... Susan, keep on top of the infection, rather one time to many to the doc!! Tina, good to hear from you again. We got rain too, so much I wanted to move. It was like instant fall....luckily it is going to be summer again tomorrow lol.....I cherish the outdoors. Glad you got the lymphedema under control. Sandra, how is your Spanish? ;) My daughter is doing well, probably (hopefully) can go off crutches in about 2-3 weeks. She got a set of books for at home and an upper locker so she does not have to bent down. She's in advanced drama and not limping during a play means so much to her. She took it so she can become a even better writer (professionally after school, it's a dream of hers......) My mom is coming tomorrow...oh boyyyyy....lol....I am excited. I am having hip pain that concerns me a lot. Had it after a fall in January and it went down, now it is back....real back. Don't know what to do. Had a PET late January while in pain, nothing noted on the hip. I am having one sheduled for late Sept. because of the bone thingy...so I am fretting thinking mets.

My sister has been diagnosed with two inch colon/rectal cancer and is facing chemo and rads, then surgery. I would love to see a cancer free year but it doesn't seem to be in the future of my family. I hope this isn't going to be a trend. Please say a prayer for me for Friday. I don't want cancer again. God Bless",

Maxine, prayers out to you for NED results and ideas for finding what's wrong. Lynell, sorry about your troubles......a friend of mine had some spotting with Arimidex but it resolved, they could not find anything. I take Femara and so far so good (same side effects like everybody) I had a biopsy and it was a vascular clip that the PS found. I still have lumps on the left, it does rattle me every so often and fear takes over. PET scan done, waiting for results with onc mid month. My therapist wants to put me on Lexapro or Paxil, I don't want neither....I am just so sad about our sisters on this board fighting and think the other shoe drops anytime..... I meant to go for blood tests and TM's today and a black cat ran across the street (right to left)....guess what? I did NOT go, I'll go on Tuesday. We are having a golden fall here in Colorado, still nice out, low humidity, I love the weather. Did I tell you that I saw a bear mom with cub in the woods, about 10 -12 yards away from me? That was \"refreshing\"  since I was there alone..... Well, here is to an anxious week until results. Might keep myself bussy with Halloween decorating. God Bless",

Can they give a dog treatment or would they only let her go? I'm sure  it would not be easy....but lets hope for the best. Our pets are family, we need them. Thanks for asking about my family. Mom finished her rads finally and is on Tamoxifen, basically a year after being diagnosed, she seems okay. My sister was dxed with colon cancerand is awaiting surgery, did neo adjuvant chemo and rads and is very sore and raw and scared. My daughter's MRI wasn't great, more deterioration, she has the beginning of avascular necrosis, the bone is dying, which is a double whammy since it seems to speed the need for hip replacement. There is a partial replacement called the birmingham hip resurfacing but it has a short pin only in the femur neck. Her femur neck is actually thinning.....so this might not work. This type replacement is good for young and active people if they have the bones to support it. They want to put her on the osteoporsosis drug 'Boniva' for now and another MRI in three months...We are praying and hoping, it's just not fair. It's been a ride and we are wondering who is \"next\"..... God Bless",

Maxine, haven't seen you post in a while, I am thinking about you. How are the issues with your hand? Anything new from the doc's? My daughter (15) just started on Boniva, to strengthen her hip. Got side effects the next day...fever and bone pain....I hate the fact that she is suppose to take it. Just hope it helps when it comes to replacing that joint.

My estrogen had gone up and I got checked out after begging and hoops....waiting for a good path as we speak....  Hugs to all, lets keep praying for all our friends in need, especially our September soul sisters!!!...good bloodwork for Nicole!!",

Saying prayers for you for all clear on your onc visit!! Susan, hope you are 'hanging tough'! Thinking about you and praying as well, how are things going? Hope everyone is doing well!!

Glad you had a good time on the Cape!! ;) Nothing like some sand, sun and water, birds and all.... Peggy, how are you doing? How did the onc visit go?? Hope all is well! I am heading to the endocrinologist next week to check on my Estrogen, still thinking it was a false 'high' lab error...will retake before I go! Maybe I was implanted ovaries by accident instead of taking the cyst/ovarian remnant out last year...that would be funny....not...just kidding, I don't even think anything like that is possible but the gyn's office sent me a letter that they haven't seen me since 07 lol I start to dislike doctors and question everything above and beyond.... Hope all our MIA's are okay....please check in ladies, would love to hear from you!",

In this study, they give you a low carb shake, probably high in Protein. I would want to make sure it is not soy protein if one has breast cancer. I have an old e-mail from Roza, where she told me that she ate low or no carb and she was NED from bone mets until the blood disease took her from us. I do think there might be a benefit of low carb.

My onc visit is Monday (just TM's but the lurking fear with lung nodule and bone spot - all probably nothing as of last PET) is with me. My daughter had her surgery and is sort of pain free but with lots of restrictions and no weight bearing yet. She will have to be very careful for at least half a year.

Sandra, so glad you are enjoying your new look. My mom is visiting next week for 3 weeks. Haven't seen her since her bc dx and she hasn't seen my recon either. She hasn't had any, so both of us will admire the other the first time (not that there is admiring of my uneven recon but she never could imagine doing it since I was in such pain during expansion). Susan, Happy Anniversary to you and your hubby, wow, 26 yrs!!! Go Susan!!!! I will be thinking about you on Thursday...good thoughts, vibes and prayers are coming. I am afraid to touch my recon because of little lumps from the surgery I guess. I freak out every time. Still check 'em with a mag light in a dark room every so often. 'Rubytuesday' has suggested that and it seems funny but it makes me feel better lol. I so hope your family is coming around and no more heart aches. Aside from my moms visit we'll be returning to 'normal' schedules with high school starting on Monday....one month or less on crutches for my baby and then hope for the best that she doesn't fall or stumble for any reason. I seem to get more clingy instead of letting go (at least in my heart, I do not want to be a hen and stop her from growing up). Best wishes girls!!!",

Mine was in July for DCIS and in coming Sept for invasive (mastectomy date). I certainly am happy if all is okay but I am dreading the PET in September....grrrr.....

How are you dealing with the stress...I do sense sadness in your report, it is not just because we are all 'elsewhere'??? You gave a nice recap there, it does seem like yesterday. I smell things lately and I think it is fear bringing back memories....not the good ones.... I am just avoiding reminders....loving to read about each of you, just not happy to add my misery lol.... My daughter is doing very well considering, still a little limp but has to go on Fosamax, she walks again but won't play any sports, jump or run. Mom had high blood pressure and had to leave early. She is in treatment. I have a PET on the 24th but won't find out until October and I had a DEXA as well, no results yet. Literally all bones hurt because I have scanxiety.....we all know the feeling..... Just went past 3 years with mastectomy. My life is not yet at \"move on\" intersection.....it seems to take turns and turns and turns....... I love to hear how everybody is doing......so hopefully by bumping up, we will write.

Tina, how are you doing? Riding sounds fun, I did a bit when I was a teen but not enough to call me a 'rider'. Maxine, happy belated birthday, hope you are doing okay Liezel, you are brave to try for a little girl. I would be way to scared to tell you the truth. I tought we are estrogen machines during pregnancy? Scary, nevertheless I wish you the best trying (having sex early before ovulation gets you a chance for a girl because the girl sperm lives longer I think lol) Susan, so sorry to hear about your troubles. I had high red blood count and bone marrow light up on MRI in November due to antidepressants, did lower my oxygen and the body responded, sort of like deep sleep, low breathing and heart beat..... I hope there is an easy explanation for you. How did they explain the bone scan? Just arthritis? Did you get a brain MRI too? Congrats to your DD for getting the job, yayyy.....it must be so exciting for her!! I had a CT for lower abd. pain in April. They found a lesion on the liver, 5 milimeters. I thought it is an old cyst but that was on the other lobe back then and is gone. Nobody is concerned yet but me....as usual lol....I was hoping for a MRI but get another CT this months as well as all the blood, TM's etc. I was hoping for a calm, quiet summer.....no worries, nobody in the family on crutches or otherwise....cancer sucks, anxiety sucks... Bilirubin is up a tad but other liver panel is peachy (Femara package says if bili is up it is no good..... TM's are good. So just hanging, waiting, and hoping. Did well with my weight but took DD to Disney and the beaches, gained 5, I am soooo mad at myself. DD is walking fine, a year out from hip replacement but no more sports, going to be a senior in HS, where does the time go? Hope everybody else is doing well here.",

In Feb. that nodule appeared on the lower lobe vs. all the other PET's said on upper lobe (could be a matter of interpretation). This last PET (results today) said again stable, on upper lobe....get this...it is 4 mm. How likely is it that something benign shrinks??? The onc says it is not a met....however why is it shrinking? Radiologist says \"appears unchanged\" it measures 4mm...well a shrinkage of 2 mm means 33% less. I know it is so little. I've been on Femara for almost 19 months now, on last PET before in Feb. I was on Femara for 11 month. My tumor markers are normal BUT they are up from 17 for several visits now to 20 I should be happy but I am so afraid something is written of as \"probably\" okay.....shrinkage is good...why are the TM's up. I can't shake that feeling, probably because my initial mammogram was overlooked which resulted in a delayed dx..... I graduated to 4 months visits to see him in Feb, but he put in for another PET, saying I want to know....do I??? Is he concerned??? Your thoughts are much appreciated.

Worth investigating.... -------------------------  Device Zeroes In On Small Breast Tumors http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080128165711.htm ScienceDaily (Jan. 31, 2008) - A new medical imager for detecting and guiding the biopsy of suspicious breast cancer lesions is capable of spotting tumors that are half the size of the smallest ones detected by standard imaging systems, according to a new study. The results of initial testing of the PEM/PET system, designed and constructed by scientists at the Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, West Virginia University School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine will be published in the journal Physics in Medicine and Biology on Feb. 7. \"This is the most-important and most-difficult imager we've developed so far,\" Stan Majewski, Jefferson Lab Radiation Detector and Medical Imaging Group leader said. \"It is another example of nuclear physics detector technology that we have put a lot of time and effort into adapting for the common good.\" Testing of the new imager was led by Ray Raylman, a professor of radiology and vice chair of Radiology Research at WVU and lead author on the study. Raylman's team imaged various radioactive sources to test the resolution of the system. \"We had good performance characteristics, with image resolution below two millimeters. In regular PET, the image resolution is over five millimeters, so we're quite a bit better than that,\" Raylman said. In addition, the initial tests revealed that the PEM/PET system can complete an image and biopsy in about the same amount of time as a traditional biopsy. \"The ability of the device to do biopsy is probably one of its most unique characteristics. There are other breast imagers, but none that are built specifically to do biopsy as well as imaging,\" Raylman said. The system features components designed for imaging the unique contours of the breast. Known as positron emission mammography (PEM), this imaging capability enables users to attain high-resolution, three-dimensional PET images of the breast. The PEM/PET system images the breast with a movable array of two pairs of two flat detection heads. If a suspected lesion is found, a single pair of heads is then used to guide a needle biopsy of the lesion; the biopsy is performed with a person-controlled robot arm. Raylman is the author of the concept and has a patent on this idea. The system is especially useful in imaging tumors in women who have indeterminate mammograms because of dense or fibroglandular breasts. The Jefferson Lab Radiation Detector and Medical Imaging Group, with a group member now affiliated with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, developed the detector heads with the on-board electronics, the data acquisition readout and the image reconstruction software. The imaging device's gantry and the motion-control software was developed by West Virginia University researchers. The next steps for the team include minor improvements in the detector systems and image reconstruction software and the addition of components for taking x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. Initial clinical trials are planned after completion of system testing. Adapted from materials provided by DOE/Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.

You are right, many wonderful ladies and posts on this board and we will get you through this. This is the place to be if you in fact have cancer. I assume you will have a biopsy soon, maybe the day you see the surgeon. Depending on the size, if this cancer is 5 cm, I assume they will give you chemo up front to shrink the tumor. They will want to know if nodes are involved too, so you are likely to get a sampling of your underarm nodes, called a Sentinel Node Biopsy.  Many good drugs out there that keep you comfortable, not everybody gets side effects all the time or the same way. The shock you felt when your mom was diagnosed is probably still with you, since you were a teen at the time. But without medication after the mastectomy, which, depending on the tumor and receptors, she lived for 25 years. I would say this is a positive among the negative. Lots of good drugs out there now for follow up therapy. Your kids might be stronger than you think, it is good to talk, they will give you support in return. I remember my then 13 yr old saying when she learned of my upcoming mastectomy \"mom, thank God it is \"just\" a breast. Would be worse if it was your foot (I like hiking and running in the woods :)  ) BTW, after my dx my mom felt nodules in her breast and waited a year and a half....she was diagnosed too...later than she should. She is fine now, finished chemo, surgery, rads and takes Tamoxifen. I will be thinking about you on Friday God Bless You'll see, as soon as you have a battle plan, you feel stronger. Post often, vent your feelings. This board kept me sane when I was diagnosed.",

I was hoping the nause goes away, Taxol being the chemo tolerable without anti nausea meds (didn't get EMEND anymore) but I had to actually throw up before my first Taxol. I found that so weird and the nurses told me I am anxious about Taxol. I wasn't. I was happy that A/C was over. So I asked to reduce steroids...I was sure that must be it and it was. Of course I wondered if I could have done without steroids in the actual drip with A/C.....maybe it would have saved me some of it. I think they use steroids in anesthesia to prevent allergic reactions. I always get nauseaus from anesthesia too, but not overseas, they don't use it...so there....I guess one could say I don't tolerate steroids.... I hope Taxol will be a breeze for you. Best wishes",
