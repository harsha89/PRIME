I thought since I didn't have to have the adria that my hair wouldn't fall out, boy was I wrong.  Needless to say, i have to go wig shopping tomorrow.  I've cried since wednesday, but you know what, the cliches are true, \"it's only hair, and YES, it will grow back.\"  I guess the chemo poison doesn't know the good from the bad, oh well.",
