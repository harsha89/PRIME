I have no doubt that something is not right but it could very much be increased by the stress and fears you have for what your mother is going through so relax and try to remember that an extra day or week with not change anything that is happening now....that is a fact so there is no point getting yourself into a state...try hard to think positive and just take some time out for you at this time. There was no history of Breast Cancer or any type of Cancer in my entire family until my diagnosis and I am a grandchild of 28 (my mum is from a family of 10 kids) ,  my dads side even more!.  There is no explanation for his disease,  all I can reiterate to you is that YOU know your body, women have a sixth sense of how it feels,  listen to yourself and demand to get some answers. I hope this email helps. Take care and a huge hig from me x",

Good lucjk,  thoughts are with you all the way.",
