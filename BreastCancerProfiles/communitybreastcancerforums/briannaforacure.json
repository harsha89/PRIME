    "Content": "briannaforacure wrote: Hi there everyone. I came to this website on reccomendation by my dad. On September 23rd, my stepmom was diagnosed with breast cancer (unsure of what stage - 10 cm tumor, no nodes), two months after my grandpa died of cancer and a day after my dad's best friend died. Recently, I was diagnosed with panic, my uncle was diagnosed with extremely aggressive cancer, my stepdad lost his job, and my stepdad's best friend's dad died (whom we were close with). It's been a really rough end of the year, but I'm making it through. I'm in Michigan and my stepmom is in California. I have 3 siblings, one here in MI, one out in CA, and one who is full blood. I just wanna ask for any coping techniques or anyone to talk to going through the same thing, something similar, or just any tips. I'd love to have answers and such. Thanks :) Log in to post a reply",
