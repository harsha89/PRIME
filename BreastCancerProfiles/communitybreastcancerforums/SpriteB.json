Of course Dr Google has to mention a pituitary gland tumor but menopause , kidney issues, heart issues are all brought up. My kidney blood tests and mugas have all been fine through treatment. Maybe my body just got used to going so much at night? Maybe chemo affected something? Im 38 and haven't had my period since April so maybe chemo put me in menopause? I'm going to start keeping a log of what I drink and what times I wake to go and speak to my MO but I was wondering if anyone else noticed the same thing since chemo?",

I have also seen a lot of ladies gargle with salt and baking Soda so I added 1 tsp baking said to the water too. Also, I had genetic testing too as I'm adopted and have no family history. They tested Me for 26 different genes and they all came back negative. That was good news! I woke up feeling okay today. I started getting an allergy cold the day before chemo and I'm definitely feeling that a little bit. The heartburn seems to have stopped for now.

I had soup when I got home and then went for a walk which felt great. Heartburn for a little bad which the nurse said may happen so I took a zantac.

Then Mr Snarky comes in and in all his snarkiness says in an exasperated, annoyed voice \"So, what, we're gonna just do the measurements everyday??\" I started to explain to Snarky that I tried my best to keep it on and I think the techs could sense my anxiety about it and jumped in and again said its not a big deal, it just may take a couple minutes longer for my treatments.

Usually they stick a tegaderm over the marks but my skin is sensitive to the adhesive so that's out. The lines disappeared by Saturday night so they had to redo the x-Rays today and put new lines on. One tech was a little snarky and commented that I must have \"scrubbed\" the area. I assured them I did not and I barely got my breast wet while showering. They used a paint pen and assured me that the mark would not come off. This was at 10am. Well, here it is 7:30pm and the marks are already gone. ",

I get that the marks have to be exact and I appreciate them being overly cautious but I think I can trace 2 straight lines. They are going to have to let me do it or we are going to have to do the X-rays everyday. I can't believe the tech put adhesive on you!! Wow, the nerve!!!",

Slather it on, put a shirt on and let it sit. Hope that helps!! Today is my 16 of 33 rads. So far I have some soreness and slight skin color change and some fatigue. I never asked how much radiation I was getting everytime and they have never mentioned boosts to me but all of you seem to have boosts of some kind so I'm going to ask the ro about it today. ",

I want one for Rads and herceptin. It is amazing how different Ro's and Mo's perception of side effects can be. My RO always asks about appetite and says that reduced appetite is a side effect.  And my MO says herceptin doesn't cause blurry vision but here I am a week later and like clockwork I have the blurry vision that will last for a few days and then resolve.  I asked RO about boosts today and I am having them. I have 26 whole Breast and then 8 boosts. So I guess I have a total of 34 treatments. ",

My partner and I closed on our house at the beginning of October so in addition to being smack in the middle of rads, I've also been moving. But we are so excited and I feel so fortunate. Tomorrow is my last day of 34 rads!! I had 26 whole breast and 8 boosts. My skin held up remarkably well except for some peeling under my breast and in my armpit. My armpit hurt very bad for about a week but silvadene has worked wonders. Prior to the silvadene I used aquaphor or miaderm atleast 3 times a day. My biggest issue is the fatigue. It really seemed to hit hard last week and like Tresjoli said, I feel like I'm walking through molasses. My body is just so tired and my brain is foggy and slow. My RO said to expect to feel this way for 2-3 weeks after rads.",

I met with a genetic counselor and had blood drawn as I'm only 37 with BC and no family history because I'm adopted. I need to decide between lumpectomy or mastectomy. I will undergo chemo because of the Her2+. I'm scared. But the BS seemed hopeful that I caught it early so I'm holding on to that hope.",
