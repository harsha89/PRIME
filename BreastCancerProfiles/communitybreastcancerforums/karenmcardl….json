I may check my insurance page and see if I can find another breast surgeon in the area that is available. Thank you both, I'm just very scared right now.  Inflammatory breast cancer keeps banging around in my head.  You couple that with intense bone pain for the last 5 months that they can't decide what is from and I'm going from bad to worse in my head.",

She will be taking the test.  If she has BR CA (new to this so if I get the terms incorrect...please understand) then my sisters and I will go for the counseling and test and all have decided if we have the gene we will have mastectomies as well. I wish you much good luck, and I'll peek in to see how you are doing.",
