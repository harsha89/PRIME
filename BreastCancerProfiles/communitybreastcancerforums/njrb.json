      "Content": "njrb wrote: Hello! I'll just get straight to the point: When I was 17 I had a small lump in my right breast, directly behind my nipple. At first it was small and painless - pea-sized - but I went to the doctors and had an ultra-sound and he told me, I think, (in a terrible english accent) that it was just breast tissue and nothing to worry about. He also said that sometimes swelling behind the nipple can be common amongst lads going through puberty. Reassured,  I left and tried to ignore it. I'm now nearly 22. Over the past few years the lump has remained. It has changed shape once or twice. First it got bigger, then smaller and then bigger again. Instead of being a pea-like lump it is now quite flat and large - say 2cm in diameter. It has never really been painful - only quite tender - but this comes and goes. The thing is - I've left puberty now and it's still there 5 years later, albeit bigger. As far as I can tell, there are no lumps in my armpits.  Should I get it checked out again, or am I just being paranoid? My other breast is fine and as far as I know my family doesn't have a history of breast cancer - although my father was adopted so I am uncertain of that side of the family. Is this something I'm just going to have to live with?  Maybe I just have a small female-like boob? :/ It's not like a boob though, I'm not obese or unhealthy - quite the opposite.
