I did have another hot spot on my chest wall at the same time that the Navilbene worked on and got rid of.  No other chemo drugs were offered, I went right to radiation.  Do you know of other chemo drug names that perhaps I could ask my Dr about?  Thank you for your time... ",

My last tumor marker, last week, showed a decline to 37.5 from 44.5, which is a borderline normal so I guess the radiation is working, but now that is done.  I go for an MRI in 4 weeks to see whats left and then decide from there what to do next.  I am definitely going to ask my Dr about another chemo to try before surgery. Although she says once its removed I'll be in remission again so thats very tempting, if it works out that way.  I was on herceptin for a year when I had my second recurrence so they're not sure if that kept me from recurring sooner or didn't help to prevent a recurrence.  I went off the herceptin then to give my heart a rest because I was starting the chemo. Mimi - keep your chin up, I know exactly how you feel, every day is an emotional challenge and I never know what to expect.  One day I feel strong and another day I feel at a loss for control. Talk to your Dr. about your options and get straight answers.  Make a list of questions and write down what they tell you or bring a friend to listen, I never remember specifics. Have you gone for a second opinion?  This could give you more information you need. You are not alone here, write back and let me know how you are doing",

Had chemo, didn't work, am almost finished radiation, only shrunk 25%.  Now my Dr wants to operate to remove, which she originally told me would only spread it around and didn't recommend at that time. I am very discouraged and don't know what to do.  I would hate to have my neck cut open if it isn't going to work anyway, but since I have 2 kids want to do what I should.  Has anybody been thru this and can offer their experience ?  I really need some insight, I just want to get a grasp on how much further I'm supposed to go...Thanks...
