Upper outer quadrant - ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate nuclear grade with apocrine features, involving dednosis, with focal microcalcifications.  No definite stromal invasion identified.  Fibrocystic change. Adenosis. Some of this is self explanatory.  The other is mumbo-jumbo.  I am sure by the end of this I will be an expert on the lingo! I would appreciate any help with this as I await the surgeons's consultation.  Thanks! ",
