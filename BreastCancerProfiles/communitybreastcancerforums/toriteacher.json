I was called back a few years ago and it was diagnosed as a shadow back then, from the mammogram, and how my breast was positioned. Everything was okay! My mom, and two aunts, have had breast cancer. So, by 3:00, yesterday, I get a call back to come back. They said the radiologist made a note that it was because my breasts were dense and they wanted to do an ultrasound. I am scared to death that they found something. Is it unusual to get a call back on your first 3D mammogram? I have never been notified the same day? I can hardly eat and wait until Monday. They said they didn't think they would need a diagnostic mammogram after the ultrasound, but they may need to do that. Any insight? Thank you for helping me ease my worries and inform me on all this!
