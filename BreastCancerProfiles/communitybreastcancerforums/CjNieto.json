My insurance apparently doesn't cover cranial prosthetics so this will be out of my own pocket (Ouch!) Anyone in central Florida know of a good, fairly inexpensive, place to get a good wig? If Not, maybe a good website? Also looking for tips from you girls on other accessories to get to make the whole ordeal more comfortable...as i said, it's Florida (so damn hot!). I know ideally the coolest would be to go bare or with a do-rag, but i just won't feel right without hair. Thanks. Dx 4/26/2012, IDC, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
