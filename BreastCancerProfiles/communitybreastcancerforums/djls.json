I'm praying you'll have peace, regardless of what the report says.  I'm also praying that you will heal quickly and without complications.

I'll keep putting on the antibiotic ointment until the blisters go away.  If I see any sign of infection, I'll call my onc. right away. I do have antibiotics here on hand just in case.

I totally understand the le being much harder to deal with than bc.  I'm currently seeing a counselor to help  me with the le.  After months of being depressed over it, I decided I really needed some help.  Sentinel node biopsy reduces the risk of lymphedema, but it does not eliminate that risk.  I had 2 stinkin' nodes removed and radiation and I have le.  It really irks me when doctors tell women they won't get lympedema because they are only removing 1 or 2 nodes.  Radiation also increases your risk for le because it damages the healthy lymph vessels and nodes.  My le started halfway through radiation and I had 3 oncologists that said I didn't have le and 1 that said I did.  One of the things I noticed first was that my sleeve became tighter on my le side....that was my upper arm swelling. Later, I developed pitting edema. I pressed the tissue just above my elbow for 10 seconds and when I released the pressure, the indentation definitely stayed there and it didn't do that on my good arm. That's when I went to my oncologist and told him I had le (I didn't ask) and he agreed.  It used to be that a 2 cm difference between the two arms was clinically significant (meaning you have le).  They now know that there can be subtle changes in the le arm before it gets to the point where it's 2 cm larger than the healthy arm.  There are \"texture\" (for lack of a better word) differences....the tissue feels spongier and is stiffer to the touch.  I use the 2 cm difference for convenience when I measure my arms. You didn't mention if the arm you're concerned about is your dominant side.  Your dominate side will naturally be bigger than the other side.  You probably didn't notice it before you started looking carefully at your arm (if it's your dominant arm).  I guess that's one of the reasons they use the 2 cm mark. I would pick at least 3 spots on your arm to measure and track (pick a freckle or something so that you have a point of reference!):  Your upper arm, another spot about 1 1/2 inch above your elbow and another spot on your forearm.   Le may cause swelling in one area, but not the others.  It's really weird. For instance, my thumb swells, but the rest of my hand doesn't.  If the sleeve is causing a rash, I wouldn't wear the sleeve.  I would consider trying a different detergent to wash your sleeve and make sure it's rinsed really well.  If that doesn't help, then don't wear it.  A rash is inflammation and inflammation can get le going.  You could also try other brands of sleeves and gauntlets/gloves....kind of expensive and it would be trial and error for you.  You could do manual lymph drainage instead of wearing the sleeve.  I would do it before and after you have a flight.  You can also do it every day.  I actually am doing it 2-3 times a day:  once in the morning to get things moving, one in the middle of the day to keep things moving and once before I go to bed to clear stuff that's been accumulating during the day.  The Northwest Lymphedema Center (www.nwlymphedemacenter.org)  has videos on their website that teach mld.  There are also youtube videos....make sure it's mld and not massage. The key is being gentle....the lymph nodes and vessels are under the skin, so it doesn't take much to move the fluid.  I use just enough pressure to gently stretch the skin a little bit. Hope this helps! djls ",

Adhesions and scar tissue also formed where the impact occurred and are clearly visible.  The lump hasn't changed since it occurred.  I finally decided to get it looked at and I had my first mammogram and ultrasound.  The radiologist has classified it as Bi-Rads 5 \"ill-defined heterogeneous solid mass with acoustical shadowing that is highly suspisious for breast carcinoma\" with a second \"slightly irregular hypoechoic mass\" also \"suspicious for breast carcinoma, likely a satellite lesion\" on the ultrasound.  The mammogram says it is an \"ill-defined masslike lesion in the central outer aspect of the right breast with probable spiculation of the architecture suspicious for a primary breast carcinoma.\"   O.k.  I have clear scar tissue (the mammogram lady asked me if I had surgery twice) from the impact and the lump appeared within hours of the impact and just never went away. I'm sure it was a large hematoma.  If there is visible scar tissue externally, could internal scar tissue look that suspicious?    It just doesn't make sense that it isn't related to the impact since the lump appeared hours afterwards and has not grown or changed. ...and yet I find myself second guessing myself and I'm starting to freak out.  I'm getting a breast MRI with contrast on Friday and I have an appointment with a breast surgeon/cancer specialist next Wednesday.  The radiologist wants me to get a biopsy right away.  The surgeon wants to see me and the films first, but not the reports.   Have I mentioned I'm starting to freak out?  I feel like an idiot freaking out over a radiologist report.  I had a radiologist once diagnose me with lymphoma...it turned out that the vein that goes back to my heart is on the wrong side of my liver.  Thanks for listening.
