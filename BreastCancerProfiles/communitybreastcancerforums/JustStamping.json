So after getting beat up by doctors, family and friends, I finally started taking the Femara.  The joint pain, constipation, hot flashes and fatigue I can handle.  It's these damn chest pains that are not manageable. I get sharp stabbing pain in my upper left chest area.  The pain is not regular but is becoming more frequent.  The pain doesn't last long, but it does strike me with such venegance sometimes that it is agonizing.  I take Advil to control the pain but that too is taking it's toll on my stomach! I've talked to my Onc about this but he insists that chest pain is not a side effect of Femara even though I found it on the Femara web site as well as the side effect pamphlet that comes with my monthly prescription. Does anybody else endure chest pain with Femara?  What kind of pain?  Is the pain localized to one area or does it move?  What do others do for this pain?  Kristin Albrecht Dx 9/12/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, mets, ER+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

So, what is \"Toxic Granulation\" ???  Further, what are \"Dohle\" bodies ??? I'd love to know what others know about these conditions. Thanks in advance!
