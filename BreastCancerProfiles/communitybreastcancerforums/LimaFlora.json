Yes I searched the National Cancer Institute website but I cannot find statistics about women who had a Paget without underlying DCIS and recurrence in the breast or elsewhere actually. I am thinking of calling them directly. This is quite important to me because I do not want to damage my breast now with radio therapy in case I do develop another cancer in the breast later and absolutely need to do radiotherapy. I also realize I did not post my request in the right thread ! I will re-write in one of the active topics about Paget.  ",

I was operated on 2 July, I had the nipple and whole areola zone removed (2.5 in depth and x 10 cm large) as well as two sentinel nodes. The Paget was confirmed but without DCIS and the nodes are negative. Mamograph, scan and MRI were negative. The oncologist and surgeon advise radio therapy of the whole left breast. A Paget without underlying tumor is apparently 5 % of the diagnosed Pagets. I am desperately looking for statistics on the web about the recurrence of such a strange cancer. Could anyone help with this ? I am wondering how a recurrence of cancer will be diagnosed later since I do not have the areola anymore and no more sentinels nodes as a test either. I also wish there were statistics about the occurrences of having the same cancer in my right breast. Thank you so much for your help with this",
