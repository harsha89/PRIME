    "Content": "SnoodleBug wrote: So about a month ago I got a sharp pain in my nipple that felt like it was being crushed and burnt at the same time. It lasted about a day and a half. I also started getting pains in my arm pit and shoulder. The nipple pain went away but the other pains stayed and hasn't gone away. Plus I am getting everyday pains in my breast. So I've been getting these pains for about a month. Not sure what it could be. So my question is if anybody has had this. And also what symptoms yall had or what made yall think yall might have breast cancer. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
