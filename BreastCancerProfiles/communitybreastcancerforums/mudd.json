I went that route for the same reason - multiple biopsies in the past and just not wanting to deal with that in the future. Plus I knew now I feel well enough to have gone through the surgery. Who knows how I'll feel 5 or 6 years from now if anything had recurred to undergo surgery like that when I'm in my 70s. I had a PS do the closing and he was the one that put in the JP drains also. One week out and I feel pretty good, better than expected, but still a lot of limitations and intermittent pain on the left side. I didn't have them leave any extra skin because I was certain that I never want reconstruction. The only issue I have is that you are dealing with two separate doctors and each seems to just be responsible for their part of the procedure. I hope things go well for you. I'm still in shock when I look at my body and realize I am now built like an average 2 year old - flat chest and little poofy tummy!!",

I am also in my 60s and waiting for the Oncotype and was told there was a delay in my insurance approving the test so now I have to wait 2 more weeks for the results. I have a similar diagnosis and the waiting is making me crazy since I feel so up in the air about my diagnosis.",

I don't understand why since the tumor is out of my body and didn't spread what is this chemo going to kill except healthy cells? He said even people that have had spread to the lymph nodes can have a less aggressive tumor and not need chemo. He also mentioned CMF but suggested T/C for me. Like I said before I am 65, have a long life to look forward to, but don't understand why I need this. Log in to post a reply",

The fever usually starts about three or four days after like clockwork in the mid to late afternoon and I feel really ill that's why I take it in the first place. My dr. said why are you taking your temperature and I told him that 99 plus shouldn't make me feel so feverish. And then I agonize and take it a million times to see if goes up. It once got up to 100.4 as well but the oncall dr. said it has to stay at that for an hour and then call back but within 20 minutes it started creeping back down to 99.5. It ususally goes away about five days before the next treatment. ( i have chemo every three weeks) and like I said, no one can give me a reasonable answer. I even bought a second thermometer to make sure mine wasn't broken! I had NO IDEA it could last after treatment ends, if I'm understanding you correctly. Yikes... Hope all goes well for you",
