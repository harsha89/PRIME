I'm worrying a little as I felt pain underneath my breast when the consultant pressed there but the lady that did the ultrasound didn't even scan that area, she just focussed on the side/armpit that the consultant had circled.  Though maybe that would have showed on the mammogram I had if there was any issue there, maybe I will ask about this when I go for my results on Monday. The situation is kind of ironic, my breasts have always been an issue, I have worried since puberty that they are small and unattractive, I went through an almost healing period about a month ago where I finally allowed my boyfriend to see me fully naked on top so that we could enjoy falling to sleep together with no clothing separating us. Now I have addressed that there seems to be another breast related unease.  Right now I wonder why I let the lack of confidence with them take up so much of my time!",

      "Content": "claire-2014 wrote: Hi everyone, I'm not sure why I'm posting here as deep down I know that only the results that I am waiting on can answer my questions and worries, however I think it helps to write things down and as I'm having such a hard time coping with this waiting period it's the only thing I can do at the moment. Around Christmas I noticed that when I was lying in bed propped up on my elbow talking to my boyfriend there was a pain in the side of my breast towards the armpit.  I avoided feeling the area so I don't know if there was a lump or anything as I was worried and decided that it could be a pulled muscle or something from working out.  At the end of March I spoke to my boyfriend about it and he felt the side of my breast and said he could feel a small lump, and that I should go to the doctors to get it checked.  I'm only 29 years old.  I said there was no need as I felt that I would be wasting the doctors time and felt guilty about having time off work for something that was likely to be trivial.  However because he was so insistant that I should go - unusual for him as he is so calm and laid back - I spoke to my mum about it when I got home from work that night and she insisted that I go to the doctors as my dad had lymphoma when I was younger. When I saw the doctor he said he could feel something, I felt pain when he pressed on the area at the side of my breast, he said that he didn't think it was anything bad but that he would refer me to the breast clinic to be sure. My appointment came through for 2 weeks later and I attended the clinic last Wednesday, this was where my anxieties have begun.  I went to see the consultant initially, he felt my left and right breast and my armpits, I could feel pain in my left breast and armpit when he checked these however the pain did seem to be in a different place in the underneath of my breast, I had noticed this new pain a few days earlier when I was raising my arms doing shoulder press at the gym.  He told me that my glands in my armpit were up and that I should shave my armpits less but he would send me for an ultrasound to check the area. Whilst the nurse walked me to the waiting room for the ultrasound she told me that when the ultrasound results came back clear I would not have to wait to see the consultant again and that I could go straight home to save time, so I fully expected to be going home very shortly. Whilst the ultrasound was being done the lady doing the ultrasound said that she could see that my lymph nodes were enlarged and had something around them (fluid, or a case - I can't remember now) she also said that the tissue in the side of my breast looked different and that I should go for a mammogram. I waited for the mammogram results and she said that there looked to be a thickened area of breast tissue extending from the armpit, she said that this is normal in some people but because I have reported the pain which is a new symptom for me she would need to do a biopsy.  I had a needle biopsy done on the gland in my armpit and a punch biopsy three times in my left breast (same place). I have to wait 12 days for the result, I have managed 5 days so far but I honestly don't know how I'm going to cope, my boyfriend and I went away for the weekend and I feel terrible as I ruined much of the weekend crying, it just feels like there is a black cloud and I can't enjoy or feel happy about anything.  Everything I think about is worrying about the results, wondering what I'll do if it is the worst.  I feel like my sparkle and joy has been sapped out of me. I researched the punch biopsy that they did and found that this is a test for IBC, now I'm extremely concerned as the pain, enlarged lymph nodes and area of thicker tissue in my breast seem to point towards this. Could this be anything else? Something benign?  I can't seem to find anything else that it could be, I know that the pain is not right or normal for me, it hurts all the time regardless of menstrual cycle.  I know that if it's not IBC then there is something that needs sorting as this is not right. I wish people around me understood, I'm fed up of everyone saying \"you're young, it won't be anything to worry about, you'll be fine.\"  I don't want to be unecessarily negative but I am trying to be realistic, there is a chance it could be bad and I can't not acknowledge this. It's the waiting that feels like the hardest part. Thanks for anyone that made it this far, thank you for reading, just needed to get this off my chest.

I fainted in the hospital when they told me and since then I have felt almost numb like it's not happening to me. I think it must be IBC as punch test and lymph test came back as cancer. I have blood tests today to check my liver function then tomorrow they will tell me when all my whole body tests are. I'm not looking forward to telling people at work shortly but will be good to get letting people know out of the way and can then move on to the next part of the journey.",

My waiting will soon be up, my boss sent me to the works nurse this morning to talk to her as he was worried about how I was coping and I'm really glad he did, I spoke to her about everything, which although it didn't help to change the worry or fear, she did tell me that I should call up the hospital, explain  and see if they can fit me in sooner to find out.  She said that often they have the results but can't fit people in to see the consultants so it's worth calling to see if they have cancellations. The good news is that the hospital said that although they don't have any appointments until Monday when my appointment is they would ask the consultant if he could see me sooner.  The consultant said that they will be discussing the results today in their meeting (apparently they discuss all biopsy results together in a meeting) and he will fit me in at the end of the day! I began to start then worrying that it was bad news but decided that I'm sure he doesn't even know the results himself yet by the sounds of it. I am so thankful that I am able to be fitted in today.  Though even if I'm told the biopsy is negative I know that I am in unusual pain in this breast and have been for months, should I push for futher tests? I really feel that I cannot settle until I know what the cause of this is, I know it's not normal.",

I have a number of questions that have been concerning me and just wondered if anyone could help. Is it acceptable to wait 4 weeks before being able to discuss my cancer and treatment?  I feel that this is too long to go, not knowing anything other than the fact that I have cancer - it's been emotional torture as I'm sure everyone on here can relate to. What can I expect to happen next?  I've had my scans, biopsy today then results next week - what comes next?  How long will I have to wait for treatment?  How long can treatment take? I feel that if I can get an idea of how long I will have to wait then I may be able to mentally prepare myself as at the moment each time I'm told about another test or wait it feels like a huge kick in the stomach and puts me back down for a few days.

I have been pushing hard for them to at least give me results of initial biopsy and MRI, CT and bone scans as I'm terrified about the cancer having spread etc.  They did say that I'd have to wait until next week when the second biopsy results are back but after a lot of pushing they will see me this week and discuss initial findings.  I mentioned to the radiologist yesterday that I want a MX and was frustrated with waiting so long and she advised that I tell the consultant this as this may help to speed things up a bit. I have been reading about multicentric cancer since yesterday and really think that I need to push for an aggressive treatment for this - can't help but feel that medical people I have dealt with so far are in no rush!
