    "Content": "Annaberry33 wrote: I could use some support right now. I am recently diagnosed with IDC and ILC that has spread to at least 1 lymph node (ultrasound and biopsy). I got the results back today from my MRI and my MD explained that the lymph nodes in my opposite armpit were enlarged despite no evidence of cancer in THAT breast. I will have an ultrasound tomorrow. I know that if the cancer has spread that far this would be considered stage 4. I am terrified and hoping that I am jumping to worst case scenario. Has this happened to anyone?
