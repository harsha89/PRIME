I called UCDavis, they want a physician's referral and they don;t accept my insurance plan.  They told me that I could use MEdi-Cal but that is a 2 month wait in our county to get an appt for the application.  BUT, one of the nurses I spoke to said to get all my reports and show up at UCDavis ER and request an emergency room visit and then you can get onto an emergency same day Medical plan. As far as the original dr?  I called the insurance company and filed a complaint.  No one deserves to be treated this way and he needs to know that.  I also talked to my primary care, and they informed me that he had never even turned in a diagnosis form to them so they could put me on a different plan.  AHHHHHHH.  They wanted me to go back and get my records from him, but I told them that I would probably remove both his testicles if I saw him again, so they agreed to calland have them FAX everything over.... will move this to another thread.... since I have my results,,,sorta kinda!!!!! Oh BTW, I told my 2 girls yesterday (10 and 12).  My younger one said yeah right, good one mom.  And the older one who had aparently overheard me talking to my mom, said that it was true. THe 10yo said no way, people die from cancer and mom can't die.  AT which the 12yo turned to her and said people die from real cancer, breast cancer isn't real cancer dummy, its fake cancer....lol....",

My surgeon is supposed to be here in the late a.m., so I will check with him about the home situation, Last night, got some more sleep, but then there was this huge bus crash and since UC Davis is a trauma center, the helicopters started coming in at 8ish and kept it up for a couple of hours.  Poor people on the bus, most were Laotians and there was a language barrier with the ER staff. Other than that, my shrunken apples look better, a little more pain today, but that means healing is taking place, right? Roomie situation is better, no family members showed up at 7, so who hooo.....lol,,,instead, I had a nice chat with her.  Amazingly resilient for 84, but she says its because she's from Minnesota. Okay, here's the TMI, no bowel movements yet, I keep asking for extra fruit and fiber, but it gets me no where.....maybe I just need home toilet advantage, eh????? As far as the drains go, I have decided to be lazy, the maintantence will be dh's responsibility, lol. The nurses here are all fine with that.  The left side is barely draining, I was hoping they would pull that side, but the interns first said yes, then no.  Another ? for my surgeon, right? As far as aftercare, it is truly weird.  The floor nurses are all giving me the deer in head light look when I ask for a surgi-cami, they had no idea what I was talking about. Any suggestions?",

I then very nicely told her that while I appreciate all the $$$ to reserach, from a patient's point of view, it would be nice to have som of that $$ for our increased expenses, that bc is hard enough to deal with wthout the added bonus of financial stress.  Poor thing, she gulped and wished me a nice day and left for a break.... Anyway, here's the scoop.  Went to the onc today, she said that no more chemo, just rads...who hooo.  I see the rad dr. Monday for a consult and she said I could start ASAP.  I see the ob/gyn for the ovaries on Tuesday.  Dr.Onc gave me my script for Tamox, but I am not sure I want to start it until after rads, she left that up to me.  Howver, she thinks I should wait until spirng to yank the ovaries, but my surgeon said he would be fine with me gettingthem out as soon as I am done with rads.  I want to tke the pills for as short a time as possible. Other than that, I was told no air travel for 5 -6 months to lessen my risk of l'dema, whichsucks because my dh's ex (and my ds's bio-,mom) is going to Germany to see them and the new baby and was planning on giving me a free trip with her.  I am trying totalk her into maybe waiting until spring.....

Then, dh's oldest daughter is on the phone saying the same thing! Just whenit couldn;t get any weirder, my dd's softball coach, who is a chiro, calls and starts asking about me and when I talk to him about alternates, he jumps on board and recommends juicing and for me to come in and get adjustments that he says will open up my lungs and lt me breathe easier.  Okay, is that too weird?????? I have to see my onc on Thursday and tell her what I a plannig...gulp...don't think shewill like it since she is a big promoter of chemo ASAP.  But, shouldn't we be able to tell if our bodies can take more chemo?  I still feel tired and achy, so why would I put myself at risk for another hospital stay? Sigh, this is such a pain trying to not second guess every decision.  I am not sorry that I did chemo in May, I just think that it obviusly didn't work for me, so I need to try other choices and use chemo as a lat reort, does that make sense? Feeling better today, I am still using the oxygen, but am trying to walk around and move more, but a shower will wipe me out for a while.....so, that's my world.....lol Hope all of us will have a better day!! randie",

Don;t get all freaky here, but this was the worst ever, I could not catch my breath, I almost passed out several times and my oxygen dropped to 89 eevn on 4 liters.  They ended up getting an IV in me with no prob as we are hurtling down a windy mountain road...lol...you know i was out of it if I didn;t bitch...lol GOt to ER, still raggedly breathing.  They tried morphine (felt too freaky) and then ativan which calmed me down.  They tried to put a BiPap on me, but it felt so closed in I couldn't.  Turns out the resp therapist had turned down the o2 to what SHE thought I should be breathing and then refused to turn it up...fuckin cow.  So, I pulled the gotta throw up and they whipped it off pronto and put me back on the nasual cannula and mask.  So, that was my day.  lol, they also gave me some zofran, so that helped. Breathing okay, but a littel worried about whats to come, so need some + thought and prayers...plus its hard standing inthe room wtith Sue, need more air...lol randie",

Shse then tells me that I have managed to have the whole nursing staff there squirming in sympathy and they can only imagine the pain.  Scripts?  Vicodin (no thanks,  would like to not get loopy and constipated, just finished that phase), magic mouthwash (lol, trying to figure out how to swish and rinse there....) and tons of A&D before I pee.  Also, suggested all cotton panties (done deal) and wearing shorts to air the area out...my MIL came over and suggested going pantiless and wearing a long skirt.  Okay, did the mouth wash....worked but hurt like hell.  Then attempted the ointment before pee....yeah, right, seriously, can not get it on fast enough when you have to go...lol.. Will try using the water while peeing method, then mouthwash, not sure about the skirt, but I am thinking, its the 4th, the air quality stinks, got 4 good netflcks in the envelops, maybe I will veg in my room sans underwear and watch tv all day while sippin some low acid drink.......  Bad part of this, the onc wants to cancel my 4th AC next week until this clears up.  That started me crying, I so want to be over AC and on to the next phase...so, she left it up to me and I will be swishing and airing all weekend in an attempt to clear this up.... Goood part of this , had a great visit with my brother.  Never mentioned the \"C\" or the air other than , wow, all your baby blond hair hung in and it looks great.  What a bud...love that guy.  Instead, he brought home In and Out for lunch ( got over 20 burgers and fries and all 6 kids scarfed them down) and then just hung out.  It was a 3 hour trip up here for him and he had to fight holiday traffic to get here and thm leave.  Plus, he then tell me that he has to leve at 6am today to go to his fiancee's house (2 hours away) and help her put up a fence. Made me cry the little bugger..... Here's to a great 4th and enjoy the fireworks if yo have them!!!!! randie ",

First, an apology to you all.  I started rads 2 weeks later then I was supposed to, and decided to take a complete break from bc until rads were done. NO posting, no talking about it, no blogging, no writing.  I finished up on 12/21 and then Christmas came and went...lol. The day before New Years I got a cough, my MIL had had pneumonia for the past 2 weeks and was really sick, so that's what I thought I finally caught.  By the 7th, I was huffing and puffing just getting the mail.  Called the rad dr and he blew me off, didn't call, just let his nimrod nurse handle it saying try OTCs.  So, I went to my onc, they  did a chest Xray and my lungs were 1/3 fluid filled.  She thought it was pneumonia and put me on a Zpac and scheduled a CTscan for the 20th. BY thurs. I was barely moving air and having coughing spasms.  went in, this time the chest showed less then 50% of my lungs were clear and my pulse was over 110. So my only option to get a Ct was to check myself in, which I did at 7 pm and ended up getting the CT at 3 am. Here's the hard part, it showed lesions on both lungs, liver, spleen and 2 spots on my spine.  Nice huh?  They decided that I needed a lung tap to drain off the extra fluid and then test it.  They ended up taking over a liter from each of my lungs.  The right lung fluid was urine colored and had protein floating, and the next day when they did the left, it looked orangey.  Which they are now saying looks more like mets then an infection.  because of the holiday, I won't get the lab work back until Wed at the earliest. So, what do you think? Me, I ended up staying 3 days in the hospital and cried thru 2 of them, then cried some more when I got home.  Crap, does this not suck ???? Now, I have a better handle on my chances after reading the Stage 4 boards, so I feel surpisingly optimistic. What really sucked was that my kids were in the room with me as he was merrily talking about cancer, my 10 year old looked like someone had hit her over the head woth a bat.  That night, my BP shot up to 200/125 and they wanted to know why...lol...gee I have no FUCKIN idea people....They endd up making me take a pill before I stroked out. there you go, my update...now I have to go back 40 pages and catch up!!!! ranD",

We get to the hospital (literally 4 miles down the road) I go into ER, he goes to park the car and I wheezingly tell them, can;t breathe, SOB, she continues to ask me for my address, phone and meanwhile i am gasping like a fish on the dock.  FInally the triage nurse grabs me, finds out my o2 isat 88%, and gets me to a bed.  She tells me that someone will be in to \"hook \" me up.  Nope, we wait 90 minutes before I grab a face and gasp for o2...they got the mesage...lol.. Long story short, the radiologist was an older doc, he did it so carefully that the pain was non=existent, drained 750 and told me to come back in a few days and he would finish the job.  Looks like the right one is not refilling and he estimated about another 500 is left in there. Tomorrow I see the pulmonary ocs at 4, so I am really excirted and then my onc on Thursday for the game plan. Yesterday after the draining, I did the complete melt down crying in the car. Even though I was feeling better, all I could think about was,is this  what the next however many years will be like? Them I got a grip, prayed away the despair and actually walked in the house feeling like a burden has been lifted. I know that all the prayers you are sending my way (and cards, thanks eddie,its right in front of me) helps me fight stronger and longer. So, will check in tomorrow after the appt.... love you all, randie",

The sad part was that today my 86 yo mil came over and didn;t know that I shaved.  She took one look at me and burst into tears.  I told her that she took it harder then I did, but she dd say I have a nicely shaped headand that bald looked goodon me.  Altho, seriously, what was she supposed to say?  YOu look like a SNL skit come to life????:}}} randie",

BTW, No one told me that Zofran could stop working.  Could that possibly be why I feel like pukey crap these last 3 days? Sheesh.  I also got my steroid dose for the upcoming Taxol.  My onc told me that it was a large dose up front and that she would dial it back it I didn't need it.  Good news from her is that the tumor is now 1/3 - 1/4 of its size and lumpectomy-doable. But, I don;t want one and after reading, praying, venting,  blah blah I want them both off so I won't have this hanging over my head again. But, my ovary question is this, if they take them, do you still need to be on meds for 5 years? Career time: Graduated pre-med, got into med school, decided to take a year off and went to California.  Got there, and didn;t want to leave the beach area where I landed, got my real estate license, got a general contractor's license, worked on flipping houses, my ex decided that if I had a law degree that would help, so went to law school, dumped the a++hole, met my dh while I was going to night law school and working for the local police dept as a criminal process server.  Graduated law school, practiced some criminal and family law, oops, forgot to mention that last 2 years of law school had a baby.  DH was medically retired with 3 weeks notice, I was 5 months pregnant, FIL had Alzheimer's, MIL needed help, we moved up to he country with them, they put a second house on the property, FIL passed away 1 year later, had 2 more kids, never went back to law.  Did the stay at home route on and off, plus took my state emergency credentials route so I can substitute teach. Can you all tell I love to tke tests?  Seriously, they are so much fun, I wish people could pay me to take their tests...just not medical tests! We home school our kids,so that lead to some teaching part-time at co-ops and then at my current job, where I started off tutoring algebra students and then ended up teaching geometry and algebra to charter students. Whew.....now I decided to give it up for the summer and go back in September.  I love tutoring math, so I will try and keep that up.  Hope this was intriguing and interesting reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lol, randie",

Oh yeah, my onc did mention that studies shop taking  super B vitamins during taxol can help stave off se's.  anyone else hear about that?

Speaking of tx, since I am waiting to have surgery after chemo, I have a couple of questions (drumroll, enter dr. otter and dr. rock).  If they remove your ovaries, do you still have to be on tamox for 5 years?  I would love not to have to put another thing in my body again.  I am also leaning very hard towards a prophylactic mast on the left side...I actually had a friend tell me that i should consider whether I was doing this because chemo had messed with my reasoning and once I was done with chemo, then I would really want recon. I nicely informed her that I have always hated wearing bras and since I have nursed for almost 15 years, I would not miss them.  Plus, they would have to bolster up my other side and there goes sensation anyway. Hope that's not TMI [grin].  And seriously, who wants to worry or go thru chemo again.  Sheesh, sometimes people say stupid things.  I think the {WARNING RANT COMING UP} dumbest thing I heard was someone explaining to me that I need to consider if my dh is a boob man and then factor his opinion more heavily then mine.  I told her that even if i was a balls woman, I would want him to make the decision since  its the person, not the body you marry. Ok, back to more sunnier subjects! I am going in to the kitchen and make some more banana bread.  The kids ate the last batch in less than 2 days. Must be doing something right.  Maybe I will try making chocolate b bread, I'll put in cocoa for some of the flour and then I will get my fix. enough for now, still waitng for my nude therapist...randie",

The Chex® cereals have been on breakfast tables for more than 60 years. From the original Wheat Chex®, we have grown to include different varieties to suit eaters with different tastes. Our classic Wheat Chex®, Corn Chex®, Rice Chex® and Multi-Bran Chex® offer the simple, delicious taste of oven-toasted grains. Our Honey Nut Chex®, Chocolate Chex®, and Strawberry Chex® varieties add a sweet, but not too sweet, flavor the whole family will enjoy. And now, Rice Chex® is also gluten free, a delicious, nutritious option for those who are following a gluten free lifestyle! http://www.generalmills.com/stream_image.aspx?rid=31608 Now go bug your local store....lol...I bought mine at Safeway.

On the subject of blood, I am dreading the results because the last couple days I have foudn myself really tired and out of breath, betting my hemoglobin is low, but since only one more round I will NOT let them give me the booster death ray shot..lol Plus, I have found that homeschooling and chemo are a tough mix.  The kids don't start any extra enrichment classes until mid-sept and even though we started 8/18, I refuse to budge from the Labor Day start. They have been pretty much just working on math andreading.  My 16 yo started classes at the junior college this week.  I signed him up for Astronomy and Physical Geography.  All the math and english classes have been cut back (thank you my loser governator and stupid ass california legislators who can;t pass a budget to save their lives.  After all, other than the budget, what else shoudl they be working on???? Come on, if we treated our jobs they same way they do, how many of us would still have the job?  I know, I am ranting, but they cut a lot of services out here in the sticks and now they want to raise the tax rate.  I say fire the whole bunch and start again!) Back to my kids, lol, because of that, it was hard to find him classes that didn't have the math and english as requirements.  Humanities was one, but he looked horrified when I showed him the outline.  He was even more horrifed when I told him it was a college requirement and eventually he would ahve to take it. My poor little science geek! Last night, I had to bake something for the nurses, so they are getting chocolate banana bread and chocolate peanut butter bars.  I didn;t have to take the steroids, but I was still really amped about today.  So there you have it. I amdreading the heat today, yesterday we were over 100, and the same today, yech.  So, to make a long ramble short, someplace cool would be nice.  How about next time we meet in Northern Japan, in a nice tea house looking up at a snow covered mountain????? CHEMOOOOOOOOOO and hope we have nice sticks today!! randie randie",

I ended up with small spots of blood.  I swear all the little hirs seemed as if they were poking into me.Now don;t laugh at the visual.  But, since I am bald there as well, I tried to lift the sides and look, almost fell over.  Why?  Because to do this I had to suck in the tmmy, sling a boob to the side, thrust the pelvis forward....not a pretty sight.  Then decided I couldn't kill myself if I used a mirror, but couldn't find a mirror, then dh was outside and when I asked him to come in he wanted to know why, so that went nowhere fast.  Anyways, I ended up slathering the inside area with A&D, which helps, but there still is a spot of dried blood...any ideas? BTW, thanks for all the Taxol updates, rest well and breathe your clean air deeply since the air quality is now at 300 in some of the valleys around us.  randie ",

Christine:  gogators; my 5 yo was hiding under the covers on the couch when I got home and then he thought no chemo becuase I still have hair!  All day today he keeps trying to style it for me, but as hard as he is pulling it. I think its his male subtle way of seeing how firmly it still is attached to me! The only problem we are having is with my 12 yo Grace.  She has been pretty subdued and then late at night, she throws up...she finally toldher dad that she has a pain/lump in her side and thinks she has cancer...poor baby... Well, its almost time for my Alleve and then maybe some sleep....I managed 3 hours yesterday and about the same today...I need my 7 hours or I fell lilke crap, which is probably why the SE hit me today... BTW our infusion center kinda ticked me off. I asked the onco and the staff and everyone said, oh sure they have popsicles. Went down and asked and No pops and they actd like that was so yesterday, no one has ever proved it blah blah blah..So, my BFF and I have decided to approach the local Raleys and ask for popsicle donations and when the heat hits 105 in the summer, they will be a treat!  more later...randie",

As far as what I am baking, I saw this awesome black and white cheesecake in a quick shot of the Carnegie Deli on \"Bizzarre Foods..\" last night.  Aw, rock I am so jealous that you are so close to the Nirvana of food!  I was salivating over the corned beef sandwiches.  Seriously, if I had the bucks I would be celebrating the end of chemo by flying out there!! Anyway, I digress, so, IF i can find the recipe , then they are getting a cheesecake, if not, I will just make my standard cheesecake brownies. What is it about chemo that makes me think of foo all the time??? BTW, I created another new recipe yesterday, a coffee cake with peaches and blueberries.  The only problem was that the struesel topping sunk and ended up makig a middle layer along with the fruit, but the dh said it was the best cake he had ever eaten, so I guess it goes in my save recipe section. New plan for after BC, I want my own bakery!  I found that I really love baking my fool head off, lol.

Rock, your mom is in my thoughts and prayers as well. With all the steroids in me, you all have given me lots to pray thru tonight! Otter thoughts and prayers to you and mom and to all the moms out there! Eddie and Sable, sorry about the pain, wish we could wave our magic bc se wand and take us all back to pain free bodies, wow there's an invention Sable: I am now hooked on the Rome series.  I am halfway thru the 2(last) season.  Warning, this show is EXTREMELY sexually and violently graphic.  Definitely no kids around for this one. First tx went fine, considering that I showed up at 11 and din;t start til 1:15. Why?  Blood work screwup my platelet count came back without a number, just a note that said they clumped.  Not good enough for infusion room, SO they had to call upstairs, wait for the callback and then run another panel.  Then the lab closed for lunch! After the results, which this time read, normal, clumping, they had to call around again because they onc hadn't written new treatment orders and they still wanted a number.  When the LPN came down, he tried to tell them that they should clump and that was a good thing and why the hell had they run another test, so it was fun. Anyway, no adverse effect so I am cleared for round 2 in 2 weeks and hopefully by round 3 they can reduce the steroid amount so I feel normal.  Right now I am rally tired, but my brain won't shut down enough to sleep. Even though I had enough benedryl to pout a horse out, I ended up with a chatty neighbor who talked for a whole freaking 3 hours and never stopped.  The nurses didn't put the curtaim across because they were fiddling with her lines for an hour and just forgot.  Mind you I was watching a movie and had headphones on an she was still talking.  Even with my eyes closed she kept it up. I felt bad, bu tit wasn;t her first treatment, it was her 12th and she had her brother with her and I was so looking to 5 hours of quiet.   I felt like the passengers that were on Airplane and killed themselves rather than listen to Robert Hayes.   She finally left at 5, and I had a nice quiet 1 1/2 hours til I left.  So after a lone 9 hours ther, I was done..ahhhhhhhhh....CHEMOOOOOOOO Bright side is that Taxol and I get along, right????? randie",

No such luck, he sits me down, I try to tell him that he needs to warm towel my arms up, he ignores that and starts that tightening band routine and slapping any vein he sees.  Finally he gets the towel and it is warm, not hot and dripping wet, yup, he takes it off 5 minutes later and now my arm is freezing.  I am thinking (OUT LOUD, to make sure he hears me) that cold causes constriction , and he restarts the slapping routine and then announces he has one on my upper forearm.  My friend Sandy is standing there and is ready to take his head off, and now she is muttering as well.  He sticks the needle in parallel to my arm and she says she can see the little point going back and forth under my skin... He then throws the kit away and gets another one and I tell him I have a one stick policy, that was his shot,,,bye bye.  The supervisor comes, wraps the left arm up, finds the side vein in my elbow, sticks it and then follows it with a whoa this is a gusher and I look down and there is a nice collection of blood pooling...but she cleans it up and I am good to go... Nurse-man comes back, and starts the med drip and I swear the IV beeps every 5 minutes because the drip stops and he stands there flicking it and moving the bag up and down....ahhhhh...I wanted out so bad... I guess the icing on the cake was that the movie we rented was so bad...\"Be Kind, Rewind\" usually Jack Black is funny, there were some funny parts, but it seemed to drag. Moral for me, I made a point memorize the \"good\" nurses names and will request them and only them...lol Rock, I went out completely hat and wig less.  Does anyone notice that the women that have a wig on give you looks?  I had several people come up and tell me I look great and that it was good to see someone willing to be all out there.  I finally figured out that I have always pushed limits and now baldness is a new limit to press.... So, that;s my story, but today I seem to be doing better with the nausea.  I complained to the pharmacist and he told me to take a Zofran that evening instead of waiting to the next day, so maybe that;s helping, but I still have that nasty hangover headache. He also told me that my insurance company is giving them a hard time about re-filling any more Zofran, so the dr. needs to prescribe it again, even tho it has 3 refills left. Time to eat a nice high protein, high iron meal....bowl of Chocolate Chex and some watermelon... randie",

Rock on to all you ladies that have finsihed...I love the pics and videos!  Good news: saw the chemo onc today, says it feels as if the tumor is all gone and all that is left is scar tissue CHEMOOOOOO. Also, since no reaction to Taxol, she is stopping the steroids except for the pre=treatment bag, she even cancelled the pre treatment dose today, so I actauuly could nap on the bendryl for a change,  I was so freaking talkative that the nurse told me to shut up! Bad ish /good ish news is that she is worried about the tingling in my 2 fingers and if it gets worse during this tx, she will move me to a 3 week schedule....nooooooooooooo. Bad news: because I  have no family indictors for cancer, she won't recoomend BRCA testing, she thinks it will be futile, even tho I have 2 girls..arghhhhh...you know I will fight that one as I suddenly rememeber several close relative who died of bc....;p.  Also, she wants rads, but I have in my notes that my surgeon only wanted them if I had a lumpectomy. She said no way, you need 6 weeks of tx done 5 days/week. Again, I think I wil wait until 9/18 when I see my groovvy surgeon..  She also said that just removing my ovaries will lower my risk to almost nothing for uterine and cervical cancer.  Then she wanted to know where I found all this info and when I said internet research, she completely poo-pooed it the shithead....hahahahahahaha.  I really don;t like her even if she does head up the dept. On the way out, I talked to her nurse who basically told me that since she is a chemo onc, don;t listen to her and made an appt to see my surgeon and then wrote him a note in the file to reccomend me to the gyn onc.  WHOO HOOO girl power.I also asked her about the wide awake effects of vicodin with me, she thinks that sice I am such a drug virgin, my system can't handle it and told me to start taking 1/2 tablet every 2 hours, instead of a whole every 4-6, she thinks that I will have less SEs and less pain.  wil let you all know. Sorry in advance for chemo steroid brain talking. i am really starting to hate infusion day, once again 11 am appt, 2 nurses clled in sick and I didn't get started until 1\"15, hello people I have a life!  To top it off, I got the 1st tx male nurse who only like ports, yup, 1st stick in my hand (before whicj I told him that in my elbow seems to work the best), and it hurt like a m-fer.  I yelped and he tells me oops, and to yoga breathe to relax.  Oops?????? He then tells me that I have really thick skin???WTF? I pride myself on my baby soft chemo skin. He just plain missed and wouldn;t admit it.  The 2nd stick in the hand goe better but he is so worried that he os bruisingmy baby soft skin that he wraps the needle in so tightly, it starts pulsing to my heart rate.  He then loosens it and tells me not to bend my hand and to go easy...there goes my card game! Yup, he will NEVER touch me again. So, pretty uneventful after that.  Chatty Cathy was no problem since they put me on the oppsite side of the infusion center from her. Why?  Because I literally told the nurses at the station and the receptionist that if she was put wiht me, I woudl either shoot her or myself.  My friend Sandy told me that their jaws dropped, I guess I looked serious.  Do you think they wrote down on my file, threatening personality, don;t piss her off?? Will I be banned at future infusions centers world-wide?  That's my story and I'm sticking to it, randie",

Feels almost normal.  But I will be worshiping bald-bald because it makes me feel better-better.  My husband came back last Sunday with 2 wig catalogs from someone at church.  They are no win the recycle bin, guess I will thank her tomorrow.  Here's a cute story: My bf watched \"Breast Cancer Diaries\" the other day.  She had her 9 yo dd with her ( my 10 yo dd bff).  They got to the part about hair loss during chemo and Mary asked what that was and if everyone gets it, she explained it to her.  Mary said that she would like to see a bald woman.  Sandy looked at her and thought she was joking, then said, you were just over randie's.  Mary looked at her and said , she's not bald. After everyone finished laughing, Mary told them that she thought i had just gotten a really really short haircut for the summer. lol, guess all that 1/4 peach fuzz makes me look like I had a bad hair day instead of a bald hair day..... hears to minimal se's this weekend! randie",

This is an actual letter from an Austin woman sent to American company Proctor and Gamble regarding their feminine products. She really gets rolling after the first paragraph. It's PC Magazine's 2007 editors' choice for best webmail-award-winning letter. Dear Mr. Thatcher, I have been a loyal user of your \u2018Always' maxi pads for over 20 years and I appreciate many of their features. Why, without the LeakGuard Core or Dri-Weave absorbency, I'd probably never go horseback riding or salsa dancing!!, and I'd certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in tight, white shorts. But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary Flexi-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can't tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there's a little F-16 in my pants. Have you ever had a menstrual period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from the curse'? I'm guessing you haven't. Well, my time of the month is starting right now. As I type, I can already feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes from now, my body will adjust and I'll be transformed into what my husband likes to call \u2018an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.' Isn't the human body amazing? As Brand Manager in the Feminine-Hygiene Division, you've no doubt seen quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers monthly visits from \u2018Aunt Flo'. Therefore, you must know about the bloating, puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, crying jags, and out-of-control behavior. You surely realize it's a tough time for most women. In fact, only last week, my friend Jennifer fought the violent urge to shove her boyfriend's testicles into a George Foreman Grill just because he told her he thought Grey's Anatomy was written by drunken chimps. Crazy! The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just crawling with homicidal maniacs in Capri pants... Which brings me to the reason for my letter. Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi-pad, and there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words: \u2018Have a Happy Period.' Are you fucking kidding me? What I mean is, does any part of your tiny middle-manager brain really think happiness - actual smiling, laughing happiness is possible during a menstrual period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit pleasurable? Well, did it, James? FYI, unless you're some kind of sick S&M freak, there will never be anything \u2018happy' about a day in which you have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your house just so you don't march down to the local Walgreen's armed with a hunting rifle and a sketchy plan to end your life in a blaze of glory. For the love of God, pull your head out, man! If you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi pad, wouldn't it make more sense to say something that's actually pertinent, like \u2018Put down the Hammer' or \u2018Vehicular Manslaughter is Wrong', or are you just picking on us? Sir, please inform your Accounting Department that, effective immediately, there will be an $8 drop in monthly profits, for I have chosen to take my maxi-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly miss your Flex-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of condescending bull shit. And that's a promise I will keep. Always. Best, Wendi Aarons Austin , TX",

Okay, this is for everyone, put on your white coats and stethoscopes, hands o chin, GOOOO Last week the chemo onc told me that she was worried that I had weird numbing in my first 3 left  fingers after the 1st taxol.They just feelas if I was either playing the guitar or the Wii too long and te pads are sore-ish.  She thought that I was reacting too quickly and wanted to slow me to evry 3 weeks.  She said that if I got any worsening symptoms after the 2nd tx to call and she would hold off the next one. Here's my dilemma, I have those same weird feelings, not as strong on the sole of my left  foot. It feels like I was walking too long in the sand, not irritating, just kind of on the edge of my awareness. My friends tells me that I should call her up and tell her so that she can postpone the next treatment so I won;t get worse.  I don;t want to, i want to be done wih the last 2 tx on 9/11.  What should do?  I really don't want to stretch this out.  I was thinking of telling her to cancel the last 2 taxol tx since she said the tumor was gone.Whatcha all think???? randie",

I think the baking gives mean outlet for all of this, and i think it means that maybe I should be pursuing my own bake shop in the future.  I really discovered how much I like doing it. Once again, scheduled for 11, got in at 1, then the first nurse found out that the last tx IV ended up blowing that vein for chemo.  Sh(**t, it hurt like hell going in and out, i actually started crying.  Good news, she right away called for her supervisor who got in on the other arm right away.  Bad news, apparently the reason they were running late was that they were doing 4 or 5 new Taxol people.  SO, the nurses were all running around like chickens and I swear( and my chemo partner as well) that the mood was so black.  Every one of those poor women were scared shitless of the SEs and were constantly calling the nurses for SEs,I felt bad for them, and I guess I was annoying some of them because I was the only one talking.  It was so quiet. Too quiet if you know what I mean.  Couldn't wait to leave. According to dr.,  I have ne more to go,,,whoo hoooo.  But all the nurses wanted me to go to weekly and continue to Xmas so I can bake for them.  Yeah, right.  Doc also said that my counts were almost in the normal range for non-chemo and she was really impressed.  Teh only thing I did different this time was double sode fo B-50 every other day.  No idea, whythey looked good, but I will take it, right?  She also said my nodes have been non-reactive since the 1st tx, and that the tumor is reamrkably gone.  She also said, based on size and location I was a Stage III and that means rads.  We will see..... While shopping at Sam's I was pulled aside by a 10 year survivor.  She was really awesome.  She went thru chemo in the dark ages,had a double, removed ovaries and uterus and went no recon.  So I got a chance to ask her about how well it worked and she said she had everyday foobs and the the I want to look SEXY foobs as well.  She also told me the story, Cristine will know what she meant of driving thru Modesto in the summer and the a/c went out.  It was dark, so she pulled over, pulled off her shirt and went barechested.  She laughed and said it was the greatest feeling, now she knows why guys do it. I love the fact that so many people tell me they fee able to approach me because i don't cover mycranium.  So, that makes me feel better about my choice. Tomorrow I will be going and getting a large bag of fresh figs, yum, here comes jam for Xmas presents! randie",

So, 2 weeks ago, I called them and asked them if I could get a fill-up (keeping in mind that it would run at least $500) and they said go ahead.  Well, you probably can figure out where this is going.  Yup, filled up, got the bill, called and asked where to send it, and they basically said, oops, can't do that, call the American Cancer Society. I was so pissed, they told me that they were a non-profit, and each client had a limit to what they would pay out.  Funny, I checked all my paperwork, their brochures and nowhere is there a limit stated.  AHHHHHHHHH. What really burns me is that we normally fill up monthly and spread the pain (lol) thru the year, not a huge $640 hit (thank you oil and gas companies0at one time.  Problem is that when I call, they tell me that my contact s the only one and she has the final word. Okay, so on the phone I go.... see ya, randie ",

Bad news, 15/15 lymph nodes had cancer cells present, one had a shrunken tumor(the lowest node)_.  That means rads for me...so now I will be plucjing all of your brains again, lol.  However, they said no rads until November, so that means that my ovaries would delay the rads, so I will rpoabably be on Tamox pretty quick for at least a couple of months. Nurse said I am a very good patient, I have more the 90 degrees of movement and it is looking like I won't need pt to restore my range. However, she thought the surgeon left too much skin for a non-recon, so I will proabbaly have to have extra skin removed next year, but the bennie??? Hey, when I lose this chub most call an abdomen, I can get the skin tightened under the boobs for free...yippee.

Oh and I can get the ovaries out, it will just have to later in the year as soon as I recover from Fri. surgery. So, right now, I am angsting over the surgery that almost all of you have been thru.

This has been a great ride, I am 3 weeks out from surgery and not the surgery I had planned on having before chemo.  Turns out my CAT scan showed a weird blip where an appendix should be.  I had reactive lymph nodes in the area, so we had to have a colonscopy.  More fun!  That turned out negative, so then time for laproscopic surgery to remove whatever the blip was...turns out that it was a burst appendix.  The surgeon said it looked like it had burst years ago and walled itself off. They ended up taking 6 inches of my colon with it and now I have 3 cute scars on my tummy and a 10 pound weight loss. Sooooooooo, if I had let the original wacko surgeon operate and put me on chemo without those new-fangled CAT and MRI scans, I would have had a major problem.  Now I tell anybody who asks that breast cancer is not that awful, it saved my life since I would have never known that I had an appendix issue until it was too late.  See, there are perks to cancer...lol. I decided to have the breast removed after chemo, so I can deal with one major surgery at a time. So here's to jumping in with you all!!! randie",

At lest that's what the nurse told me after the fact. I actually told the doc that he had one last shot and I was pulling the tube out myself and running back to the onc ward and have them finish it there.  Good thing I had my dh waiting in the lobby, don;t think he would have handled it to well without resorting to husband rage.lol. I was yelling so loud that they had to stop and shut the back doors to my room.  I think I completely freaked them out, especially afterwards when I told them that I had a really high pain tolerance and this hurt more than childbirth without an epidural.

It was discovered by a Canadian nurse, Rene Caisse, who named it after her last name spelled backwards. The original formula is believed to have its roots in native Canadian Ojibwa medicine and contains greater burdock root (Arctium lappa), slippery elm inner bark (Ulmus rubra, formerly known as Ulmus fulva), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), and Indian or Turkish rhubarb root (Rheum officinale)[3]. And it pretty much is a tea that smells like it tastes.  Although we put stevia in it and it tastes a little better.  Plus, now that I am used to it, I don't shudder as much when drinking it...lol Supposedly: Effectiveness With respect to the use of Essiac in treating cancer, the U.S. National Institutes of Health's Medline states that as of early 2008:  [edit] History Caisse set up a free clinic in Bracebridge, Ontario which ran from 1934 to 1942. During that time a number of petitions were presented to the Legislature in Ontario, in 1938 calling for Rene to be allowed to practice throughout Ontario, but such permission was not granted. Medline notes there are more than 40 different essiac-like products now being sold in North America, Europe, and Australia. One of these alternative preparations contains eight herbs, adding red clover (Trifolium pratense), watercress (Nasturtium officinale), blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus), and kelp (Laminaria digitata) to the original four ingredients. Other preparations add echinacea and black walnut (Juglans nigra) or other ingredients, such as cat's claw ( Uncaria tomentosa )[5]. According to Medline, based on tradition, some people take essiac tea on occasion for general health purposes, detoxification, or for healing of various ailments other than cancer. Some of these other ailments include AIDS, asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, immune system disorders, liver problems, Lyme disease, and lupus erythematosus. NIH's Medline says even less evidence is available for these applications than for cancer. [6] Updating the history of Essiac, Medline says:",

Talk about feeling the love.....<sob sob sob...but joyful ones> Okay, hey, call my house...after BC, I have no privacy issues...lol...just be prepared to be undewhelmed with how much info you will get from the kiddos if they answer.... I was admitted Wednesday nite, but we had a horrible snow storm and it took 2 ambulances (once ran off the road coming to get me) and a fire truck  (which also ritched and they had to walk up our steep road with all their equipment to save me.... They ran all kinds of tests, said I was nuetropenic (sp) at around 1.8 and stuck me in a little isolated room for the next 5 days.  Because fo the snow, I did;t have visitors for 2 days, so it was rally really lonely and sad in teh room.  Add to that there was no internet hook up at all, so I couldn;t hook up with you all. Also, because of the snow, their satelliel TV option was not happning...so I counted ceiling tiles. Turns out that I had/have pnuemonia, so they treated wih IV antibiotics and kept checking ny counts each morning.  The last time they checked, I was at 2.4, still not great.  They tried 5 differnet times to check on Monday, but they couldn;t get a good vein, or it was microclotting. No one will tell me what that means, so I am still a little paranoid that something else is failing...ahhh the joys of cancer!! I checked in at our local hospital so they had to assign a local doc for my stay  What a bitch, she was not a very warm person, but her whole attitude was that if the patient complains, give her a pill.  When I told her that my back hurt from being in bed so long, she asked if I wanted morphine, when I cringed, she said, okay, muscle relaxers.  NOOOOOOO.  When she walked in on  me crying, pulled out her pad for antidepressants.  Crap I really hate medicine at times, why is the solution a pill?  She rarely acknowledged me and when she did, she stood 3 feet away with her arms crossed.   When she dischrged me she tried to get me to take antidepressants again....when I told her that I was finding solace in praying, she rolled her eyes.  Yup, give me that dammit doll and fill mine with lead please! The one bright point was the night nurse crew....it was like all of you rolled in to 3 wonderfull people ...seriously, what are the odds that all 3 were South African, 2 were sisters and the other was their best friend.   They were my protective hedge,  when my back hurt, they ordered an aor mattress and heating pad.  The doc saw them outside my door and was pitching a fit and the nurses just ignored her.  When Dr Doom ordered that I drink 1L every 8 hours round the clock, they adjusted my IV antibiotic flush bag and gave me more fluid.  So, they had my back. ENough of that, tomorrow I see my onc and then we plan from there...I just want to get this fluid crappy lung thngie gone..... thanks for your prayers and thoughts and just for being you!!  Love you all randie",

As far as the dr, he is a general surgeon and the hospital and clinics around here send everyone to him. He also told me that i would have  a 5 day hospital stay.  I guess what really pisses me off is that I can not drop everything in my life with a few days notice.  I need to get things in oder before surgery, don;t I?
