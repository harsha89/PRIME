The post above with the ATAC trial info shows that this particular er+ pr- combination does very well with an aromatase inhibitor but not as well with Tamoxifen. I was 38 but had ovaries removed and thus qualified for the AI. Your mom is lucky to have you looking out for her. Michelle",

I did have some complications and several more surgeries to repair. I did not do for cosmetic reasons but for other more unexpected feelings. I found that having the weight and feel of my chest back helped me to forget. Also after bilateral with no fat or skin on chest it was always having to wear something so clothes wouldn't sag or gap open. I swim and bathing suit was a pain etc. Then after several more years I had the nipple tattoos. Really had to brace myself for these things. Resent the invasion after so much time has passed. The outcome is not beautiful, nor would I pose for any calendar but it looks Ok and once again helps me forget. When i step out of shower and catch a glimpse in mirror it doesn't remind me anymore. Not vanity but jsut wanting to put it behind...move on.",
