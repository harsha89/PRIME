Its good to hear from someone who has had it done as most people have their surgery before radiation. Will definitely be going ahead with it though. Thanks again for replying.",

Had a lumpectomy in Nov 2015 and rads in Feb 2016 which left my treated breast considerably smaller than the other. I spoke with a plastic surgeon last week and she suggested a reduction and lift on both breasts for asymmetry but advised that the radiated breast may take longer to heal and likely hood of infection is high. Would love to hear from ladies who had this surgery completed and what the outcome was. Log in to post a reply",

Treatment left me with radiated breast nearly two sizes smaller than the other breast. I'm due to go in next month to have a reduction and lift on both. Just wondering if anyone else on here has had this done, and if so, was it successful.",

I scored 18 with the oncotype test and after looking at the facts and figures, I reckoned chemo would have given me an extra 2 per cent advantage. The only point I would mention is that there is only a small time frame to undergo chemo after breast cancer surgery so maybe get a second opinion if it will make you feel more at ease.",

I had two very small tumors which did not show up on mammo or ultrasound. I would definitely go with the advice of your radiologist and have it done, hopefully all will be ok. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Feb 23, 2016 07:13PM - edited Feb 23, 2016 07:16PM by jenny153 Try not to worry. My case is very similar to yours and I found that the waiting for results was the worse part of being diognosed. I also had three small stage one grade one tumors, ranging from 5mm to 1 cm with no node involvement. I had a lumpectomy with clear margins three weeks later. My doctor arranged for me to have the oncotype test done to see if chemo would be of any benefit to me and it came back low so I managed to escape chemo thankfully. I finish my 4 weeks of radiation next week and will take tamoxifen for 5 to ten years. It has been doable to be honest. As your's is caught early, my guess is your prognosis will be good. Hang in there, once your treatment commences things change, you will hopefully feel more positive. Tip: bring somebody with you for support when you are seeing your doctor, also two sets of ears are better than one. Good luck.",
