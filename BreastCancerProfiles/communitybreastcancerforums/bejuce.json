I've recently increased my weight lifting exercises so I'm hoping it's a sore muscle or something. I don't feel a hard lump, but today I'm feeling what appears to be soft tissue of some kind or a pocket of fluid. I did have the area radiated to the max. I'm afraid it may be a recurrence to the supraclavicular node.  Or could it be lymphedema? Can a supraclavicular node be enlarged because of lymphedema? Has anyone experienced something like this before? I'm coming up on my 3-year anniversary from diagnosis on the 18th so I'm a little more anxious/stressed than normal.  All the memories are coming back to me and the fear is so vivid.

Starting with my OB, who, on a routine visit in March '08, felt my breasts and noted that my right was more \"engorged\" than the left, especially on the upper outer quadrant.  I questioned him how I could be engorged when I was just breastfeeding at night at that point.  He shrugged me off.  In July '08, I found a swollen lymph node on my right armpit - same side as the so-called engorgement.  Went to my family doctor, who requested an ultrasound (just of the armpit and not of the breast - she told me I was still breastfeeding and wouldn't show anything!) and upon the finding of a \"benign-looking swollen lymph node (2.5cm!)\" was given a paper that said roughly come back for a baseline mammogram when you're 40.  I talked to her on the phone and she told me it was \"unrelated to the breast\" and was most likely due to an infection (which I had no signs of). I requested to see a surgeon, who didn't know what to do, recommended against a biopsy or surgery to remove the lymph node (made it sound like the most difficult thing in the world to do, he was young and didn't know anything) and consulted with a breast surgeon and the clinic's specialist on breasts, who told me to come back in 3 months.  This was in July '08. I weaned my son right then, went back in October for a repeat ultrasound (again just of the armpit as they still wouldn't image my breast), which revealed the same benign-looking swollen lymph node but at 2.1 cm.  Was told again to come back in 3 months.  Only in January '09 did the surgeon decide to request a mammogram/MRI, which I could only schedule in February.   Sorry for getting off-topic and venting, but as you can see, it's no wonder I still get angry at this. Worse is, my story is not at all unique.",

I wonder how much time I have left, etc., etc., thoughts I never imagined having at this stage in my life.  I was diagnosed in February of this year, went through chemo, had surgery, and I'm now doing radiation.  By the time I was finally offered an MRI and a mammogram, my tumor was gigantic at 12 x 10 cm.  I thought for sure I was doomed.  Chemo destroyed the tumor in my breast completely but still left a small percentage (< 5%) of residual cells in 11/13 nodes, making me a stage IIIC.  I was devastated when I found out about my node status, but I'm trying to stay positive as much as I can.   I read somewhere about the Stockdale paradox and that has been helping me lately. Here's the quote that perfectly describes how I feel: \"You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.\" Hope this helps!",

The article talks about a family's struggle through a kidney cancer ordeal and the absurd costs of treatment (much of it covered by insurance).  The article was very emotional to read (I cried in the end).  My hubby read it first and then recommended it to me. What was interesting was that in a converation we were having over dim sum yesterday, he mentioned to me that he was impressed that the patient in the story had (for months) hidden from his wife the fact that his cancer had metastasized to his lungs to spare her of the pain of seeing him suffer. Then my hubby said he'd be impressed if I did that to him too, that if my cancer were to return, I'd somehow spare him of the pain of it - at least for a while. I was very taken aback by his comment - does that mean he can't take the pain? How about me? Should I just go through it alone? I don't think I could do that... This is so old school to me.  I know women that went through cancer treatment alone (10 years ago or so) because of the stigma associated with the disease.  But we're in 2010! And why should I hide anything from my family, who should be my biggest supporters???  What do you guys think? Would you hide a recurrence from your significant other and kids? How is this even possible? Is it better, knowing that the cancer will eventually take your life in the end, to spare your family of the pain? I for one would be trying every single treatment available out there and would not give up... Let's open up the line for a frank debate... Thanks!!
