I was diagnosed six weeks after having my daughter when i found a lump while I was breastfeeding. I was diagnosed June 22, 2012 with stage III IDC with involvement of axillary lymph nodes. I was started on chemo right away four AC's and four taxol then I had a bilateral mastectomy with left axillary node dissection in December 2012. I started having severe back pain in January of this year and was diagnosed with a spinal met on T12 and they said it looked like a few lymph nodes on my left side were still involved. I'm currently on Xeloda and radiation and the radiation on my spine has helped with the pain tremendously! I'm getting my port put back in on Thursday cause my onc says I'm going to need more chemo after radiation. Wishing everyone the best and keep fighting the good fight! Deyla",

I was just in the hospital for ten days because I had a compression fracture to T12 and new lesion to L5 and the pain was just unbearable. They did kyphoplasty to the compressed vertebrate and I am currently having radiation to L5. Now I have a pinched sciatic nerve that I am dealing with. I am going to start PT so I'm hoping that will help. I have been triple negative from the start and it is just so depressing looking at the statistics but I just try and stay positive. What else can we do right? Thank you ladies for listening to me. Deyla",

So far I feel ok just really tired and sleep (I think it's from the Benadryl). DeliriumPie- back when I did the ACT I had my port surgery and started chemo the same day. It wasn't too bad. They took my port out when I had my BMX and boy I wished they hadn't because I had a met to T12 and so I'm on a new round of chemo now. I had to have the port put back in and it hurt more the second time round. For all you ladies starting ACT I had a tougher time on the AC. I started losing most of my hair after the 2nd tx and just decided to shave my head. I had such a metallic taste in my mouth all the time and could only eat cold foods for some reason. I lived on Kellogg's cornflakes. I did have constipation problems and my nails did get discolored but didn't fall out. I also got a mild cardiomyopathy from the AC and had to be put on cardiac meds which I'm still on. The taxol gave me mild neuropathy but it went away. The fatigue and the bone pain from the neulasta shots were probably the worst for me. Wishing everyone the best of luck on their journey! Deyla",

My husband and I shaved our heads and my then 2 now 3 year old son watched so he could see I was still the same mommy. My hair is just starting to fill in nicely and I just started another round of chemo-Ixempra due to a small lesion on my spine so it looks like all my hair will fall back out. At least I know it will come back eventually. For now i'll be rockin my bandanas again for summer time. Wishing everyone minimal side effects! Hugs, Deyla",
