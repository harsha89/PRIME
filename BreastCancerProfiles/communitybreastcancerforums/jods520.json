The mass is large and in my lymph nodes so I need to start soon. Does not give me a lot of time to prep or do research on what to expect, so I appreciate all of the information here. Still soaking in my diagnosis. I will be on an AC regimen initially- does anyone know if a cold cap would help to prevent hair loss? To me, that is the most scary of all possible side effects. I also have a weak stomach to begin with so am just hoping I am not vomiting all day for 4 months straight! Glad to know there is a community out there to ask and answer questions. The unknown is scary.",
