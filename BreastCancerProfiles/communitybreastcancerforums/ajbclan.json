My regimen has hit me harder each time, so I plan for the crappy week afterwards. I also still need to have surgery and there's possibly more chemo to come, but one step at a time!

Another mom walks in- obviously doesn't know I have cancer and loudly says \"you cut your hair!!\", yes, and she kind of said a couple other things (she was nice- don't get me wrong), but I now feel all the eyes on me, knowing some know- and some don't. So I said well it'll all be gone soon and then I can't even get the words out and mouth \"I have breast cancer\" and start crying! Crap- I'm pissed I'm crying because I don't feel bad for myself, but don't feel bad for me. Then she comes over sweetly (again- don't be nice) and then another mom hugs me (stop the hugging). I know on top of it I'm hormonal (still not in menopause). So that sucked! I think that's just why it's the worst part- like someone said you can hide the surgery aspect (I'm assuming- haven't done that yet), but the hair is just obviously. Good luck tomorrow djm71.",

My mother in law spent 4 hours with me yesterday, which was fine, but on the way out she says \"I was a little scared to come over\"....then says \"but you look good, you are still YOU. Um yes- I am! So fascinating but weird at the same time. Karey and JandJmom- I'm on the same chemo as both of you, but you're ahead of me- my 2nd treatment is Wed. I didn't get any metal taste, but hope things don't start tasting like dirt! Things just tasted off that first weekish- and I agree Karey- sweets seemed to be fine. I would \"crave\" certain things that week (7 up tasted good, trail mix with m&m's tasted normal), but now I don't want those. I also was the same- not feeling \"semi-normal\" until day 8. I didn't have much D, more constipated, so hoping to get ahead of that next week as it made me nauseated last time. I did have a good case of thrush that week after and tried baking soda, salt, and biotene. Biotene seemed the best for me so I swished after every food or drink. MO agreed to just keep using that. JandJmom- I haven't had any blood work done mid way- I will do it Wed am right before treatment. Seems to be a quick turn around for the results. Dara- I'm constantly queasy....and I don't know if it's my sinuses, chemo, or a combo. I eat, and it goes away for a bit, but always there. I just deal- haven't taken anything. I feel like a lazy bum next to all these folks staying so busy with kids and work! I'm still running my daughter and dog places, but definitely take it easy when I can, which is daily. I was really gung ho with the \"I won't get sick\", until that first treatment (and also this board) and I realized- I'm not going to jeopardize keeping this treatment on schedule - want to stay on track as much as I can, so I'm now once again, a germaphobe lol. I can't do my work....but possibly could work in our office if no one is sick. I secretly ride the buses in our county, and evaluate the drivers. So I've been doing this for 4 years, and I've been super healthy even though I'm exposed to who knows what! I think it's helped my immune system, but the husband and MO reminded me this is taking that all away- so now I respect that. I thought being bald would have been a great undercover look for a while though!",

Will be meeting with a radiation oncologist in Sept to see if I need that after surgery. Found out yesterday that we are waiting on the insurance for the pharmacy side on the Nuelesta approval- so hope that doesn't delay the start of this all. The oncologist didn't think I needed a port, Nurse Practioner assumed i was getting one, so will hydrate a ton and see what happens after the first round, and go from there.

Your sister was beautiful and it's just so heartbreaking to see this disease do this to so many families. Thank you for your post! Cali- some of us have gotten throat issues including a cough from the chemo- I'm hoping this is just a side effect for you and not something else your body may be fighting. Awesome story SweetRain! Marlene and Elizabeth- how are you doing? I have chemo #4 next week...always start feeling fairly \"normal\" and then I realize that'll change soon. My side effects seem to shift. After the 2ish week mark I have more of the heartburn and eye issues. Dara- I try to have at least a vitamin water a day for the electrolytes to help with the eye twitch. It does seem to cut it down for me. My eyes are watering a ton. Something I have to watch- the NP told me yesterday that there's a rare chance the eye ducts clog from the chemo (I think that's what she said). I'd have to go to the eye dr if that's the case. Fingers crossed no. I had an ultrasound on Monday. I think I pushed the whole memory that there are \"multiple masses\" out of my brain until I saw the results from the ultrasound that listed 4 different masses. Ugh- 4....really- I grew 4 cancer masses in less than a year. Nice. But the NP said they don't worry about the number of them. Ok. Good news is 3 out of 4 are responding to the chemo. The one with the tissue marker has stayed the same size. Other 3 have mostly shrunk in 1/2. So the Oncologist office is very happy and I still have 3 more treatments to go before surgery. Fingers crossed. Hugs to you all.....off to the plastic surgeon for a consult!",

That's interesting about Vitamin D- I already take it almost daily, so that's a bonus I guess? Lisbeth- wow.....I did get a little of that- well the people posting on the boards have issues, so that's why the post, but now that I'm here with you all- it's not like that, and I am too super happy I was able to walk in with the questions that the group has sparked for me.

CandyHB- I'm sorry you're not feeling confident. I haven't started, so may change my tune tomorrow (lol)- I guess I guess I always knew that if I got any breast cancer it was going to be take it all, get rid of it asap. I've watched my mom go through cancer 3 times. I've been watched for 15 years, so I bawled when if finally came to be- but will lose my hair to this poison but want this crap gone.....and I know from previous meetings with oncologists back with my mom- to my current- those cells are small and can't always be seen on screenings- so I'm hitting the chemo right off the bat to keep any potential floaters a firm death. But - everyone is different- I have a history of cancer so have thought about it off and on for years- easy for me to know what I was doing. I wish you the best- it's ok to vent and ask here..... Oh- and I must have chemo brain prior to chemo- my daughter started school today! LOL- just 1/2 day, but my 1st treatment isn't until tomorrow. Duh!

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2016 05:38PM - edited Aug 24, 2016 05:40PM by ajbclan  Trying to catch up and scroll! First off, my treatment went fine. I was feeling good after, made a casserole, went to my 13 year old's volleyball practice and the her Dr's appt. I'm now in that waiting game of \"what will my body do\" with this. Swishing my mouth with the Biotine mouthwash, drinking so much water (the nurse warned it may taste bad soon). A friend said she read that eating peanut butter took the metal taste away- hey whatever works I'm open....but so far so good. Candy girl & KZ1966- you're right- I brought a bunch of stuff, but basically just looked at my laptop, drank my water and a small Perrier, and I ate a snack bag of pretzels. Used a blanket, beanie on my head (I realized my ears are now cold a lot- no long hair to cover them!), and a jacket (and ICE). KZ1966- jealous you only have 4!! I have 6- but one down is all that matters. Fireheart- love the idea of the spiky hair!! Kechla- I didn't do the hands or feet- I think I'd freeze, so I just did the ice chips when the put the chemo in. To give you an idea- for me, they did bendryl and steroid first (think that was an hour), then 1 chemo drug for an hour, and then another for over 30 min. It went fast- then they just did a quick flush and I was done. I really hydrated well the days, and am before, and probably had a talented nurse so IV went in fine. I have the Nuelesta on my belly....took about 3 min and then when it beeped the nurse said ok you'll feel a pinch soon- it made a little noise that made me jump more than the actual prick. Unwilling- your experience sounds beyond awful! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that at all....geez! Glad you're out of the painful woods now. Lori- love your photo!! Of course I won't want to hear it, but you look great without the hair! I really think that (or I'd just avoid the topic all together lol). I'm going to have to try a mocktail- it's a great idea...they don't come out and tell you not to drink- a beer sounds good to me right now, or a glass of wine lol. But I'm guessing it's not part of the hydrating plan. Dara- I love your stories!! Thanks for sharing- you guys give me hope for dealing with the bald stage to come and I'm sure quickly now. Oh- I was able to tell TWO people today that I had cancer without crying! Progress lol! The first one I couldn't add the word \"breast\", but at my daughters dr's office I know she was checking out my short hair, so told her. I said next time I'll see you I'll be bald. I just shared on one of the other boards I follow for IDC diagnoses (but I don't look at it often)- said I found a wonderful group here!! Thanks everyone- Kechla and Sweetrain- looks like you're up for tomorrow....no luck needed you'll do fine! and get to scratch one treatment off! Keep us posted on how it's going. Have a great night everyone.....",

Feel good that there is some progress. I have 4 masses, 3 responded pretty well- the big doosy with the marker in it from the biopsy is holding steady...errr. Hang in there.

Leydi- the office where I got my chemo was cold- so I picked a spot away from a vent and near a window. They had blankets, but brought my own along with a beanie. I chopped my long hair down to a Pixie cut. A week into the cut now I'm used to it so I'm glad I made this transition- hoping the next shave will not be as traumatic (ha!). I brought my own ice chips, I'm not getting that AC drug, so I was able to hit the bathroom fine- just had to learn how to \"dance\" with the IV- laughed by myself in the bathroom . One question- has everyone had surgery already? I'm doing 6 chemo treatments first, then surgery. Just curious if anyone else is backwards like me.",

Annie- I was able to hang out for a bit with the trick or treaters this year, and my 13 yr old had 4 friends over (makeup, pizza and out the door!)- was fun to see and hear how much fun they were having, esp after returning to the house....makes you really appreciate the time with the kids and hearing all of the laughter. JandJ- geez...it's funny I guess I have expectations of myself and how the rounds \"should\" go, that I too was surprised with the nausea. Usually I only take a couple of pills, and it doesn't feel like it works. This time I was more willing to take them...and it makes me nervous for rounds 5 and 6. I'm trying to keep notes and suggestions written down so I need to read them and follow them next time. I'm definitely still fatigued. Anything feels better than last Friday/Saturday. It all hit a day earlier too. I thought I'd make it out to the desert for Thanksgiving, but not so sure that will happen (round 5 will be the week before). I feel like our bodies \"issues\" are brought to the forefront with the chemo- I'm hoping that's what's happening with the vision for you!! Its so hard not to be scared by everything...hang in there. I'm suppose to do an ALS/Lou Gehrig walk this Saturday. I just noticed the walk doesn't start until 930am, phew- don't care about registering lol....so 930 works. I have a high school friend that is down to communicating through her eyes and a computer. Cancer is horrible, but ALS is a horrible death sentence.

I asked if I would get an Oncotype- nope- no need since I already am doing chemo. Still a chance for more chemo. They'll not only use the pathology report but what the surgeon sees when she goes in. Looks like I'll have surgery in January but should know next month. I'm so dense that the MO said she honestly can't determine if she's feeling the tumors or just dense area...so I'm glad i had the ultrasound.

The NP told me that I shouldn't have to feel the SE's, to take things she suggested and if they don't work, call. So please do call. Kenzielulu- so appreciate you being frank with how it's all going- I hate the 2nd guessing and trying to figure out should i take something etc. I'm not much of a tea drinker, and so not sure how ginger will go over with me, but I'm open to every idea lol. Loved your story about the casino- funny though how fast my thoughts have changed about even going into the office (even though I usually work \"outside\")- those vents, someones always sick- I'm thinking might not be worth it. Ok good to know on the squirt bottle- just adds to the \"fun\". Oh speaking of- so i get my menstrual cycle yesterday? NY1980- I guess I can't even get rid of that as you said pages back! Seq24- maybe we should just think that those that aren't having bad SE's aren't posting? Wishing you the best- glad you found both boards- I think DaraB was super smart going back to July. It's hard to keep up with all the possible SE's for sure...then you start 2nd guessing everything your body is doing and feeling. Lisbeth- thanks so much for posting that a SE of the nausea pills can be constipation! Seriously- I think it was the constipation that made me nauseated but then I'm like \"I'M NAUSEATED\" and took a Zofran lol. Thanks for being so open and frank on both ends- the fears, the tears that randomly come, and the then laughs. Caligirl has some good ideas on the mouth- I bought a waterpik, but still need to set it up. Hugs to you all....one hour at a time ladies......",

All of the advice here- from personal experience to what you guys are learning from nurses, etc I am taking to heart and seriously. I'm focused back on my fluids today, and realizing I may not go back to work even in the office- don't trust all those germs running through the vents. I want to desperately stay on schedule....so making that my primary goal for now. Kechla- I was told to take Claritin every am for 7 days starting the day of the Nuelesta. I've taking Aleve and Tylenol as well (NP said don't be in pain) to help. jandjmom- love you wore the shirt- I was looking around....did anyone see the shirt that said \"no these aren't real, the real ones tried to kill me!\" Got a kick out of that, not sure if i could wear it. lol. I can't remember who's husband had the shirt or hat on as well...I'm thinking it would be more fun to get friends shirts lol. fire heart - you always make me laugh, thank you.

You've really been on a ride with the delays, etc. Stinks! Not sure why we can't just deal with the crap called cancer, and not have other stuff thrown in. Hang in there. Tishabe- after treatment I seem to be an 8pm bedtime person too! Right there with you. Dara- seriously- so cute with the scarf! VLH- Wow- So much to process, I'm hoping you can find some clarity through the MO, but also can someone help with the house? I know people want to help, I'm not one to ask, but here's a place where they can and feel like they're doing something....people want to be able to do something for us- if you can- let them. Cali- I definitely think if you're concerned, a 2nd opinion is in order. I met with the radiation oncologist- I'm \"weird\", I\"m \"almost\" triple negative, but I've got a little hit on the progesterone. Right now, they're not feeling I will need radiation (but can change after surgery obviously). The one thing I'm so thankful for is that this group (Memorial Care) meets weekly. The whole team, multiple radiation oncologists, MO's, surgeons, etc. So I'm getting more than one opinion- they talk through each case. I'm taking this as another life lesson/learning piece (if I'm not making sense- apologies, the SEs have hit)....and would love anyone's feedback on life after I beat this (yes- my plan lol).....after my mom passed in April, it's just my daughter holding us here in Calif. My husband and I have for the first time talked about \"where would we live?!\"....so it's been fun to research cheaper states to live in, what's the weather (we haven't traveled much, so it's online right now), etc. NOW....I'm adding in- health care, good hospitals, etc! I'm spoiled- great times, less than 10 min from me. So would love to hear what you all think! Gives me something fun to look forward too.",

Cali you're right- and I really hope that what karey indicated - this extra week might help my body after treatment. I really don't want to get any closer to Xmas- my 13 year old is so excited, and I know I don't have many more of these \"excited\" xmas's with her so want to have the best that we can. I read about foods to help boost the platlets- who knows if it works or not, but figured it can't hurt and went out and bought papaya and papaya nectar yesterday. I'm not a fan of the taste, but figure if I throw it in a smoothie it can't hurt! So I'm back on my smoothies this week lol. I was doing smoothies pretty regularly before chemo, but it just hasn't sounded good the last couple of months (plus I'm too lazy to make them). So we'll see.",

Then she proceeded to list off the family members that have lived/died with the different cancers. Thanks. Have a nice day. 2 things I'm pissed at- DaraB's teacher situation- please keep us updated. So frustrating, and if a 5 year old senses it, makes me even more upset. We already had one crappy NP (can't remember who had that as I type), and now we've got Seq24 with the crappy chemo class! Really people?!! Seq24- everyone is right- it's the waiting for the SE's and constant wondering what's happening and why that makes is worse. My chemo day was \"fine\".....yes, had SE's, and wonder if I'm still having some every day. In a way- it's good you know what's causing it (not some random virus), and you know it WILL go away. I was totally sick when I was prego, and I haven't thrown up at all with this. I'm nauseated slightly lately, but it could just be my sinuses and the weather change and I probably would be nauseated chemo or not. Who knows....just be aware and like my NP said- they DON'T want you to \"deal\" with the side effects....take the meds that help. Don't wait and see if you can tough it out, there's no need. Since my SE's are better, I'm not playing with my hair waiting for that \"ball to drop\". I love everyone's feedback and how a lot of folks have taken charge of it.

I know we expect the chemo SE's to just go away so maybe a crappy combo. I see my PCP dr today- yesterday was the first day I felt like the clot was getting better. I honestly said 2 days ago- I'd do another round of chemo.....at least I knew how many days I'd feel like crap vs this pain and inability to do anything for almost 2 weeks. But I've been able to spread the pain meds out longer, and actually did some dishes and laundry. I was really hoping I'd be exercising and getting the house in order before surgery, but instead I've been practicing sitting haha. I do still enjoy this group of ladies....I'm periodically on other boards, but I think when you go through chemo with a group, we can relate better. Might be me haha.

I get the tingling, and I know it's nueropathy- the MO and my NP really are watching that. NP mentioned a B vitamin, but since I'm not numb, etc she doesn't want to add another pill just yet. I'll get tingling in arms, legs, hands and a little feet- but it's not prohibiting me from doing things. Dara- I had the same questions on where to find that on the liver enzymes. I get a quick print out during chemo, but then more pop up online on my records so was wondering if I'd see it there. My eye started twitching when I read your message lol. Yesterday I realized I have over a month of feeling like crap. I usually have a good 10 days of yuk, before it mellows and the next round. I have 3 more rounds. poo. I'm hoping those of you shifting to another regimen have better luck with the side effects! I'm not doing the AC, but seems like they call the A the red devil for a reason?!

It's funny this process, and I know we're all different, but trying to figure out if my hair will just continue to thin, or will I have patchy bald spots, things you don't think about. I've always planned to shave, but it's good to know I don't have to rush it! Barbara55- I read your post this morning, and then what pops up on the TV- Blue Bunny! I love all the tips from everyone! I'm so sorry about you being trapped in the house, and the mouth sores. I took the advice from here and brought ice chips. I was like Dara- thrush, but no sores. I swished something (baking soda/water, salt water, biotene) after each time I ate/drank anything besides water until that thrush was gone. Kathi- thanks for calling us beauties! That made me smile! Glad you're feeling better. Leydi- I so feel like you....trying to keep my 13 year olds life as normal as possible! Did you get something along the lines of Nuelesta? I went from not afraid of germs, to feeling weird around any public place. I know some folks here are having issues, so I'm cautious but I am also empowered by the women not letting this stop their lives. I would check in with your MO if you can, and if you get the green light you'll just be more aware of the people around you. I sat down 2 nights to watch my daughter practice volleyball, and I just scanned the people around me. I was prepared to move if anyone started coughing or sneezing. We have a couple of concerts coming up, and i know one is right after my 3rd treatment. It was suppose to be me taking my daughter and friend to her first concert. Makes me cry to think I can't, and then I think of the crowd and germs and not sure if it's even good for me to go. I have the friends mom ready to go as my back up, but chokes me up to think I'll miss this. Seq24- I felt just like you.....just sitting and waiting for something bad to happen. I felt bad starting day 3, and really didn't feel normal again until maybe day 10. Everyone is different and you worried so much that maybe this is it for you! Take it and don't feel guilty- the meds are working...you're body is handling them well! I had a great night last night. I mentioned previously that we never go out to dinner (unless there's a coupon involved lol), but we had watched last season of Top Chef on TV. Turns out one of the chefs was local here- and my husband surprised me with my 50th bday dinner at his restaurant. We were doubly lucky he was there....so I wasn't going to miss a chance for a photo (usually I would just sit and watch and never ask lol). Great food, great fun....great way to kick off my 2nd chemo treatment week.",

I totally understand your feelings of worry...I too am still worrying about the what if's, especially as they are really getting the word out during BC month about metastatic BC. I even saw something on the Today Show yesterday. It's hard to imagine we do all we can to our bodies, and that there's a chance of it coming back or spreading. We will all need to lift each other up and out of that! Periodically I'm even googling and trying to find statistics! I'm bad. I had met with the radiation oncologist and she didn't think I needed radiation, but I think like you- well maybe we just need to add the to keep this done. I don't see that you've updated your bio, which is totally fine, but I'm not sure where you are in the whole process (for example- I started chemo first, then I'll have surgery). But want to say you ARE a warrior...some will do more chemo then others, some surgeries are more intense, same with radiation. I'm glad you asked your MO what he would do with his wife...perfect! Be proud...they can always revisit options like he said. HAPPY BIRTHDAY VICKY (AKA CALI!!)!!!! Fire heart - thanks for sharing your SE's, and keep us posted on the neuropathy and what the MO says about the scary GI burn/pain. Can I just say too....as I know I feel like this sometimes- this board can get overwhelming, and you want to post and then feel like you're \"behind\" and won't address or comment on everyone you should. Please don't worry about that! Please post and let us know how you're doing...I don't think we all feel like we need comments back. I think everyone just sharing what they're going through is helpful and supportive....so let us know how you're doing.

I have been taking probiotics for years.....definitely recommend, but that can be confusing on what to take. I seemed to do well on just a Trader Joe's brand so stick with it and rotate in another one to get different strains. Dara- thanks for asking- it's been a confusing ride with the different surgeons, and throwing in an infectious disease dr lol, and with not a lot of communicating between them. Bottom line the infectious dr did do a blood test...I want to get a hard copy of it at some point as I'm still not clear what he tested for. He told me protein level, and then his assistant said white cell count lol. Surgeons office referred to protein levels. Whatever it was, it's normal. Both surgeons saw the area this week and felt it looked good. No one wants to hang their hat on saying it's gone, including the infectious dr lol. So it's a wait and see if something flairs up. I will be keeping my antibiotics handy just in case. PS said we're good to go to start fills now and exercise and PT. Finally moving forward. It's crazy all we've been through already!

Tish- did you get prescription/dr stuff straightened out? I'm thinking we can just use our MO as our primary during this- why not! JandJmom- I understand your concern....after my first infusion, I was chalking weird pings and pangs to neulesta. I'm realizing this is more neuropathy. It doesn't happen only in my hands- I'll get weird feelings in my legs, etc. I would absolutely talk to your MO about your concerns. When I met with mine after first infusion, she really seemed interested in all of my side effects, noting everything. My mom had BC twice, then colon cancer. She didn't have any neuropathy issues until colon cancer chemo. We're not on any of those drugs. She had numb feet, never any pain, and it would come and go. I'm refusing (LOL) to get neuropathy. I'll fight that too! Watch out! haha. By the way- I say that about the chemo drugs with colon cancer, as I was suppose to have a colonoscopy in Oct, then found out I'd be going through this. So I looked at the oncologist and said well, if anything is growing in the colon, this will kill it right???? Nope! Oh great, my body falls apart, but I could still having cancer growing in my colon? What the heck lol. So they squeezed me in. I still am worried about that....but I go in often. Annie - on behalf of the group, I want to say thank you for carrying out baby!

Plus I guess we bmx'rs naturally hunch, so my shoulders, etc are all off. I had 2 BC friends ask me if they need sleeves for flying, my PT said yes to be safe. So just something we all need to be aware of if any lymph nodes were removed. Took my daughter and a friend to Universal Studios yesterday....long day, but we had a good time.",

It reminded me Dara of your post about seeing the person beyond the scarf, wig, pink ribbons. I'm finding that first week after chemo I'm pretty teary (but I can cry easily before all of this lol). I was pretty knocked out last weekend from chemo, so my first outing finally was to the grocery store mid week. By the time I got into the line, I was pretty fatigued, and sort of mumbled I'm tired. The cashier said she was tired too. For some reason I responded that I was going through chemo, and she stopped and looked at me and said the usual sorry to hear, asked how much I've had, what it was for (all very nice), and then she said she'd pray for me. Which was great, we get folks saying that, BUT....she then said \"what is your name?\" Ok- I think this is exactly what Dara was talking about....all of a sudden I was a person, and I started crying! Then I'm like great I'm crying in the grocery store! She then said \"I'm giving you a hug\", and with a line forming she came around and hugged me. Lesson learned- see the person, not the disease.

You have been busy! Glad to hear you're staying positive and enjoying the company. Tunegrrl- I can imagine being disappointed.... I'm on chemo first as well, but my mass was about 4.5 cm, so I have had some success and it's shrinking, but it's still more than twice as big as yours. I agree with VLH, may have something to do with the size to begin with. The MO told me I won't necessarily see a change each time. I'm getting infusions every 21 days, so after my next one (next week #3 of 6), I'll go get an ultrasound so they can get a good gauge of what's happening. I have a feeling if they're not satisfied, maybe they'd change up the drugs, but that's a guess. Good luck- I hope you can obtain the drug you're wanting!! So the mouth sores....I guess I wasn't really thinking I was getting them (clueless), but now I realize- yes, that's what's happening in mouth! I asked my NP today- soooooo would they be worse if I wasn't icing, or is the icing not working. She looked at me and said \"I don't think it's working\". I'm actually wondering if it's irritating my mouth??? So I'm going to be crazy and not do it Wed and see what happens. She did give me the magic mouthwash prescription. yum.",

First I want to say to Kechla- even though we're not writing right away, definitely thinking of you and prayers to you on your surgery next week! I'm really hoping this finally gets you back on track to your new normal (because God knows we're never normal again). Dara- how frustrating to keep being in pain, I know I definitely have some PTSD so every little thing has my worry flag flying. Lyn- glad you're moving forward and getting the radiation done, and hopefully we all stay with that word DONE lol. Cali- I know I can do more to help myself with the fatigue (oh exercise more? uh lol). It's frustrating for sure, too tired to exercise, but I know that's what the Dr's will tell me to do. Working full time though has got to be exhausting. I know our bodies are still recovering from everything. My counts were better a couple of months back, I think that's why I panicked. I have surgery scheduled for the exchange of the TE's for the \"real fakes\" on the 18th. Pre-op next week and we'll see what they say. I just hope no more complications. Still dealing with my teen and her headaches. She had botox a week ago, Sunday finally a no headache day but then her first day of high school was Monday and we're back up on the pain scale. This is more exhausting to me than anything. Sensitive great hair pic!! All my love ladies- I'm thankful we are 1 year out from dealing with all those chemo side effects!!!!",

Interesting about the vitamin D- it's one thing I still take regularly! i've read a lot over the years about how it helps with immunity, so have been giving to the family for years. The pediatrician told me a couple of years ago that he'd rather my daughter have D over a multi vitamin. JandJ- so sorry about the worries, but glad its ok! Gotta laugh at the Dr's reactions to things....they're so mellow. My NP didn't think the ice chips were working since I have mouth issues each time. I still did it last week, but not as crazy. I'm afraid that if I don't- maybe it'll be even worse?!! I do not ice hands or feet. I get the tingling and like you the MO/NP want to keep an eye on it. I think the NP mentioned B6 too (like your dr- she didn't have a comment on the Glutamine), but she told me to hold off (since I have so much entering my body lol). Super Super exciting that the tumor is shrinking! I get to go and have an ultrasound on Monday. It'll be so different going into the breast center and not \"worrying\" about anything since I've got cancer already lol! I might scare some women? No hair? uh oh. Cali was it you who said people weren't recognizing you? I've learned if I page back, I lose what I type! That's been happening to me for years...even with hair lol.

Teen became moody and didn't feel well, which through her father into grouch mode. Good times lol. To top it off we almost missed getting off the train when we got back home! I went down the wrong stairs and there was no door....next thing we're running lol. I can find humor in it but the rest of them not. Cali always wanted to hit Yellowstone. So many things on my bucket list. Lyn- do you do the manual drainage as well? I'm back in PT. Of course the therapists comment on how horrible my posture is lol. Last week I saw the gal that I primarily saw last summer. She said my arm was bigger than last summer! What! Crap. I don't notice. I get the aches here and there, but I'm trying to be better about nightly drainage and my stretches (thats more for my range of motion that's still not 100%). The therapist I primarily see this time really is making sure I'm doing it right. So far I've gotten a passing grade on it lol. She showed me a quick video of how they used dye so you can see the difference the manual drainage makes immediately in the lymphatic system. I always thought it was a little hokey, but that sold me. Oh and Lyn- I had a Bakers cyst too! I think it might finally be gone on its own. It's been months, so I've stuck with walking and hiking. I need to do more strength exercises. All my love ladies!

Cali- what the heck. Ok I can't believe your daughter is going through cancer stuff, and then they still haven't figured out your pain. You have every right to feel frustrated and scared....feel like the Dr's should do even more due diligence after we've already gone through this crap and like someone said the PTSD. I just went to a memorial for an old boss. My husband and I met working for her when we were in our 20's. I knew she had some kind of cancer, but when I've popped on and off Facebook over the years I assumed it wasn't BC of course since she didn't lose her hair with the chemo that I noticed. She passed about a month ago....seemed to be doing fine and then they found out yep- spread. I believe it was cervical. I looked back on her Facebook page and it was a few months ago that she got an \"all clear\" PET scan. I guess she was house boating the month prior to passing. 69 yrs young...nuts. So we always have that worry in the back of our minds...I know with Kathie she was getting extreme headaches, and a trip to the ER found the tumor in her brain. I still want to know- so was it always there, even through the chemo? I now get when my parents felt pain, that they would jump to the cancer conclusion. Oh hind site.

Dara- definitely smart advice- it seems like each of our MO's has different thoughts on supplements and pain meds. I have been taking fiber, Vitamin D, and acidophilus during my chemo- Dr was fine with all of it, as well as any pain management (Tylenol, Aleve, etc). I was advised to stay away from antioxidants. Dara- my NP had me adding electrolytes for the twitching - so I've been drinking Vitamin Water every day and it's definitely made a difference. She said to watch the watery eyes- using Refresh as a lubricant. I had eye issues before all of this and my eye dr had me using Zadiator (most drug stores have it just a little pricey). Life- I'm on Taxotere (same family as Taxol) along with Carboplatin. I've had 3 of 6 infusions- the neuropathy feelings have actually lessened over time- I don't get anything really in the 1st week- after the cruddy feeling goes away then new side effects happen (I'm every 21 days)- some tingling in hands and arms and legs...but they're minimal.",

DaraB, Caligirl- so glad you're both ok, as well as they others that reacted so strongly. Of course makes me a little more nervous for the next one, but will make sure the nurses are close by! Because of all the reactions everyone has had- I decided to grab the paperwork back out and see what I actually got that first round: Dexamethasone (Steroid), Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Famotidine (Pepcid), Palponosteron (anti-nausea), and those lovely chemo drugs, and home with the \"pod\". I am also to take the steroid starting the day before - by pill, and that goes through \"day 2\". I am so thankful for everyone's frankness - from the allergic reactions, to the dryness in the nether region...please know you are all helping with the posts. DaraB- your posts are great, funny and informative. I'm glad your little pup was ok after all that slurping up of \"stuff\"- flipping dogs! Fireheart43, VLH, JandJmom, kenzielulu- I love the funny posts, the wardrobe you and others are wearing....the \"danger I'm being poisoned\" (maybe THAT should be a shirt!)....thanks for making me smile (and I know others as well!). Kacey- I hope you're feeling better and have had a chance to talk to your Dr. Lisbeth- thanks for your frankness, and your funny but frustrating comments about your husband's illness! Sometimes you just want to spray lysol everywhere and make a lysol bubble around yourself! CandyHB- So hope your son can listen to you with the smoking....even the neighbors smoking briefly in the backyard is irritating more now as my sensitivity is lower. tishabe- I think it's sweet your 19 yr old is calling so much....I agree with another poster, homesick mixed with worry. Esp if you ended up in the hospital! I hope my 13 year old at least calls when she leaves home in a few years! Hope floats- thanks for keeping it real regarding how we feel, and what's really happening. Hope you're doing well now. You inspired me to keep exposure down, and fluids up. Arlenew- I love that quote! I think I may have to use that My nurse did say that anything that melts is \"fluid\"- so even ice cream! Get creative! Regarding blood draws- I had had one right before my first infusion, but the nurse said she would be doing 1st thing on future treatments. The dog is fine, of course. Lots of love to you all....thank you for being here with me!!",

Lisbeth- mine daughter seems fine.....I think because I just told her- they're going to kill it first, then take it all out, and then we will move on like we always do. She's had heath issues herself- at the age of 5 she was hospitalized for Guillain-Barre Syndrome (something to google in your down time- haha). It was very scary, as we had of course never heard of it. She's fully recovered from that thankfully. She's had daily headaches now for the last 2 years...scary to watch your child go in for a brain MRI/MRA, cat scans, etc. But they're manageable now even though no direct answer. And then she's watched her GMA go through multiple health issues, and watch me deal with them....so I honestly am just pissed (oops- is that a rant word?!) that she has to deal with something else....so trying to keep as much normal as I can while being straight forward with her. I love Hopefloats suggestion for your sister too Lisbeth! I was kind of thinking something along those same lines! Seq24- I read that rant board, and now I just feel lucky so far to not have much stupidity thrown my way yet. I loved the video that was attached too. It seems like people need to try and \"help\"?? Why do you \"have\" to go to a in person support group. That would not work for me. Also- I think everyone here is more free to express things...would we sit around and talk about how our privates are drying out and what to do?!! Doubt it! I learned a long time ago, when my dad passed away, that people are naive, and say stupid things. So my comment has always been is I hope you are lucky enough to stay this naive! People can't deal, they don't know what to say- and those of us that have dealt with crap know there isn't anything \"correct\" to say. My word for everything is it SUCKS...and that just fits right into this diagnosis as well. I made it clear to people after my crying episode in front of others, that look- basically don't pity me (I was nicer than that)- flip me off- I'd be much happier with the finger than that poor you hug.",

I guess I'm expecting maybe more than I should at 2 weeks post op. I have some swelling near the lymph node and went to see the surgeon this am (you know you'd hit the weekend and then something would happen!).....she told me to basically stop using that arm - not dangerous, but the fluid \"should\" resolve itself back into the body. If not a needle to drain it, but then I have expanders so then that would increase the risk of infection. If I wait too long to drain then it can create scar tissue which may mean more draining times, which means more chances of infection. Geez....give me an answer lol. So we're waiting a week to see if I can lower the usage and have it go down. Did you follow that lol?!!

I have a 13 yr old daughter, and totally understand trying to keep their life normal as possible. Whole thing stinks! Hope you're starting to feel better. It took me over a week to feel more normal again.",

From what I remember reading some did better on just the Taxol, while others had uncomfortable side effects. It really was a variety, but hopefully some of them will see your question and give you a better idea of their experience. Thanks so much for the feedback on the BMX! I really appreciate it!! Trying to be a sponge right now! Dara- I just had read about the lights out in Riverside, though about a train ride out to see it, but doubt that will happen now before xmas. Trying to get organized, cleaned up house, decorated, etc before chemo tomorrow. Hope everyone is doing well. I'm still having fatigue now and either some neuropathy or achiness, so wild with chemo again tomorrow. I will keep you all posted on my weekend lol. Looking forward to \"hair talk\" with you all. Oh- another question actually.... I forgot to ask my MO, but wonder when the immunity is back after your last chemo? Anyone get any feedback on that? Thanks!!",

Last year at this time, I was with my mom daily on hospice--- cancer wasn't even in my mind at that time (but was growing quickly little did I know). I think we are constantly trying to figure out why anything happens to us now including the tears! Barbara I love what you wrote about it, I guess we just have to be ok with it and maybe not try and figure out \"why\"?? VLH and Barbara- hang in there....this process is long, and I feel like any little bump is just frustrating for me, yours are more than little. I finally got my first \"fill\" last week, and no issues there, he's conservative I think with just 60cc fills (I sound so smart, but really have no idea what I'm talking about lol). He ok'd me for PT and to exercise- so I've walked and done a couple of slower hikes. PT was really to get range of motion back and education on lymphedema. Well, the lady measured my fingers, hands, and several spots on my arms. My cancer/lymph node/ and what is my non-dominant arm - is slightly larger! ERRR. I would have never considered that I was having any swelling, so I'm thankful I got in. So she knew I had a sleeve already from my blood clot, and said I need to wear it daily again (no!), showed me some manual drainage moves and a couple of stretching exercises. Me- \"so how long should PT be for me?\"- PT \"oh twice a week for about 3 months\". what?!!! Geez....more appts- who's sick of appts?!!! Me lol. Between me and my daughter, it's non-stop, but it will continue. If you had even 1 lymph node removed, make sure you're educating yourself on lymphedema....it can happen at any time to any of us. Ok....enjoy your day ladies!!",

My KI is high like yours- 90%, I didn't get that at first, took months for me to understand thats why I did chemo first, and the aggressiveness. But thanks for posting the pictures!! It IS a different perspective knowing she's 6 mos old \"already\"!! Wow- and you look great too! Both put a smile on my face!! I've been still dealing with my teen daughter who has chronic daily headaches, and now got a mild concussion Sunday night. It feels like it's one thing after another, and Monday when I was just drained from all the appointments I turned on the TV to hear about the Manchester bombing. Ok....this isn't so bad. Then yesterday, since I couldn't go to work once again because my daughter was home, I decided to go for a walk with a friend. I sat at the light waiting to exit my neighborhood, and I learned from my job to wait a couple of seconds and scan the intersection before proceeding. So I did that.....but continued to scan it as I was going through. There was a car traveling at a high speed not slowing down. I hit the brakes and my horn, and the older gentleman hit his brakes finally at the line. The cars weren't near each other, but boy he would have T-boned me and at that speed I don't think I'd be here. How fast life can change and so I'll be thankful for my man haircut right now and keep moving forward. Love you to all!",

Its been totally tender still, so I have this stubble, with areas of baldness and some scaley patches I guess. My girlfriend/hairdresser had me get special shampoo that should help with the scalp. So I feel fine about it, but I don't have to look at it! Where's that shiny smooth bald head? Assuming the stubble will fall out? Tomorrow is treatment #2. So feel good today, esp on the steroids, but know the crappy feeling coming soon. Candy- I was actually surprised i didn't lay in bed. My NP told me not to lol. But I did do a lot of laying around, and probably would have been more comfortable. I was like Kechla where by day 10 I was starting to feel way better, but still hit the bed at night by 8/830. Last few days I haven't been as tired, but I'm on a 21 day cycle? I'm opposite of Dara- I am more tired in the am, then finally by lunch can get up and do something. I would get my daughter off to school by 8, and then come back home and sit for hours. Elizabeth- glad all is well for you....long drug process so your port makes sense! Dara you are always our go to for info! Dang it on the brows! I will definitely be watching the video. I love all the tips on the ACS class, I will try and see if we have one. We'll need pics of your creations from the weekend! Dara- I have eye issues before all of this, and the twitching is so annoying. So far not too bad after 1 round. I'll keep you posted later this week. Caligirl- lets hope your friend is off! Please keep us posted. Annie- thanks for bringing some fun and excitement to our group! Being a mom, it puts a smile on my face hearing about the baby! Keep it coming, and of course I know you have no choice, but think we all admire your strength with this whammy life has dealt you. Can you stay home and not work so we don't feel like total slackers? LOL munibroker- I have heard people doing that cold booties, etc. I haven't really researched the results (if it helps or not). I did suck on ice chips for the mouth sores, but I'd be way too cold for that. My mom got neuropathy on her feet from colon cancer chemo treatment. It was numb, and honestly came and went until she passed. So I'm a little more aware of my \"tingling\" and will keep an eye on it plus get in the MO's ear if it gets going more. ocmdcat- welcome! Sorry you feel like crud. Seems like no time to recover really? This is a great group of ladies, so fire away! If you feel up to you and want to share, you can add your treatment to the profile section on here (so we don't ask you multiple times)- but get staying private by all means. Sounds like you're nearing the end though?!! Keep me entertained this week ladies- I'm sure by the weekend I won't be typing this much lol.",

Dara- let us know how your scans turned out etc. I've been riding the wave of teenage girl hormones...not all her fault lol, but it's exhausting. She's going to start going to a new therapist, so I met with the woman last week. About 45 min in I was like \"oh yah, I had BC last year\" lol...she was like yeah just a side note. I think she wants to talk to me about my issues, but I told her cancer was way easier than dealing with the ups and downs and health of my kid! I don't have any scans....just the routine blood work. Like some of you have mentioned, I realize I may need to do more reconstruction to get things back to \"normal\". I don't want to, and we just wait and see how things \"settle\" into next year. I do know unless the laws change, etc that if I need to replace implants 10 years down the line, it's covered all under this BC diagnosis.",

Hang in there, please keep us posted on what the Dr says for you. jandjmom- thanks for the info on the Benadryl and Melatonin.....Dara and Cali and JandJ let us know how you're doing when you're up for it. Jiffrig- I still have 4 more rounds to go.....and some of us move from one drug to another, so we may be riding this together for a while. Then a few of us still move onto surgery and/radiation. Maybe we can still keep this group?! I love the support I get here, and would want everyone's feedback once I'm into the surgery process too! I'm about 7 days post chemo #2. I have less chemo fog, but I guess I'm still surprised at the nausea and fatigue. I'm not a napper, and went out yesterday to take my daughter to the Dr, and hit a couple of errands, and I was DONE. So much for my thoughts on getting exercise in! I also get the random tingling. Oh and my tongue was burning last night when I drank sparkling water. I have one of those geographic tongues, so I think the chemo just tears it up. Wishing everyone a nice day today.....Elizabeth thinking of you too....patiently waiting for your post that you're out of the hospital!",

Lyn- I didn't even know they had lymphedema pumps...I realized I've been totally slacking on the manual drainage. I think my arm is fine, but who knows so I need to get back on track with that. MO said that she's just going to monitor my blood counts a little closer (every 2 mos right now)- thinks low counts are still residual issues from chemo thanks for asking. Also no scans or anything for me- just checking my skin, seeing how I'm feeling and I'll do an MRI on my fake boobs in January. I agree with the dogs! I will always be grateful for mine and never forget her laying next to the bed for hours and hours during chemo- me worried she needed to eat and go to the bathroom but too weak to holler to someone to take care of her lol. Mine is 6, has had 2 knee surgeries (before my cancer) and now has 2 heart issues. I'm happy she's made it to 6, and hoping she can stay healthy enough for her 7th bday in April :) I get the how to react to people. Everyone asks how I'm doing. I don't want to be one of those people that all they talk about is cancer. I remember thinking that before all of this. Everyone wants you to move back along with your life, but you don't feel the same. Here's a classic example- one of my daughter's teachers was diagnosed with early stage BC, and went for the BMX. it was DCIS I believe so no chemo or radiation because of the aggressive surgery. I would text her to check in. Texted her like a week or so ago. She's been back at work for a month and literally wrote \"I almost feel like nothing happened, back to normal\". Ok what?! LOL....so it definitely made me realize all of our other treatments and complications have wreaked havoc on our bodies. Annie- I was just speechless when I read your post, it's beyond frustrating that this is happening. You and your family have been through enough! I'm thankful you shared....please lean on us --- we are here for support and won't leave you. Let's get that crap out of you once and for all. I'm so sorry. You're not the only one- not me but another one of our friends from here had a reoccurrence as well but I think at this point needs to just focus on life and hasn't been on the BC website at all. Thank you for continuing to lift our spirits with beautiful Josie!! You have been an inspiration --- all the crap you have gone through and now continue to go through keep a lot of us motivated and moving forward....thank you. Kechla- thank you for sharing your story, it's so appreciated. I love the pic and story of the gingerbread house! Is that your daughter? Happy your pup is doing well. Cali- PLEASE keep us posted on both of you. This is getting ridiculous. Can you push to get in sooner? I can't believe that they can't make this a priority- its not unusual to do both at the same time- that used to be my \"regular\" appt every year. So many prayers out to this BC family here....all my love ladies.  ",

I'm just trying to bump my work hours back up (its only a part time job, 1000 hours a year, but with everything not close), while driving the 15 year old around. I can't believe the miles on my car. She's doing volleyball and is in the high school musical this year, so enjoying for the most part. I had to make an expensive decision for our kitten last week. He had a urinary blockage and it was emergency surgery or put him down. We did the surgery and so far he's doing pretty well. I haven't had a cat since I was a kid, so it's all new again lol. Had to change his diet (no dry). Should be staying in town for Easter. Wishing all of you a wonder week!",

I wasn't happy with my scalp, but once I got some hair on it, I started ditching the beanies (never did wigs or really scarves unless it was hot). I still will wear a beanie if it's cold....my ears get cold easily! I think it's really just sad someone would skip a family event just based their hair, but we all do what we need to do. Dara- I would go out with your head of hair! I know people try and figure out why my hair is short lol. Let them wonder- do I want it like this? I'm ballsy? Sure- it's my only time to be \"ballsy\" --- I would never had cut my hair this short, so why not embrace trying something different for once. Life is too short! I colored my hair myself. I looked at that Herbatin, but something turned me off- I don't think it came with the applicator etc. So I just went back to Target and got a box. My daughter really wanted me to do a fun color, but I didn't want to use a permanent color of purple lol. So just went brown. It has some copper. So that's my hair story. Embrace it! I honestly just don't care what others think. If I make you uncomfortable or it's a reminder of cancer, good. What we went through and still go through sucks. I think people think we have surgery, chemo, radiation, etc and then poof we're better. Not really. Ok there's my soapbox lol. Dara I'm on Tamoxifen. Once in a while i feel some pangs, not sure if it's the meds. If I stay in menopause she may switch me to something else....like an AI? geez...looking at your story not sure if i want to switch now lol. IT band- I've had that years ago. Keep with the PT, should help. Just need to be aware that it's a hip issue- your hip is tight, that band goes from your hip to your knee from my understanding. When I was running I learned to stretch my hip and I haven't had an issue since. So you CAN get rid of that!!",

Ok- so leave you on a funny note- went to the PS yesterday for my last fill, but I wasn't sure if he would do it as I noticed one side is bigger than the other (and don't we always just jump right to something is wrong lol). So first he asks me \"how big do you want to be\"? Umm...I don't know! You're the expert. He looks at my file, sees how many cc's I have and he says one more. Ok lol. He said not to over analyze the expanders- it'll make me crazy. LOL- my husband says I'm am crazy so....

Kacey- I'm starting chemo on my daughters first day of school as well- her dad took the day off to take her, and I'll head over for the chemo. My cousin, who battled this 9 years ago at the age of 47 (I'm 49- on the verge of turning 50), told me up front \"you'll learn who your real friends are\". She said that there are friends she hasn't talked to now since the day she told them. Just can't handle it? I got my Nuelesta delivering tomorrow- so hopefully that doesn't get messed up! I put all my med reminders on my online calendar. Hopefully I can get some groceries today and focus on what to bring from everyones suggestions. I know I want a blanket, asked the office if they supply ice chips, and I'll bring water, drink and some pretzels or something?? I may listen to some podcasts- not sure how focused i'll be on a movie. KZ1966- still working on it! Erdie - thanks for all of the tips!! I will be looking those up later. I haven't started chemo yet, but looking back on my paperwork the NP dais that the Decadron can cause a flushed face and neck. The Taxotere can cause skin rashes, which it says the Decadron is suppose to help with, but the NP said also to use hydrocortisone cream. jandjmom- I chopped my long hair off last week. I cried walking into the salon (reality hitting) and then walking out- on the way out it was more about the support I was receiving from my friends (one that cut my hair, and surprise visit from another). I can't scroll back far enough- but I never addressed the BC sister that wasn't doing treatment as she's taking care of her husband. I just spent basically the last 4 years taking care of my mom, who passed away in April from dementia (but- she had breast cancer twice, colon cancer, a stroke so- hospice was like- who knows what's really going on in her body). It's a whole road that is difficult to navigate, and I can't imagine with your own health concerns. My thoughts are with you in the journey. I found Silverado Care has THE best standards when it comes to memory care. They can be a great resource. The oncologist office just called to try and change my appt...no! lol. Still set for Wed.

She had a successful surgery, no signs in her lymph nodes and did radiation. In Sept she started getting headaches, and long story short- it was a brain tumor- metastasized. They successfully got it all, and she was being monitored. Literally 1 month ago, she was having leg pain and thought it was a pinched nerve. On 1/29, after a couple of MRI's she was told there were spots again on the brain and on her spine. 2 weeks later she's gone. She was in some pain, quite a bit at points, so I'm glad she's at peace.

Rented a condo, everyone had their own space, trolley that takes you around town right outside the complex and a starbucks my daughter walked to daily lol. Made it great for all. No other summer plans besides working, daughter will start volleyball and is doing a online spanish class right now.",

Crazy how it's- hey- don't feel to0 bad, and each day feeling worse- so curious if this is the bottom and i'll swing back out the other side. Definitely could be worse. Enjoy your day!",

I think the constipation just added to other issues like nausea but doing better. I don't like taking pills for whatever, but I'm doing it- it's that balance of \"senokot\", now Zofran? I woke up with a white coating on my tongue. I did really well with washing my mouth out the first few days- cut back a bit yesterday. Took my temp (fine) this am and called the Dr's office- he said keep rinsing (he said warm salt water or mouthwash). I seem to like the Biotine the best but trying to mix it up. Drank a cup of coffee and that \"burned\" it off a bit lol. Aches aren't as bad today- for those of you that haven't experienced it- it's a weird feeling- tingly, sharp, achy....so weird trying to figure out what the body is doing. So I'm hanging in there- looking forward to feeling better soon. I was bummed at first that my bad days might hit the weekend with the family, but realize it's better- I don't have to try and drive the kid to school etc (I do have offers if needed). Thinking of you all....",

I know how quickly our minds go sideways, and you've already had to deal with multiple diagnosis! Dara- I felt the same after chemo, felt like something stupid with my arm swelling and getting whatever it was (I can't remember the name haha). It felt harder than chemo at the time- kept me down more. I think with the chemo we learned how to ride the good and bad days so to speak...when something puts you down longer its frustrating. Let's see...last week the kid \"wasn't feeling well\". Of course it hit the day after we raved with the neurologist how well she was doing lol. She stayed home from school- part of me knew I could have pushed her but it was one of those whatevers. Then she started getting a rash. What the....then I remembered rushing her to the Dr as a kid- rash on her arms....googled again what she had back then- slap cheek. A virus. Well, now I feel like crap. No rash, but wonder if it's the same virus. Feel bad because I always question if she's just being a teen, but she was legit not feeling well. I feel like each of us just want to live life a bit, and keep getting knocked back. Some much more than others for sure. ",

It's hard, but it's so interesting how this hits, and has built up. In a way- even though I feel bad, it's so interesting in a weird way, I'm amazed I'm still feeling crappy lol. I made it to the couch, and that's progress! Usually by the Monday afterwards, I'm tired, but back on track....so the side effects have extended both ways. Dara- can't win sometimes! You're finally back on track, and then hubby. Eesh! Elizabeth, yes- stay healthy my friend! My daughter had a sore throat, so I was staying away from her more too. No plans for Thanksgiving- but we're not big Thanksgiving folks...we usually camp in the desert, which is always so relaxing...everything in throw away pans, around people I want to be around lol. So we missed it this year. I'm also realizing I have to miss another concert. I had tickets for the Brian Setzer Orchestra out at Penchenga in Dec. Realized I'll be bouncing back even slower on the last round, so better just plan to get rid of them. It's such a fun Christmas show....I pulled the trigger and bought the tickets, which wasn't like me lol....so I can do it again I guess next year. I look forward to a year from now and we all are celebrating a year out from this crap! I bounced on an \"old\" chemo board, and the ladies were talking about 6 years out....we can be those ladies! I do still think of WenchLori, Marlene...some of the others that posted regularly.....I really hope that no news is great news for them and they're moving on!",

Glad everyone seems to be off to a good start :) I echo if anyone else is reading please just say Hi- we'd love to hear how everyone is doing. Annie- always thinking of you. Ok well I never actually think/talk about survivor anniversary. I guess I just can't wrap my head around that. Funny- Kathie and I used to talk about that. Those questions like \"are you in remission\", \"you're cancer free right?\". Kathie said she'd say \"that's what they tell me\" lol. So maybe it's a mental block for me, but I haven't used the term survivor. I just say I was diagnosed 2 years ago, or finished chemo 2 years ago or whatever. Not the answer you were looking for lol. I started Arimedex right before Christmas, switching from Tamoxifen since I'm confirmed to be menopausal. Just like Tamoxifen, I was nervous to switch because of the unknown side effects. The MO's NP told me I didn't need claritin for joint pain (love how they think you won't experience anything lol). But I decided to just take it anyways- whats it going to hurt. So far doing ok. First day I was all emotional...crying for no reason. Popped onto the AI boards here and posted it. Gotta love the BC sisters that responded- doubt its the medicine that fast- maybe its the anxiety about taking the medicine lol. Yep probably right. Side note- right before Christmas I decided to take my daughter to a recommended acupuncturist that wasn't covered by our insurance. 2 years ago, 2 of her Dr's recommended this woman- worked a lot with pediatrics and also adults. She wasn't covered, so we tried someone that was for Shea's headaches and it didn't do anything. The last few months have been so bad. She did take 1 dose of a newly approved medication but didn't seem to respond to that. So I felt like we needed to re-visit what we tried years ago and see if she responded now. Time to cough up $$ if needed. Well, long story short, this acupuncturist it turns out has treated 10 kids over the years like Shea. Shea had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (something for you to google lol) when she was 5. In the hospital they're given IVIG to stop the attack. This Dr has seen 10 kids like Shea that end up with chronic headaches. She looked at Shea and said I think I can help you but you'll need to be patient. I started crying lol. Shea actually walked out shocked as her headache had actually gone down. So we are hopeful!",

Honestly I probably could have sat on the couch all day, but knew it would be good to get out. So the family went down for just an hour or so. Just breathing in that salt air and hearing the waves and feeling the sun- wow- I could feel the difference even in my attitude and thought process. It felt healing. I think I need to remember to look for those things when I'm dwelling in those dark moments.....whatever that is for each of us.....we need to push to go there when we can. Another thing- I have a Mastiff named Daisy....she is by my side, and is a comfort. But she has connected me to \"other Mastiff Moms\" on Instagram- and a couple of them are either going through BC, or have. One is 10 years out from BC....diagnosed at 39. She reminded me yesterday that she got through it, with small kids- and life can/will be good again. 10 years ladies....we can do this. (remind me of this in Dec when I feel crappy again lol).

I had a chuckle- I remember doing those \"birthday parties\" but they were really adult BBQ's lol. Kelly/Kechla- I still just grinning about your tailbone. I'm so glad to have some \"good news\" posted here! Let's keep that rolling! Lyn/Cali- Ok yeah diet blah! Lyn- I'm like you- once I have to cut something out, all I do is focus on food. So I agree- I try to eat more of the healthy and try to just limit or pick my sweets a little better. Oh and right now I'm addicted to salty pretzels lol. I've been listening to a book on Audible (I'm horrible at actually reading) called Genius Foods. It's more about brain health (my mom had dementia). Lyn- I could never do this full board lol, basically cut out all the good stuff! BUT....I'm doing what you said- I'm taking away what TO eat and maybe cut back on the other stuff of make better choices. For example- one of the genius foods for your brain is olive oil. So on my salads I'm feeling good about using that with balsamic. Healthy fats are great for your brain I guess (avo, eggs)- so making some slight shifts that way. Saw the nurse practitioner yesterday at the MO's office. I had my blood draw the previous week, I thought for sure the white cell count would stay low or be lower since I hadn't felt good LOL....nope- it was actually in the normal range for once! Go figure- so who knows what I had if anything. OH...loved this- MO's office still has you fill out the symptoms sheet- pain, fatigue, stomach issues- same sheet as I completed with chemo. So one thing I circled was fatigue. She was like- ok that's the menopause. Oh really? Then she said \"and that little pill we give you doesn't help\". LOL...ok thanks for that. She told me to exercise more. ha! Ok...seems to be \"the\" answer. Have a great rest of the week.....like you all have said- thinking of our other friends here....if you read this, please check in- don't feel like you have to respond to anything we've written. I'd love to hear how everyone is doing. *** reminded me- daughter is feeling better, rash is gone. Headache increased but the acupuncturist said the barometer is affecting everyone this week.

Going in today to get compression sleeve (which is funny- same place I have to go to next week for mastectomy bra fitting, but no way I want to try and do that now with my arm).

I think we're all on the same page that we give everyone grace trying to keep up with our thread- but it's been great. So sorry about your nausea! They prescribed Zofran and another med (can't remember) to alternate if I have issues. Someone also helpfully commented that the Zofran can constipate, and so I confirmed that with the NP and she said start with the other- gee thanks lol. I have the same road, but different meds- chemo first, surgery, then possible radiation (meet next week with the RO). Regarding your profile- if you go the top right of the page, you'll click on \"my profile\". You'll see 4 tabs, and one is diagnosis and the other is treatment. It's weird though- it says \"potential treatment\" so I had added surgery, but when it pops up here- it looks like I already had it, so I went back and deleted! Hope that helps.... Off to my follow up with the NP today and then right over to genetic counseling appt. Wishing you all well.....",

I haven't heard anything about the Glutamine. Oh- I had my follow up yesterday with the NP, but to my happy surprise my MO walked in! I just love her lol- I think almost everyone falls in love with their oncologist! She was awesome, decided since I had messaged her some questions that she'd come in and answer them herself. Ok! She did examine and measure my mass (it's not one tumor- there were like several on top of each other- so they call it one mass)...she feels it has shrunk a bit after that first treatment (question one answered- how do you know this is working?!). She cautioned that won't necessarily happen each time, but hey- I'll take it. She let me know after the 3rd treatment I'll get an ultrasound so they can see what's happening. She felt I was tolerating the chemo well, she was super positive which is nice. I did ask her if I was considered triple negative- no. I had a mild to moderate hit on the progesterone (I didn't know if it was high enough to \"count\")- so not triple. I had a question about why this chemo regimen. Because I have a lot of negativity (my words not hers lol), and I had a high KI67, she chose these drugs. She wanted to stay away from the Adriamycin because of some of the side affects, but \"keeping it in her back pocket\" in case she needs it. I also met with the genetic counseling and did the test. My mom had done the testing/counseling in 2012, but they've added so many new things to the panel it's good for me to do (esp since I have a 13 year old girl). Next treatment in a week. I'm feeling like KZ1966- my scalp hurts. Wishing everyone a great day......",

I saw the oncologist and the breast surgeon in December...both examine and primarily are looking at my skin making sure there's nothing popping up. The team where I go recommends I get an MRI every 1-2 years, so I'm going next week. Whatever it takes. VLH- My arm has been fine, I've been really slacking doing the manual drainage, so I got back on that this week. I fly this weekend from So Cal to Nor Cal so short flight, but got a new sleeve and she said to wear it 2 hours prior, and then 2 hours after (and of course on the plane). Cali- please check in if you can? Oh hair- just had my mop cleaned up....glad it's there of course lol.",

Feel like I'm always complaining about it too lol. Had a lady exam on Friday and they gave me tdap vaccine. Went to work, but by friday evening my throat was bugging me and now I'm back to feeling am I fighting something or is it the allergies I \"don't have\" (according to the allergist lol). I had blood draw last week for my MO appt this Wed so we'll see what they say. I'm trying to walk a bit more, but after work and running the child around I'm spent. I am sitting here thinking of all the things I really should be doing lol, but again no energy. Oh- if anyone is on Instagram, or I also found her on Facebook- here's a woman that's very inspiring. Her name is Emilee Garfield - https://www.facebook.com/emilee.garfield https://www.instagram.com/cancersavedmylife/ (she also has a website. You can read her story, she's a cancer survivor, and a fitness instructor. She started last week videos on both Facebook and instagram of ways to get moving for those of us that can't as well. She also has some uplifting videos of her working with an older gentleman and the creative ways she's getting him to move and stay agile. She's \"real\" about things too, which is a nice balance. Anyways- if you have time check her out. I started doing some of her moves in the beginning of the week, and I need to do a couple of more to catch up but it's nice to have some motivation and ideas on what to do to gain my strength back. We are on the final stretch to the musical....my daughter's rehearsals will go to 8 and 9 pm this week! The musical is Legally Blonde, so should be a fun one. Kitten is doing well, but I didn't have any clue how hard it is to get a cat to eat! I ran into 2 other \"cat parents\" at the pet food store last week who have gone through it too.....so still working on that part but think he's doing well (thanks for asking!!). My work is only hard to increase hours because I have to cart the daughter around. I was going to work this weekend but with me feeling eh I thought I better not (I'm on the public buses so it's just too much exposure sometimes). I'm still \"dreaming\" of travel :)  ",

I got behind again, and I'm not totally up to date but wanted to pop on and say \"I'm here!\" Vicki- looking forward to hearing good news after your surgery....hope all went smoothly. Dara- feeling good this week...it's crazy to go from in bed to having the ability to take walks, and I'm popping back into work today (went on Tuesday). Work is not taxing, and it's good for me to stay in touch. My eyes water constantly with our dry weather out here, and some tingling and heartburn but I can't complain. I'll do that in a week lol. I'm glad radiation is going smoothly so far for you!! Jiffrig- thats so funny your Dr said to stay off the boards...I have already looked at the side effects of those drugs and wondering what she'll end up putting me on!! I was going to say- another reason I wanted to stay in touch with you all as I'm assuming a lot of us will end up on something. Smile- thanks for your kind thoughts- let me know if you have any surgery advice! JandJ- boy do I feel you! I love your line \"my spirit revolts\". It was hard to feel bad and \"know\" in my head it gets better, but it sure doesn't feel like that as you're going through the crap. I was pretty down that weekend, very teary and thinking the same thing- this better not get worse with the next two. It is hard as I start feeling more \"normal\", it just means it's closer to another treatment. I'm so thankful your MRI came back ok. I'm so NOT liking all of this cancer that comes back. I know not to focus on it, but it seems like it's constantly a reminder. I feel like I should get scanned for everything! Ok gotta get ready for getting the kid to school and me to work. Have a great day everyone.....",

Dara- I took my husbands beard trimmer to my head. I have those willy nilly stray gray hairs all over!! Part of me sees some fuzz as well, but who knows. Then I get the short lived \"why is my hair growing?!\" worry worry. We both have had Taxotere and I'm just so \"happy\" to see the commercials about permanent hair loss intermingled with the Neulasta and finally over- political commercials!! Enough already. Just want it to grow back. I have a cousin- 9 years out from BC (she was 47 at diagnosis).....had to go in for a shot yesterday (for a side effect from cancer med she's taking). She was actually getting it done where she got her infusions. She said she started tearing up. It was good when the nurse said \"what are you here for\" and she said \"a shot\", and the nurse replied \"whiskey or tequila\". Thank God for the nurses/Dr's that can bring you out of it. I get now, what she described as the dragon in the corner.....stupid cancer........can still affect you even when you're healthy and years post treatment.",

I'm already confused as to what's leftover chemo, for me- related to blood clot and just lack of exercise. I can't imagine adding radiation and hormones on top- how can we keep it straight?!! It's gotta be our body reacting to the constant barrage of stuff happening to it! Elizabeth- if it wasn't raining this week here (ok- i COULD walk in the rain)- I'd try and get out, but even going up and down the stairs with laundry makes me tired. I'm getting more out of shape when I need to get in better shape before surgery. Dara- what are you making in the pottery class?? Kechla- so glad to see your post- hate the idea of lymphedema- I got a compression sleeve for the blood clot and talked to the woman fitting it a little about that. I know it's something I will need to be aware of but good to know about the exercise encouragement. I'd like to get further educated and I think my hosp has something I can go to, need to follow up. Lyn- are you still going through chemo? I agree- I'd laugh at the fact I'd be so tired after doing what would be \"nothing\" before. Cali- keep us posted- on top of your stuff and healing, those are not fun exams! I feel like I'm trying to test to avoid anything else!! Arm is itchy and the vein was hard last night. Weirdest thing, but pain is better so I'll take that. I also went to another genetics counseling appt. My mom had colon cancer (after 2 BC's), and I read they can do counseling/testing for it- got approved for a counseling so went for it. Same genetic counselor so she had my history. Basically- not enough \"history\" to make it necessary for gene testing on the colon gene(s). Funny- I remember them saying that with me after my mom's breast cancer 10 years ago lol. I've only had two pre-cancerous polyps- and I'd need like 10 - no thanks. We did talk more about my BC gene testing as I've got a variance on one (PALB2)- so it means they don't know yet if it's a mutation. If it does end up being positive- my risk goes up for Ovarian and Pancreatic cancers- I'd have ovaries/tubes removed. Good times lol. It could take months to years for them to figure it out so another waiting game. I can't thank you all enough for staying here! I hope others pop on once in a while as well. I know sometimes it's hard to read and then try and post. If anyone is lurking say hi ;) I've come to appreciate this board the most.",

I've been more dealing with the teen's health- migraines still. Trying to get her on one of the newly approved FDA drugs, but the first one we looked at would have been $600 a month out of pocket. Think we found a more reasonable one just waiting on approval.

I'm on the generic, and I've been on the AI boards and follow one of them. My NP said I didn't need to take claritin, but started doing it anyways- seems to be what folks do to help with the joint pain and what we did with Nuelesta so worked that into my pills.

Can't seem to get my referral into that infectious disease office so i can make an appt. See the BS tomorrow. One thing the PS said was that there might be some fluid in the area again. He said if there's fluid then it won't go away. Didn't realize that, ok. Also a nurse asked him about the whole situation. He said it's from the lymph node surgery and the lymphatic system not moving the bacteria and junk out. He said it becomes a \"party\" in there. LOL....interesting.",

It's amazing honestly to be a part of a group of women that are 2 years out now from that crap. I remember wondering how it would feel to have it behind me, and appreciated those that were doing well later, popping in on us and encouraging us. Elizabeth so great to see you and hear of all of your adventures! Helps encourage me to get out and enjoy life. I'm still bad about pulling the trigger on things. Lyn- like you I think of Annie (and so many of our original sisters) and wonder how she's doing. Annie we are all thinking of you!! My lymphedema is very slight I would say....can't see it but they can feel it and measure the difference. That reminds me I haven't been doing my drainage lately lol. oops. i had a great gal that was really good and making sure i got the technique down. It's good for anyone to know that a simple massage basically can move the lymph system quickly and more efficiently. I had another colonoscopy on Monday. i had pushed for it as my last one was right before chemo, and honestly I had been more worried about colon cancer the last few years then breast (my mom had both). I was a polyp farmer and even have my first tattoo on my colon haha (TMI). The GI Dr was like oh we can wait until 2020, me- uh no! I just had cancer buddy....I think we should check and see what's up in there. Well the crazy, but great news (besides losing 2 days of my life with that prep lol) is that no, I repeat no polyps! Even my Dr said \"he was surprised\". Of course I want to know why- what made the difference? Did having chemo benefit that? Or was it cutting back on alcohol over the past couple of years? I don't know, picking my brain as I'd like that trend to continue. It was weird though...I remember telling the nurses 2 years ago that I was about to start chemo. They encouraged me and said when they saw me again it would be over. I also thought- man, I hadn't even \"met\" Kathie yet, and now 2 years later she was in my life daily and then gone. Life is such a roller coaster. Hope everyone has a great weekend....lots of love and hugs. Dara- hope you're well. Cali- think this should be a cooler weekend!",

One thing I said was hey- I had a blood clot already and my mom had a stroke (lol). My MO was like- were you ever on birth control pill? Yes...well that's a potential side effect with the clotting there and you did fine lol. I did laugh that it never even crossed my mind when I took the pill. I have done well on the Tamoxifen so I think thats why I don't want to mess with it. She made it sound like if I had the bad joint pain, then after a few weeks (I'm hoping not longer) she'd move me back. You just get a higher % of success rate with the AI after menopause, and it has less issues than the Tamoxifen. I just feel like everyone complains more about AI's. So I should be exercising right now....sunny, I'm out of shape- husband is off today and just went for a bike ride. Nope- just ate 2 chocolates, on the couch under a blanket and just finished watching a Real Housewives lol. Thanks Lyn....and thanks for keeping us laughing and keeping this going. I need a hobby- anyone playing that new craze- Pickleball? Also you know I was looking at those Dragon Boats but never have pursued..... they even have the BC teams I guess. ",

I am so sorry for all your families have been going through! 2019 has to be better. I'm with you...I'm sick of \"Jodie has metastatic breast cancer\" commercials and that nuelesta continues to come up! Maybe I watch too much TV lol. So has anyone watched Marie Kondo on Netflix...the new rage in cleaning/organizing?! I thought of it when you said you're re-organizing a craft room! I watched the show, she's adorable lol. I'm a horrible reader so I downloaded the audible app and listened to her first book (I think it was the first one) while I did my sporadic walking. I'm ready to try it. I don't secretly hoard but still would like less stuff. I think the biggest issue is the photos and associated papers, but she has you do that last. My daughter made it through her first full week of school, on time. Small goals. OH but get this...her luck I tell you. She was walking at school, and felt something crawling on her arm. She thought...no I'm just imagining something underneath my long sleeve shirt. Then the stinger went in. She said she was with 2 guy friends so she said \"I'll be right back\" and went into the bathroom. Took her shirt off and shook it and the bee flew out! She always seems to have a decent allergic reaction so now she's on antibiotics...arm was really swollen and red. Never ending right?!! Happy Weekend Ladies!!",

Oh- as she was doing it, and we were talking about the virus I said that I had been wiping down surfaces as my white cell, platelets, red cell are still low. She asked why and I said from chemo. She recommended some kind of herbal mushroom to boost my white cell. She wrote down the name, said her oncology patients use it, and I asked my MO. Usually my MO just says no lol, but she said she found nothing to indicate not too, so she gave me the green light. Interesting! I'll keep you posted on my mushroom experiment!",

I love you're going to the gym seriously- I'm always impressed by anyone out there moving. So I've had the \"eye\" this week. I had done some workouts for free on the Audible app. I think tis through what's called Aptiv- it's an app. Long story short I got an email for a \"7 day challenge\"....ugh- ok what is this lol. Then it gave me 45% off the app for the year. Works out to less than $5 a month- ok I can handle that. So the guy leads you through the exercises....actually for the most part like the motivation he gives (there's women too on the APP but this 7 day challenge is through a guy). I've now done it 5 days in a row which IS almost world record for me haha. 2 more days. My hip flexer is hurting though and I'm sore as crap. BUT..then I put pants on and ugh! So keep at it Kelly! I'm assuming this is a side effect of the AI I'm on but my hands have been falling asleep at night, and then it was super warm this morning, asleep, tingling....took a long time to come out of it and now I still have some of those feelings. Geeez....does it ever end the annoyances?? So a long time guy friend sent me this random text this week: \"how long were you on chemo for\". Hmmm....care to elaborate on your question?! Sounds like he just got diagnosed with lymphoma...not sure which one yet. Funny how we do \"forget\" a lot of what we went through that brought us all together!!",

Docmomma- Well, I've done that before chemo lol, but funny you mention it- I realize how little I look at myself, so a lot of times I don't think about it until a get a second glance. I also haven't been wearing makeup- one of the side effects for me is the watery eyes, and esp when I'm in a store, etc so it's a waste. I was thinking about the friends I was talking to during my daughter's volleyball practice, realizing afterwards no makeup, barely any eyebrows/lashes- good lord! I also thought about xmas- friends have seen me, but the family actually hasn't (husbands family)- so how uncomfortable is that going to be?!!!

I saw her, and she put me on an antibiotic (not knowing it was a clot at the time)- it got even bigger and more painful the next night so I went to the ER. That's where I got an ultrasound. At first they said DVT and admitted me, but the next day they reviewed it and it was a superficial clot and released me. But then I was confused...in pain, no direction. I finally got into my primary care and she switched up the meds and put me on blood thinners and ordered a compression sleeve and it finally started to resolve. It was so friggin painful. If your MO isn't given you any insight try your primary care. I just kept bugging different dr's until someone seemed to take charge.",

Oncologist and surgeon both said about a good 4 weeks out at least for a date. Missil- i have some white lines on my nail beds, noticed it recently. No darkness though. I've had some bleeding in my nose after 5 as well, but not running thankfully. Even though I'm 3 weeks out, if I get moving \"too much\" (running xmas errands yesterday), I get really fatigued. I have some aches/maybe neuropathy that showed up these past few days. I can feel everything it's just almost like body parts are falling asleep or tingly or achy. Funny how we can't describe what's happening! Dennyj- my eye twitching has really gone away with the Vitamin Water (or try anything that has electrolytes). I'm so tired of water, I've actually drank two a day the last 2 days and I noticed my eyes aren't watering as bad either. I just read on the \"hair\" board, a couple of ladies commented the watery eyes can take a few weeks to go away after the last treatment. Beachbaby- I'm in Orange County! Maybe one of us can remember to start a \"who's having surgery in January\" thread?! LOL Nayda- Just an fyi- my Dr's meet together weekly to go over each patient. There's a Radiation Oncologist, and the oncologist and surgeon both wanted me to consult with her, which I did back in Sept/Oct. She told me that she reviews what the tumor (for me it's multiple) looks like at diagnosis to determine radiation. Right now I'm 95% no radiation. There's a chance once I'm opened up that I could do radiation (and God forbid more chemo). So I'm not doing any happy dance yet....surgery will tell. You may want to ask about seeing a RO and getting a referral. I will try and keep you all updated on #6.....fingers crossed it doesn't get worse than 5. My best to you all, thanks for your support!

So I thought I'd \"help\" with that piece lol. Like mom- routine screening (was pushed out a bit because my mom passed away- go figure) on an MRI found \"aggressive\" masses. ER-, PR was 15%, HER2-. KI67-90% (yikes!)- right into chemo. After 3 rounds, ultrasound was done- the main bad boy stayed the same- other 3 \"shrunk\". I have never been given any indication that it would all go away- but they liked what they were seeing. MO kept Adriamycin \"in her back pocket\", my assumption if things weren't responding. She has always let me know there's a slight chance of more chemo after surgery- so the dreaded wait for what the see during that time. So I will keep this thread updated once surgery and path happen and come back as it seems helpful? No date yet- but shooting for January. Background- mom had BC twice (and colon cancer- my dad had prostate), tested negative for BRCA 1 and 2. Her cousin had BC (but both ladies were \"older- 60's and 70's\"), and that cousin's daughter (at the age of 47). All have tested negative for BRCA. I did the genetic testing and negative as well, but I have a variance on the PALB2, which once they have more info they will let me know. I'm also watched closely for colon cancer as I like to grow polyps lol. So I can relate to those of you searching and testing, and also I'm a mother of a 13 year old daughter- and it's so frustrating to see so many of us with young families just wanting to watch our kids enjoy life! But we will move on!! Have a great holiday week everyone!",

Said if not getting better to get into Urgent Care (of course it was the holiday weekend approaching). Last Friday night got worse and I got myself to ER. Ultrasound and blood work done and ER dr said Deep Vein Thombrosis and checked me into the hospital. The next day after further review of ultrasound the Dr said it's a blood clot in a superficial vein and cellulitus. I was able to home Saturday, but I've been on constant pain meds and it's just totally frustrating. So hoping my surgery stays on schedule. Wishing you all a wayyyy better 2017!!",

Side note- I had done the genetic testing and had a variance on the PALB2 gene. A 2nd cousin had BC 9 years ago (at 47) and back then the testing wasn't as extensive. We weren't too sure her dr's would approve or push for her to get tested again, but I sent off my packet of results to her. They have approved to re-test her....should be interesting! Our mom's are cousins, and both of them had BC but at an much older age. Everyone has come back negative for the big 1 & 2, so this is the first hint of something running in the family.

They told me in the hospital to just make sure I let the nurses know if I needed pain meds, I stayed on it regularly. Now I can't quite remember, but do know I had percocet, and also had that for home. I do remember suggesting to the nurse that I alternate with another pain med, but now can't remember what that was. I did Tylenol (500mg) and Percocet the first few nights, but went straight on Tylenol after about day 5ish. I'm honestly more uncomfortable in a way since the last drain came out....I think I did too much (which didn't feel like a lot) too soon, so swelling a bit around the chest. Spending these days doing nothing. Driving is uncomfortable. Sleep - I spent the 5 months of chemo worrying about having to sleep on my back after surgery lol. I'm a side sleeper. I ordered a wedge pillow and neck pillow from Amazon and prop up additionally with pillows. The neck pillow helps (even though I didn't like it at first). I can't wait to get back on my side, but I'm sleeping ok...not great. I took Benadryl for a while at night as I would get super itchy and uncomfortable (plus could help with sleep). My PS is waiting a good month from surgery to start fills (but actually put a bit in at surgery time). He said it doesn't hurt (lol), but I'm going to take tylenol or something. I'm reminded that it's going to be tighter, so I'd rather be prepared. They told me every 1-2 weeks depending on my discomfort, and my PS does 60 cc's at a time. Most of us want those drains out, but I want to just say that the drains are helping get rid of the crap in your body....once they are out we have to be really careful on what we are doing so we don't cause any other issues. My arm started swelling the other day and it freaked me out and was that reminder that I needed to slow way down.",

I was even in the hospital over night because my arm was swelling from the clot, so then I had that Dr's input. Until I went to my PC dr the following week did things start getting back on track. I was on a variety of antibiotics. I could be really wrong, but your low count might be due to the infection. After my BMX in January, I ended up with another infection at the lymph node site, and was again on a variety of meds to clear that up which took over a month. Hang in there, but you've gotta get 1 Dr to guide you through whatever is going on, and I'm guessing at this point it should be your primary care.",

Emily- I had 4 tumors (\"a mass\"), KI67 was 90%, very aggressive. I only had 1 ultrasound 1/2 way through chemo and 3 of the 4 showed some shrinkage. Like everyone I wasn't expecting much I just wanted to start killing the cancer before it spread more. I knew before everything that I was doing a double mastectomy as my mom had BC twice and also colon cancer. I did do genetic counseling, wasn't positive for BRCA genes, but I have a \"variance\" on PALB2 (which we still do not know what this means lol). I went for the whole she-bang as I just didn't want to have to worry as much. I wish I had kept my mom's files as she had a mastectomy the first time, 2nd cancer the surgeon said lumpectomy which she struggled with but agreed and then went to MO and he said no- your going back for mastectomy, so she had an additional surgery. This was years and years ago, but I think that weighed on my decision as well. I agree with what everyone says- that from what I read the survival rate seems to be the same from the studies. We all have to do what's best for us....go with your gut. Wishing you the best.",

Wishing you all a great day and look forward to hearing from leftcoastie, pugsmoma, elem and win-chimed on the other side of surgery! Momy4ever, maya15, and annoyingboob- thoughts are with you for tomorrow!!! Welcome Rosebowl16 (can I assume you live in the LA/Pasadena area????? My cousin just volunteered at the parade again- she loves it- 9 year BC survivor!!). And the others that now are buried in the pages of this board- this is a great support group!",

I'm a size A, so right now I don't feel overly connected to them lol, but I'm sure some emotion will come into play. Lisbeth- you and i had chemo at the same time, looks like we're on track for surgery around the same time. I had the same- met with surgeon and PS a couple of months ago and just assumed I wanted implants. Didn't discuss anything else. Then I started reading on the boards and got totally confused lol. I did find one article on the main site of the BC boards and it compared all the different types of reconstruction- shows you the pro's and con's. That helped me and I'm back to implants. So after my last chemo treatment my vein site bruised and discolored. But now the elbow below that has swelled and is super sore and tender. I ended up at the MO's office yesterday- she doesn't think it's related but started me on antibiotics (there is redness too). I'm more whiny about this elbow than my 4 months of chemo lol. Timing's always great with Dr's off for the holidays too. So needed to read 3bears's post.....and all the positive thoughts to get me back on the upswing mentally. Just frustrated as it's limiting what I can do, and I know I'll be super limited in a month!! Thats my vent lol!",

      "Content": "Jan 1, 2017 06:08PM - edited Jan 1, 2017 06:10PM by ajbclan Hi Ladies- wishing those having surgery this next week, smooth sailing! I've been reading your posts- even though I'm home from the hospital this clot and cellulius are painful and laying me up. I think I'm having a harder time with this in a way because I don't have an answer of when this will be better and having chemo which brings my immune system down it's just crazy trying to heal. I guess it's all prep work for surgery. It's also frustrating as I'm not sure which Dr to tell and do a follow up with lol. MO, PCP, should let my BS know and make sure there's nothing I need to know for surgery...geez...no straight answer. That's my rant haha. Beachbaby- I think your struggle with the Dr (is that your BS or oncologist wanting lumpectomy?) I think is because there's studies out there showing that women with a lumpectomy are not having more of a reoccurrence than with mastectomy: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/more-dou.... I totally agree this is something each of us have to decide for ourselves and listen to our own gut on what's best for our situation. My decision was never in question of a double mastectomy with reconstruction. But I've known this choice for years- my mom had BC twice and also had colon cancer. We have other women in the family with BC as well. Everyone has tested negative for the BRCA genes, however I have a \"variance\" on PALB2 so we have to wait and see if it turns out to be an actual mutation. I'm also an A cup so don't feel like I'm losing much lol, but I'm sure it'll be emotional at some point. I have a good 4 tumors in my right breast. They refer to it as a \"mass\". My KI67 score was 90% so considered aggressive and why I had chemo first. BUT....something I wasn't aware of is that a BMX does not leave you in the clear for no BC in the future. Unfortunately they can't get all the breast tissue and cells out. As you're all probably aware they can't see all the cancer cells in any of the tests....one could be floating around. Not to scare all of you but it's not a guarantee.....but I'm wanting to do whatever I can to lower my risk and my worry so going for it. Dsmom- I CAN'T agree with you more on your frustration! I was so happy to learn that my Dr's DO work together- they have weekly meetings to go over each patient, so I have built in 2nd opinions. My mom's situation was like yours and was super frustrating!! One thing I have to say is having cancer does not make anyone weak....this is not a choice, this has nothing to do with anything we may have done or not done. While my body isn't 100% healthy, each piece of this journey is making me stronger than I thought I could be. Do I have down moments, absolutely- but we learn to pick ourselves back up and fight for another day and I appreciate my future and want to make sure I take advantage of living life once I can. Telling folks: my mom passed away in April and my dad has been gone for 25 years- so I don't have experience with that, but I know if my mom was here and healthy she'd be my biggest support. We all have to do what's best for us. I don't like help, don't bring me a casserole lol. BUT...I don't care what people know for the most part. Also I didn't want to deal with telling multiple people at multiple times because I don't have hair, or I can't participate in something etc. Part of my \"packet\" after diagnosis had a flyer for Caringbridge. It's a free website where you (or someone else on your behalf) can post updates. So instead of multiple calls/texts/emails- if someone wants to know how I'm doing, they can go to the site. Also- then I don't have to explain myself to anyone. I did have 2 moments where I had a hard time vocalizing it. I had a mom at my daughters school that didn't know. I had cut my long hair into a pixie cut in prep for losing it with chemo. She had lots of nice questions of why I cut it. I felt like there were a ton of eyes on me- some knew and some did not. I opened my mouth and as tears started flowing I could only mouth \"I have breast cancer\". Then I got some pitty hugs which I hated haha! I told my friends I'd rather you flip me off than hug me. So one of my Christian mom friends got me middle finger socks lol! I wore them to each chemo treatment and now might put them on for surgery. If you tell your friends and family what you need for support (texts, chances to take a walk for me) and what you don't want (hugs and casseroles for me lol)- they will listen and want to be there for you!! But we all have to do what's best for ourselves on this journey. No right or wrong! ",

I have a follow up appt today with PCP. Pre-ops had already been scheduled with both surgeon and PS this week so I will see what they say regarding keeping my surgery date. I do agree with others regarding the boards- if you spend a lot of time reading through them, you can get confused, down, and scared. As my MO reminded me- a lot of the women that do well with treatments etc don't post. So just try and keep a good balance and don't get sucked into the negative (coming from someone who went there lol). Dsmom- chemo- agree to read some of the boards (I was on Aug 2016 for example), and I hate to re-iterate what everyone says but we are all different, and our bodies react differently. Depending on the treatment some of it becomes cumulative too. Example- all of them hit me, but #5 of 6 was the worse. Then for #6 I had to delay as my platelets were down- nothing you could prepare for by being in shape for example. I had a great immunity system going in- hadn't been sick in years, but chemo will change that quickly, again- beyond your control. So if you have to go down the chemo road- just realize how your body responds is what it is, and no reason to feel you should be responding better or worse. Some women do work through it-- also depends on your \"exposure\" to potential germs etc. AND...some of us will feel the effects of chemo for months to come afterwards. This is a very positive group....wishing those going into surgery this week the best, and those that have completed it continued smooth recovery!",
