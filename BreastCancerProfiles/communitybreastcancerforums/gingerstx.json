    "Content": "Mar 5, 2011 12:08PM - edited Mar 5, 2011 12:11PM by gingerstx I'm about to start my radiation treatments.  I was introduced to the simulation room where I got marked, taped, and manipulated to form my cradle last Tuesday.  I go back on Monday to make sure their calibrations were correct and that's when I'll find out my treatment schedule. I'm hoping to begin my rads as soon as possible because I live in the Virgin Islands but had to fly to the states (Birmingham, AL) for my treatment.  Thanks for taking the time to write about the entire process in such detail.  I'm one of those women who likes to know as much as possible, beforehand, and I found your posts really helpful.     ",
