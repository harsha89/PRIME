I will still have Herceptin until December, but a lot of the side effects should be gone and my hair can grow. I will have to have a lumpectomy and radiation. I don't know if I will need any reconstruction after my lumpectomy but I was worried if I did if the radiation will hinder that. My eyelashes are sparse, not completely gone. My daughter does permanent makeup and she did my eyebrows before I started chemo. My brows are not completely gone just thinner, but it is not noticeable because of the brows that my daughter gave me. This board helps me reading about all the side effects that you all experience and how you are dealing gives me ideas to help myself.

My daughter does permanent makeup and did micro blading for my eyebrows before I started chemo. I was too afraid to have her do the eyeliner. Stephanie- I felt like it would take forever- I just started going without my wig to work in October at 7 months past chemo. It was thick but very, very short. People at work said they love it...I think they are being nice. I just have to make sure I wear makeup and earrings to pull it off. It is growing - slowly. I too am taking Herceptin and have read that others feel it was slower while on it. Truthfully, I think every body is different and maybe it feels so slow to me because it is not as fast as someone elses and I am looking at it several times a day to see if I see any growth.",

My hair seemed to grow at a slower rate than other people I have seen on here. I didn't even count the first month thinking that the chemo had to get out of my system a little. The first hair that I had growing in was translucent too, but the darker hair grew in and my last chemo was March 23, 2017 so I am almost a year out and my hair looks like a short haircut now instead of chemo growing out hair. I want to say have patience, but I knew I didn't, I was measuring it-when it got long enough to measure.",

Not just for hair, I was glad to read about boosting immune system and for arthritis. I had my 5th treatment yesterday and my last one is scheduled for March 23rd. This will be on my list to get. I still have to do Herceptin until December, but my hair should grow while on that. ",

Drained- Take it easy on yourself. Everyone's hair grows at a different speed and it looks like the hair grows in patches. I read some had a slower rate on the top of the head. I think mine is like yours and thinner on the sides, but I think it will all even out. Go out with your friends and have fun! Don't let all this keep you from living your life, be happy! ",
