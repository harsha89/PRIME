I'm 99% sure I'm not going to do radiation. I've done allot of research on it, and to me seems like overkill. I had a modified radical RT masectomy and prophylactic LT side done, I did this because the mri found fibroids and cysts and I've always had lumpy dense breast, so I wanted to eliminate left even though it was clear. My surgeon had clear margins. And no nodes were seen in chest wall that were invaded. They took all of my auxiliary sac on right, with 3 of 16 positive, the left sentinels were clear. There is conflicting stories for node positive radiation anyway with mastectomies, usually more that 4 are done. I have not had the oncotype test done, but wonder is that just to decide on chemo or all reoccurrence rates? I just can't imagine going daily for 6 weeks to burn areas that to me are gone now. Anyone else having this dilemma or more info? The pills I will be on for 5 or more years is also there to help reoccurrence...how much is too much? My biggest concern is possible future heart issues from AC and to top it off with radiation to the chest would be a double whammy, not to mention the burns and scars...and I also have temp implants in, and would prob need to start that all over again if I had rads.

I have cording in my right arm, some in the left and I'm going to physical therapy, so I do have allot on my plate, and will take my time to consider if radiation if right for me....I work in the financial medical field part, and I also know there is allot of money made by many health professionals, some much needed by cancer patients and some who get those wonderful referrals from other docs who pay it forward, hence our health insurance issues we have now in the US.",
