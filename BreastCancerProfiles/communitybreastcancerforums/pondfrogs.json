I immediatly answered both. my mom died of bc 20 yrs ago. I said I did not want to go thru' it again with the 2nd one down the road or be worried about it. I also wanted immed reconstruction and wanted them to look as even as possible. I have met people who only had one done and got it in the other later. to be fair I also have met some that have not. I have never regretted my decision. I feel like I made the best choice for me.",

I had to be hospitalized after the second tx for severe n/v. my anti-emetics have been changed so much I have a pharmacy supply company in my closet lol.  the thing that finally kept it half way decent was a combo of ativan and reglan (along with other 'as needed' stuff). now I will start taxol in 2 weeks. my onc told me she didn't think that the taxol would be as bad as the a/c. hopefully it won't as I will be getting taxol every week x 12 weeks and I know won't be able to take it if it is. I also have expanders and will be getting my new implants sometime in sept. after all this chemo and my body has a chance to recover. ",
