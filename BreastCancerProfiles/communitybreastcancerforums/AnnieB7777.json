There were too many cases of people being told cancer doesn't hurt, so they blow their symptoms off, and find out at a later stage. The posts speak for themselves.",

Radiologist says it's fatty tissue, sure hope she's right... It is unnerving, I know how you feel. You could always ask for a biopsy. Just to answer your question, it does happen.:)",

Finally did one about a month ago and found several new lumps ranging from the size and feel of a BB to the size of a pea, which go from the 11 oclock position of my breast and travel on a path right into my armpit (and a couple in my armpit). I then waited because I wanted to make sure that it didn't go away after my monthly. Which they didn't, and then I found four more under my collarbone to boot. The biggest one has almost a bruise shadow over it which I can see when I look in the mirror. I'm making an appointment as soon as they open today, but am wondering if anyone has experienced this and had it be a benign condition. My fear is that lump was something more than fatty tissue. Please reassure me if you can, my stomach is in knots today. Log in to post a reply",
