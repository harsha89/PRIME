I'm crossing my fingers it is just a cold virus. Has any one had similar and it was confirmed,ed as mets? Can some sort mets not show up at all until the lamp nodes are enlarged? Really appreciate some feedback here whilst Iponder if I should get my gp to give me a scrip for sanex     ",

Very slow growing cancer with0-1 mitosis. I've probably had the cancer for well over 15 years my Onco told me. I was on zoladex with arimidex for 3 years with about a year of tamoxifen initially. The X-ray and ct did not shown any lung issues - just the enlarged nodes - it seems a lot of them and mainly on the right. Would the X-ray or CT not show the plural infusion. My mum had sarcoidosis so it could be that but my ACE results are low - if seen a rhuemologist - but he didn't identify anything. My ESR has been creeping up since chemo - it was elevated before diagnosis and recently my ALP is also borderline elevated. I'm seeing a Chiro for back pain as well between spine and shoulder blade in the T5/6 area. My spleen is also on the larger side of normal. My GP is going to do a call around to see if I can't get in early - it took three months to see the neurologist - so I am crossing my fingers. My Onco is away - but his receptionist is good and she's also doing a call around. I think NHL is unlikely but I wouldn't rule out mets as my cancers were very deep and I don't think the sentinel node biopsy they did took that into account. Is it not unusually for bc to not show up on X-ray and MRI - I had the right off prophylactically as they couldn't be 100% sure it did have cancer either - it didn't but it did show some cells were changing to dcis. Dcis was extensively through my left. So hopefully Monday will bring some news about an appointment this week. It's great to see such strong and well informed people in this group - sometime I realise our doctors are just humans too with a bit of training. Thanks again k",

I've now had a pet scan and it's shows more activity then the ct. still no lung involvement but suv max in my nodes of 16 and intramamory node is also affected. Going for an bus biopsy as Onco says could be mets, lymphoma or even sarcoidosis as results and blood working support any one of these! Feeling a tad confused. Ke",

Having moved a few years back, my current doctors don't have my baseline scans. So I had to chase them up - and no large nodes in 2013ct. So these large nodes are something new and could be the band - I will ask. I suspect now that they have the baseline results - they will rescan and if still large they may biopsy. They are treating the cough as GERD - but looking through my results I see I have had a cough on and off now for a few years. Also just had ultrasound on neck as large lump has developed over the last 6 months since I came off zoladex. There is a ROI on the scan - so I now wait anxiously to see what that is. Lump is in the cervical node chain area. Interesting my baseline scans in 2012 showed no hyperintemsities - whilst my latest brain MRI does. Onco back next week - so I will follow up as something is def not right. Thanks for the advice. Ke",
