      "Content": "BDW wrote: Hi. I'm 37 and have been having pain in my left breast as well as a very disturbing \"let down feeling\" in both breasts. I have nursed three children so I'm very familiar with the feeling. My youngest is 7. I had 2 fairly large cysts drained from my left breast in Oct 2016, and a fibroadenoma removed from the right in Nov 2016. The let down feeling has only been going on for a couple of weeks but when you GOOGLE it, aside from being pregnant (which I'm not), Cancer pops up and I'm totally freaking out. Anxiety on 10. I have an appt in 2 weeks but I believe I will be crazy by then from worrying. HELP. Has anyone had this feeling and it not be anything? I have really dense breasts and my last mammogram was in Oct 2016 and then the right breast in Feb 2017 to make sure the fibroadenoma was removed completely. Log in to post a reply",
