I have 2 masses, one palpable at 1:00 and the other not palpable at 9:30. They are fibroadenomas with atypical ductal hyperplasia. My question really is about recovery and scarring. I already have a significant scar near the 9:30 from breathing tube placement as an infant so I am used to scars, but just curious. I meet with the surgeon Tuesday so I can ask her as well, but I like to hear personal experience from others. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Juliana1835 wrote: Hi everyone, I posted here before when I was facing two excisional biopsies two weeks ago. I ended up with a very large hematoma, a second surgery, but I am doing much better. Went for my post op and have good results - fibroadenomas no atypia. So happy for those results. But now I have two questions. Why do I have tenderness in my rib area around/under that breast? Yes I should have asked the surgeon. Wasn't so tender until after the fact. And what is with the new indent/ vertical line under my nipple (not near the 2 biopsies I just had, but in the area of the one I had 20 years ago). If I palpatate it, it feels like a line under the skin, maybe an inch. I am hesitant to call the doc. Could just be how my breast is healing. The hematoma/swelling was pretty dramatic. Please let me know your thoughts! I very much appreciate it. Log in to post a reply",

It was literally overnight that the indent showed up, but my whole ribcage was sore for a day or two after surgery. Sitting up in bed was painful. I thought maybe it was due to coughing after 2nd sugery to deal with bleeding, but didn't think I coughed that bad! The new soreness developed over the last few days. I think you're right about mondors. The indent and line under the skin is a symptom.",

However, it also turns out there is atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). I am meeting with a surgeon next week to discuss my excisional biopsies. I think you should wait until you get the path report and then make a decision. I have had fibroadenomas before with usual ductal hyperplasia (I think that's what you call it) and no worries. I am glad I decided to do the core bx because now I am aware of the ADH and can keep an eye on it.",
