Ive just seen your post while searching on behalf of my mum and your situation sounds exactly the same as ours. My mums just had her first chemo for breast cancer (she also has fibromyalgia) and will need 4 rounds of chemo before a mastectomy and nodes removed and then more radiation/chemo.  She ended up in hospital this morning after fainting, being sick, migraine which I know can all be normal side effects but she now doesn't know whether she should be taking the injections prescribed (filgrastim/zarzsio) because she feels its making her worse. Did your mum stick with the neulasta? This is also putting her off having anymore chemo. Thanks",
