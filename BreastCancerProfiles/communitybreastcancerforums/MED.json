My Oncologist is also active in doing research. I do have faith in him and he definately looks at the whole picture but I guess I am old school where cancer = chemo. My oncologist told me the exact same thing about using chemotherapy in the past. I definately feel better after reading your blog. Did you have a positive node with your diagnosis or were the nodes all negative?? Happy Friday MED",

The onc said it would be of no benefit to me. This is a test that came out I think about 5 years ago. It looks at your individual tissue for analysis and can determine if chemo will be of any benefit based on the score. Take Care and Best Wishes MED",

      "Content": "MED wrote: Hello, I hope someone can help me I am so confused. I was recently diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Had an extensive lumpectomy with clear margins and 1positive node out of 17 that were removed. Had the oncotype DX test done with a recurrence score of 18. My oncologist said chemotherapy would be of no benefit to me so I have started on Tamoxifen and am scheduled to start radiation tomorrow. I am worried about the 1 positive node and no chemo. Is there anyone who had positive nodes and did not do chemo??

When I got my Onco DX test back according to the graph it showed chemo would be of no benefit to me but I can't help but think there are little \"bad\" cells floating around inside of me. Needless to say I am driving myself and everyone else nuts. There more I read the more anxious and confused I get. My husband and I are both in the medical field but I'm not sure that is a good thing. Thanky You and Happy Thursday!!",
