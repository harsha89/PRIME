The problem is my liver function is going out of whack right now and I developed some ascites. I read that people with liver problem should take femara with cautions and dose may be decreased -what does it mean? I understand if your liver function is still normal when starting femara - because the liver is still ok to handle the drug toxicity. My liver is diffused 60% by the cancer already:( and is not functioning properly right now... wonder if femara is gonna make it worst? I am ER/PR+++, was on tamox for short, arimidex for a year then stopped wrking, now my onco wants to try femara. thank you for any feedback. Log in to post a reply",

It worked like a charm... tumors started to shrink etc. but then it stopped working after a year.  Then they put me on chemo, it worked but VERY slow. Then my doc put me on tamox (without chemo) and that worked too with pretty speedy results. But I can't tolerate the SE much. So now, he thinks going back to arimidex/femara would help again after being on break for more than a year. What's the difference between aromasin and aromatese ? I thought femara was aromasin? Is faslodex some kind of oral chemo? thanks for your thoughts ",
