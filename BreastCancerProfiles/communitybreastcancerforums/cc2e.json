She is a triple negative. My concern is that the surgery showed that the lymph nodes appear to clear but there is still a positive margin but it is DCIS not IDC. The surgeon and oncologist agreed that they want to go ahead and start chemo instead of going back in and trying to get clear margins. When I questioned this I got the answer that the margin was very small and the radiation would take care of it and another procedure would delay chemo. I am calling again tomorrow for more explanation as I am having trouble wrapping my head around not going back to try and get clear margins. Just wondering if any had a similiar experience, IDC first, then DCIS found...did you have surgery again before starting chemo? thanks for any sharing of experience and opinion. Everything is moving so fast that I want to make sure I am asking the right things Carrie Log in to post a reply",
