Judy~ I was so disappointed to hear about your delayed appointment---- but YAY for the great  preliminary news!  Try to rest easy tonight. Clams~ Thanks for passing on the helpful hint re: email updates.  I'm delegating this responsibility to DH too-- and hoping that he'll agree post here for me too if I can't myself.  His updates will surely be brief and to the point- he's my polar opposite when it comes to writing! Sal Specht~ Welcome Girl.  Had to laugh at \"Bull Balls.\"  Do you have a preliminary dx? Ann Alive~  The AND soreness sounds terrible :(  I hope relief will be coming soon.  And I'll be praying that you don't have to wait any longer than Friday for your final path results.  trinity927~ So happy to hear the node negative news.  Did you have any drains removed at your PS appointment today?  CLC~ Hey my WNB hahahaha.   How have you been feeling this afternoon?  How's the fatigue going?  I'll be wishing you a solid night of sleep (is that REALLY too much to ask for?!?)    Kelleyod~ Wow on the 480cc at your initial fill.  After my PS pre-op appointment today, it doesn't appear that will be my case...but time will tell.   So sorry you had so much nausea.  I've never had an adverse reaction to anesthesia but I know better than to never say never!  ILUV2Knit~ What beautiful support you had at work today :)  You are going to do wonderfully tomorrow.  BTW, I just read your bio and it touched me so... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I can officially say that my DH is WAYYYYYY more nervous for this upcoming surgery than I am.  He went to my PS pre-op appointment with me this afternoon and I was quite sure that he was just seconds away from needing medical attention himself when the nurse explained the drainage protocol.  Ummmm.... I think I'll be stripping my own drains since that will be easier than delivering CPR when he faints trying to help me!   Other than that, it was a very informative appointment.  I even got my antibiotic/pain scripts written in advance.  We meet with my BS in the morning to sign waivers and such...    It's really starting to feel like \"BBIBB\"  is approaching quickly now (Bye-Bye-Itty-Bitty-Boobies) who have caused me nothing but pain,stress and anxiety for way too many years.  I may be in the minority, but I'm currently feeling NO physical or emotional attachment to these useless appendages on my body.  Good Riddance Cancer Bags!

NO, his belly fat is full of stuff that I'd never consider putting in my body.  My boobs would then be stuffed full of \"Cheez-Its\"  LOL!  YUCK!   rk85~  Does the grafting procedure delay the healing process?  I know of only one woman (personally) who has chosen this route so I don't have much experience with recovery time.  While I know that this woman has had a couple of false alarms re: her transferred tissue, she is okay but underwent lots of testing.  I know that every surgical option has its own set of risks and there is really no \"best\" option.    So... I'm home tonight with my hubby and 11 year old son who BOTH have confirmed dx's of pneumonia :(  It will be a miracle if I can manage to stay healthy while taking care of them.  I see lots of Vit. C in my near future!   Good Night Everyone~",

My boy is still down with a case of pneumonia so I'm signing off for now.  Hope everyone is doing as well as possible.  More tomorrow. ",

CLC- Oh why are I NOT surprised that you're my fellow Halloween enthusiast?  I've always loved it.  No stress, no pressure--- all fun!  I'll gladly come Trick or Treating with you in spirit.  As for the costume I had previously planned, well, I was going to be \"Laverne\" and my bestie was going to play \"Shirley.\"  I insisted on being the one to wear the big cursive \"L\" on my soon-to-be-gone little sweater kitty! On a more serious note, I'm really bummed that you have to wait 10 days for compression bandage removal.  I know this will be such an integral part of your emotional acceptance/healing. Re: nursing~ Yes--- C nursed until he was just shy of 3 yrs old.  We both had a very rough start (he couldn't latch onto my \"nips\" that have been inverted since birth.)  So... I pumped non-stop for the first 9 months of his life.  It wasn't until we had a family emergency in which I had NO bottled breast milk on hand for him so we tried yet again.  BAM--- he finally got it!  And once he got it, he did NOT want to give it up!  :) rachelvk~ I'm offering up giant hugs.  While I haven't been in the exact same situation as I do have one child, I know how much it hurts to want a baby and not knowing if that will ever be a reality.  My ex husband and I were days away from starting fertility injections when I finally got a positive HPT.  My current husband and I have tried to conceive since 2004.  I have not wanted to take aggressive measures due to my breast issues.   That was probably really hard to follow.. sorry!  At any rate, I hate how much BC can try to take from us.  Glad that you have a little peanut (neice or nephew?) in your life right now.  I know it's not the same as having your own child.. but still a really awesome part of your life.   TracieM~ So happy you got some great sleep last night!  Hope it continues on! Eema~  I was nodding my head whilst reading your entire post.  Right on Girl re: always requesting full pathology.  I'm become a stickler for this.  Also, I'm very happy that you found a great \"in-person\" support group.  Strangely enough, I've been wanting to get involved/volunteer my services (fitness instruction) to our local Cancer Community Center for a while now.  Just didn't know that I would eventually be on the receiving end of their support services.   Hope you had a great sports day with DS.  While I normally bitch about \"Soccer Mom Saturday\", I enjoyed every second of his game yesterday.  This shit certainly helps one put things into perspective, eh?  To answer your question re: feeling poorly before DX---- I've been feeling fatigued for well over a year but I've always attributed it to overtraining.  While I don't have a definitive BC DX yet, I'm pretty sure there's an association here.  trinity927~ I'll be sure to remember the drain stripping tip re: using an alcohol swab.  I can just see myself accidentally ripping one out... GrandmaV~ UGH!  So bummed to hear that you're not feeling 100%.  I'll be praying that this doesn't postpone your surgery on Tuesday.   I ALMOST suggested taking a whopper of a dose of Vit C just in case this is a cold... but then quickly remembered that Vit C needs to be discontinued prior to surgery!   Keep us posted on how you're feeling in the morning,k?   MargieC~  Hope you don't mind that I'm doing a little celebratory potty dance here for ya!  Hope you can get some sleep tonight in that recliner.  I've got mine my recliner ready and waiting (and have told my husband to not even THINK about using that chair until I'm back in my own bed! :)  I'll be wishing you the very best at your PS appt. tomorrow. CookieMonster~ Love your name.  Good to meet you.  I'll be wishing you the absolute best outcome for your upcoming surgery.  I see that your procedure is scheduled soon after mine... we'll be recovering together.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Random thoughts~ I wasted a completely gorgeous summer-like weather day today.  While I made it to the gym this morning and had a strong workout. I spent the afternoon reading a mindless book and then napping for almost 2 hours.   So much for tackling my To-Do list!  Night My Sistas!

ILuv2knit~  How did your appointment go today?   Hoping those antibiotics do the trick! Rachel~ I hope you're having a smooth transition back to work :) Kat~ YAY for not having to wait any longer for pathology!  Have fun shopping for some new clothes :)  I know you will do very well with rads.  Do you know how many treatments are scheduled?  I went to each of my Mom's rads appointments and was always amazed by how quickly she was done... Ann~ How's it going with the new TE?  That bend sounds quite unscomfortable--- ugh.  Quick update on me:   Had my post-op appointment for exchange surgery this morning.  I can't believe how quickly this is all happening-- Im now scheduled for December 15.   While I'm excited, I've apparently created quite the dilemma for my PS with regard to which antibiotics to use this time around.  It's unclear which of the 3 used that I'm allergic too.   I can't imagine going through that nasty itching all over again.... but I'll manage if I must.  Time to go... more soon! ~AJ",

Kim137~  Been thinking of you!  How did surgery go?  Hope you're back up and posting soon!  rachel~ Good luck with the apartment decisions this weekend! To anyone I've missed~ I'm truly sorry.  This board moves so quickly and I hate that I seem to have lost my email notifications.     Off to start our afternoon of soccer.  Hugs and love to all.  Hope to hear more updates from our post-surgery ladies soon!

So so so tired tonight as the Benadryl I'm taking for this allergic reaction is seriously kicking my ass.  I am SO uncomfortable--- in fact it feels worse than the actual mastectomy sites.  PS took me off of all meds other than Benadryl as we can't identify which agent(s) are causing the  reaction.  I'm a bit nervous about not taking an antibiotic while my drains are still in.  Has anyone else experienced this situation?  I had adverse reactions to Keflex and Clindamycin.  PS said that the first 48 hours is the most critical for antibiotics but I'm still fearful to go without.... Alright Ladies, I can no longer keep my eyes open.  I wish you all sweet sleep tonight.  Back in the morn!",

Diana ~ So happy that tomorrow is your last day of chemo!  I know the 10 day wait until your PET scan will be stressful.... but you will make it through:)   Thank you for relating to my anxiety re: my very UN-informational ultrasound.  I hate that my insurance is being billed for all of these diagnostics that don't seem to provide any information at all.  My goal is to avoid all Breast Worries until my surgery on 10/24 as there is really NOTHING I can do in the meantime other than take very good care of my body.    Caryn~ HAAAAA re: Thing 1 and Thing 2.  Love that.  Just hoping I don't need to meet Thing 3 and Thing 4 :)   If you're sure you don't mind parting with the Softee Cam, I'd be more than happy to buy it from you!  I think the size would be perfect.  Just let me know.   Margie~ Way to go on the fundraising for Susan G.

Well Ladies, I finally have pathology news to share.  Much to my surprise (and after differing pathology reviews), it was determined that I do not have invasive or in-situ carcinoma in either of my breasts,  My final diagnosis revealed ADH in both breasts (thought to have been low grade DCIS) in addition to having \"rare benign intraductal microcalcification, non-proliferative and proliferative fibrocystic changes\" in the right breast.  I'm relieved that I listened to my gut on this one.  While some people in my circle of friends thought that my decision to move forward with BMX was extreme, I honestly believe that I did the right thing and at just the right time.  While it could have been 2 weeks, months, or even YEARS until I was diagnosed, it would have inevitably happened.       This experience has changed and will CONTINUE to change my life.  I've never felt so strongly about taking an active role in my community with regard to breast care awareness,  I just met a woman today who was recently diagnosed with later stage BC.  Sadly, she hadn't had a mammogram (or any type of clinical exam/diagnostic testing) in 8 years,   I wish you ALL sound sleep tonight as I send hugs to each and every one of you.  I feel like I have found my \"lifeline\" here and I'm stickin' around for the long haul :) Night Everyone~ ~AJ   ",
