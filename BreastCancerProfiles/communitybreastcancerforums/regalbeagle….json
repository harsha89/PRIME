Consequently a portion of her lung was removed.  All that to say that I was being closely monitored with all the women in my family having the BRAC 2 gene and 2 of the 4 women with breast cancer.  I even went to high risk control center, but with all that they still discovered a 2.5 cm lump with an MRI.  It was quite by fluke really.  My mammograms had come out normal, my ultra sounds, normal and I had an MRI ONLY because of my family history.  In fact I waited 1 year to get that MRI and that is where they discovered my lump.  What I find is that they put us all in the same category.  As good as the doctors are, they always seem to lump (no pun intended) us together as if we are not individuals and that the cancer will act and grow exactly the same for all of us.  The truth is it doesn't and we all are different so our cancers will (might) behave differently as well.  Treatments, screenings, have to be done in accordance with the individual's history, habits etc.  Our lives are priceless so the cost should be immaterial.   In the end they did find the cancer and we are still here so let us remember and be thankful for that and pray that we will one day find a cure for this horrible illness.
