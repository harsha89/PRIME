I'm TNBC, have had five grueling months of chemo, and head to surgery with a sense of \"finally\" (and dread). And I'm almost 64 years old, happily married to the best, most supportive husband in the world for 38 years. My question - any older ladieson here with what my PS calls \"large, pendulous breasts\"? My healthy side is 38DDD. Yes, she's big, and when I'm one-sided, there will be no hiding the difference. 1. Thinking about going flat on mastectomy side anyway. Tired of treatments, headed to 6 weeks of radiation and probably Xeloda (pill chemo for trip negs) for six months. Just don't want to put my body through more. 2. But . . . always been \"well endowed\" since breasts grew in. PS wants to do TE with implant replacement and reduction of healthy side. I'm not excited about the TE or implant surgery. I've lost 30 pounds, have 25 more to go, and will probably go down to maybe a 36DD. Still big. Maybe yes to reduction surgery? I welcome your thoughts. I live in Atlanta, GA, so don't have all those Bay Area resources. I appreciate all the good information about online resources and other info I've found here. Thank you!",
