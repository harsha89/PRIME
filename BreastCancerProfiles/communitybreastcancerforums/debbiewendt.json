      "Content": "debbiewendt wrote: My 19 yr old daughter had an ultrasound today, she told me that what they had seen were white spots... her doctor called and gave her the number to another doctor and she is to schedule a biopsy.  The doctor that sent her for an ultrasound is a gyn. and a surgeon also, i dont understand why she is being sent to this other doctor.  I read up on this doctor and I see he has experience with cancer patients but also does things like colon,and hernia operations... My daughter has been complaining of pain in the area where the \"white\"spots show up...Question to those that have had cancer...is this something that I should be totally stressing over or just try to remain calm until we know more?  Any info would be sooo helpful.
