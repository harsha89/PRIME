I had a follow up in Jan this year at age 40 and my left breast was lumpier ... cluster of cysts. Went back yesterday and it seems like a cyst got a lil bigger. I have to go for an aspiration and biopsy. Doctor said 99percent B9 but because of that 1percent we have to make sure. Need some reassurance... I\u2019m scared as hell! It was a week before my period. Could be hormones? Is this common? Cara Log in to post a reply",
