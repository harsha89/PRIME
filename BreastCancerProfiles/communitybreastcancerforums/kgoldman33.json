Three weeks ago I discovered a yellow spot on my right breast. I was due for my year follow up as of July 8th of this year and needed to make an appointment anyway. By July 24th I went in to see my doctor and had my mammogram. By this time there is a distinct thickness in my right breast  and quite larger than my left. My numbness and tingling down my right arm is horrible and I feel an obvious thickness that doesnt move. My doctor confirms that she feels it too, my mammo came back noticing  intraparenchymal lymph node in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. SHe told me to follow up with her in a month to see if there was any change. Well the lymphadema specialist is noticing more swelling as of last Friday, I too noticed it and noticed the thickness had felt even more full and I am now working on my third stretch mark. So I went back in and yes once again yesterday my doctor felt more significant fullness and wanted an bilateral MRI (insurance denied it) but got an ultrasound. I went for my ultrasound today and the radiologist talked to me and said at my age I should not worry, he found three areas that did not show up on the mammo that he was not worried, but not really sure what they were. He restated that at my age I have nothing to worry about and that the three spots measure no bigger than half an inch each. Then the doctor said , \"I would suggest to follow up in six months.\" I told him I would like to have 100 percent feeling in my hand again in six months and that since my mammo , my breast has changed. Still at my age of course I had nothing to worry about. Well I do, my mom's side of the family has family history of colon cancer, as well as breast cancer. I do have to worry because I do not have periods anymore and for something ot change in size that fast makes me worry. ANy ideas ? Can anyone help me feel not so crazy? What should I do?",
