Unfortunately I didn't have insurance, so I could not get the care I needed. I recently became insured, and expressed my concern to my healthcare provider, She told me I was 43, and my insurance would cover a routine mammogram 100%, so she scheduled it just to be sure. Two days after I got a call that there was scattered fibroglandular density with an 8 mm asymmetry in the central portion of the right breast, and additional imaging was necessary. She set me up for a diagnostic mammogram, which showed the same findings, The tech sent me directly to ultrasound, but the ultrasound tech could not locate the mass due to the dense tissue areas of the breast. The radiologist has recommended that I have a stereotactic mammotone biopsy. The findings were assessed as BIRADS Cat 4. I am terrified. I have read some horror stories about the procedure itself, and then just the thought of what this could be! Log in to post a reply",
