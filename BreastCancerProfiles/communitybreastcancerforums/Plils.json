Since I have had a normal cyctscopey, normal renal ultrasound on and off lower achy back, needed a nap everyday just have no energy yet today I check and still have microscopic blood and lucycites in my urine which has had a nutty weird smell and cloudy the whole time that is why I though something was wrong in the first place.  I am really getting scared I have a tumor but because the cyctoscopye and renal ultrasound was normal I was told it was probably just a hormone problem.  Help has anyone else been going through this.",

Ha ha, my girlfriend said the other day that that is why we lose our hair during Chemo is because we get so hot.
