Now all i have to worry about is loosing the excess weight gained during treatment. Also im so delighted with my hair growing back even though it is all white. For you all out there, do not despair there is hope and I am proof of it.",

My family have rallied round too but i keep crying all the time, can't help it. I am so very scared! Should start chemo end of January. I don't understand the grading or stages. What is grade 3? Also I have a constant dull pain, is this normal? Thank you for your help.",
