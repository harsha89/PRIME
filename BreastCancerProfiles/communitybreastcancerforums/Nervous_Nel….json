I believe it will first be a needle Biopsy..However they scheduled me an appt. with a doctor to do the biopsy, and when I called to confirm my appt the receptionist informed me that in fact the biopsy would not be done that day, so I am thinking maybe he would just like to go over the report with me first.. I really do not know how all this is supposed to work, I am so confused... Either way I think I will request if I can, that whatever this lump may be they go ahead and take it out... I am in no way trying to tell a doctor how to practice medicine, but whatever this is does not belong in me and I want nothing more than to have it gone, even if it is not cancer kwim? It is causing me alot of stress and worry, and even though I know I should not worry until I have some kind of diagnoses, but that is just me a worrier...And my poor family has to deal with me being on edge all the time...",

The doc called me today with results from the radiologist report...( which isn't much info at all) She said the mass looks suspicious and the next step is biopsy.. So now the wait begins for that appointment... What should I expect as far as a biopsy is concerned? Thank you in advance! (I refuse to google it lol)",

The lump is palpable, I found it myself...I was having burning sensations in my breast,months and months ago and thought nothing of it because \"cancer does not hurt\" I found the lump about 3 mos ago but thought nothing of it because of my age which is 37..I have been told \"most people do not develop BC until well into their 40's\" and I was in my cycle.. But I felt it again in the shower so decided to have it checked, and here I am... A nervous nelly lol... I know the chances are in my favor of it not being a form of BC but I am a pessimist by nature...I try not to be but it is a hard habit to break..",
