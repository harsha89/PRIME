    "Content": "bradfordvero wrote: I am 46 and found a breast lump a few weeks ago.  I had a mammogram, magnified mammogram and an ultrasound, all the same day.  The mass was listed as a category 4 on the pathology report which was sent to my surgeon.  Upon examination, my surgeon could NOT make a determination if this is a cancerous lump or not.  Because the lump was hard to see on the mammogram but clearly seen on the ultrasound, my surgeon feels the lump cannot be properly \"watched\" over time.  He also said that even if I have the core biopsy done, I most likely would also need to have the entire lump removed.  So he recommends that I have the entire 3cm lump removed at an outpatient surgery center.  Does this sound logical?  It sounds to me I would be better off \"watching\" the lump by ultrasound for a while.  I have very few risk factors (my age, I smoke, and I stopped having my periods almost 2 years ago-no hormone replacement).  I have no family history, I breast fed my children, I started my period at 13, my first child was born at age 19.  I have no idea how long the lump has been here.  I have ignored my breast health for the past 4 years while I concentrated on other health issues.  I became blind and adrenal insufficient during the last 4 years due to a case a spinal meningitis.  Now that I know the lump is there, I feel it over 50 times a day, just checking to see if it is going away.  I am not super worried that it is cancer but of course there is a little bit of me that is worried since I just don't know what this lump is.  Any words of wisdom are welcomed!  Log in to post a reply",
