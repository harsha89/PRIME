A particular blow because I had just finished my last Herceptin treatment, was scheduled to get my port out, and thought my life was finally getting back to normal. Am trying to decide on treatment from here. Saw a preeminent bc oncologist who recommended either Taxol and H&P (I'm HER2+++), or Kadcyla. I am asymptomatic at the moment and really don't want to go back on chemo until I absolutely have to. Am leaning to just doing H&P and seeing if that works for awhile. Was on TCHP originally. Any advice, o, wise women of the site? ",
