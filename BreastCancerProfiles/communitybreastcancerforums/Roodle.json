I've tried to read extensively on the site but I'm still new to the terminology and trying to get informed so please bear with me. My 37- year old wife was diagnosed two days ago with what I take to be DCIS (\"epithelioma intra-canulaire\" in French, we live in Belgium) following a mammogramme that showed extensive microcalcification in the right breast.  She had biopsies, which showed up the epitheliomas having non-invasive  grade II to III malignity on the EORTC scale. The pathology document also mentions .\"classe B5 EGBP (contributing, malignant)\" as well as evidence of necrosis and some comedo aspects.  The gynecologist who presented us with the report recommended a masectomy potentially followed by radio and chemo, depending on what surgery shows.  This came as a complete shock to both of us as my wife has no family history and we just had our third child 10 months ago.  She had some mastitis, but nothing since. The gynecologist explained things to us in very simple terms, but didn't take us through the report in detail.  I've pieced together the picture based on it, and we'll be meeting the surgeon on Monday, so I wondered if anybody can explain to me the scales above, because I can't work out the malignancy or what B5 EGBP is. Many thanks to everybody.  Log in to post a reply",
