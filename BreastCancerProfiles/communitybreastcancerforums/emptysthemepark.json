So I thought I'd kind of throw out what's happening and see if anyone has a story or experience to share to help me know what might happen or help me stay positive? I'm 29, never had children. My family on both sides is riddled with cancer but the only breast cases are distant (mom's cousin; grandmother's sister, same side). I'm usually pretty good about breast exams but started slacking about 6 months ago. Up until that point, I'd had a few tiny lumps that were very moveable that doctors checked and assured me were just cysts that flare with hormones (coincidentally, there's a lot less of them since I had my Mirena IUD put in). I've noticed lately that my bras fit weird. I noticed the one I was wearing Tuesday seemed particularly 'off' somehow and chalked it up to a slight rip in the cup. I love it, so I repaired it. Didn't help much, so I brushed it away as hormonal swelling, which is usual for me. Showering later, I noticed that my left breast, which has always been larger, was REALLY larger than the right. In addition, it felt firmer overall and also, the nipple no longer pointed forward, but a little to the outside. Not normal for me. I try and remember my last exam, realize it's been ages and do one. I find a large lump in my left breast. It's hard, not moveable, located on the edge near my armpit, and doesn't hurt. I'd say it's almost two inches long and half an inch wide, an oblong shape.There's no noticeable heat inthe area and no redness. I went to the doctor yesterday and obtained a referral for a mammogram and ultrasound. Those are scheduled Feb 10th (the best I could do). During the exam, I again had no pain when he pressed the lump, but I did have some pain near the lymph nodes under my left arm (mild), which made the doctor make a face that was NOT comforting at all. I know in my head that it's probably fine, likely a fibroadenoma, and either way, it's coming out. I refuse to let it wait a few years to shrink if that's what it is. I don't want it in there. But no matter how much you intellectually KNOW something, it doesn't override emotions. I'm scared. I know it's important to be positive, and everyone in my support circle has been incredibly positive. But only one of my friends has been through a lump and it was small, squishy and was just an abscess on a lymph node under her arm. This is very much beneath my breast. I also feel stupid for slacking on exams, especially since I used to do sex ed counselling in university. Are there questions I should be asking, depending on the results? Has anyone had a similar lump? How did it turn out? Are there any other signs I should be watching for? Thanks so, so much in advance. Log in to post a reply",
