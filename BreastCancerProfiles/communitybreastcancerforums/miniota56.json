If a clinic or hospital takes any kind of federal funding they have programs for free care. My husband had pre existing conditions. We were without insurance for 2 years. Like you he was afraid to go to the Dr. Hear in MN he has a plan which is excellant bought through the state. Me I'm on medicare + other insurance. My Dr told me there are Federal laws when it comes to BC. Hope everything turns out for you. Hugs",

I really am so fortunate to have the surgeon and regular Dr. who are so aggressive. I was just going to go the 6 months and didn't think nothing more. What I have learned  through out all of this is I am getting as strong as the rest of you. Hugs to all. We really do rock ",

I was dx a year ago with IDC I had a port put in but right after Chemo I had it removed. It hurt to access it and constant pain Thought I had an infection. Went for my yearly mammo there was a nodule in my chest wall so had a digital done then US Radioligist said it's a cyst come back in 6 months. My regular Dr. sent me a letter and told me to go to my Breast surgeon. She is sending me to a Breast Cancer imaging center because it's so deep. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else had this problem. The little gal that did my mammo a year ago didn't pull and tug like this last mammo. I had my left brest removed. This is above my right breast. Do any of you think that it was there a year ago and thats what always caused my port to hurt. Thank you for listening. God bless you all. Log in to post a reply",

It ended up being a very deep cyst caused by the port that was in me. My onc also had me do a ct scan on my right lung. There is a nodule there. When I went back to my surgeon for follow up today I had her check it out. I guess it shrunk. I about fell over when she said the lymph node also shrunk. I told her the chemo and Femera is helping. She said it could be lung cancer. What I can't figure out if it was lung cancer why would it shrink. Today when I went to the dr. a lady there was crying. I was called in passed her and recognized the pamphlet. She had been dx today. Broke my heart. She was gone by the time I left. I did ask the nurse to please check on her. I read everyday to keep up with everyone. Others think they know what I'm going through. The journey I'm on is shared with all of you. You all are very calming to me. Thank you all for that.",
