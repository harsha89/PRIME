My posting is slightly more specific as my overall cancer area is larger than in those posts. I wanted to understand if people considered lumpectomy where overall area was relatively large 30/40% of the beast. I also would not want to do breast reduction (esp to my healthy breast) esp since after lumpectomy it may be determined that i still have some cancer cells on the edges and still need a mastectomy (would like to avoid having to reduce breasts and still needing a mastectomy). ML1209 how did you find the option that was offered to you - a mini lift with prosthesis? Do you know if you may still need a reduction if, for example, prosthesis does not dissolve?",

Initially they found only 1 lump around 2.5cm but now it seems that there is another one around 1.5cm and some potentially pre-cancerous cells. Given extent of lumps, it seems like i have 2 options, do a lumpectomy (which will reduce my breast by at least 30%) or have a mastectomy with reconstruction. Also if i do lumpectomy first it does not mean that i won't need mastectomy later if more cancerous cells are found on edges; also they will need to reduce my other breast to match the right one or insert an implant to cover the bit that was cut out. I would really like to avoid mastectomy if i can being young and worried about the lack of sensitivity post reconstruction (as well as extensive reconstruction surgery) but given the extent of actual plus potential cancer, i wonder if it even makes sense to consider doing lumpectomy first?
