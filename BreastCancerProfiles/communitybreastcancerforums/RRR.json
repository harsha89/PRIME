Like RNKaren, I ordered my wigs online from TLC.  I just ordered a half dozen and sent back the ones that I did not like.  Their return policy is great, postage is nominal - worth it trying on the wigs in the privacy of my own home.  I was happy with them and lucky to find ones that looked like my regular hair at the time - one was longer and curlier and became my date wig. When one wore out (I was rough with the brush at first) they were inexpensive enough to order another.  I used a wig sock under my wigs - a little hot at times because I am in Florida but I had a fear of my wig flying off during work and it made it snug enough, not itchy at all. I did not have to wash the wig as much, just rinsed the sock nightly. Their kits for shampoo, stands, etc. are priced well and worth a look even if you purchase your wig elsewhere.  Be well",

I had that plus a touch of depression too. The worst was the first 3 months; 7 months later I am still extremely tired at times and just give in to a nap.  I do take a med, Provigil to stay awake.  It is a drug that I used before rads since I have sleep apnea  but also shift workers use it to stay awake too.  Others on the boards have used Ritalin for the same reason.  Perhaps your doctor can prescribe something for you if your fatigue is debilitating you.   Week by week your foggy feeling should lift.

      "Content": "Aug 5, 2008 10:35PM - edited Aug 5, 2008 10:39PM by RRR Hi Snufflesmom, A year ago I had half of my thyroid removed at the same time as I was being diagnosed with breast cancer. I was actually more worried about my thyroid because I had a clicky feeling in my throat for some time before and we thought the newly found breast lump was just a cyst.  My thyroid tests were always within normal limits. I had a fine needle biopsy that did not yield enough cells to test and since my lump was 3cm (same size as my breast lump and positive lymph node, just a coincidence), decision was made to remove just the lumpy half.  They did a regular biopsy during the surgery and if it was positive, they would have removed the whole thyroid.  Outpatient surgery is same for both, just a small incision in fold at base of throat so not noticeable.  Two hours later you are on your way home with a drain and steri-strips, both will be removed in days. I was driving the day after the drain was out. Since I did not have cancer, well thyroid cancer, I did not have to drink anything radioactive.  They said to not to get sun on the incision line - piece o'cake since my next 9 months consisted of chemo, rads, recon.  A year later you cannot really see it.  Initially I was told the remaining side would take over thyroid function and I would not need meds but recently I had to go on low dose, probably due to rads.  I have since read that they can do a laproscopic type procedure that would minimize scar.  I remember at the time thinking my thyroid biopsy and later surgery was the very worst thing that could happen to me......I found the breast lump after I banged myself while I was buying drinks and soups for post surgery diet.....paper cut in comparison to what lay ahead.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery!",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2008 09:23AM - edited Jul 11, 2008 09:34AM by RRR Last year my oncologist told me 75% chance of reoccurance.  Not stage III but a high grade. This was after bilateral mastectomy with every lymph node removed but before chemo and radiation.  Three months ago at my check up I was still NED and he said he thinks this may have been a one shot thing for me and I will be okay.  I don't think they really know and give us the higher number.  It might make us work harder to have our treatments and exercise, etc.  I am sure it has the reverse effect on some women causing stess and depression.  In any case I had my pre-visit bloodwork drawn and only allow myself to freak the week before my visit and hopefully I will still be in the clear. If I worried about the number from the onset and thought about it daily, I don't think I would have tolerated surgery to reconstruction as well. I keep in mind a radiology tech I met early on when I was having a sterotatic biopsy. We spent a lot of time talking that afternoon and she made the comment that you never know what life will bring, you just have to live, and you can always get hit by a bus (we laughed because I always use that analogy).  She was young and healthy and died suddenly six months later.  I would never have thought to outlive her at the time.",

I had a gyn checkup between chemo and radiation and she felt that there was enough estrogen there to have it return even though I was nearly 44 at the time.  I was actually happy for it's return because after my little taste of menopause during chemo, I certainly did not want the added fun of the symptoms while I was trying to regain strength.  Of course since I have not had a period except for the last four months without benefit of birth control pills, they are a lot heavier than I expected. I get a warm flushing - not hot flash - that's new for me and usually the next day my period starts.  Big lecture from my oncologist last week about how I should not get pregnant for two years, etc. and to use extra protection since I can't have birth control pills.  Next year I will likely have a hysterectomy and deal with the effects of menopause when I am ready for it.",

It seemed the more I did, the more I would felt like I was wearing a keg. I tried light exercise at 4 weeks - too sensitive still and waited until after six weeks. Now that I am three months out, I still have some sensitive areas, especially on my ribs under breasts (I had bilateral) but the swelling has gone down. I monitor how flat my abd incision line looks on my hips - if I start to get a muffin top above the incision line, I slow down.  It's hard, sometimes I am on my feet for several hours with little break time during work.  Time and taking it easy while you are recuperating will help your abd settle down before you return to work.  Also, I noticed the amount of salt in my diet has an effect on how swollen or soft my midsection.  I had Chipolte Grill this evening with my daughter and I know I will pay for it in the morning. Wishing you a speedier recovery",

I plan on asking my LE therapist if this would be helpful for me, sounds like something I could do more harm than good experimenting with on my own.

Just be sure your drains are really finished draining to avoid other complications. It's good to take things one step at a time and not read too far ahead. Funny story - I had a thyroidectomy a month before my mastectomy - unrelated. I had a drain in my neck, the first one in my life.  Two days later, I met with the surgeon for follow up. I told him I felt a little nauseous thinking about the drain removal.  He said not to worry, I'll pull it on three.  One....two...yank! and it was out.  He said ha, I betcha I can't trick you like that again.  At that moment, I vomited on his shoes, he jumped back letting go of the direct pressure he was putting on my drain hole causing blood to spurt over my white shirt (only my neck drain hole really bled).  I instantly felt better and I said to him I betcha you won't be tricking me like that again!",
