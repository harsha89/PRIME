I was informed that they considered me to be at low to moderate risk but as a precaution agreed that I could start screening for BC early (I was 47) I never received this. I was diagnosed with IDC on 10 April 2012 stage 3A grade 3 and had mastectomy, Chemo and radiotherapy. As my circumstances had changed I went back to the genetic clinic (as did my sister) and this time I was seen by a doctor who tested me for the BRCA gene and also because there was a significant occurrence of cancer in our family also tested for the Chek2 gene when the BRCA came back negative. The problem is that not many people seem to know that much about it but when I informed my Breast surgeon about it he compiled his own research and so far has agreed to annual mammograms and a longer follow up period. However, the genetic clinic refused to test my sister for this gene defect saying that somehow it was inconclusive. I am unsure if she has pursued the testing privately (we are not close) I am currently on Letrozole after brief sessions of Tamoxifen for 18 months and Exemestane for 5 months. As far as preventative surgery goes (ie. undergoing mastectomy of the other breast) I am against this type of action and will cross this bridge if I come to it. Statistic may indicate that I am at 59% of chance of recurrence or a new cancer but, that means there is 41% that I am not I do not regret my decision to be tested however, as its much easier to deal with things I know about than things I don't.",
