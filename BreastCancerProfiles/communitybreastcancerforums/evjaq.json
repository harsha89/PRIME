They were painful and achy and I had trigger finger. Then that subsided and I started to have trouble in my feet. I have arthritis so I was attributing the problems to that. The foot Doctor diagnosed it as Bursitis and spurs and possible gout. It has continued to get worse and now my ankles are affected. Now it is rare that I can walk normal. I'm always having some kind of spur or Bursitis attack. At this point my foot Doctor seems stymied. I spoke to my Oncologist about what's going on and he seems on the fence about it. I'm at my wits end. I fear I'll never be able to walk right again. Has this happened to anyone else? Please I really need some feedback Thanks Log in to post a reply",
