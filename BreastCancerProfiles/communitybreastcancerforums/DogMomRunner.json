I thought it was probably a fibroid (which I had in the other breast years ago). Last week I had the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. Yesterday I saw the radiologist report and got a bit nervous when I found out what BI-RADS 5 meant. Today I had the biopsy. I asked the breast nurse navigator how often a 5 came back as non cancerous. She just smiled at me. Sadly.

      "Content": "DogMomRunner wrote: I thought everything was a go until I met with the MO yesterday. He wants to punt it back to the surgeon for surgery first and then chemo. But he also said that if the surgeon really felt she couldn't get good margins then he would do the chemo first. He wants to have more information about stage before starting chemo (basically if it needs to include Perjeta and another chemo drug or just Taxol and Herceptin). Which is a legitimate concern I think. So I drove over to see the BS after MO appointment for another US. Now the BS is not so sure about the 1.3cm size estimate. She is thinking it is possibly 1.5-1.8cm because of some dense tissue surrounding it. She really wants to do lumpectomy instead of mastectomy and is worried about it because I have smaller breasts. So she wants an MRI. And she wanted to delay my port placement (tomorrow) until MRI results. I told her that I thought I should go ahead and the get the port done Friday. Both MO and BS say I'm not going to avoid chemo so why not? I have already go the pre-op work done and the day off. My MRI has been scheduled for next Tuesday. I think both the MO and the BS have legitimate concerns but I kind of feel like ticking time bomb. What if the tumor has grown since diagnosis. I want it gone, like as in yesterday You ain't run far enough to say My legs have failed You ain't gone far enough You ain't worked hard enough You ain't run far enough to say It ain't gonna get any better.
