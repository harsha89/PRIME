It was hard, rubbery, about the size of a marble, and moves freely within the breast, all characteristics of a fibroadenoma. After a physical examination he sent me to have an ultrasound, they took measurements and that dr. also suspected a fibroadenoma.I also had a dr. do a fine needle aspiration on it, and he sent in whatever cells were collected, and I haven't heard anymore about that. They wanted to do another ultrasound two weeks later, but I was 5 months pregnant, and had complications arise. I needed emergency surgery performed on my placenta the same day the appt was scheduled for. Then I was on bed rest, and had 2-3 o.b appts every week, so I decided I would come back post partum because I didn't want to provoke premature labor anymore than I had to as I was pregnant with twins. Anyways I was not only scared because I found a lump, but my mother and both grandmas have had breast cancer, but theirs was all post-menopausal and they were all on hormonal therapy. I am only 22 yrs old, but thought I would get this checked out just to be safe. So 5 weeks post partum I am calling them back to schedule another ultrasound. I don't want a biopsy done at this time, because I am nursing. My babies are still in the hospital because they were born 9 weeks early, so I have to pump, and I won't be able to with all the bruising from the biopsy and fear this will dry me out. So after this long explanation of whats going on my question is this; has anyone else had a lump develop during pregnancy? I had an exam when I had my annual a month before I conceived, and it was not there. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks ~Malinda Log in to post a reply",
