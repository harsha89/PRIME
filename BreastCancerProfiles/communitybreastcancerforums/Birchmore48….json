An abscess then formed , antibiotics did not help , so had to have op to open wound for it to drained cleaned and packed . That seems to be healing nicely , but I now have a bit of a swelling about the lymph node wound. Breast clinic have said over the phone that it sounds like a seroma and unless it gets infected , is nothing to worry about . My question is - I am due to see oncology nurses on Friday June 3 to find out when chemo will start . Will this seroma cause a problem with the start of treatment? Should the breast ckknjc/ my surgeon or BC nurses 've doing anything to disperse this build up of fluid ? Log in to post a reply",

Apparently my chemo was due to start on June 7, but as wound was still very slightly open, they called one of the doctors in to advise. It has been postponed - but only by a week - to 13 June , as he wanted to give wound one final week to fully heal over . Im ok with waiting just a week - better to be safe than sorry x Just torn now between feeling relieved that something positive is happening towards recovery and being shit scared ( excuse the language ) xx But I know I will get thru this xxx",
