It was discovered that only 25% of folks have cancer as aggresive as mine, and I'm due to start chemo soon, but felt as though it was down-hill from here. Oh oh, spot discovered on liver....kaboom...and my oncologist outright told me that if it's cancer, I will be dead in 2 years!! So I am now waiting for the results of my liver biopsy and frantically looking for some hope. Also trying to find a new oncologist. Anyone in a similair situation? Log in to post a reply",

Har-har...bartender....occupational hazard. I've decided to subject myself to an unusually long wait period for the results,however, as I refuse to see that oncologist again. I'll take the news from whoever my new one turns out to be. Love the pooch photo, and don't you just love that we can avoid kids during chemo but still sleep with our dogs?",
