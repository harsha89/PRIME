Asking for help with everything from getting a glass of water to getting dinner started and cleaned up was definitely humbling and frustrating for me. I'm really independent, too, and used to doing everything for myself and my family. It isn't easy doing nothing. We have a full slate of surgeries for the June group this coming week. I hope everyone has a happy and peaceful weekend. Getty. ",

You'll wake up from your surgery on June 21 and you'll go forward from there, one step at a time. I'm so sorry that you are having to do all of this a second time! seh:  3 weeks with the drain! Yikes!!  The small incision for the drain took about three days to close up for me. I'm 9 days past getting the drain removed and there's just a scab left behind now. Circe:  You're a brave lady and I know you will be fine on Tuesday. I'll be thinking of you and praying for you. MistyJ:  I am definitely feeling better every single day. There are times when I can actually forget about the surgery and the TE's. I will also be thinking of you on Tuesday. Wishing for strength and courage for all facing surgery this week, and for healing and comfort to all of us recovering from our surgeries. My first fill is on Monday! Getty. ",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2010 02:05PM - edited Jun 21, 2010 02:06PM by almagetty Good morning everyone! I'm keeping all of this week's surgery ladies in my thoughts and prayers. There are quite a few this week. Sheila: Welcome. Liz: My PS marked the incision 6 days before my surgery. He instructed me to shower as usual and then to retrace the marking with a Sharpie pen after I had dried off. It pretty much ruined a couple of bras, but it worked.  He also instructed me to shower using an anti-bacterial soap on my chest the night before surgery and the morning of. He didn't specify a brand and told me that the anti-bacterial hand soap that I normally buy was fine. As far as using my arm, I had a RMX not a BMX. I was able to use my arm pretty much as normal from the elbow down. Lifting my arm was hard for anything past about a 45 degree angle from my body for the first days. I did not have a SNB, since I had that done back in March when I had my initial lumpectomy. Robin: Good luck on your Psych evaluation today. Hi Marm!  Lucy: I still have a little bit of fluid buildup on the outside side of my scar, where I have a bruise. I'm pretty sure it has gone down a little bit in the last couple of days. It definitely has not increased since they took the drain out. My drain came out 10 days ago. seh: I hope your drain starts drying up really soon. The drain is a huge PITA. My PS's nurse recommended that I cut way down on my activity in order to get the drainage to stop. I did, but I'm not sure it made that much of a difference. I hope it happens for you soon.  Laurie: I love your husband's attitude (and yours, too). I don't know that you will be up and around in a couple of days. I was up, but pretty much doing nothing. However it shakes out for you, you will be limited only for a little while. \"This too shall pass.\" More appropriate words were never written for our situation. I have to run and get ready for my visit to the PS. I'm scared and excited about my fill today. It's the first one. I'm scared about the possible pain and discomfort but excited to get \"pumped up\". Happy Monday! Getty. ",

After consulting with a few doctors, I'm going to wait until my reconstruction is all done and then start on it. I figure it will be around mid-October'ish. In the meantime, I'm getting an ultrasound in a couple of weeks to make sure that there are no problems down below, an eye exam to count out cataracts (even though I'm way on the young side for this), and I may start taking a baby aspirin daily in October to help ward off any clotting complications.

I feel bruised on my side where the PS did a small bit of lipo to get rid of a bit of fat, but other than that I feel great. When I took a shower and changed my bandage, I was surprised to see that I don't have a bruise, it just feels that way. As far as the look ... I'm trying hard to be patient and to remember that the PS told me that it would take a month or two before the implant relaxes and drops into place. Right now, it looks a whole lot like a hamburger bun. It's definitely situated in the right place, unlike the TE which was way high, but it doesn't look like my natural side yet.

I'm excited/nervous to take this next (and hopefully last) step in the reconstruction. I had my pre-op appointment yesterday with the PS. We're going ahead with the micro-fat grafting to correct the step-off that I have on the top inner quadrant. And then, of course, we're doing the nipple/areola reconstruction. The nipple will be some sort of flap procedure. The areola will be a graft from my lower abdomen. No cones for me, though. I'll have a sponge-like thing sewn on top of the graft for a week. That will then be removed at my post-op appointment. I'll then have to wear a gauze between the graft and my bra for an additional 10 days. Then I'm home free!

I went to my PS' office today and the nurse removed the sponge and all the stitches. I didn't see the PS, but the nurse told me that, barring any complications, I am done with them. It was a little weird, I think, to be dismissed by the nurse without seeing the PS at all after surgery, but whatever. She said that in 2-3 months, if I feel that I need to tattoo the new nipple/areola to match my natural side, to give them a call and the PS will do it in the office. I think that if I decide to go with a tattoo, I'm going to go with one of the 3D tattoo people like Facecrafter (Judy) who posts on this board.  I had a slight scare as I was changing the dressing on my new nipple/areola just now. One of the scabs had stuck to the gauze and it seemed to me that the skin graft came up oh so slightly in one small area. My husband checked it out carefully and he thinks that it was just the scab that came off, but I'll be keeping a careful eye on it. This is all a bit nerve-wracking.  Getty ",

I wore blouses instead of t-shirty clingy type tops, and no one was the wiser. The more difficult things to hide, still, are the bruises from the fat grafting. The darker bruises are pretty high up on my chest, so I have to be careful with necklines. This is one time that I'm not happy that our Florida temperatures are still in the 80's! ",

If it helps you to know this, the SNB shot was not painful for me in the very least. The pre-op nurse had freaked me out by telling me how much it would hurt. The doctor who administered it told me it would be felt for about 10 seconds and then it would go away, and that's exactly what happened.  What I did feel wasn't a pain, just more of a sensation.   When I decided on May 3 which PS to go with, I was told by the BS's office that it would take approximately 3 weeks for the two surgeons to coordinate their schedules.  Lo and behold, the BS office called me that very same afternoon that my surgery was scheduled for May 7.   I was the one who asked them to re-schedule.  It was just too soon for me.  And, we had been planning to take a long weekend away for Mother's Day, just me, my husband and my two daughters (age 20 & 16).  We were holding tickets to see my very favorite musician in the world on May 8 in a nearby city and were going to be staying at the beach for 3 days around it.  Call me crazy, but I really needed the break.  So, the next date available was June 2.  I didn't expect it to be so far away, but truly it was only 2 weeks after the tentative schedule that the BS had given me to begin with. I don't think I'm nervous about the surgery itself, either. I think I'm more worried about the recovery and the expansion. Like you said, each of us will have a journey that is unique, but I also find great comfort (mostly) in reading the stories of others that have already traveled this path.  I was just reading in the January thread. They are a wonderful, really upbeat group. It's awesome to read about their completing their exchanges and nipple surgeries.  Soon, we'll be there, too. Now, to get past this next little bit ... ",

You guys in the previous months' threads are a real inspiration to me. It's good to read about the recovery phase. Laurie, I hate it when my mind's wheel starts turning in the middle of the night! My GP gave my a prescription for a very low-dose Xanax when all this started out back in March.  I have yet to fill that prescription, but is that something that one of your doctors might do for you? My doctor told me that it's an anti-anxiety and would help me get a good night's sleep.  She also assured me that she would make sure that I didn't get addicted. I don't know how that's accomplished, but she seemed to know what she was talking about. reneemac, your 8 year old sounds like a real sweetheart! I teared up at the \"Thunder Cake\" story. It's amazing how kids are able to say the perfect thing!  \"Out of the mouths of babes ...\"!  I hope your hospital lets her come to visit. I know that many times the hospitals will bend the rules when the visit doesn't involve infectious diseases. Will you have a private room? That will also probably make a difference. StacyA, welcome to our little group. I'm sorry that we all have to get to know each other because of stupid BC, but I'm glad of the support that I've been able to find here. You do have such a full plate and it is infinitely unfair that you (and we!) have been dealt this hand. Are there friends you can call on to help? Nearby family?  I did all my pre-admission stuff this morning at the hospital. On Wednesday morning, I just need to walk in to the surgery center and go. The PS office suggested I buy the little string-thing that people use to hang their eyeglasses around their necks to hold my drain bulb.  Do you know that I can't find one anywhere? I checked at Target, at an Optical store, at a couple of places in the mall, at Walgreen's and at the grocery store and no luck! If anyone has any good ideas on where to look next, please let me know. Getty. ",

I hope everyone who went in for their surgeries this week is resting comfortably and getting on with the business of recovering. I had my RMX with TE on Wednesday. I'm feeling better than I ever dared to hope I would. The pain is manageable with the Vicodin that the BS prescribed. I'm actually pretty mobile.  So far, the hardest thing by far has been getting comfortable in bed. I finally settled on four pillows stacked one on top of the other, so that I'm basically sitting up.  I have a full body pillow that I placed on my right side, which allows me to curl me legs and rest them on the pillow.  This keeps my right arm nice and tight against my body, which is surprisingly comfortable.  I also have a little pillow for the small of my back. The PS had to use alloderm to create a sling for the TE because of the way my pectoral muscle sits on my chest. The pec cuts across really high. Because of the alloderm, he was able to fill to 300 cc.'s, which means I only need about 150-200 cc's more for my exchange. Yay! Good news for me. Three or four fills should do it. My first fill is tentatively scheduled for the 23rd, with subsequent fills happening every two weeks after that. I have one drain with a ridiculously long tube. It doesn't hurt, I'm not even aware of it most of the time. It's just a bit awkward looking. Hopefully, they will take it out at my post-op visit with the PS on Wednesday. I spent one night in the hospital as planned. I can't say enough wonderful things about the staff at the hospital. Everyone was so kind and helpful. There was no lag time between any request I made and getting that request fulfilled. The anticipation of the surgery and the fear of what it would be like was definitely worse than the actuality of it all. Hang in there everyone! I've found that taking things one moment at a time helps tremendously. Laurie, don't beat yourself up about needing that alone time in your backyard. I think you are doing a terrific job holding everything together. ",

You're both in my thoughts and prayers. Laurie: I've found the most comfortable thing for me to wear are the sleepshirts made from t-shirty material that I normally prefer to wear to sleep.  I bought a couple at Target the week before my surgery that button down about to my belly button.  I just step into them and pull them up.  The pj's with pants make me incredibly hot at night, plus it was not so comfortable to pull the pants up in the bathroom the first couple of days home from the hospital.  I'm not sure about lifting my arm up over my head.  I think I could if I tried, but my PS told me to not lift my arm past a 45 degree angle until he gave me the go ahead. (It's still amazing to me all the different rules the different PS's have.  Lift your arm, don't lift your arm. Wear a bra, don't wear a bra.) I don't know what to say about the sex, except perhaps to follow the great advice that I got from a survivor about everything else.  She told me not to do things I didn't want to do, and not to do things only because I felt I had to. She told me, rather, to do the things I want to do and that bring me joy. I guess only you can decide where sex would fit into this for you.  I'm still above the 20ml in my drain, so I'm fully expecting to have to keep the stupid drain for a few more days after tomorrow.   Yes, BC sucks big time. ",

Her graduation will happen at the beginning of June, two days after my niece's wedding. All in all, a much happier June for 2011 than for 2010! I'll take it!  Hugs to all! Getty ",

The nurse told me it could be as soon as mid-August, but I'm aiming for the last week of August or the first week of September. I look pretty darned even, though I do have to give my \"real\" side a nice lift with a good bra to get it up to the same level as the TE. Renee, my family and I are going on a cruise, too, in the beginning of August. I have a couple of bathing suits with good support and I think that I look pretty normal with them on. Now, my tummy and behind are a different story ... :/ I've found that the bathing suits that cross in the front hide any differences a lot better than the bathing suits that are cut straight across in the front.  I hope Melissa's surgery today is going well.

I got a second opinion, which was almost exactly the same as my 1st onc's advice. The 2nd opinion doctor (who I absolutely loved, btw) told me to just give it a try, and if the side effects were awful, I could just stop knowing that I had given it a fair shake. It made a lot of sense, so that's what I'll do. I'll be starting on it after all my PS surgeries are done, so probably by mid-Oct. Jane: It is unbearably hot in Orlando, too!

It lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes. The PS did a lot of pocket work, removing scar tissue beneath the TE which allowed him to place the implant on the same plane as my natural breast. I have no pain. I did take a Tylenol at about 3 AM, but that was for a headache. I have some discomfort on my side, where the PS did a bit of lipo to remove some fat. He told me to expect to bruise there. He asked me to keep it iced down for the next three days. The implant seems flat to me right now, resembling a hamburger bun. It does have a bit of tight bandaging on it, so that might be part of the reason why. Also, I think that the implant will 'fluff\" up as the weeks progress. The PS told my husband that he was really happy with the symmetry he was able to achieve. This is most definitely the easiest of the surgeries so far. I'm one step closer to done! Getty. ",

As you said, mentally it has been wonderful to get out among people and have other things to think about besides BC. I no longer feel like a patient, but like a regular person going about her life. Truth be told, I rarely think about BC during the course of the day. The PS lipo'd the area that is usually covered by a bra on my side, facing the inside of my upper arm. (Does that make sense?) It wasn't so much sore as bruised. It hurt like a bruise, too, so the first few days it was like I had been punched, but after that it only hurt if I bumped it. The bruises looked like long fingers leading from closer to my back towards the lipo incision. There were three lines. The incision was tiny, closed by a single stitch that was removed at my one week post-op visit. How would you get to Vegas? How far is it from you? I think you should leave the option open, if you can, until you see how you feel. It's the coming and the going that might trip you up.

How fattening can it truly be? ;)  Thanks for your words of encouragement! I am nervous and excited in equal parts. Being done sounds wonderful. I can hardly believe that it will happen. I've gotten so much strength from our group here. I couldn't have made it through the past months without all of you. My job has been a godsend! I love going to work every day and being useful and not having time to think about what has been and what is coming. My brother-in-law is always telling me how grateful he and my sister are that I am there helping them out, but honestly I've benfited just as much. My whole outlook is much more positive. And I'm having fun to boot. I'm so sorry to hear about your grandfather! Is this the grandpa you told us about who has the vegetable garden in his yard? I love that story! Hugs to you as you go through these tough days. Our weather is Florida has been unbelievably beautiful for the past few days. The skies are a piercing blue with not a cloud in sight. I'm sitting on my back deck right now. The sun is starting to set. It's a comfortable 70 degrees. Perfect!  Getty ",

I saw my PS this afternoon and it actually made the whole thing a lot better. I hadn't seen a doctor for over a month and I think that, much as I wanted to ignore it, it ended up giving me a lot of anxiety. Talking to the doctor and nurse today was very calming for me. I think it is because they just exude confidence that everything is going to be fine. They were both so calm and answered all my questions. It seems that, in my heart of hearts, I'm relieved that this train is moving forward again. Even my grumpiness is gone ... for the moment, anyway. Surgery-wise, I'll have one drain to deal with for (hopefully) one week until my post-op appointment. I'll have interior stitches that will dissolve on their own. I'll leave the hospital with a very soft sports-type bra that closes at the front. There will be steri-strips on the incision and a gauze between my skin and the bra. The gauze will stay in place until my first shower 2 days after surgery, and then I only have to replace it if the incision isn't \"dry\".  The amount of saline that he'll place in the TE will depend on whether he needs to use Alloderm or not. If he does use it he'll be able to fill to about 220, if not then to about 100. If anyone has any other questions, I'll try to answer them. Laurie, I like to say that I'm a stay-at-home mom that has been retired. My older daughter is away at college most of the year, but now she's home and working for the summer. My younger daughter is finishing up her Junior year in high school and drives.  She works part-time after school.  This BC caught me as I tried to figure out what to do next with my life.  If anything, I have way too much time to think. I remember those days of having the girls small and at home. I loved those days, but I was sure busy all the time! I can't imagine how you're dealing with this whole nightmare, too! Go easy on yourself where and when you can.  Reneemac, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that your date is firm. I think it's an excellent sign that everything is still moving forward.  jmac: I, too, am so sorry about the baby. I had written a response to you the other night and then got locked out by the \"5 posts a day for newbies\" rule. I'll say an extra prayer for you tonight. Please consider yourself hugged.  (((jmac))) Tomorrow morning I go in for all my pre-op testing at the hospital. I'll let you guys know how that goes.  Getty. ",

This morning I was at 10ml. I have to be at around 20ml total for two straight days before the PS will remove the drain. So I'm sitting very still today and tomorrow and only getting up to go to the bathroom. The nurse feels that will do the trick. Now, the good news ... my final path report is in and it is all clear!!!!!!!  They found a lot more DCIS spread throughout the bottom half of the breast, but it's all non-invasive and the margins are really good. The mastectomy was definitely necessary because of the extent of the spread. That's really good for me to know, because it was a judgement call on whether to have the mastectomy or to try to treat with rads. The BS and the radiation onc strongly recommended the MX, but it was still my call and a really difficult one for me to make.  So, no rads for me and no chemo!!!!  I think I see a light at the end of this tunnel ... My first fill will be in two weeks and I should need only 3 fills to get to where I need to be.  The PS does fills every 2 weeks. I was so darned scared to get the path report! Orchidgirl: The day I walked into the PS's office was the hardest day to date for me, too.  I think it's because that is the first time I had to tell someone that I was getting an MX. Before that, it was the medical staff saying it to me.  When the PS sat in front of me and asked me what I needed from him, I just started crying. I'm so happy to see that marm, reneemac, lucylou, & gettingpastthis are all on the mend and doing well.  I'm seriously jealous that marm got her drains out. I'm also glad that my experience is making the load a little lighter for the later June girls and others who may be reading here. I know that I was fervently reading the May and January threads before my surgery, hoping to find a little peace and comfort. And those ladies and their stories always helped to calm my fears immensely. I'm glad to be able to pay it forward.  Stay strong and believe! Getty ",

I hate having to ask others to do the things I would normally do, like empty the dishwasher and start dinner. It's humbling to ask for help. I don't want to gloat, but I also won't lie. Having the drain out is wonderful! Showering is so much more enjoyable and not having to deal with the grenade shaped drain and its accompanying tube is a huge relief. Your day will come, reneemac, and when it does, it will be glorious. But there's no sense rushing the drains out before they're ready. That would bring a whole different set of problems.  I stopped wearing the surgical bra because the band was killing me. I switched over to some front clasping sports bras that I bought at WalMart. They were really inexpensive. They come in a two pack and I think they were less than $10 for both of them. They are really a lot more comfortable for me. The PS told me I could wear them in the daytime and could wear nothing at all under my pj's at night if I wanted. I found that I'm more comfortable wearing a cami under the pjs though as it gives me some support. I hope everyone's weekend was happy! Getty. ",

I took the Vitamin C on my own. I figured it would help my body's defenses against the random summer cold. The nutritionist that my oncologist had me consult with also has me taking Calcium, Vitamin D3 and Omega-3 every day. FYI, at my pre-op appointment at the hospital when I got all my bloodwork and stuff done, the RN told me to stop taking the Omega-3's until after my surgery because it is an anti-coagulant (sp?).

My rule of thumb for doing things is if it hurts, pulls or tugs, don't do it! Little by little things will get back to normal. My Mx was June 2 and I can tell you that it's just been in the past week that I've felt that I can do almost everything without pain or a pulling sensation. One thing I can't do is lean on my arm to lift myself out of the couch when I'm laying down, or push myself out of the car. That still hurts. I started driving again once I felt that my range of motion for my arm was close to 100% and when I could comfortably turn to look over my shoulder. Did you find your DCIS with a mammogram? I see that you took Tamoxifen after your LCIS. My onc wants me to start taking it now and I just can't decide what to do! Laurie: It's great to see you posting! I'm glad you're home. Your husband sounds like a great guy! How sweet is Jacob!?! I'm sure your poor little guy is sooooo confused! Sending healing thoughts your way ... Yesterday I realized that there are actually times in the day (more every day!) when thoughts of BC, my surgery and the TE completely leave my mind. A lot of the time, I forget about them altogether for extended periods until a movement causes a twinge, or I see an upcoming doctor's appointment on my calendar, or something like that. I guess that's progress, right?  Happy Friday! Getty. ",

When I sit and think too much about it, way too many \"what-if\" scenarios pop into my mind. I guess we have to trust the experts with their prognostications about DCIS. I know, though, that I will be vigilant forever with my health. No more blowing off routine tests for any part of my body. I never blew off the mammo's, but I can't say the same thing about yearly blood work, etc. One of the reasons that I like the set-up of my onc's office is that it is in a hospital, so all the treatment areas are on another floor from her office. It helps to make my visits to her a lot more like \"just another doctor's office\" visit. The only things on the same floor as her are my BS' office and women's radiology. I didn't know that onc offices had the chemo rooms contained in them until I went to my second opinion guy. Like you said, it really brought it all home. You and I dodged that bullet with DCIS. We were lucky this time. God-willing, our luck will hold and, like my GYN told me, this will be the one health crisis of our lifetime.

I'm two and a half weeks out from my exchange surgery now and can sleep comfortably on my side (and even on my stomach if I wanted to, but I'm not really a stomach sleeper). I'm still waiting and hoping for the mythical \"drop & fluff\" so that the implant begins to look more natural. All bandages and steri-strips are now gone and I just have some bruising on my side from the small area the PS lipo'd. This week, I started a brand new job. It's a huge step for me, since I haven't worked outside of home in years. My brother-in-law has a small chiropractic office and my sister is the office manager. She's pregnant and due to deliver next month, so I've taken over for her. It's part-time (about 30 hours a week) and very flexible with time off when I need it. So far, so good.

As to your question, I find that at the beginning, I told everyone who would listen, but as this journey has unfolded, I've been more hesitant to talk about it. It has become more of a private thing for me. Even some of the people that I shared with at the beginning don't know how exactly things have worked out. When they ask, I tell them that I'm fine. And they're happy with that answer. I think it fits into everyone's hope that this is a thing with a definite finish line.  There's that feeling for me of TMI (too much information) when explaining that what my next surgery entails includes things like a new nipple and areola. Right now, the people I confide in are limited to my immediate family mostly. I think your number of 14 people is pretty close to accurate for me. It might actually be a bit on the high side. I love all of the encouraging words that you've brought to our thread today. I'm sorry that so many of our June ladies are going through a hard time right now.

Another post to make me smile. :) Ducki: I know that saying not to be nervous about a surgery is asking the impossible, but ... don't be nervous. This surgery is sooooooo much easier than what we've been through before. The recovery is pretty quick, too. I'm doing great after my exchange. I feel wonderful. The implant has dropped as promised and it has fluffed up a little bit, though not as much as I had hoped. The implant is also so much more comfortable and natural feeling than the TE! It is like night and day. I go see the PS on Tuesday for him to get a look-see and also to schedule my nipple/areola surgery, hopefully for the end of the month. I have a couple of issues I want to discuss with him. On the top part of my breast, I have this sort of flap thing that has some scar tissue (which I can see below the skin) that prevents the breast from moving naturally when I reach forward or reach up, so I have this very strange distortion there where the skin kind of just folds and flops over when I extend my arm. You can't see it when I'm clothed, but I can see it and it's unsightly and annoys the heck out of me. I'm hoping if he is able to remove the scar tissue, it will correct itself. I also have an indentation of nothingness between where the implant originally reached on the top and where it has dropped to. I think the girls on the EC thread refer to this as a shelf. Also, when they say that you will not have projection enough to fill the cone part of the cup in your bra, they aren't lying! I went to Nordstrom today to get a proper bra fitting and my natural side fills my \"C\" cup fully, as always. The implant side leaves the pinnacle of the cone empty. Yikes! Hopefully the nipple and areola surgery will correct this a little bit. It's probably way more noticeable to me as a uni than to those of you who have had a BMX. That is the extent of my gripes. The issues are all minor and hopefully correctable. I can definitely say that I'm in a much better place now than I was with the TE's. Enjoy what's left of the weekend! Getty ",

It's so wonderful to have a place to come where everyone understands the strange situation we're all in. I went to Nordstrom today and got new bras. Ladies, check with your insurance companies and see what they will pay for as far as bras go after your mastectomies. Better yet, go to Nordstrom and ask them. My insurance company is VERY generous with their allowance. Here's to hoping for a nice fluffy bunny year ... Getty ",

After the PS removed that, I didn't have to wear anything over the NAC except a simple gauze, and that was only to protect my bra from the polysporin that I had to apply twice a day to the area for three weeks after surgery.

There's nothing to do but march right into that closet, turn on your light and see that whatever is in there isn't as scary as what you had imagined. Believe that your MRI is accurate. It's something to hold onto on this crazy ride. If anything, MRI tends to show false positives. I was walking in the parking garage today before my BS appointment asking myself how the heck I had ended up in this position ... having just gone through a mastectomy ... walking to find out what other little surprises the path report had in store for me. Never in a million years would I have imagined myself in this place four months ago. Life is unpredictable and cancer is cruel. I hate that all of us here have had to learn this. Getty. ",

We try our best to hold each other up and cheer each other on. Melissa & Laurie: I had SNB with my initial lumpectomy on 3/26. The doctor who injected the dye told me he couldn't use lidocaine since he had found that it sometimes affected the ability of the  dye to spread as it needed to. I think we have another instance of different strokes for different doctors. Honestly, even without the lidocaine, I felt nothing past a small burning sensation as the liquid went in, much like you can get with a vaccination. The burning lasted less than 10 seconds and we were done. Gettingpastthis: It's great to hear from you. I'm sorry to hear you had some painful days in there. What wonderful news about the success of your chemo treatments!!! Marm!!!!  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NED!!!!  My education of terminology and acronyms continues. These letters, at least, are a joy to learn and to see. Melissa: Step 1 for you ... done!!!  Ice and tylenol will be your friends for a couple of days. Thanks for the advice about the steristrips.  I think I'll keep them on (if they stay stuck) and give the nurse the pleasure of stripping them off on Monday.  Wifemomx2 & StaceyA: Sending strength & courage to you both. Laurie: I slept in my bed, too, from day 1. I bought one of those body pillows on sale at Target for $9.99 and placed it in the middle of the bed to keep my husband from accidentally bumping up against me in his sleep and also to offer support to my right side. It was nice to curl my legs against it and not feel like I was sleeping straight on my back all the time. It was also nice to have my right arm cushioned against my side. I used 3 pillows under my head, so that I was practically sitting up anyway, but like you, I'm not a chair sleeper. MistyJ: Having mom & grandma there will give you so much peace! Jeanne: I hope your drain and your wrap come out today! I didn't have any bandages at all, except for the steristrips.  jbicsw10:  Patience and living in the moment are definitely two talents I've improved in the past four months. Two positive things to take away from this. I'm sorry you're having to experience all this again. I took an Aleve last night because I'd had a pretty hectic day and was feeling some pain and discomfort.  I wanted to see if the muscle relaxant in the Aleve would work better than the Tylenol.  It did!!!  I have been completely pain and discomfort free since.  I got the best night's sleep I've had since I don't even know when and haven't even felt a twinge of anything this morning. Let's hope it holds out ... Happy day to everyone!  Getty.",

It was an idea that I was sad and angry about all the way up to my surgery. But it's okay. I've really come to be okay with it. I'm looking forward to seeing what the PS comes up with when it's time to recreate the nipple. Does anyone remember the show \"The Bionic Woman\" from the late 70's? I kind of feel like her sometimes. The show used to start with the quote \"We can rebuild her. We have the technology. We can make her better, stronger, faster ...\" LOL Three days in the hospital might not be a bad thing. You'll have that wonderfully convenient hospital bed at your disposal. And the nurses will deal with your drains for you. If the attention at your hospital is anywhere near as great as it was at mine, I think you'll appreciate being there. But the food was really not great. The PS came in to see me the morning after my surgery and basically looked at the incision, told me it looked fine but to ice the bruise and then promptly left. I found that the BS and her residents were a lot more involved with my care, but the nurses were most involved of all and quite helpful. I think, knowing what I know now, I would be totally okay if the PS wasn't around in the days immediately following my surgery. By the way, I've removed 9 of my 13 steristrips. It was completely pain free. I kept the last four on because they are covering the end of the scar that is still bruised and swollen. I remembered what you said about the strips keeping the swelling down and wanted to keep them on there as long as possible. I'll remove them tomorrow after my shower.  Jane: Thanks for the warrior designation. I do feel like a warrior. And I have a heckuva battle scar to prove it. But I am still standing and strong despite it.  We will all beat this stupid disease. The 28th will be here and past before you know it. Getty. ",

I guess I misunderstood how they determine how much they're going to put in.  I had thought that it was until that moment when the pressure became painful for me. In actuality, it's a function of how much the pectoral muscle allows them to get in. The nurse told me she would put in at least 50cc, but possibly as much as 100cc. In the end, my chest muscle would not allow a drop more than 75cc. So, I have a total of 375cc's in now, and I have to get to 500cc. She says she'll do 100cc in two weeks, and then the last 25cc two weeks after that. At that point, the PS will evaluate whether we're done with fills and we'll schedule the exchange for a month later.  Now, if i wear a bra that gives me a little bit of lift on my non-surgery side, I look almost even in clothes. I'm quite enchanted with the newly bigger breast. I'll confess to sneaking several peeks in the bathroom mirror. This is definitely the happier side of this journey.  Getty. ",

      "Content": "Mar 30, 2011 12:37PM - edited Mar 30, 2011 12:38PM by almagetty I haven't even thought of setting up an appointment for a tattoo. I find that I'm increasingly indifferent about getting the tattoo done at all. Maybe I'll skip it for now. The only reason to have it is so that my reconstructed areola matches the natural one more, color-wise. Eh ... like I said ... I find I don't really care one way or the other. I think I just reached my quota of having things \"done\". I'm so happy to not be poked and prodded these days. Now, bra shopping is something I've grown to enjoy a little too much. Since my insurance company pays for all the bras that I get at Nordstrom (yes. All the bras. No limits in number or dollars.), I have a ridiculous number of bras now. So I've promised myself to allow myself only two bra shopping adventures a year. And to restrict myself to 7-10 bras per spree. Leave it to me to feel guilty about taking too much of something that is part of my insurance benefit. Laurie: I've also noticed some twinges in my reconstructed breast lately. Not so much a true pain, more like a sensation. I like your explanation of the implant settling in. My husband says it might also be some of the nerves regenerating. I go see my OB/GyN for my yearly next week. I'll ask him to see what he thinks. ",

Today has been pretty crappy so far. It's designated cleaning day and everything is supposed to run like clockwork. I woke up at 5:30 AM to put in the first load of bedsheets and get lunches packed for my daughters (I know, I know ... at nearly 17 and 20, they can do this for themselves, but it's one of the few things I still do for them ...). Well, guess what? I'm out of detergent. So, I flip my packed schedule around a bit and go out to the store at 7 AM.  So, now I'm running very low on gas. I run to the gas station after the store, get home, put the first load of laundry in. Since I'm dressed, I decide to run out now to the post office and to Wal-Mart to check if they have cheap button down pajama tops (Yay! They do!) and to re-stock my freezer. (Did I mention that my refrigerator died two days ago and we had to replace it? I lost everything in my freezer, which I had already started stocking for after the surgery.) On my way to the post office, my sister called ... her daughter missed the school bus and my sister can't leave work.  Can I please go give her a ride? This caused a minor melt down as I deviated from my plan yet again. When I arrived at my sister's house, I had tears streaming down my face. A half hour later, I get to WalMart, skip the post office and run home to meet a 10:00 AM appointment.  Ha!  Just missed her ... she left a note and she's gone.  She says she'll be back this afternoon, but ... oh, yeah, I won't be here this afternoon because I have an appointment with the PS for pre-op and marking of the incision, which is probably the reason I'm so on edge today. ReneeW53, I'm like you.  I started with a really great attitude. I'm normally a pretty even-tempered, go-with-the-flow type of person.  Now, after two surgeries so far and the next one coming in 6 days, I'm just really grumpy. If today is an example, we can now add weepy to my list of charming qualities. Part of me wants the surgery to be done. Another part wishes Wednesday would stay a week away forever. Marm, I totally understand trying to be strong for the family. I'm like that, too. It seems that, as moms, we're always the strong ones that hold everything together. It's hard to step out of that role and be the one leaning on others instead. Jeanne, you're right. We are stronger than we imagine and we can and will do this.  Now, I'm going to pay bills and write down all my questions for the PS. This day won't get the best of me. Hang in there, ladies. It's going to get better. We'll all have beaches and summer cottages and wonderful trips and great times in our future. Just as soon as we get past this bump in the road ...  Thanks for listening to my rant.  Getty. ",

That is to say, it is cadaver skin that has had all the cells taken out of it, and just leaves the collagen behind. It is like having a shell of a building there, without all the walls, furniture, and people living inside. This makes it easy for your own body to incorporate your own blood vessels and tissue into the alloderm.\" I found this definition by a PS (Daniel Mills) online. Like he said, the graft will eventually be incorporated as part of my body. My own blood vessels and tissues will grow in it, on it and around it. It sounds kind of gross, I suppose, but it is really helpful with a lot of different issues relating to breast reconstruction, including helping to get rid of those ripples that can form over some implants. It's also used a lot with the one step, direct to implant reconstruction.  ",

It's either that the MRI did not accurately portray the whole area or that the radiologist didn't mark a large enough area.  Either way, the area ended up being way too big for a lumpectomy, so MX was the best and only solution.

Extensive DCIS for sure, but it's all gone now and she told me that we really won't need to worry about that breast again. She did prescribe tamoxifen for prevention of BC on the left breast. She states that with my life expectancy of 40+ more years, my chances of developing BC in the left breast is about 20% over my lifetime. With tamoxifen it goes down to 10%. For some reason, this whole tamoxifen thing has really brought me down. There are so many potential side effects to deal with/worry about. I'm really feeling sorry for myself and mad about everything right now. Is anyone else taking tamoxifen yet? Any thoughts would be welcome. I'll have a mammogram on my left side in August and an MRI in February. They will both be repeated yearly. When the nurse brought the orders to me after the appointment, there was also an order for a chest x-ray. The doctor hadn't mentioned that at all, and when I questioned the nurse, she said it was standard and I would get it done yearly. Has anyone here had their doctor order a chest x-ray? I sort of think that it might be an error on the nurses part and I questioned her about whether it was standard for patients not receiving radiation and for patients with pure DCIS. She said it was standard for everyone. Melissa: I drove today for the first time and it was a piece of cake.

I'm sorry you've had to join our group, but you are very welcome here. Breast cancer is a hard thing to deal with and all the emotions and thoughts that you are having are normal. Having dealt with colon cancer last year, it is no wonder that you are feeling especially challenged with your strength. We do what we can to support each other and offer encouragement. Listen to your PS about the implants. A lot of people will have opinions, but your PS is the expert. The final choice is yours, but the new silicone gels that are being used now are much safer than the ones that were used years ago. Tell the PS your concerns and let him address them for you. A lot of people have a rough time with Tamoxifen, which is why I'm so concerned right now about starting on it, but ovarian cancer is not one of the things that tamoxifen can cause. In fact, if I am not mistaken, some doctors prescribe tamoxifen to prevent ovarian cancer. I wish you strength and courage for the road ahead. I hope that you'll come back often with your concerns and, hopefully, to share your triumphs with us. Getty. ",

I think I'm going to call my BS tomorrow and ask her for a couple of other oncologists, so that I can get a second and third opinion on it. And I have an appointment with my GYN in a couple of weeks so that I can discuss with him how we can be ever vigilant about the uterine cancer side effect and an appointment in a month to talk to my PCP about how to avoid the blood clot side effect. Don't worry, it didn't keep me down for long. One thing I've really learned with stupid BC is that I'm a pretty positive person.  I am thinking about you so much as you approach your surgery date! You're bringing up the tail-end of our month. I know that you will finish strong for our team! I've been reading this very awesome book that I got, based on recommendations from others on this board. It is called \"Anti Cancer, A New Way of Life\". It talks about very specific things you can do in your nutrition and lifestyle to help your body fight cancer. It's written by an MD who had a very nasty brain tumor 17 years ago. His prognosis was bleak and he managed to beat the odds. It's a pretty easy read and so interesting! I've learned so much from reading it. I really recommend the book highly! Getty ",

Most seem to  place their uni patients on it, but there are some that recommend against it and go with close monitoring instead, via alternating mammograms and MRI's every six months. My onc wants to do both the tamoxifen and the monitoring. There really are no studies out there on prescribing Tamoxifen for patients that have undergone a unilateral mx, except to say that it is exclusively to prevent a new occurrence in the contralateral (the other) breast. And, there are a lot of ways of looking at the statistics on the odds of getting something in the other breast. Laurie: I can't even imagine why your dr. wants to discuss Tamoxifen with you. This is one of my frustrations. There always seems to be \"one more thing\". When I was first diagnosed, the story was \"you'll have a lumpectomy, then rads and you'll be done.\" I'd never heard of margins before and took them at their word. Then, when the re-excision margins weren't clear, it was \"we'll do a unilateral mastectomy. You won't need rads and you'll be done.\" Lo and behold, the mastectomy is done and now it's \"5 years of tamoxifen and you'll be done.\" To which I replied, \"Tamoxifen?!?!\" Their response was, \"Well, if you'd had a bilateral, there would be no Tamoxifen. You'd be done.\" Well, darn it!!! No one told me that!!! So, Laurie, if they're wanting to talk Tamoxifen with you, I'd be interested to know why, if you care to share. I think I was off of the narcotics by one week post surgery, but remember you had twice as much surgery as I did. I think your PS' office is being overly cautious. And tell your SIL to stuff it. (Just kidding. Kind of.)  On to body image ... except for the times when I catch an unexpected glance of myself in the mirror when I'm undressing, I'm okay with how I look. Those times when I'm caught unaware, I do get startled just because it's not what I've grown to expect to see over the years. I, too, saw a lot of pictures online before my mastectomy and I think it did prepare me for what to expect. My skin is smoother than I thought it would be.  A lot of those pictures looked really bumpy to me. I was telling my daughter today that watching this process of getting \"filled\" is a lot like going through puberty again, but really fast. My right side is practically even size-wise with my natural breast now. The real one needs quite a lift from my bra to get to where the TE sits, but in clothes I look completely normal, albeit perkier than before. On the other hand, I have not let my husband see. I just don't want him to have this picture in his mind. Once the reconstruction is done, of course he will see the finished product. I will be getting a nipple done by the PS. I never have considered not doing one. For me, it is a really big part of getting back to \"normal\".  Oh! It's 6 o'clock. Time to start dinner ... or maybe it can be a pizza night.  Getty.",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2010 07:27AM - edited Jul 9, 2010 07:30AM by almagetty My husband and I had a really good laugh last night about the Madonna-type boob cone that I might need to wear with the nipple reconstruction. Luckily, Halloween will fall right around my recuperation from the nipple surgery. Instant costume! I think I misspoke yesterday about the lack of studies for Tamoxifen use for unilateral MX patients. I left out one important detail. There is a lack of studies out there for Tamoxifen use among DCIS patients who have undergone a unilateral mastectomy. I have not looked into studies for invasive cancer. I just wanted to be clear. We did end up getting pizza last night. It was delicious! Joy, I did save you a few slices. They're waiting for you in my refrigerator. I would offer a slice to Liz, but I'm not sure it fits in with her preferred diet these days. :) Laurie:  I am taking Vitamin D  (2,000 IU) and Omega-3 daily in addition to my regular mulit-vitamin. I'm also taking calcium (Viactiv). This is all at the strong recommendation of the dietician that my oncologist had me meet with before my first lumpectomy. The studies the dietician showed me on the cancer fighting aspects of Vitamin D are super interesting. If you consult with the holistic doctor, please share any advice, if you don't mind.  Another simple thing that shows great promise in fighting cancer is the daily consumption of green tea. I first learned of this in the book \"Anti Cancer\" (which is fantastic, by the way). I've since found out that there are some really major studies going on right now at some of the huge research hospitals to see how effective the green tea is in fighting breast cancer. I don't love tea, but I have been drinking two cups a day. It can't hurt, right? Apparently, fresh brewed Japanese green tea has more of the ECGC in it, which is the property that makes it such a good cancer fighter. I bought some really high quality loose Japanese green tea yesterday. It was expensive, but if it helps in this fight I consider it money well spent. We're also buying organic dairy and meat products (and fruits and vegetables, too). My grocery bill is higher, but if it makes a difference in our health ...  Joy: For sure the doctors know better. I'm getting the opinion of a few of them, though, because I'm scared that just one doctor might be overly aggressive. My feeling is that if I'm going to be putting the rest of my body at risk for new complications in order to lower my risk of getting BC in the other breast, I want to make absolutely sure that the risk to the rest of my body makes sense.  But, I will definitely not skip Tamoxifen if all the doctors recommend for it. Jeanne: Hang in there! You're about 10 days behind me in recuperation time. These last couple of weeks I think I've made giant strides towards feeling better. You will, too. Liz: It has been true for me that the more they fill, the less it feels that my boob is under my arm. I don't know why this is true, but it is. It's Friday! Happy weekend!! Getty. ",

There was no pain, discomfort or pressure from the fill itself, although I am getting feeling back on the top part of the breast (which is where my port is) so I did feel the needle go in this time. Two weeks from today I go back for the last scheduled fill. I'll see the PS two weeks after that (1st week of August) to see if 500cc is enough or if he wants to put in a little bit more that day and then ... we schedule the exchange!! It could conceivably happen as soon as mid-August, but I think last week of August/first week of September is a little bit more doable.  I haven't been posting a lot, but I have been reading everything. I can truly say that I'm back to my regular pre-DX life (well, except for all the doctor appointments!). As I said in an earlier post, I can sometimes forget completely about BC and about the TE.

I'm certain the PS will give you the okay to shower today. Jeanne: I hope your swelling is down today. My PS cleared me to sleep braless after my first post-op appointment 7 days after surgery. At first, I slept with a stretchy-type cami under my pj's, but have been sleeping completely braless for at least a couple of weeks now. I haven't had any problems with swelling. Tomorrow I'll be six weeks post-op. I'll keep my fingers crossed that you don't have to go back to the bandages. 4LuvofZ: I think you won, too! Interesting about the Neosporin. I hadn't heard that. I did use it on my drain incision. Maybe I shouldn't have ... oops! Oh, well. All's well that ends well. The Tamoxifen call is horribly difficult. I hate it when there are gray areas, and this whole BC ride has been filled with gray areas! I went to another oncologist yesterday for a second opinion about Tamoxifen. I absolutely loved him! He took so much time to explain everything point by point. Plus, the man is really, really good looking, which didn't hurt at all. ;) (My first opinion onc explained a lot, too. But, since I saw her three weeks ago I've done extensive research and had so many more questions.) Anyway, bottom line for me, both doctors give me a lifetime chance of developing BC in my remaining breast of between 20%-25%. Both agree that Tamoxifen will cut that in half. The oncologist yesterday told me that with or without Tamoxifen, my survival chance remains exactly the same since I am being monitored so closely. Anything that crops up will be caught early. The advantage would be that with the Tamoxifen my chances of having to deal with things like further surgery, rads and chemo (basically with anything BC) would be reduced by half. He confirmed what my first onc said, that my chances of developing a uterine cancer from this are basically non-existent because of my age. The uterine cancer chance, although extremely slight in any case, only affects women in their 60's, 70's and older. The blood clot complication, which terrifies me, happens in 1 in about 10,000. His recommendation for me is to wait until my reconstruction is finished (October'ish counting the nipple re-do) and then to try the Tamoxifen out. He said to evaluate it a few months at a time. He estimates that 80%-85% of the women that he has given it to in my age group have no major issues with the hot flashes, etc. If that is the case with me, I continue on with the dosage. If not, I can then choose to stop taking it forever or to stop taking it until after menopause, with the understanding that stopping it will up my chances for new BC. He said over and over that my starting on Tamoxifen is not an emergency \"do it right now\" situation, nor is it a matter of life and death. It is not a treatment for cancer because all my cancer is gone. It is strictly a preventative measure. He also told me that if ever I chose to have a prophylactic Mx on my remaining breast, there would be no reason to take the Tamoxifen. I told him that at the first sign of anything wonky on a mammogram or MRI, that is precisely what I would do. I think I will follow his advice. I go back to my first onc next week to tell her that that is my plan. I will stay with her as my oncologist, but the doctor from yesterday told me he'll be available to me if ever I want another opinion on anything to do with treatment. It's nice to have two good doctor's brains to pick. So, that's where I sit today ... happy healing, everyone! Getty ",

He'll sew on a bandage during the reconstruction that will stay on for a week, and then after that is removed I'll have another soft bandage that I have to wear for 10 days.

I just said a prayer for your successful surgery. Laurie:  Happy birthday to your son! I'm so glad you're doing so well!! I went to the PS today. My nipple/areola reconstruction surgery will be on November 10. He's going to do a little lipo-suctioning to hopefully correct my fold/flap issue. He says it won't be eliminated, but should improve somewhat. :-/ He also suggested micro-fat grafting to fill in the void on the top inside edge of the implant. He's not a big proponent of the fat grafting because he says that it doesn't really last, but he's willing to try. He's also going to micro-fat graft under the new nipple/areola complex to give the new breast a little bit more of a cone effect. I'm really happy about that! The skin graft will come from my bikini area, right above the hair line. He indicated with his hand that the incision will be about 3-4 inches long. Yikes! The fat grafting will come from around my belly-button. It all sounds a bit painful, but he assured me that I should feel good as new about a week after surgery. He hasn't steered me wrong yet ... All done (except for the tattoo of the areola for color) by Thanksgiving sounds really awesome right now!!  Getty ",

I did have a small amount of liposuction to help get rid of my lovely dog ear. I didn't have any fat grafting. I am feeling 100% well now. I had my first day of work 12 days after surgery and I was fine. This surgery is A LOT easier to recover from than the MX/TE placement surgery. Plus, you get something that feels much more natural than the rock that is the TE. I'd classify this one as a good surgery. (If there is any such thing!) When is your exchange?",

It is a feeling that will stick with you even after baby Vida has grown into a lovely young lady. Someone way smarter than me said that to make the decision to have a child is to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body. And that is exactly right. 34 weeks is not the full 40, that is true. But so many great steps have been taken in neonatal care that babies born at 34 weeks do very, very well. She will thrive. How could she not when you and she have fought so hard throughout this pregnancy? She will be wonderfully fine. I know it! I will join you in saying f**k cancer! What a stupid and horrible thing it has done to us! But, we are winning and will continue to win. You and your beautiful baby are quite the example to me of how life does go on and beautiful things can happen after breast cancer. So, you will take your horrible cocktail and live to see Vida one day have children of her own. And in that world, hopefully, we will have figured out how to cure this disease so our daughters and theirs won't have to think about foobs and scars. Thanks for the hugs! I will carry them with me into surgery on Wednesday. When you get a little minute, stop by and let us know how you are. And bring baby pictures!! :D",

And you'll get to go with your squishy implant instead of the TE! That's pretty freaky that your PS thought your TE was out and that he was ready to move forward with the nipple surgery. These are the things that make me scratch my head and go \"Huh?\". Melissa, I'm so glad that you got that time away to think and reflect on everything that has happened this past year. Sorry you had to deal with a toothache, too. :/ Great news about the pain management! And the both of you have your exchanges coming up so soon! That's great news!!  Robin, besides the soreness from my bruises, I have no pain to speak of. I really think the nipple is looking great! I check on it every couple of hours to make sure that it's still there. lol!  Even though the color doesn't match the natural side yet, it really, truly does put that finishing touch on the whole thing. I'm really happy that I did it.  Getty ",

For me, it was a really important and crucial step in my getting back to a semblance of normal. Good thing it's been such a cold winter. The cones are easier to hide that way.

And then the crazy survey BC.org put up took over my computer and I couldn't get it off the screen to read the boards. Very frustrating! Finally, this morning, I was able to sign on without getting attacked by the pop-up! I'm sorry that you've been dealt such a rough hand in the middle of what should be a time full of happiness and enchantment for your family. I'm glad that krcil stopped by with links for the head scarf. This is the venting place, though, so come in and blow off some steam. The good news, though I know it must be hard to see right now, is that the hair will grow back when the chemo is finally behind you. Reconstruction will make things better. I like angry better than sad. I think the anger moves us to action. I loved the avi you had of the three of you! I also love the new one today.  On the Tamoxifen front, it's been 6 days and still no side effects. I know that it takes two weeks for it to reach it's full effect in the body, but I'm encouraged that so far not even a little twinge of anything has shown up.  If anything, I'm sleeping better, which probably has nothing to do with anything. Have a good week! Getty ",

Unbelievable! I can't help but think, though, that I may have been the same way before this year came by to teach me a few lessons. I think (hope) that I've now become a person who focuses more on the positive. I, too, am sometimes tempted to tell them exactly what I've been up to in the past year, but for the two reasons that you state, I stay quiet and say a silent prayer that they won't ever have to face what we've had to face. After the exchange, I had to sleep on my back, I think for three weeks. After that, I was told it was okay to sleep on my side, but it took me a little while before I felt comfortable (more mental comfort than physical) doing that. I did more of a 3/4 of the way on my back with a pillow to lean on. It is freezing in Florida. Seriously freezing. Kind of crazy weather for December.

Facing your reflection in the mirror is truly difficult. Joystars is right, if you don't see it you can pretend it hasn't happened. I'm finally getting to a point where I don't get startled when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And since the swelling and bruising improve daily, it's mostly a positive experience when I take a good look. All my steri-strips are still firmly in place. I'm supposed to remove them as they become unstuck, but, as of today, all the corners are still firmly stuck. The nurse told me she would remove them before the fill if they were still there on Monday. Sometimes, I prefer that option. Other times I think that, if it could possibly cause irritation to pull off the strips, I want them gone ahead of time so that I don't have to deal with any additional discomfort on the day of my first expansion.

Sadly, I've had a similar experience with someone who was diagnosed around the same time I was. She's a mom at the school where my sister's kids go. I don't know her personally, but you know how you hear about these other ladies that are on the same journey while you're going through it... She had her BMX right around the time that I had mine. We have the same oncologist. She did have lymph node involvement. In the past couple of weeks, she found a lump in her remaining tissue. The biopsy showed that it was malignant and that she has mets in her spine, bones and some other place. I can't even tell you the panic that I experience whenever I think of her. Her kids are really young ... preschool and early elementary. Logically, I know that my case was so different, being Stage 0, lymph nodes clean, no invasion or microinvasion. But feelings know no logic and when I think about it, my blood runs cold from the fear. I feel so bad for her! About your mom's medical records, I think I would want to see them. After the past year, we've all become pretty savvy in understanding the language and scope of bc. I agree with Jane that it may be healing for you to look through them. It will be hard, of that there is no doubt. But you might get some answers that you didn't have before. If you don't want to read them for fear that you might find out more than your mom wanted you to know, I think I would be inclined to give a copy of them to my doctor just so he/she can see if there is anything relevant to your case in them.

Knowing now what I didn't know then, if I had to go back, I would still do everything exactly like I did it. I am happy with how I look and feel now. My natural side and my reconstructed side match up extremely well. When I am clothed, even if it's just in bra and underwear or a bathing suit, there is not a person who could tell that I've had a mastectomy and reconstruction.  But, just because it was the right choice for me, that doesn't make it the right one for you. This is all such a highly personal thing. You just have to be comfortable with the decision that you make. Get all the facts that you can from your doctors. That was the most important thing for me.

Robin: I'm sure you'll get advice from your doctors as soon as your surgery date is set.I really didn't get a whole lot of instructions. I did receive a packet of information from my PS when he marked the incision 6 days before surgery. I also received instructions from the hospital at my pre-op appointment 5 days before surgery.  JOY!!!!: I'm so happy to see your post and to know that you and the baby are doing so well! Good news, indeed! It's good that your doctor insisted that you do things for yourself as soon as possible. I think that knowing and believing that we can do things empowers us to do more. When the orderlies took me from the recovery room to my hospital room, they wanted to lift me off of the stretcher onto the hospital bed, but the nurse insisted that I sit up and scooch over myself. I really hated her at that moment, but I came to appreciate that she showed me that I was not an invalid. I, too, was able to hear the fluid sloshing around in my breast while I showered. It is freaky and weird. I laughed at your confusion at the doctors and nurses saying how great your wound looks, because I had the same reaction. I know you're going to feel better every single day. Marm: Time has flown by! Thank goodness this month is almost over! I'm sorry to hear about your infection. Please let us know what the doctor tells you. Thinking of and praying for JBL, Speech and Ducki today. And Laurie, too! Getty. ",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2010 11:53AM - edited Jun 21, 2010 11:55AM by almagetty I can answer your question about what I did with my drain when I changed clothes or showered. I got a lanyard that I hung around my neck, which I pinned my drain to whenever I showered or changed clothes. You can also use a long shoe string or one of those strings to hang eyeglasses around your neck with. I hated the tugging feeling I got whenever I accidentally yanked on the drain line. I didn't use a surgical cami, so I have no opinion to offer. I had a unilateral MX with TE's (no SNB, since that was done a couple of months ago with my first lumpectomy) and had one drain. So, depending on whether you have SNB or not, you might have just two, maybe three. The drain is a pain, but it's doable. You'll get through it and be fine.  Good luck with everything! ",

But, stripping the drain (basically, emptying it out) was not really a big deal. It was quite simple, in fact. The thing with the drain is that you have this little bottle connected to you by a tube, and it gets in the way. But, the good news is that it's only there for a short time. Mine was out 10 days after surgery. It helped to pin the tubing and the drain to my surgical bra strap using a big safety pin. Good luck to you! ",
