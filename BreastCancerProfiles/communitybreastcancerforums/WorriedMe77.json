I know that it's hard and scary just hearing acancer diagnosis and then when you start hearing about chemo and radiation side effects It can easily become overwhelming. I'm still pretty new to this cancer stuff But my best advice would be to make sure that you take care of you physically and emotionally make sure that you have a treatment team you trust and have confidence in. And take each day as it comes.",

I try to occupy my mind time and thoughts on something other than this diagnosis however I\u2019m not doing a very good job I find myself constantly thinking about the breast cancer and the What Ifs,Worrying about the side effects of treatment that I haven\u2019t even had yet. Worried about how cancer may potential affect my relationship My husband is 13 years younger than me and has no children I was 14 weeks pregnant when I was diagnosed had a ultrasound the same day and our baby didn\u2019t have a heartbeat so losing the baby and being diagnosed with cancer has been hard on him too. I worry that cancer is going to rob me of the opportunity to give him a child. And is it selfish of me because I love you so much to worry that he\u2019ll leave me because of that? I hate hate hate cancer one minute I\u2019m calm in OK and the next I\u2019m crying and having panic attacks. The people that know about my diagnosis Have been encouraging and positive and keep stressing to me about not worrying but I have no clue how to do that I\u2019m worried about so many things. Well ladies thank you for letting me vent I don\u2019t really feel like I can do this at home because I don\u2019t want to lay all my emotions on him and he\u2019s already going through a roller coaster because of me",
