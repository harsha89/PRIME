But yeah. Insurance. The abx is not covered, however my totally incredible parents want to pay for the meds.(about $1000 for three months, grrrr!). That was step one. Then to make the appt for the PICC insertion- I called for the appt, but the hospital needs the dr to call it all in Of course, here in NJ we are covered with snow and ice and the drs office has been closed.  But to focus on the good, the woman at the hospital called, had seen my med records and set up a temporary appt for the PICC on the 19th. She also had Lyme and understood why this was so important. So now, I wait and focus on baby steps forward! Hope that all of you are having a good day and if on the East Coast, staying warm!",

Lmp. done, all cancer was gone. My husband is very anti-rads (chemo as well, so thank goodness this was not invasive). He is very much a Rick Simpson oil proponent and very firmly believes that taking the oil will prevent any cancer from coming back and with no harm done to my body. He could be 100% correct. But I don;t know, there are no long term studies that I can find that give recurrence rates. I told the RO that I was going to think about the decision to do rads, but I am pretty sure that my mine is made up to go for it. I am \"young\" --45 yo-- I have a lot of years ahead of me and I would kick myself if I don't do rads now and in 10-20 years its back and is worse than DCIS. RO gave me the stat of 20-30% recurrence risk if I don't do rads. To me, that is pretty risky. I know that with rads it still can come back, but the chances are much lower, right? He has read many stories/articles how rads causes more cancer, kills healthy cells etc and that is what he is focusing on. He thinks I am making the wrong decision. I think I am making the best decision for *myself* as I can.  So this is my  question (after my long rambling post, finally!!), do any of you know more \"real life\" occurrences of rads hurting rather than helping? I know that the SE's are mainly fatigue and skin issues, but did anyone you know end up with heart/lung issues? Cancer caused my rads?  And do you know of anyone who didn't do rads and has a long term good prognosis and survival rate?

Just to make you all smile-- I have this *thing* about buttons. Can't wear 'em. Hate them. This has been since I was a kid. I am a digital scrapbooker and I can't even use digital buttons on my pages!! LOL It is goign to be sheer horror for me to wear button-shirts. I don't have any of my own so when I had my biopsies, I have to borrow hubby's flannels. Who wants to bet that the buttons make me crazier than the \"after surgery stuff\"?",
