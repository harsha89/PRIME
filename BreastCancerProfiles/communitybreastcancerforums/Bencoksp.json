    "Content": "Bencoksp wrote: I had a needle core biopsy last Friday and the Radiologist just called to give me the results.  He said they didn't \"see\" any cancer cells but the diagnosis is \"papillary lesion\" and his opinion was that it must be removed and that I should see a breast specialist.  He also said that I should speak with my internist after the holidays because some women decide not to do anything after this diagnosis, but that was not his opinion. So, I think it's good news - but would love to get more information. Thanks, Karen Log in to post a reply",
