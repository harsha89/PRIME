I am 17 years old. my doctor diagnosed me with fibrocystic breastfeeding disease about a year and a half ago. i made an appointment because i was feeling really weird lumps and i thought omg what if that\u2019s really bad i don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. well she decided my breasts were just really cyst filled. and she told me that if i felt an extreme change and tenderness and hard lumps then to come back. well jump to now. and over the last 2 months my breasts have begun to hurt super bad. it has hurt so bad where i can\u2019t even move or even touch my breasts. and also when i do my weekly check ups by myself i\u2019ve actually found a few small hard lumps. but because there\u2019s so many lumps in my breasts when i go to have my mother feel it to check we can\u2019t find them again because the hard lumps are deeper in my breasts. and that honestly concerns me. well anyways that\u2019s something that i\u2019d maybe like advice on. and also i\u2019ve lately been having really bad breathing issues where it makes it hard to breathe and it hurts when i breathe and it usually is in my rib cage right behind my left breast. and i don\u2019t know if anybody else with FBD has had this before or even if the two are related. but if anybody could shed some light on any of this or give advice that would be great because everytine i tell someone\u2019s about this they just say it\u2019s gas. but ive felt where the pain was when breathing and it slightly feels like there\u2019s about a lump stuck there. just please someone maybe give some advice if possible. thank you. sorry if any of this is confusing and a lot.
