      "Content": "Mattsbabe wrote: Hi!  I am 42 years old and very worried about my mammogram & ultrasound results.  18 months ago, I found a lump in my left breast - had a diagnostic mammogram followed by ultrasound.  The tests showed a small simple cyst in my left breast and very dense breasts (nothing in the right breast)...no worries!   A few weeks ago, at my annual \"girlie\" visit, I had a mammo screening- it was abnormal.  I was called back for diagnostic mammo and ultrasound due to \"question of asymmetries amongst very dense tissue\".  The diagnostic mammogram confirmed the asymmetry, but \"very dense tissue makes it difficult to assess for possible underlying abnormality\".  Hence, the ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed the following:  \"Right breast survey ultrasound shows a 1.6 cm complex cyst versus solid nodule at the 10:00 position.  No additional cysts or nodules are seen elsewhere in the right breast.  Left breast survey ultrasound shows several hypoechoic foci.  The 12:00 position there is a 4mm mildly complex cyst.  In the 2:00 position there is an 8mm complex cyst.  At the 4:00 position there is a 7mm complex cyst.  There are also at least 2 axillary lymph nodes seen measuring 2.3 cm and 1.7 cm.\" My biggest frustration???  The report said that they didn't have comparison films and gave me a BI-RADS category #3 and told me to see them in 6 months!  My doctor's office assured me they would send all of my films/reports prior to the study (they had 2 weeks to do this).  Since they didn't, I had to take all of my personal copies to the diagnostic center yesterday afternoon.  Now it's a waiting game to see if the BI-RADS score changes.  Like I mentioned in the heading - I am usually NOT a worrier - but for some reason I am terrified!  I'm not sure if it's because I have reason to be, or if it's because a girlfriend of mine was just diagnosed.  I just feel that there have been a LOT of change in 18 months....and something has to be causing it!  Any thoughts???
