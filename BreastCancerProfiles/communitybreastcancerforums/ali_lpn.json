I do weekly txs of Avastin/Taxol...3 weeks on, 1 week off.  I also get Zomeda once a month...not sure of the dose.  Anyway, I am in a clinical trial because of mets to the bones, recurrent in right breast and lymph system, and around the right lung.  My oncologist is wonderful and I totally trust him, but I have promised my mother that I would go for a 2nd opinion if this tx doesn't appear to be working.  I haven't had any repeat scans yet, I have only had 3 tx thus far.But slonedeb, I am not sure if it is the combo of the Avastin and taxol or either one or the other, but I can already tell a HUGE difference in my local recurrence on the right breast.  I had NUMEROUS tumors and an ulcer on the breast.  They are all still there, but have shrank substantially.  Actually my breast was so hard before the tx started that it felt like a rock and now I can feel my implant.  This alone has given me hope.  Slonedeb, keep your head up and like I said, you are in my prayers.
