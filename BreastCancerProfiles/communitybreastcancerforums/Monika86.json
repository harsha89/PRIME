I am a country away from her and she is in Canada, and have been flying back and fourth from school to see her throughout the journey, we are and were a very close family and this whole \"cancer\" thing which i was used to only reading and studying in my courses and books suddenly change my life. Her next mammo and tests are in August and I will be finished my second year of med school, getting ready to go into 3rd and 4th year starting my Clinical Years. I am so scared of whats to happen, i am so scared of reoccurance and of it coming back not at stage I but worse........i guess i never thought that having aspirations of becoming a doctor my mom would be diagnosed right in the middle of my schooling, its changed my life....and im so scared sometimes in class I just feel like bursting into tears when we are looking at topics realting to cancer ( which by the way is at least everyday in every class at least 10 times) i guess i joined this chat in the hopes that I would find some solice in other women and other family members as to how they dealt with the fear and the 'unknown\" my mom is such a strong lady, when we talk about it now we think \"was it a bad dream\" did it really happen?..........i am just scared and dont know how to handle it...i think i mite have \"post traumatic stress syndrome\".........typical of a med student to dx herself....",
