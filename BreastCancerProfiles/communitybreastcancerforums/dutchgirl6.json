Just a word about taking supplements, as sunnybottoms suggested.  At my teaching session when I picked up my Tamoxifen, I was given a list of things to avoid.  Lots of supplements either contain hormones, or contribute to hormone production.  Unfortunately, evening primrose oil is one of them.  If your cancer was hormone positive, or if you are on Tamox, you might want to discuss it with your dr., pharmacist or a dietician before you start taking them. ",

I registered for the Look Good Feel Better workshop next week, that should be fun.  I also found out that they have clippers and will shave my head at the Cancer Lodge, so I will definitely go there when the time comes.  My hairdresser had offered to come to my house to do it when the time came, but she doesn't have much experience with chemo hair loss, and I think that I would feel more comfortable with the woman at the Lodge. Marcy4, thanks for your interest.  You're right, I was probably still in bed.  I slept pretty good last night, hopefully I will tonight too. Shygal, you were right too, the anticipation, and the waiting, were harder than the Tx. Here's hoping that all goes well for everyone.",

I also had my head shaved on Tuesday morning, it wasn't too traumatic, and it doesn't look too strange, I am still the same person and I have the same face.  I bought a wig, a couple of shades lighter than my normal colour, something that I thought would never do, having never had any desire to be blond, but it looked the best.  I haven't quite gotten used to wearing it yet, so I have been wearing caps and scarves so far, just for warmth.  I have to say, it was liberating to be buzzed, no more wondering how much hair would come out at any given time, and it certainly saves time in the shower!  I'm sure that the wig will come out soon enough, but right now I am cocooning. Good luck to all having tx today, and for everyone else, have a good day.",

I seem to have some hair growth, on my head, and I am very excited.  However, I have one more Docetaxel (next week) and I am afraid that it will all fall out again , so I am trying not to fixate on it.  I did notice some leg hairs, I think that I am like SGJ05, it is probably travelling down from my eyebrows and lashes.   DancerMel, I'm glad that your surgery seems to have gone well, also that your rads will be a bit closer to home.   Happy Friday everyone",

On that note, Happy International Women's Day to the strongest and most inspiring women I have had the privilege to know! Sleep well everyone.",

The major SEs that I felt from the Tax have been fatigue, a little bit of neuropathy for the first week or so (tingling in my fingers and feet), a twitchy eyelid, again for the first week, a rough feeling in my mouth, but no mouth sores.  I have been using a baking soda mouth rinse, cheap and stuff I already have at home, this seems to help.  Also, and somewhat indelicately, loose stools, but no actual diarrhea.  I have been using baby wipes on that area, and those seem to be nice and soothing.  I went over all this with my onc today, and she seemed to think that I was doing all the right things.  Hope this helps. I had my second infusion today, and it was uneventful.  We were out of there in under two hours, the fastest yet.  It's nice when things go smoothly.  Only one left!!  I hope that the next three weeks fly by.

One thing to keep in mind is that chemo wreaks havoc with hormones, and that might be one of the reasons that weepiness seems to be rampant right now.  Well, that and the fac that we are all just fed up with this whole cancer thing.

Shelley, according the the information that I received, the metformin study includes Americans, and you don't have to live in Toronto to participate.  I think that you just have to live close to a centre that is included in the research.  In any case, you have to be at least 4 weeks past your last active tx, so waiting to talk to your onc in November won't exclude you from the study.   I hope it works out for you, it might be fun to compare notes, or that you can find another one to participate in.  ",

MelBell07, I'm sure that you are glad to have started this week, it puts you closer to the finish line.  I hope that you have minimal skin problems, so that you can have your reconstructive surgery as planned.  I agree about the tattoos, when mine were done, I asked \"was that it?\" ",

Swiftbird and Julia2, each time I am lying on the table, and the techs leave the room to hide behind their 12inch thick door, I get an itch.  It's usually my nose, but today it was my back.  I wonder if it is a subconscious reaction to knowing that I can't move until the machine is done.  It's a real exercise in self control. I was wondering why radiation causes fatigue, so I asked Dr. Google.  Apparently, nobody really knows, but it is thought that it is partly because cancer treatments destroy healthy cells, and the body is trying to rebuild them.  So, in order to help this along, it was suggested that a healthy diet and drinking lots of fluids, especially water, can help to reduce fatigue.   Hydrating from the inside can also help with skin irritation.  It's one of the things that my rad techs told me.

BocaCiegaBabe, I hope that you can get that BP under control, you certainly don't need another thing to worry about at this time.  I am usually pretty calm around medical procedures, but I can totally relate to that kind of anxiety.  To me, this whole experience has been otherwordly, and a bit surreal.  The radiation is more tangible, and the fact that I am lying there and can see and hear the machine doing its job makes it real.  Also, as I move closer to the end of treatment, the \"what nows\" are starting to creep into my thoughts.  Lying on the table just gives my mind more opportunity to think. Well, I'm off to #7, almost halfway there!   ",

Joni, I understand your feelings.  At my first tx, being introduced to the team, there was a student.  He is young, early 20s, and his first name is the same as my son's, who is in his early 20s.  I was a bit weirded out at first, but I have come to the realization that he, and the other techs, are just doing a job.  They are all very professional and respectful and, after my initial discomfort, I am fine with him assisting with my treatment.  I am glad that they listened to you, and are able to accomodate your request as much as they can.   I hope everyone has a good Sunday, before we resume the zapping! ",

DawnKy, I love your avatar pic, is that on a t-shirt?  I hope that the SEs from you antibiotics clear up soon, all you need right now is that kind of aggravation. 1marmalade1, I think it depends on where you are getting your treatment, and what protocol your onc follows.  At the cancer centre here, all of the women who are getting rads for bc are doing it in 16 treatments, I think it is standard for the whole province.  I didn't get a dry run either, I think that the day you got your CT and tattoos were probably your \"simulation\".  Great idea to look it up on Google, it really isn't as scary as you think.  Good luck. If I missed anyone, I apologize.   AlCa, my mom died from bc as well, I understand how you are feeling ((((hugs))))",

My onco told me that I wouldn't be getting any rads to the underarm area, but today I noticed that it is a bit darker than the non radiated side, and I feel some pulling in my scar area.  I will definitely mention it to the techs, and find out what is going on.  Only three more for me!!

Shelley, I'm glad that things are starting to fall into place for you.  Do you have a start date yet?  I'm sure that you are eager to get going. kaydub, here's hoping for no snags, so you can celebrate your birthday rad free! nwshannon, you're right, this is a great group!  It sounds like you are going to be busy for the next little while.  Make sure you get enough rest, from what I understand, the fatigue from rads can be overwhelming at times.   bubbalu, I would think that the closest formulation to natural aloe vera would be the best to use, definitely not the one with the alcohol.  Why on earth would they put alcohol in a moisturizer?  That makes no sense to me.  Your journey through radiation land is certainly not a smooth one, is it.  Good for you to try and stick with it, you know that we are here cheering you on. julia2, you said it, freaky.   I find one of the strangest things is when I am done and the techs say \"see you tomorrow\".  My first reaction yesterday was, no, I'll see you in three weeks.  It seems odd to be going in every day. BocaCiegaBabe, glad you survived the drive home through Hermine.  You were smart to ask about the difference in times under the machine, the last thing you need is more exposure than you are supposed to get.  I am a stomach sleeper too, and I never even thought about possible difficulties from the rads.  Great, another reason for not getting a decent night's sleep . DMS, I was also told that I would be xrayed weekly, but because of the positioning issues this morning, they had to xray me three times!  At first I was a bit concerned, but then I figured that even three xrays wouldn't have the same amount of radiation as the actual treatment, so I calmed down.  I did manage to get over the whole modesty thing by thinking about a woman I know who had to have radiation for cervical cancer.  She is over 80, and if she could expose herself \"down there\" I certainly shouldn't have any issues with my boob.  ",

Welcome Marie2.  It sure sounds like you have done your research.  I hope that you have success with the ACV.   Hi zivagirl.  From what I have been told, the boosts are given if your surgery didn't get clean margins.  The boost is directed at the tumor site, whereas the regular radiation is more widespread and covers more of the affected area.  Good luck with your decision. JanetfromPgh, it's good to hear from you.  I was also wondering where you were, but obviously you have had lots on your plate this past little while.  I'm sorry that you are having more issues to deal with, and I hope that the spot on your pancreas is not what that ER doctor thinks it is.  My thoughts are with you. SweetMarcie, I love the idea of the tats being a badge of courage.  We are all fighters, and we have earned them! Regarding the question of fatigue, I read (I can't remember where, I have done so much lately) that it is partly because radiation damages healthy cells, and the body is trying to repair the damage, which can contribute to fatigue because of the added physical stress.   Happy Anniversary, Shygal!

Hi Janet, I'm glad that you decided to rejoin us.  We were concerned.  What's with that nipple?  I hope that it corrects itself soon.  I'm sorry to hear about your sister. I hope that she is feeling well enough to be with her family.  The whole hair thing is such an emotional experience.  When you have chemo, you lose your hair everywhere, not just on your head.  I personally felt that not having to shave all summer was one of the positive SEs, but for some people it is a difficult thing.  I know that there are some sisters on these boards who are still struggling with hair growth long after they are finished with chemo.  I guess that you just hit a nerve.  Have a good Monday everyone.

You said that your pain feels muscular, it very well might be something has been pulled or twisted.  Have you been doing any kind of activity lately that could have led to an injury (gardening, going to the gym)?  Swollen lymph nodes are often a sign of infection somewhere, do you have a fever? If you recently were hospitalized and had \"all the blood and heart tests\" and they were all normal, that is a good thing.  If you really are concerned that it is IBC, you really need to see someone about it.  I understand that you might be somewhat phobic about doctors, but what would be worse, a missed diagnosis or nervousness about having it checked out?  There is a lot of support on these boards, use them when and if you need to.  But please don't ignore your health!  Peace of mind is worth its weight in gold.  Take care",

Hi Dawn46, good idea to learn as much as you can before you start.  And who better to learn from than those who are going through it or have finished.   Fayebu, you must have been pleased to be able to \"pass\"on chemo.  From what I understant, CT scans are a regular part of the planning for rads, but I don't know about the other tests.  I do know that I had a chest x-ray and MRI after being diagnosed, maybe your onc just wants to be sure that everything is fine before your treatment.   DebbieLyn, How are you feeling, it looks like it's only been a little while since your surgery.  I'm glad that you were able to find answers to your questions from this site, but it is a shame that your medical team didn't give you any instructions.  Not everyone has an MRI or PET scan, but after meeting with your rad onc I am sure that you will have a CT scan.   BocaCiegaBabe, Canada's a pretty great place, and not just because of our shorter rad protocol!  Your daughter gave you a wonderfully strong image to hold on to during treatment, it sounds like she LOVES her mom too.  I also had an post op infection after my lumpectomy, developed an allergy to the antibiotic and then got C Difficile from the same antibiotic, not fun.  My chemo and rads were delayed for six weeks because of that.  Oh well.  Each day gets me closer to the finish line now.  You are right, this website is fantastic.  So are all the wonderful members who share their lives and experiences with the rest of us.  Thanks everyone!  ",

MelBell, I once heard somebody refer to it as \"chemostench\".  I went through a phase where I was constantly asking my DH if I smelled bad, his response was always no.  Maybe it's only you that smells it.  In any case I'm sure that the techs don't notice, they are dealing with this sort of thing all day long. kaydub, it sounds like you had a huge emotional release, and that you needed it.  This whole experience can be so overwhelming, and I think that we sometimes hold everything in just so we can get through it all.  You never know when the floodgates are going to open.  I hope that you are feeling better today. nwshannon, I'm sorry about the complications.  What a frustrating experience for you.  I hope that the infection clears up soon, and you can get back to finishing the treatment. sespebadger, your posting made a lot of sense.  I told myself that radiation would be a walk in the park compared to the marathon of chemo, and so far so good, but I'm not even halfway yet and who knows what the next week or so will be like.  I think it's safe to say that all of this cancer stuff sucks! So, I had zap #7 today......NOT!  The computers were down, and they sent me home.  I wondered, because as I was walking to my waiting room, passing all of the rad suites, I noticed signs in all the windows saying that they were all delayed.  When I got the to waiting room, it was full of other gowned people.  After 30 minutes, one of the techs came in and said that they didn't know how long it would be till the server was up and running again, and they told those of us who live in town that we could go home and come back tomorrow.  Argh!  So, that circle on my calendar is no longer valid, and I will have to add one day to my treatment.  I hope that this doesn't happen often. Have a good day everyone.  ",

KaeB, I'm sorry that you're having to deal with your insurance difficulties.  I hope that you can get it sorted out, you don't need the added stress.  I started back at work the day that I started rads, and although I would have preferred to have the time off, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. DMS, a shorter length of treatment is great!  You must have been thrilled to get that news. Boca, sometimes I think that the downstairs hallway is the new storage area for my vacuum cleaner.  We have all become adept at walking around it.  You are right, we are very lucky with our skin, red and itchy is bearable compared having it peeling off and weeping. jsmiley, the thought of lymphedema is never far from my mind, altough it hasn't been a problem so far.   My armpit area seems tight after the rads, but I don't have any swelling, so I think that things are ok.  I will be flying across the country in a couple of weeks, I hope that I will be ok with that as well. Janet, I hope that your dr can give you something for your skin issues.  I will be thinking of you on Friday, with crossed fingers. Have a good day everyone, I hope that your treatments go well, and that your SEs go away!",

I hope that everyone else who is having skin issues is also getting better.   I just came home from visiting a friend who has been diagnosed with a recurrence of DCIS after 16 years.  With her first diagnosis she had a lumpectomy and chemo, but not radiation and now she is considering having rads.  She has been my shoulder to cry on, and a wealth of information and wisdom, and now I hope that I can offer her the same in return.  I'm sure that she will have lots of questions about rads, and I know that thanks to all of you, I will probably be able to answer most of them.     Have a great day!",

CELinVa, I hope that your tape rash goes away before your rads begin.  I understand about the whole denial thing, sometimes I still can't believe that this is happening to me.  I hope that you get a good path report and you can start your rads soon.  The sooner things get started, the sooner they will be finished.

You might want to consider taking that short term disability, your boss will get over it.  It will be better in the long run to allow you to take the time you need to have your treatment, and recover from it, than to have you continue working right now and possibly be unproductive because you feel the way you do.  This is the time to put yourself first.  Take care, and I am glad that you joined us on this board.  You will find lots of support and great advice.

I had a wonderful time in Bermuda with my sisters, the weather was lovely and we enjoyed our personal tour guide who showed us almost the whole island.  I came home last Wednesday.  Why is it that the week on vacation flew by in a heartbeat, but the past week has dragged its feet? I am starting to get my energy back, and I am starting to feel normal again.  If I can remember what normal is.  Sespebadger, I am finding that I am achy all over, and I still have some neuropathy in my hands.  I spoke to my med once this week and she said that it could take months before it goes away, and that the achiness is a combination of the aftereffects of chemo and menopause.  At least taking Advil helps.  I haven't heard anything from the cancer centre about a follow up with my rad onc, I am five weeks out, I wonder if I will see him at all.  I did ask the receptionist, and the only appointment she had for me was a follow up in March with my surgeon.  Odd.  I'm not sure that I really need to see him, but he did tell me that he likes to see his patients after six weeks.   Shelley, I'm sorry that you are having so much trouble with your skin, and your other issues.  I hope that your radonc can help you.   I started taking Tamoxifen this week, anybody else?  I have been thinking of starting a discussion board, is anyone else interested? Have a great day everyone, the finish line is in view for all of you! ",

Jeanne, there is a discussion board called \"Radiation with Tissue Expanders\" on the Radiation forum, with a lot of postings, I'm sure that someone there can help you with your questions.  I hope that you can find some positive vibes from the members here, too. My friend recommended a moisturizer called Glaxal Base.  It was recommended to her by the rad techs.  She started using it 3 times a day about a week before her treatment, and she never had any issues with peeling.  Apparently it is available over the counter, and comes in both cream and lotion form.  I think that I will also invest in an aloe plant, just in case. It is actually one of the few green things that I don't manage to kill, and comes in handy around the house. Malady, did you have rads with your first dx?  ",

It's great to see so many September sisters reaching the finish line.  I hope that skin issues are starting to get better.  How go the energy levels?  I felt great all through the rads, and the week after, but now two weeks later, I find that the fatigue is starting to get the better of me.  I am starting to fade mid afternoon, and by the time I get home from work, I am exhausted.  That's why I haven't been posting, but I am reading your posts.  I know that it will pass, I can't wait for my vacation next week, when I can kick back and relax. MelBell, go for it.  I bought new shoes last week. ",

It's quite attractive.  It's like the nails are falling, but rather than having no nail, the new ones are growing in underneath the old one, and pushing it off.   I also think that I have developed neuropathy in my hands.  When will all this end????",

I get occasional shooting pains as well, and I am almost three weeks out.  I hope they go away, because they are annoying.  I am one of the lucky ones, with no skin problems, but sometimes I get itchy.  It just feels like I am recovering from a mild sunburn.  For a few days it looked like my nipple might start to peel, but that too has cleared up.  I am still using the GlaxalBase, and it has worked like a charm for me. Have a good week everyone, the finish line is getting closer.",

Thanks for your good wishes Shelley, I am actually sitting in my sister's living room enjoying the conversation.  So far it has been cloudy and rainy (I arrived yesterday) but the forecast from here on in is quite nice.  However, the humidity is taking some getting used to.  But, it is a beautiful place.",
