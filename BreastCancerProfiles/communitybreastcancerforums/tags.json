I will have to go 5 years also on a pill after everything is finished.  I had the in sutu, but after that surgery the pathologist found a patch underneath. I had another surgery and infection, so be very careful.  So far, i have had 4 stays in the hospital due to surgery, infections and illness.  I went out without wearing a mask or anything and didnt think i dose of chemo would wipe out my immune system so quickly.  If any one else can tell me of anything else to do to protect myself i would appreciate it.  drop me a line. take care and remember you are not alone.",
