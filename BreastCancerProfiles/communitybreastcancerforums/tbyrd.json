Holly Colorado, I'm so sorry you're having so much trouble.  I hope your doctor fixes all that for the next time.  Mine said to report every single side effect because they have something for everything ... except the hair loss, of course.  Someone should figure that one out and they would make a bazillian dollars. Chob, I think the fluids really help even though they taste bad.  Of course I'm on different drugs than you.  But really it can't hurt and might do you some good. Listen to me.  I'm acting like I'm an old pro and I'm only three days out.  I guess I'm just so relieved to feel as good as I do. Have a good day everyone! Terry",

Had to put off the trip to the Survivor Gals shop until tomorrow so I could wait for a phone call.  Think I'll just chill out the rest of the day and jump up early and go tomorrow.  The Look Good Feel Better program was great yesterday.  They gave us each a big tote bag full of very nice cosmetics ... not drug store stuff ... name brand department store stuff... and gave tips on using them.  I don't know if I'm going to throw away all my current makeup like they said to because of contamination!!!?!?  They gave us each a hat or scarf of our choice and gave tips on tying the scarves and how to wear hat and wigs comfortably.  And also how to take care of your wig.  Plus they served sandwiches, chips and a dessert.  It was very nice and great to be around a group of women going through the same thing.  I took a friend with me which was good.  She didn't get the goody bag or hat but she really enjoyed it, too. Day 5 after my first treatment and I'm doing pretty good.  I'm scheduled to go back to work on Monday and for the first time I'm feeling like I'll be able to do it.  Hope everybody who started yesterday, today and tomorrow have a good first experience like I did.  I know you'll all be relieved to get things going like I was.

      "Content": "Jun 10, 2010 04:49PM - edited Jun 10, 2010 04:50PM by tbyrd I got a tip on using Phazyme for my stomach problems.  I ran straight to CVS last night and got some after reading the post on another thread.  It didn't work for me but it might for someone else.  I had a sonogram on an ovarian cyst this morning and my gyno is confident that my stomach problems are from that and not from chemo.  Sounds strange since my pains are both high and low on my abdomen but I guess we shall see.  She wants to do another sono in three weeks to see if the cyst goes away so I guess I'm stuck with this for at least that long.  I asked about my ear aches and she said if they get bad or if I start to run a fever then I need to call and in the meantime take Claritin.  Believe it or not my onc gave me her cell phone number and told me to call her in the middle of the night if I had to! I had my blood work today, too, and my onc nurse just called to say my blood counts are almost nonexistent.  This is day 8 after my first chemo.  So I guess that's why I'm tired.  She said no movies or church, etc. until they come back up.  I guess that means no Winstar Casino to see Blake Shelton in concert tomorrow night, huh?  I didn't even ask because the answer would probably have brought on the waterworks again.  I've been so emotional today! grneyd5600 my husband is wanting to shave his head when I do but I don't think I'll let him.  Its a very sweet gesture but one of us needs to look normal around here.  He wears his hair pretty long and its just wavy and beautiful and dark brown with no gray.  I've always been jealous!  Right now I think I'm going to wait until I absolutely have to before I cut my hair. Good luck to everyone starting out tomorrow and early next week! Terry",

I have to say I'm very lucky with my oncologist and her staff.  They're the best.  She even gave me her cell phone number and said to call her in the middle of the night if I have something bad going on, especially fever.  And the study nurse made up a notebook with all my reports and instructions organized with tabs and all and brought it to us while we were in the chemo room.  I just love them all. On top of all the calcuim and vitamin D they have me on they also told me to take B-6 and B-12 I guess to help with my energy level.  I have to have a calendar to remember when to take what and last night I finally broke down and put my pills in one of those weekly organizers with a little box for what to take in the morning, noon and night.  I keep forgetting whether I've taken my doses so I guess this will have to be the way I live from now on. Also, about the nail problem.  A friend of mine has been a nail tech forever and she said I will probably end up with problems and when I do that I should go to her and she'll help me deal with it.  She's very experienced with helping people on chemo with that. Best wishes and little side effects to everyone! Terry",
