I did have the cathetar in about 5 days before the treatments began however due to scheduling. I think the docs are very concerned about infection and the 2 week wait would seem unacceptable to the surgeon!! I'd call the office and make sure the appointment desk understood your situation. If she can't move you up herself, make sure she passes your concerns along to the surgeon. It should take only about an hour to place the mammosite balloon! The cathetar will be uncomfortable for the whole time to some degree and you probably won't be swinging your arms around or lifting them high over your head. I did get in the bathtub to bathe for the first time in years and made sure no water got near my breast/incision. I washed my hair too without getting the area wet, keeping a thin plastic tablecloth cut to the appropriate size around my neck. Good luck with your treatments.",

I understand the waiting game after a bad experience. I've had bc in the same breast twice with an 8 year interval of normal mammos. Just as I was beginning to relax about the yearly mammo, up popped another cancer. If your insurance covers mammos, which it should, it'll cover a screening digital mammo.

Are you sure about the excisional? Your appointment with the surgeon is probably just that--an appointment to decide how to proceed, not a procedure. However,the appointment could be for the stereotactic biopsy if the surgeon performs them, then those results would dictate the next step. I'd go to that appointment and get answers to my questions including the need for MRI.

You need a skin sparing mast to be able to do the immed implant. Just a guess. Ask the current PS and if his explanation doesn't seem right to you, get a second opinion. Good luck.",

There's 2 basic categories here: Tamoxifen is one and a group of drugs called aromatase inhibitors is the other. Tamoxifen blocks the estrogen receptors so that any more cancer cells can't grab on there and make trouble, and the aromatase inhibitors deplete the body of estrogen. There are side effects to each type that the onc will discuss with you. And given your mother's personal health history, one may be perferable over the other. I hope your onc visit goes well and having a bit of info before getting there may help in understanding what can be somewhat complex. I'm sure your mother appreciates your help and is thankful that you will be with her.",

The onc doesn't do that either. So if the PCP seems bc aware and concerned and are knowledgeable about SERMs or AIs, she may be the only doc you need. Otherwise, an onc and a PCP might be the only 2 docs needed. As for the surgeon, I let her go after a couple of checks, but some patients still follow with her. I think it's your choice.

It concluded: \"Use of conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate for approximately 5 years resulted in more than 1 in 10 and 1 in 25 women having otherwise avoidable mammogram abnormalities and breast biopsies, respectively, and compromised the diagnostic performance of both. This adverse effect on breast cancer detection should be incorporated into risk-benefit discussions with women considering even short-term combined hormone therapy.\" Part of the study participants received the drug and part received the placebo. Noted is that the study was stopped when the WHI Data Safety and Monitoring Board determined that more risks than benefits were associated with the use of conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate.
