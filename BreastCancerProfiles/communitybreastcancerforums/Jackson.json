I'm now on Navelbine, herceptin, arimidex, zoledex, the whole works and I feel like crap a lot of the time. I'm disappointed in people in my life. I don't know if they don't realize how serious this is or if they know and just don't care or don't know what to say. My dr. says it's important that I feel like I have enough support and I don't feel that way. It makes it hard to keep going. Anyone else feel like this? Log in to post a reply",
