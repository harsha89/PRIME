However, I agree with the previous postings - the anesthesia team is very specialized, and are aware and able to deal with different health issues. I had lots of fear before surgery, fear about everything. In fact, I recall telling a nurse in pre-op I was terrified. So, the emotions are just part of the pre-surgery process.  I just need to know that the surgeries I am having this summer are saving my life, and the risks are part of the process. I need to give the anesthesia team honest information about me; then they are responsible to do the right plan for my health and conditions. Just wanted to encourage you to know that fear itself is part of the process, my opinion, and it is natural to have fears before surgery.",

If it's the same breast?? Perhaps they can do both biopsies at the same time. I also found getting second opinions along the way helped to assure me that all would be well. Remember to breathe, and having a happy place in my mind helped me through the stress. Best wishes...",

The sentinel node biopsy prior to the mastectomy was not as intense as I had projected it to be, and the mastectomy was not as painful as I had projected it to be. I'm doing well at home, and just want to encourage you that you can get through this. We didn't choose this part of our journey, but we can make it through by sharing and supporting each other.Hang in there.",
