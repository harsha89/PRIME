One four-year-old and a 14-month-old. I have been breast-feeding my son the entire time. With my first son I got mastitis in my right breast and it stopped producing milk almost exclusively. When pumping the difference would be 4 to 5 ounces compared to half an ounce. This problem did not rectify with my second son. As a result I have been almost exclusively feeding off of my left breast for going on 15 months now. For months I have been telling my doctor that the veins are very pronounced on the left side. She told me that was due to overproduction because I am only feeding on one side. They are very dark and some are even bulging. Then in December I started getting some pain. It is almost like a burning pain. I went into the walk-in clinic and they diagnosed me with mastitis though I had no redness. The only thing I had was some breast swelling that my doctor had said was again because of overproduction of milk. The walking doctor sent me for an ultrasound that was clear. I understand that IBC is not picked up on an ultrasound though. That breast is also always warm to the touch (since December at least) From time to time it will cool down but gets warm again.  No the fun (blah) horrible progression. I seem to forget/ignore it for most of December and January. Then the pain came back end of February and I went in again. She noted the warmth and now some swelling of my areola.  I can typically massage out the swelling if that makes sense. But now I am getting a very pronounced dent on the underside of my breast that will swell up and then wrinkle down and get hard. Like a ridge or line. Then back to normal. I finally talked another walk I. Doctor to send me for an ultrasound and mammogram (my doc wouldn't because of my age). Has anyone had these symptoms? Log in to post a reply",
