I worked Thursday and Friday, but by Friday pm I felt horrible.  I could hardly stay awake.  On top of this, I got my cycle, which they said would end during chemo.  I guess the timing was off. I am expected to get 4 rounds of chemo every three weeks. So I have felt sluggish all weekend and can't decipher whether my issues are related to the period or the chemo.  I think my iron count is probably low because of the period and that makes me really tired.I slept most of Saturday, but have been up for two hours this morning and feel like I have some stamina to stay awake another 2-3 hours. For those of you wonderful ladies who have weathered this storm in the past, what is a typical pattern for this treatment? Will I feel sluggish for another week? Did you isolate yourselves from the world? I am almost scared to go outside. Any advise or coaching will be most appreciated!",

My treatments started last Wed and I was scared out of my mind.  Looking back I should have been more concerned about what would happen on the subsequent days.  I had no idea I would be so tired and feel so out of it.  What is the typical pattern during the three week cycle?  In other words, what are the times when I should expect to feel like crap?",
