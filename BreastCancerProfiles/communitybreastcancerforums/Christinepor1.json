The first symptom I had was breast pain (in my left breast) and it didn't go away or change with my monthly cycles so I decided to go to my family doctor where they found a grape sized lump- but blew it off as a fibroadenoma and told me to come back in 6months. However in 4months the pain has doubled, my nipple has become inverted, my breast tissue feels thickened, I have pinkish discharge from the nipple, and the area around my nipple is darker. So I had an ultrasound and they found a tumor, now the size of a golf ball- but they claim it's benign because I am \"too young to have cancer.\" So once again they stated to come back in 6months. But instead I called another doctor who referred me to a breast cancer center for a mammogram. Can someone give me a second opinion on these symptoms and if I should truly be worried? Thank you guys so much in advance. Log in to post a reply",
