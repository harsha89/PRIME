I think the chemo has done me in, My feet, legs and hands burn, my feet are are always burning or freezing, I also have to have help getting out of bed, I am using a cane to walk with my balance is so out of wack. The rads have taken a toll on me to. I hope I can work thru the last 8. I took three days off this past week, It's getting tougher to work .I am on strong pain meds but they only take the edge off, which I am thankful for that.     I just want to live with no pain, I have been very strong thru all of this but I am really running on low and getting depressed, It's like will the pain and weakness ever go a away. I dont know what I would do if I couldnt work and didnt have insurance. I hate whinning!!!! Sorry ladies God Bless you all.....",
