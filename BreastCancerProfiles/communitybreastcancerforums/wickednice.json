I have big lumbs under each arm pit and a bump in the middle of my chest. the nurse thinks that they will go down with excerise but they really are uncomfortable and they look aweful. I don't mind being flat chested but I don't want to carry boobs under my arms. I see my surgeon Fri to see what can be done with them.",
