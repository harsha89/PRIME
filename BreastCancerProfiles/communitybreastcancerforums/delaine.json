Thanks for  letting me know what you did about the mouth care. The info. I have from the cancer centre said to try club soda but I also will use Biotene and the salt/baking soda combo. I really don't want mouth sores. I am going to start right away.  Yesterday was my first T/C and I still feel really well. We went out to an Indian restaurant for dinner tonight - I ate far too much. Revriki mentioned being bloated and I am bloated as well but not sure if it was the chemo or the overeating. Took the dog for a  3 km walk tonight so thought that might help me sleep but no luck there.",

Jayne_in_UK - thanks for taking the time to wish us well and let us know that you are faring not too badly with your chemo. It is so helpful to hear. tamlyn110 - I had my bi-lat. mx on Aug. 6 - no recon. I had not heard the \"iron bra\" term before but that describes it perfectly. Are you doing the recommended exercises? (no, this is not a lecture). I went to a session at the hosp. yesterday where a physical therapist showed us how to do all the exercises correctly and we had to do them in front of her. Between that and wearing my mast. cami and fiberfills all day I was in agony by early evening. I did not take any pain meds at all for my surgery or since but I just had to last night. She stressed  that we do them twice daily. I have been doing a lot of walking but only doing the exercises off and on and only the easy ones - which sort of defeats the purpose. I don't know any details about my chemo. only that I will begin in Sept. I am scared too. Were you given the option of having a port? What a relief to be able to keep in touch with others going through the same things.  My husband was stung by a wasp yesterday and was nattering on about how painful it is. I just gave him the \"look\".   I think he got the message. Gitane - thanks for the info. on Emend, Kytril and Compazine.  I am keeping a notebook with those recommendations from those who have \"been there and done that\"  ",

I never thought about only having a short period of time to get \"stretched out\" althought the physical therapist did stress how important it was to do them twice a day. I do not have a chemo start date - I have not talked to any oncs. I only know that the cancer centre will be calling me - 3 - 4 weeks post surgery - which was Aug. 6. I don't even know my HER2 status yet. Those electric shock feelings in my incisions make me flinch. We played bridge with friends last night and they must have wondered what I was doing - flinching away every so often. By the time we got home my body was in pain from having that cami and fibrefills pressing on me through the evening. I might try your idea of just pinning the fiberfills in to a looser cami - the mastectomy ones I have are a bit tight. Around the house I just go flat but too self-conscious to do that in front of anyone else. tamlyn110 -I, too, would like to know if you will be awake for the port. I had fears about the SNB and the mast. being scary and painful and they weren't painful at all - for me - so try not to worry too much about tomorrow's procedure (I know, easier said than done). Please let us know how you made out.  London-Virgina - what a good post. I think you are coping really well with all that walking and making nice meals for yourself. I try to walk 5km every day - not sure how close that is to 10,000 steps. I am too lazy to do more than that though.  I loved the description of your walk home - being in the middle of London, crossing the bridge and walking along the Thames. My trip home from the cancer centre will involve a car ride on the freeway back to the boring old \"burbs\". Not nearly as uplifting. I am so relieved to hear that you are not vomiting although being queasy is almost as bad. I think being weepy just comes with the territory. It is just so darn hard to cope with all of what we have to go through. It is like a physical and mental assault. The letter carrier said \"have a nice day\" to me the other day;  that sent me running for the tissues.    It sounds to me like you are handling it all really well - geting out and about. I am impressed. It gives us all hope. Ice lollies are popsicles - same thing. To those of us not living in the US - do you get oncotyp dx scores - I am not positive about it but I don't think they do that testing in Canada?   mrsb45 - how is it going today? Still feeling not too badly, I hope. Please update us when you can. Great to hear from MN-Jeanne, MarieK, unklezwifeonty, viday, Jayne_in_UK - keeping in touch through this site takes some of the \"lonely\" out of the treatment process.",

Three of my grandparents were born there and one grandmother was born in Scotland. Maybe we will try it next fall.  I read as much as possible on the forums about chemo. I guess I had convinced myself that it will be pretty  bad but today I read some posts from women whose SE's were not that  difficult, so fingers crossed for all of us. I have already been to a shop that specializes in wigs and clothing for cancer patients. I have not made a final decision on a wig yet and was going to go with a one that looks just like my own hair but maybe I should look for something a little different. I really need to stop feeling so very sorry for myself and get on with things.  Ninjamom - I had bi-lat mx but with no reconstruction. It was pretty easy for me, really. I did not have to take any pain meds. I hope that your surgery will be just as easy as mine. I have come to this site every day, sometimes many times a day, since my dx and it has been such an enormous help to learn from the others here and to be able to share all aspects of having BC.

My onc. had given me pre-chemo meds to take orally yesterday and today so that shortened the time I had to have the IV in my hand.  Did not get any allergic reaction to the Taxotere and no headache from the Cytoxan so they pushed it quite fast. Think I was in and out in about 3 hours.  The nurses were very efficient, pleasant and upbeat. The treatment room was bright, airy, spacious. We had DVD players if we wanted. The snack ladies came round often, so all in all, despite the crappy cancer which is why I was getting chemo - this part was not all that bad. When the side effects kick in and I am sick, tired and  bald I will be back to complaining and being a misery but today, so far, was just fine. I did drink a lot of water yesterday and during the IV infusion and will keep it up for the next few days. Thanks to all the incredibly strong women who post on this forum for sharing their experiences. It is so helpful to know how we are all coping.

I am sure they would not give you chemo if your unhealed areas were going to be a problem but it is another rotten thing to have to deal with on top of everything else.",

I am curious - was it your choice or did your onc. recommend it. I go for my onc. consult on Sept. 10 - pretty sure I don't want a port but don't even know what chemo I will be getting. We saw the Jersey Boys while on holiday in Chicago last fall - absolutely loved it and I hope that you can go. It will make you smile. ",

Mine seems to be farther down than what you ladies are describing. It does not hurt either. Someone please tell me that theirs is the same. I will be obsessing forever now that he was digging nodes out of the wrong spot.     My tumour turned out to be 4 cm which is larger than the mammo. showed. I have ILC, ER+PR+, 0/4 nodes, Grade 2 - nothing on the report about stage and my surg. did not mention it - and like the idiot I am, I  I did not ask. I think I am IIA from looking on-line.  There was nothing in the report about Her2 either.",

I don't want to have any more surgery.  My range of motion is very good and my chest only feels tight in the mornings now. I just seem to have put my life on hold till my chemo is over and then I want to not have to think about cancer for a while - I hope that proves to be the case for all of us.  At home I just go flat most of the time and I am fine with that.",

I knew that I would never have another moment of peace (probably won't anyway) worrying about whether it was sneakily growing in the other breast. My surgeon agreed with me. I had my surgery two days ago - still feeling a little shocky when I look down at my flat chest but I guess I will get used to it -don't have much choice anyway. As well, I think it will be easier to cope with dressing, etc to be assymetrical.Now have to get my head around dealing with what ever chemo they decide to give me. I am exhausted with this whole ordeal.",

There was no palpable lump and I had had an \"all clear\" mammo. 8 months prior. I stared at it and willed it to go away for three weeks before I finally made an appt. for diagnostic mammo. and ultrasound. Sure enough I have ILC and am having my mx surgery in two weeks time. They found it with the spot compression mammo. I did BSE every month and never felt any changes. I am in Canada too. The radiologist told me right then that I had cancer and to call my doctor - they did not make me wait for  a week for the test results. U/S guided biopsy confirmed it.  Hopefully yours will turn out to be nothing but you acted quickly and are being proactive.   I come to this forum all the time now because the women here are amazingly knowledgeable, empthatic and supportive.  You can get an MRI quickly if you go private. Cover all your bases. Keep us informed.",
