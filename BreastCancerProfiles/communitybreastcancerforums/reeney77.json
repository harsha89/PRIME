My hair was able to grow back in and stay in for the remainder. I was just hoping it would be like that now -not the pneumonia of course but hair growing in and staying. Oh well. Just sick of wearing something on my head every single day. Hope everyone is doing well! Are we going to start a new board for the people who finish treatment?",
