The results came back negative for cancer, but they determined I have mastitis.  However, it was a very atypical mastitis (no flu-like symptoms, no fluid to drain, just a fast growing lump).  Now they're sending me to a breast surgeon to \"keep monitor it\".  I'm scared this may turn into IBC.  Could that be a possibility? What kind of questions should I ask the breat surgeon? Any advice? Has anyone had something like this happen to them?  I've also been on antibiotics for a few days now, but the lump doesn't feel any smaller.  Could it be that it's not getting smaller because of the biopsy?  Log in to post a reply",
