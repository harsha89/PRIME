Sending a hug to my sisters and brothers and wishing you all good health, Almost Done ",

I was on a diuretic as well but I stopped it for I was always running to a bathroom. I guess that is why my ankles are swollen and perhaps why I probably wake up with headaches often, ie today. But with all that said I am almost done. And it is better than arimidex so hang in there. Give yourself a party whenever you want to stop. After 57 I want to stop, so I am planning my big bash. If it were not for this forum I think I would have stopped. So thank you everyone and I will toast you all at my party. Have a sweet day! Almost done",
