I still don't know the stage of my cancer although I saw an oncologist yesterday. I know that cancer has spread to my lymph node (one is enlarged). But I have also a lot of mental issue with my husband wanting to leave me and some suicide thought. I guess they didn't like my saying that the cancer was a good way to end my life without too much involvement on my part. Oncologist was very caring and took my needle phobia at heart. He suggested that I have a catheter place on my chest and then all medicine and blood work could go through the catheter. No needle after that. Still I am really scared about the placement of this catheter and the IV accompanying it!!!!! He said that usually surgery comes first but in my case, he recommends chemo first. It seems that my cancer is aggressive and fast growing. I am not yet ready to lose my hair on my head. I am afraid I will feel the drugs coming through my vein. I wanted to wait longer before starting anything. Is this suffering really worth it? I will keep you posted!",

He will support me but it is not the same when you know that you will enter another nightmare after you will have left one! Catheter will be placed the 15th. After that CT scan of my whole body and bone something, don't remember anymore what. Small question: is it standard procedure to have CT scan of the whole body + i guess X-ray of the bone? ",

Nurse was very nice, she asked me to think about something nice but I don't want to associate something nice with something awful. It would taint my good thought for the rest of my life. I put on the numbing cream and wrap with clinging plastic wrap but unfortunately when I bent my elbow, the cream spread away from the area to numb so I started to het anxious. Big lesson for next time, I need to find something else to put on the cream... The good thing though was that the dressing removal wasn't painful. All in all, I hated the rubber band they use to get the vein pop, i felt the IV, and my shoulder was sore from the position for the MRI. I am now really scared of the sentinel node biopsy that I will eventually get. But I guess I will survive Cheers to all ",

I live in US but I am from Belgium. Like Jacquibutterfly, i am really afraid of needles. I never go to the dentist or do annual check up because of needle fear. It is quite extreme. I also refused half of the blood work when I was pregnant. I got such an awful experience of my first epidural that i delivered my second child without it. I have had a biopsy done. It took all my courage to take an appointment for torture session. Once there, i got very stressed and requested that my friend be in the room with me. Hopefully the radiologist was very helpful. When the time of the numbing injection arrived, I was hyperventilating and crying like a baby. At first the injection wasn't bad but all of a sudden it started to be painful. I don't want to have another needle on my breast! Hopefully after that i didn't feel a thing and was very interested in what was happening on the screen. I had a first appointment with a surgeon who understood my fear and prescribed emla cream plus valium to go through MRI. I have decided to try the emla cream alone because I want to stay alert after MRI. I will go tomorrow sereine. The cream must work or else! So now I am crossing my fingers and hoping the cream will work. Is there other people just diagnosed who are sharing my phobia? I will let you know how the MRI went. I am so paralysed by my fear that I could refuse treatment.",
