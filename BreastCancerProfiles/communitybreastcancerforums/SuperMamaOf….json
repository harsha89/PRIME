I am having a biopsy done at some point this week, whenever my doctor gets the referral sent over. I can't afford to play around with this thing; I have too much family history with breast cancer and the outcomes haven't been very good. I'm only 29, but I know it can strike anyone of any age. My best friend from a while back had it and she was only 31. Age doesn't matter. I wish you all the best and I know how frustrating it can be when you want answers, and feel like nobody is in your corner. I have been there. Good luck and if you're getting tested, let us all know what the outcome is!",
