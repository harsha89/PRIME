For the longest time, my doctors said to start getting mammograms 10 years before the youngest relative was diagnosed (so I would start getting them at 30).  With how strong this familial link seems to be however, I don't think I want to wait that long.  My mom and I are going to talk to a genetic counselor (again) in the middle of July to see what our options are.  At this point, I think I want to be tested for the mutation.  I can't find any information/research, however, on women my age being tested and coming back with a positive result for the mutation. Are there others out there who have tested positve at this young age? I'm scared of knowing but I want to know.  I don't have kids yet.  It makes me nervous to think of the consequences of getting the test done.  But I wouldn't want to wait until I get cancer to make a decision.  If I can avoid going through what my family members have gone through, I want to.  I would like to do anything I can to help prevent it as much as possible.  But I'm only 23.  Could I really need to make a decision before my 24th birthday as to whether or not I have my breasts removed? And what about when I get pregnant? How does it work with reconstructed breasts and pregnancy? With how much your body changes? Basically, I'm just scared and am hoping that other young women who are going through what I'm going through, or who have already gone through all of this, can help me get through it.  I don't know who to talk to that can relate.",
