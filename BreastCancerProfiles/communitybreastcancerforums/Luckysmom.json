As you can see by surfing around this site, cancer is not fun but it is indeed manageable. One thing I learned from my experience of three years ago was that I had a slew of people wanting to help me if I would only open my mouth and ask for it .... these boards too were a huge source of strength and support for me during my journey. Be good to yourself, take plenty of deep cleansing breaths. Waiting is a bitch, no doubt about it. We've all been there and will be there for you!",

What I tell people now is to stock up on popsickles; they were the only thing I could stomach during the later chemo treatments. I always take one with me for my girlfriend who I sit with during her chemo treatments. God bless all of you; I got so much wonderful support from this board every step of the way in 2006 and am so grateful for it. My Profile says I joined in 2007 for some reason; I joined a week after my March 2006 diagnosis. Hugs to all of you.",
