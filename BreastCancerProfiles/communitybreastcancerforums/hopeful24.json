(I have no sisters or aunts.) We are both BRACA negative, but the genetic counselor feels there is just another gene we carry. I am currently on Evista. I'm undergoing mammograms and sonograms every six months, MRI yearly and the oncologist every three months. They are vigilant about watching the new mass, which has grown slightly, but still doesn't appear on imaging. The genetic counselor has put my risk of developing bc in the next five years at 70%. A new breast surgeon -- who does nothing but bc and specializes in high risk -- said he does not want to do another lumpectomy, he would prefer me to plan for a mastectomy. My oncologoist and genetic counselor are in agreement. I have had enough with the surgeries, medication, tests and appointments and am ready to do it. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified. I have an appointment this week with a plastic surgeon to discuss the details of the reconstruction (the bs went over the basics). This is a very personal decision that you have to make, but you need to get people on your 'team\" who are in agreement with your decision.",
