I was positive I was going to have a mastectomy my surgeon, oncologist, radiologist told me I was a great candidate for a lumpectomy. I'll be starting chemo in a couple of weeks. I have read some things that help chemo and radiation like dringing slushes while the chemo is going in, it helps so you wont get mouth sores, use pure aloe immediately after radiation so you won't burt, use sea breeze on your head so it doesn't itch and use something rogain to keep the folicals doing their thing. On and on - does anyone have any other suggestions to get me through the 3 months every 3 weeks, 3 months every week and 35 weeks or radiation? I believe I'll be getting A/C plus taxol. Also, although I'm not a drinker, but I have started to dring a glass of red wine at night and when out with friends I love frozen margaritas - what is the protocol on alcohol while on chemo and radiation? Lastly, my doctors are in Austin, I'm in AZ right now, they thought I needed to get away because I wasn't getting any support and understanding from my daughter and son-in-law, so I am here with loving friends and will start my chemo here. I think I'll go back to Austin for the remainder of my chemo, it's up in the air but I would like to get back home to Michigan - can anyone suggest good doctors in the metro Detroit area, even further, it doesn't matter how far I have to go if the Drs are great. I looked on the Karmanos site but wasn't impressed with the site at all, not much info, no bios. Of course, I am terrified of the triple negative. I know the oncologist gave me the %/odds but I have no idea what she said. Except the oncologist and surgeon were very happy with my results and said that I should be too. Anything else I should know would be helpful. Like, do I have to stay out of the sun, do I have to give up swimming this year? Anything that will help and give me tips. Cookie",

I did hear to use Sea Breeze on your head for itching or something, forgot now, but have it on hand. Also, if you have time, go see your dentist and have your teeth cleaned. Use Biotene toothpaste and mouth wash. Get it in any drug store, it is for \"dry mouth\" and for sensitive gums. Also, a soft tooth brush. Yes, lots of water. A friend of mine worked in a urology office and she said if you don't drink lots of fluids to wash the chemo out of your bladder you can get bladder cancer because the cancer cells stay in the bottom of your bladder. So lots and lots and even more liquids. Dove soap and Moisturelle Lotion. That's all I've found out so far. I did hear from someone on chemo that she was told not to eat any lunch meat or fruit or veggis that don't have to be peeled, i.e. oranges, bananas? I don't know, this is what I  heard so I'm going to ask the oncology nurse about this. No antioxident vitamins or the like. Actually, nothing without your oncologist saying it is ok. Again, I don't know if it is true, but I heard that if you drink something like a slushy when getting your chemo and swish it around in your mouth that it will prevent mouth sores. Also, for radiation, have your pure aloe with you and put it on immediately, then reapply every few hours. But, I really want to know about that \"goodie\" bag. I get my port in on Tues. so I suppose I'll start chemo shortly thereafter. I am triple negative, 4.5 cm invasive tumor, part of it was maybe 1.5 that was not invasive, nothing in the lymph nodes (sentinal and 1 axillary), good margins. I have bodacious tatas so even though I was sure I wanted a mastectomy, my surgeon, oncologist and radiologist said I really should just have a lumpectomy. I am glad I listened to them. All of this was in Austin, TX. I live in MI but now am in AZ, as planned with friends yearly. Saw an oncologist here who told me \"we're going to be aggressive and kick some butt\" the radiologist said this can be cured and that is what he is expecting (yeah, if I could only believe him). He said it was good that I had a lumpectomy, you can't even see where the lump was. He said the reason being, if we need to at some time, we can always do a mastectomy. I had some blood work done and I think the radiologist and/or oncologist said it'd tell them if there was any cancer in my blood and the oncologist said it all came back ok.   So, I am anxious to get going. I, like everyone else, had a real hard time at first, then was ok, but now I'm dreading getting my head shaved. A friend is going to do it for me, but I am so afraid that I'm going to cry. I already have a wig. Looks just like my hair only maybe a little more than I have, my hair is thin. But color and style are exact. So, I say, \"Let's Roll!\" get this started, the sooner the better because it will be over faster. Take care all. We can do this, there are people a lot worst off then us. Just keep faith and I'll pray for everyone of you, please do the same for me. Cookie",

I cry at store openings and surprised myself that I didn't cry today, I was so sure I would. My husband and a friend went with me, the friend sat with me, my husband doesn't like needles and can't even hold our cats when they get their shots, so he sat in the waiting room.  The chemo took about 2 hours, may be only 1.5 in the future because she let the chemo go in slowly to see if I'd have any reactions, which I didn't. That all took place from 2-4 and it is now 8 and I'm still doing great. YES, you need to drink a lot of water after the chemo because the chemo can cause your bladder to bleed so you have to have the water to wash it out. The onc told me 8-10 glasses a day usually and another quart for the chemo to get out. Also, I was told to go to the bathroom as soon as I feel I need to, don't wait, even at night when you wake up then figure you can wait and go back to sleep, just get up immediately and go. Also, you'll pee red and even your tears could be red, just til the chemo goes through. The Port: I am so happy I got the port. Dr originally said that the chemo is so strong that it isn't good to use your veins anyway. No fuss, no muss, no pain at all. I am so happy, it was very uneventfully, thank goodness. The Drive:  Onc said I would be able to drive myself to and from chemo, and today I certainly could have. Will let you know in 2 weeks if that is still true. GuitarGrl: I know where you are coming from. I cried and cried and that is why I was so surprised today that I was very calm. I must say, though, my onc gave me xanax for anxiety and I had taken it prior but haven't for a couple of weeks now. I was going to take one today but forgot and was pleased to know I didn't need it. SO, if you haven't taken anything for anxiety perhaps you need to talk to the Dr. Honestly, you don't have to go around crying and crying, you will feel so much better if you are somewhat, calm. I hope once this gets started you'll feel much better. For the first time, today, I said I was cancer free. My blood work for cancer came back with a big fat zero, meaning there are no cells in my blood. What a relief. Everyone: Here's what I am getting:Aloxi and Decadm for naseua, then Cytoxin, then Epirubicin - finished - every two weeks for 4 sessions. Now, starting tomorrow I have to go every day for 5 days to get a neupogen shot for the white blood cells. I'll have a blood test tomorrow and one on day 13 (1 day before my second chemo). Question:  My first session of chemo, I am getting the Epirubicin (it is in the Adriamycin family) instead of the Adriamycin, is anyone else getting Epriubicin, if so why did you/your onc choose this treatment? My onc said that the E is getting good results in Europe but isn't used widely here in the US yet. Just wondering what some other thoughts are on this. I am fine with it. He is treating me aggressively, with the triple negative you have to be. He actually said that he has never treated anyone as aggressively as he is treating me. So, ladies, we can all do it. Believe me, if I can get through it you can too. I am a real woos. Anxious to hear that everyone had a great 1st chemo day and all is good with everyone. Cookie",

So, when I went for my shot the next day, after the nurse almost fell over when she found out what I drank, she said, 12-14 glasses of water a day, every day is pleanty.

I am not good a getting around this site so hope that my comments go to the correct place. I live in MI, was diagnosed in TX mid December (while visiting my daughter and her family). I am now in AZ, Coolidge, (on a previously planned trip with friends) and have found an oncologist here. He is aggressive, as you need to be with triple negative. He said there is no other way to treat triple negative, but to be aggressive. His name is. Dr. Don Hill, 1.520.876.5770, Casa Grande, AZ. I also just today, received an e-mail from a site called Breast Cancer Watch, where I e-mailed asking about treatment for triple negative. The response was AC-T or TAC. Also, I quote, \"... especially as triple negative disease, regardless of tumor size, is generally considered higher risk breast carcinoma. ..\" The author also suggested \"... consulting with a leading clinical investigator like the great Robert Livingston in Tucson at (Arizona) University Medical Center, who is an innovative thinker not constrained solely by standard protocols, and one of the best breast csncer experts in the world, not just the US. ...\" Dr. Hill told me he is willing to be \"creative\" as he felt I wanted to be aggressive, just as he suggested. He also says to go dose dense, every 2 weeks instead of every 3 weeks, if my body can take it. I am taking this e-mail in to him tomorrow (Thurs) to read. We're just maybe an hour away from Tucson. But I am hoping that he may know Dr. Livingston (I think when he called me the other night, and we talked for one hour, he had mentioned his name) or at a minimum would give him a call and run me by him. SO, I hope this answers some questions and gives some insight, ESPECIALLY to whoever it is that is opting not to get chemo. Everything I have seen, read and everyone I have talked to says chemo is a must for triple negative. So, please reconsider. If I am correct, he said if I get radiation and chemo I have an 80% chance of cure, and all along he's saying CURE, if I do no chemo or radiation it is 65%. I am scared to death, but I really love this guy. I've seen him once and talked to him on the phone twice. Never is he in a hurry, when he called me at night it was 9:00! He said, \"triple negative is like walking on a trail and coming up to a rattle snake, you are not going to use a stone on the rattle snake, you're going to use the biggest bolder you can to kill it.\" Gosh, I hope that I have given some insight and help to someone. I think the most recent e-mail I received sums it up. If anyone wants a complete copy of the e-mail I will be more than happy to forward it to you. I don't know how to put it in this site, I'd have to e-mail it to a specific address. Cookie",

Am now in AZ on a pre-planned trip with friends (we have RV's, very comfy). I am starting my initial dose dense chemo, every two weeks for 4 cycles. I then get a 1 month rest, and start 35 sessions of radiation, another rest then for 4 cycles, more chemo 3 weeks on 1 week off. I'd like to get back to MI. October will be 2 years since we've been to our house. Is this a good idea, during my rest period before or after radiation to go to MI. Find a Dr. prior to leaving AZ, set all up and finish my treatments in MI. I think I'd like to get my radiation here in AZ, I think. I am sure that I'd like to finish my last cycle of chemo in MI, just to be near all our friends. Can anyone help me sort this out and help me decide what we should do? I know, in a perfect world, I'd be getting all of my treatment in one place, not all over the country. This is a transit society though and besides it isn't a perfect world either. We come here every Jan for 3 or 4 months, so I'd still want the Dr. here to follow me. thanks all and we'll do another try tomorrow for chemo - yikes Cookie",

YES, you need to drink a lot of water after the chemo because the chemo can cause your bladder to bleed so you have to have the water to wash it out. The onc told me 8-10 glasses a day usually and another quart for the chemo to get out. Also, I was told to go to the bathroom as soon as I feel I need to, don't wait, even at night when you wake up then figure you can wait and go back to sleep, just get up immediately and go. Also, you'll pee red and even your tears could be red, just til the chemo goes through. The Port: I am so happy I got the port. Dr originally said that the chemo is so strong that it isn't good to use your veins anyway. No fuss, no muss, no pain at all. I am so happy, it was very uneventfully, thank goodness. The Drive:  Onc said I would be able to drive myself to and from chemo, and today I certainly could have. Will let you know in 2 weeks if that is still true. GuitarGrl: I know where you are coming from. I cried and cried and that is why I was so surprised today that I was very calm. I must say, though, my onc gave me xanax for anxiety and I had taken it prior but haven't for a couple of weeks now. I was going to take one today but forgot and was pleased to know I didn't need it. SO, if you haven't taken anything for anxiety perhaps you need to talk to the Dr. Honestly, you don't have to go around crying and crying, you will feel so much better if you are somewhat, calm. I hope once this gets started you'll feel much better. For the first time, today, I said I was cancer free. My blood work for cancer came back with a big fat zero, meaning there are no cells in my blood. What a relief. Everyone: Here's what I am getting:Aloxi and Decadm for naseua, then Cytoxin, then Epirubicin - finished - every two weeks for 4 sessions. Now, starting tomorrow I have to go every day for 5 days to get a neupogen shot for the white blood cells. I'll have a blood test tomorrow and one on day 13 (1 day before my second chemo). Question:  My first session of chemo, I am getting the Epirubicin (it is in the Adriamycin family) instead of the Adriamycin, is anyone else getting Epriubicin, if so why did you/your onc choose this treatment? My onc said that the E is getting good results in Europe but isn't used widely here in the US yet. Just wondering what some other thoughts are on this. I am fine with it. He is treating me aggressively, with the triple negative you have to be. He actually said that he has never treated anyone as aggressively as he is treating me. So, ladies, we can all do it. Believe me, if I can get through it you can too. I am a real woos. Anxious to hear that everyone had a great 1st chemo day and all is good with everyone. Cookie",

Also, my onc. said that that this powerful stuff isn't good for your regular veins. Thus, the port is a good thing. It is really a breeze. I can't imagine not having it. I go every day for 5 days for the shot after chemo. I have my friend here with us and she is going to start giving me that shot. It does not go into the port but the needle is very small, can't feel the shot at all. I don't know if I could give it to myself though. So glad our friends are here with us. Cookie",

The Doctor gave me an antibiotic because of redness and some swelling, but I realized it was the tape. Took the antibiotic anyway, but when I took the clear tape off of my skin as much as possible, just folded it under itself it was much better. I also took my allergy pills and that helped a lot. I actually had welts where the tape was. But that was only for a few days, less than a week, then it all came off for my chemo. Ladies: I feel shaky, is this normal? Almost to the point of \"feeling\" cold shaky, but different. Can't explain it.   NEULASTA, I get NUPOGEN instead and get it once a day over 5 days. I have to no pain at all. Did have an awful headache from it the first night though. I was surprised that I wasn't getting one shot but they told me that they found this was better and no/or less pain. I have absolutely, no paid, so far. Did say joints may hurt but don't have that either.  I do find it hard to get started in the a.m. and feel a tiny bit sick to my stomache. Not sure what that's all about. Maybe just getting used to all of this, I feel almost \"lost\". Just a crazy \"feeling\" but I hate the shaking! Cookie ",

Yes, it is thicker than my hair but the style, etc. is the same. Because I had a script from my onc. insurance is paying for it. Well, they are paying $200 of it and it was either $270 or $370. Don't recall I went onto the TLC site and ordered another wig, it is called a 24 hour wig with a wide headband and can be worn during sleep. I thought I'd like that. Their wigs are not expensive at all, we'll see what they look like. I would hope they'd be of decent quality. Will let all know. I also got a bracelet to wear on my left wrist not to take blood or blood pressure on that arm. I am so afraid that I will at some point, forget to tell someone about that. Also, with my Power Port, I have a card to carry and a dob for my key chain. It is important that anyone that will be dealing with me should know that it is a Power Port. Guess there is something different with it. I have always hated hats and never had looked good in them BUT, I tried on one (although it is felt/wool) it has a larger rim but a little floppy, it looked great! So, I got it and on the TLC site in their sale section there is a pink cotton hat, very similiar to the other one I got. So, I'll see. My husband thought that scarves and bantanas would bring more attention to the fact that I have bc. Well, it is a fact, but he thought I wouldn't want to draw attention to it and a scarf or bandana would. Cookie",
