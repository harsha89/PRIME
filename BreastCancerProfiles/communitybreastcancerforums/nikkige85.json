Doc says dont be too worried your so young its probably just cysts plus you have lumps (that i didnt feel) in both breasts and it so unlikely to have it both breasts (this I know) she says but if it would put your mind at ease I will schedule you an ultra sound to make sure. Next day had ultrasound but they only checked the one breast with the bigger lump and then told me to have a biopsy. Went in for the biopsy doc said that it would be better to just remove the lump first to make sure its not cancerous (which he is 99% sure its not) and because you shouldnt have a lump in your breast. Then I mentioned all of my lymph nodes that are swollen. He said he would remove those too. Was about to bring up the lumps in the other breast but he brushed it off and started on my blood pressure. both my breast are achy idk, i just dont know. I know im young but cancer (no matter what kind) doesnt care...grr so frustrated.",

He said he wanted to just take the lump out and remove a lymph node (because they are swelling all over) and we were going to schedule it for friday BUT then he saw my blood pressure reading and said he would not perform the surgery without me getting my blood pressure down. So after that I went to m doctor and had her put me on some blood pressure medicine. I havent checked my bp yet planning on it when I get home for lunch.",

Called the other joke of a place that i seen when they decided that it wasnt a cyst and asked why they never checked the other lumps that she found in the left breast plus with the swollen lymphnodes on the left breast and the \"pain\" on the side of the breast and they said that I needed to quit calling until I get my blood pressure down and that they would check it when I went into surgery. Cried a bit this afternoon. I never felt like this before from a health care professional and ive had 2 kids!",
