First 2 days were fine, yesterday I had some red discoloration and some aching from under my arm too. But the biggest change was the taste in my mouth! Full metal taste- still hasn't gone away... I'm going to ask the doc about it this morning but was curious if anyone else had this side effect? My total course is 6 weeks... Had a lumpectomy a month ago... I've been offered tamoxifen but will most likely decline.... These posts are so important to me I'm very grateful to have found this forum!!!",
