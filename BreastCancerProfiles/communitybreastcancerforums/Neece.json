I had mastectomy in 2002 and took some time to get over that, but the second one in Aug this year was much harder - all my lymph nodes were taken this time and I think that made the difference. Was OK for the first few days but once I got home the pain really set in. Some of the pain is due to damaged nerves (that burning, prickly 'sunburn' type pain) and there's not a lot (bar meds) you can do about that. Rest assured it does fade eventually - after about a month I could not feel it as much (except when very tired). However the stiffness and tightness you can help by doing the movement exercises you may be shown in hospital - if not go see a physical therapist ASAP to get some appropriate range of movement exercises to do - and try hard to do them several times EVERY day - it is a real chore but it does work. Good luck and be gentle with yourself.  Good luck with your other treatment oo. It is a long hard journey but there is plenty of support (including on this forum. Neece",

Great to read such informative posts on the topic. I had previous mastectomy 8 yrs ago with only a few lymph nodes involved and this time the post op stuff has felt much harder to handle - the burning, the electric shocks, the 'iron bra' feel (love that term), and I sitll have one drain in which is taking its time to slow down in output. So have not felt really great since I got home 2 weeks ago, but I have noticed a gradual improvement over the past 48 hours which is encouraging.  Not sure how chemo will affect me so just have a wait and see attitude. I have ordered some beautiful hats and head wraps from an online company (a US one, ironically - I am in Australia!) which has a wonderful range of really lovely and stylish headcovers, much nicer than the ones I could find here, so am all ready for the hair loss saga... at least I think I am, I may not feel quite so ready when it happens! I am lucky to have a fantastic 'solid as a rock' husband and a supportive family and group of friends - not sure how I would survive all this without them. Really value reading others' experiences and tips for coping with chemo, so thanks. Good luck to us all!",

A number of years previously I had 5 nodes removed from other arm and was always extremely careful to avoid using that arm for blood draws, blood pressure etc. However during chemo last year I had to use that arm for everything inlcuding chemo infusions! So far (touch wood) that arm has not developed any signs of swelling. However if I had a choice I would not use either arm. They can do blood pressure measures around calf on leg.I have had one blood draw from foot but found it uncomfortable to say the least - and lots of nurses etc are not experienced or confident doing this. So it leaves me with a bit of a dilemma. I use the less at risk arm when necessary but wish I didn't have to. I certainly don't want lymphoedema in both arms!",

Zahra was a very special person, a woman from Iraq who fled the regime there and walked across the mountains in the night, in the middle of winter, with her husband and three small children. She refused to leave her baby behind despite the urgings of some who feared his cries would lead to their discovery by Saddam's thugs. They were eventually granted refugee status and came to live in Australia. How lucky were we? She was a brave, generous, funny and enormous hearted person. For a few years she ran a cafe in my local shopping area (that is how I came to know her) and despite not having much herself she constantly gave meals to the homeless in the area.When people asked her why she gave so much away she would answer: 'If I dont feed him/ her, who will?' A huge heart in a tiny woman. Her battle with breast cancer was awful but she faced it with such bravery. She was the bravest woman I know.  We held a celebration of her life in the local school hall several days after her funeral. About 400 or so people crammed into the hall: so many people knew and loved this woman. She united a community in life and after her death. Neece",

Just in the last two weeks Ii have found two small lumps in my underarm area and of course had some anxiety given my bc diagnosis. Had them ultrasounded today and it seems they are more likely to be lymph fluid blockages rahter than anything too sinister - but goodness me the merry go round spins doesn't it? Anyway good luck wtih your AWS symptoms and I hope it eases up for you soon.
