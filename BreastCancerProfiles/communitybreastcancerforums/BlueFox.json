If you have positive nodes but your onc has not recommended you for radiotherapy, may be worth having a further discussion with them and mention this paper. Those of you who are having radiotherapy may also be interested in reading the paper to gain a better understanding of the benefits. iameclectica.blogspot.co.uk Dx 10/2012, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 2/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I started colouring it at 3 months post chemo - no more Chemo White.  I used a temporary hair dye in order to avoid the harsher chemos, but it seemed to cover all the grey very well.  I spent some time researching hair dyes see http://iameclectica.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/colouring-hair-after-chemotherapy.html",

Is forearm hair was more vulnerable as the chemo drugs go into the arms?  Did I have a narrow escape from more serious hair loss?",
