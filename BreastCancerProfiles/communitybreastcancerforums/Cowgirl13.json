The part that made it easier for me is that dying for me did not mean that i would never see my children again.   I don't have kids.

I posted earlier about Buck crossing the rainbow bridge a few weeks ago.  I've had some wonderful horses in my life but oh my god was Buck special.  He came to me just before my diagnosis.  This sounds hokey but I do think we were old souls. just noticed we are one day apart on our diagnosis date. ",

When I was first diagnosed, it took about a week to get into see a breast surgeon and I had surgery about 10 days later.  It was only after surgery that I met with my oncologist.  I can definitely see a benefit to seeing an oncologist first, but that's no how I did it.  The best advise I can give you is to be sure you like and feel comfortable with your surgeon and onc.  It's very important that you feel good about them....I changed onc's because of that and was so glad I did.  Others will post here shortly.  Please know you are not alone.

As long as I have a horse I can do anything.  There were times when I could barely brush him but I did.  Enjoy your new saddle, ride and if you can't ride for a while, sit in a chair near your horse and read him the newspaper (I know someone who did this). The support here is wonderful as you can already see. Take care and I wish you many, many miles of Happy Trails. Lizzie ",

Great advise about breaking things down into manageable pieces.  It looks like, right now, that all you have to decide is about your surgery.  My surgeon presented my options so clearly. so, make sure you take someone with you      think about tape recording session      just show up for your appointment.

What I would like to touch on is the positive side of getting a biopsy out of the way now--the only reason being the anxiety you feel.  Biopsy is a simple procedure and within a week you will know for sure what is going on.  And since most biopsy's turn out to be benign 80% of the time--you could just get on with your life and hopefully not have to worry about it. As a person who can be very anxious myself, I just wanted to give the 'anxiety' perspective. Good luck. Lizzie",

If you counts go too low, they will not give you chemo until your counts are normal.   There was one time i showed up for chemo and they couldn't do it based on my blood and platelet counts even though i was taking neulesta..  Remember, while going thru chemo you will have an impaired immune system, if your counts go lower, you will be susceptable to illness.  Also, do get the steriods--they prevent allergic reaction. Good luck on our first chemo--i was terrified I would blow up in the chair!  I loved my chemo team and always felt so well cared for.  It sounds strange but I miss them.",
