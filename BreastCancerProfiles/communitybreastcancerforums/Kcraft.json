Surgeon said when we met there's a 10% chance the core needle biopsy was wrong and it could be cancerous. I haven't worried because 10% is very small and he sounded confident they got good samples.  I'm still not overly concerned but after surgery, the doc spoke to my husband and said everything went well. He also said it was an \"ugly mass.\" My DH thinks he was just commenting that he needed to come out, but I assume most masses he takes out aren't pretty. Is that just something they say? DH didn't ask for clarification. I would've said...as opposed to ? Or worse than you expected? Or ugly as in suspicious? Luckily I can call Tuesday, so it's not a long wait.  Any thoughts on the comment? Log in to post a reply",

I've since had two children: ages 5 and 1. I noticed a change to this area in February and had a CBE. She said it was not likely cancer, but let's check it out. Last Friday 3/7, I had a mammogram and US. The radiologist recommends a biopsy because the spot has changed when compared to previous images and she is concerned about the blood flow to that region. It's in the same location as before. It has increased irregular shape, is (27.8mm x 28.5mm x 10mm), and has increased calcifications. The concern last time we're because I had microcalcifications, so that didn't worry me. I concerned about the blood flow, though. She also said there were small cysts inside the mass, but I can't find anything on that. Anyone else ever heard of that? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Kcraft wrote: So I have a biopsy Thursday. Time has slowly ticked by. I've been trying to stay busy. Today I finally got the results from the mammo and US. Here's what it says: A left breast ultrasound was performed. A mixed echogenicity predominantly solid mass is identified deep within the left breast 2:30 to 3 o'clock position, 6 cm from the nipple. The area measures 26.8 mm x 26.1 mm x 10.2 mm. Calcifications are visualized in the mass. There also appears to be some cysts within the mass. The margins are irregular. There is significant vascularity within the mass. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended for further evaluation.  1. The palpable area of concern corresponds to a mixed echogenicity predominantly solid irregular mass with internal vascularity and calcifications in the 2:30 to 3 o'clock position, 6 cm from the nipple, measuring 27.7 mm x 28.3 mm x 10.4 mm. Although a prior biopsy revealed florid duct hyperplasia with papillomatosis and no evidence of malignancy given the clinical change as well as the appearance repeat biopsy is recommended for further evaluation to exclude a papillary carcinoma. The findings were discussed with the patient. Now I'm all kinds of confused. Some of it sounds promising; some of it sounds horrifying. And I'm left wondering why they didn't take the thing out back in 2006. It's the exact same spot! The vascularity and calcifications are giving me fits!  Ugh. I suppose I should be thankful I'll know at least benign or malignant in another week.  Log in to post a reply",
