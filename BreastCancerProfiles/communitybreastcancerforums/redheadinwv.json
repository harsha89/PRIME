I am 39, first diagnosed in April of 2012 then in December 2012 diagnosed Stage IV with met to spine.  I have a 17 year old son and am happily married to my very best friend. I was first diagnosed as triple negative, had a reoccurence on chemo (AC & T) which came back HER2+ therefore the change in status.  I start Herceptin/Perjeta/Taxotere tomorrow.  I have been on Zometa for 2 months now.
