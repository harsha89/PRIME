      "Content": "Shachar wrote: Hello, everyone!   I'm a 37 year old mother of five children ages 16-8.  My journey began around a year ago.  I had noticed some breast milk leaking from my left breast.  It wasn't a lot so I wasn't too concerned, but I had also been having migraines that had come on suddenly, blurred vision, dizziness, and would see spots.  The doctor decided it was migraines and nothing to worry about so off I went.  This was my first doctor's visit in five years because I stay in good shape and am very active in martial arts.  The dizziness continued along with the leaking breast milk, and now I had a small (maybe marble size) lump in the bottom portion of my left breast that got larger in the middle of my cycle and then shrunk near menstruation.  Back to the doctor I went and this time he determined that it was probably fibro adenomas since I have fibrous breast tissue and do drink a lot of caffeine.  That sounded good, nothing to worry about.  Three months later the lump was still changing size but was getting painful at its largest, which was now about the size of a jaw breaker.  In addition, I found two lumps under my armpit.  It was painful enough to use a heating pad to make it better at times.  Third trip to the doctor and he still said it was probably fibroadenomas but let's just get a mammogram done to make sure.   As I stood in the waiting room, the receptioninst left the window wide open as she called and told them that \"(my name) needs to be scheduled for a mammogram for fibroadenomas\".  The whole waiting room was looking so I basically ducked and ran.  Not having insurance, not wanting to ever go back and have my business broadcasted, and still thinking it was fibroadenomas (so not use in spending that $400 on a diagnositic mammogram) I decided to blow it off.  Again. It has been six or eight months now.   A few weeks ago my entire left breast turned red and felt warm to the touch for two days.  It was very painful to the touch and I noticed another lump to the left of my sternum in addition to the two in the armpit.  Both breasts had gotten larger to where I went up a cup size (now that was NICE!) but then the left has continued to grow beyond the right.  It is noticeably larger and hangs lower.  The left nipple also is being drawn in on the bottom side, like it is being pulled into a pucker. Time to quit blowing it off.  At least half of my left breast is now \"the lump\".  It feels like it is the size of a lemon and is hard.  It doesn't get smaller or larger throughout my menstrual cycle anymore.  I bawled on the front porch yesterday and my husband made the appointment for the mammogram for 3 PM at our local hospital.  Friday the 13th. The tech went out to confer with the doctor after the first shots, and more were taken with different \"paddles\" to focus in on the lump.  I got to see it on the film and named it \"Patrick\" from Spongebob because it looked like a big starfish. (Was trying to stay humerous).  Then they sent me over to have an ultrasound done and took more pictures and measurements.  The radiiologist came in and examined me, and looked like she was about to cry.  She told me not to leave here today thinking I had \"something bad\" but it wasn't cysts or fibroadenomas.  It was either A) scar tissue over an old ruptured cyst or B) let's not talk about that until after the biopsy is done.  In addition to Patrick, there were several other dark circles around it that were measured but not mentioned.  Lymph nodes?  Cysts? So next week I will be going for an ultrasound guided biopsy.  I have no idea how much this is going to cost but they said they would make payment arrangements with me.  I spent the rest of the day just bawling like I have never bawled before, on and on.  I still hope for the best but can they really tell me that scar tissue would somehow affect my lymph nodes for this period of time?   Sometimes you just know.   If I had gone 6-8 months ago would it have made a difference?  I don't know since the lymph nodes were present then as well.  Just hoping for the best and don't know where else to turn, so here I am.  I do have an excellent, supportive husband and good friends but they haven't BTDT got the t-shirt.  Before now, I have never given much thought to breast cancer.  Either way, this will forever change my life and how I look at things.

Still hoping for the best and mentally planning for the worst!  I had my pitty party last night, so I should be good for another week. ",

And do all (any) radiologists actually come back in after viewing the ultrasound pictures and the mammogram pictures taken by the techs to do a physical exam themselves before picking up the ultrasound wand and looking even more?

      "Content": "Apr 16, 2012 01:27PM - edited Apr 16, 2012 01:46PM by Shachar Thank you, guys.  Today has been a good day because I got to go back to work and have lots of distractions.  I was able to go to the hospital this morning and get a copy of the written report in addition to my ultrasound and mammogram immages on CD.  There is some good news in that it is smaller than what I suspected.  It feels huge but it seems that it isn't that big.  The report says that it is \"an ill-defined highly lobulated mass at 3 o'clock which measures 2.3 x 2.5 cm\".  I guess I don't understand why, on the ultrasound, it also showed measurements of two other masses.  One was 1.5 cm and the other was .7 cm at the largest.  The small one was round but the other was just as odd in shape as the one mentioned in the report.  So maybe I am feeling two different ones in there?  My biopsy is scheduled for Friday at 9 AM with the same radiologist.  That makes me feel more comfortable because I like her.  I guess now I am in for the long wait, but that may be good to let it sink it a little over the next four days.  Thank you all for caring and sharing. Also, it says BIRADS 4 and I have \"architectural distortion\".  Is that a polite way of saying \"this chick has a deformed breast\"?  LOL.  I can also see why it is pulling the nipple down, it is pretty close to the front of my breast and looks to be right up under the nipple.",

      "Content": "Shachar wrote: Hello, everyone!   I'm a 37 year old mother of five children ages 16-8.  My journey began around a year ago.  I had noticed some breast milk leaking from my left breast.  It wasn't a lot so I wasn't too concerned, but I had also been having migraines that had come on suddenly, blurred vision, dizziness, and would see spots.  The doctor decided it was migraines and nothing to worry about so off I went.  This was my first doctor's visit in five years because I stay in good shape and am very active in martial arts.  The dizziness continued along with the leaking breast milk, and now I had a small (maybe marble size) lump in the bottom portion of my left breast that got larger in the middle of my cycle and then shrunk near menstruation.  Back to the doctor I went and this time he determined that it was probably fibro adenomas since I have fibrous breast tissue and do drink a lot of caffeine.  That sounded good, nothing to worry about.  Three months later the lump was still changing size but was getting painful at its largest, which was now about the size of a jaw breaker.  In addition, I found two lumps under my armpit.  It was painful enough to use a heating pad to make it better at times.  Third trip to the doctor and he still said it was probably fibroadenomas but let's just get a mammogram done to make sure.   As I stood in the waiting room, the receptioninst left the window wide open as she called and told them that \"(my name) needs to be scheduled for a mammogram for fibroadenomas\".  The whole waiting room was looking so I basically ducked and ran.  Not having insurance, not wanting to ever go back and have my business broadcasted, and still thinking it was fibroadenomas (so not use in spending that $400 on a diagnositic mammogram) I decided to blow it off.  Again. It has been six or eight months now.   A few weeks ago my entire left breast turned red and felt warm to the touch for two days.  It was very painful to the touch and I noticed another lump to the left of my sternum in addition to the two in the armpit.  Both breasts had gotten larger to where I went up a cup size (now that was NICE!) but then the left has continued to grow beyond the right.  It is noticeably larger and hangs lower.  The left nipple also is being drawn in on the bottom side, like it is being pulled into a pucker. Time to quit blowing it off.  At least half of my left breast is now \"the lump\".  It feels like it is the size of a lemon and is hard.  It doesn't get smaller or larger throughout my menstrual cycle anymore.  I bawled on the front porch yesterday and my husband made the appointment for the mammogram for 3 PM at our local hospital.  Friday the 13th. The tech went out to confer with the doctor after the first shots, and more were taken with different \"paddles\" to focus in on the lump.  I got to see it on the film and named it \"Patrick\" from Spongebob because it looked like a big starfish. (Was trying to stay humerous).  Then they sent me over to have an ultrasound done and took more pictures and measurements.  The radiiologist came in and examined me, and looked like she was about to cry.  She told me not to leave here today thinking I had \"something bad\" but it wasn't cysts or fibroadenomas.  It was either A) scar tissue over an old ruptured cyst or B) let's not talk about that until after the biopsy is done.  In addition to Patrick, there were several other dark circles around it that were measured but not mentioned.  Lymph nodes?  Cysts? So next week I will be going for an ultrasound guided biopsy.  I have no idea how much this is going to cost but they said they would make payment arrangements with me.  I spent the rest of the day just bawling like I have never bawled before, on and on.  I still hope for the best but can they really tell me that scar tissue would somehow affect my lymph nodes for this period of time?   Sometimes you just know.   If I had gone 6-8 months ago would it have made a difference?  I don't know since the lymph nodes were present then as well.  Just hoping for the best and don't know where else to turn, so here I am.  I do have an excellent, supportive husband and good friends but they haven't BTDT got the t-shirt.  Before now, I have never given much thought to breast cancer.  Either way, this will forever change my life and how I look at things.

I wish everyone the best in the upcoming days for surgeries!  I think the toughest part, at least for me, is the pesky drains.  I got the right one out Friday since it was doing about 30cc/day but the left (where they removed the nodes) was still around 120cc/day.  Currently the left is down to about 60cc/day so almost there.",

DH broke the news to me that they couldn't put in the spectrum one-step implants because my pec muscles were too tight.   Due to a knee injury in karate I had been working out on the total gym instead, working those pec muscles good before I was diagnosed.  He said they had a hard time even getting TEs behind them, no fluid added at all.  So, I look like a small A cup right now.  The PS did an excellent job closing me back up, using some type of purple glue so it looks like thin little lines.  Well, the right is pretty small.  It will all be under a new areaola but the left is larger and I will probably have a two inch scar to the outside of the left nipple.  Honestly, I don't even care.  I'm just glad surgery is over even though I am looking at another one for the exchange. Surgery Friday, drugged up Saturday until Saturday evening and then extreme claustrophobia in my hospital room.  My view was of a wall out the window and the room got very, very small.  I also was tired of being so drugged so I asked them to discontinue my morphine drip Saturday morning and put me on pills instead.  I was so nauseated on the morphine that I wasn't eating.  The worst part was the anxiety from feeling \"boxed in\", so I popped an ativan and DH took me for a stroll in the wheel chair while it kicked in.  That helped a lot and I got fortunate to have a nurse on the night shift who also had anxiety issues so she understood. Came home Sunday, still nauseated and throwing up.  I started feeling weak and totally run  down, getting dehydrated.   I felt like all I could do was lay there, so I quit taking narcotic pain meds Sunday evening hoping that I would be able to eat when the nausea wore off.  A friend then gave me a phenergan pill for the nausea and I came to life again!  My doc called in Phenergan Monday morning and it was awesome to be able to eat again! Today I have been awesome, four days out.  I've been walking all over the house, straightened up my bedroom, dressed myself completely after taking a bath (waist deep only),  and feel human again!  I have removed all of the surgical tape (PS said I could when I went home) and am happily wearing a sports bra with nursing pads stuck in them so I can apply tons of neosporin to the incision.   I had three drains, two on the left and one on the right, but one of the left drains never did drain anything so they took it out before I left the hospital.  After the nurse warned me that it would probably hurt really bad, and I made her promise to go slow and stop if I asked her to, I didn't feel a thing. I am back on the pain meds but taking only half of the 750 mg hydrocodone every 5-6 hours with 6 mg of phenergan (cut into 4ths) and a regular 500 mg Tylenol.  This seems to work for me, and I take an ativan in the evening to relax.  I am getting back to myself, have pretty good range of motion and can lift both arms straight up in the air plus out to the side.  My left arm does feel a little weaker than the right.  My kids come in four times a day and make me to my arm excercises.  Friday, 7 days after surgery, I go to the PS to get my drains out and get my first fill.  He thinks I will be able to do 100 cc but we will see.   Today is the best I have felt since surgery and it's nice to be getting back to feeling like myself. When I looked at my incisions on my breasts for the first time Sunday afternoon I had to sit down on the floor because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Monday I was ready to look again and it wasn't so bad, I knew it would all be okay.  Then I let DH seem them and he said they are still the most beautiful breasts he had ever seen, kissing each one.   I sure love that guy!  He has been my rock and has waited on my hand and foot, and knowing that he thinks my breasts look okay has made me more accepting of it as well.  I think that was always my biggest fear, and now it is gone. Sending hugs and well wishes to my other sisters who are recovering and  to those who will soon be having their surgeries.  (((HUGS)))",

      "Content": "Shachar wrote: Sleep did not come well at all last night, until I invited my friend Ativan along.  A year ago, when this all began, I began having full blown anxiety attacks and so I was prescribed 30 Ativan.  I still had 25 left (hate taking medication and just dealt with it), so they have been put to good use at night since Friday.  The truth be known, I felt like a hypochondriac and put off going to the doctor for a good 6-8 months before finally going a year ago.  My best friend talked me into it, having lived through treatment for a pituitary gland tumor.  I was having the massive headaches, blurred vision, confusion, the room would tilt, eyes about to pop out of my head, seeing shadows and flashing lights, and then the left breast leaking milk.  The head symptoms would come on for a week and then disappear for a month or more.  My menstrual cycles were becoming irregular and much lighter.   I would also have anxiety that came out of nowhere, for no reason at all, worrying about crazy stuff like bills when they were all paid! (Hence the Ativan script, and another for migraines that remained unfilled).  I have no anxiety/depression history, so this was very disturbing to me and I was just convinced that I had brain tumor.  I knew something was wrong, but didn't want to be that person who had invented issues and visited the doctor constantly with invented symptoms. I was happy for a \"migraine\" diagnosis and all of my hormone levels checked out normal so no MRI. Hence, the long, long time between my visits when I discovered the lump and then watching it grow, turn my skin red and warm, having lots of pain with it, feeling the lymph nodes enlargen,and having my entire breast turn hard as a rock before softening again.   Now, I think too much.  I have googled too many ultrasound breast images and what I have doens't look like anything at all benign.  But that isn't even what bothers me the most right now.  I can clearly see the mass they measured at 2.5 cm, but there is one that looks the same...long, dark, black, and irregular (not cysts like, more like a scorpion that curls and twists) not far from it that they measured at 1.84 cm to be exact.  And then there are one or two, more roundish but still irregular and \"dished\" like pac-man's mouth that measure at .7 cm and .5 cm.  That may be the same one from different angles, but it is obviously against the chest wall and attached/imbedded slightly. And I wonder, why have they failed to mention this in the report?  Do they biopsy the biggest one first and then dump it all on you at once? That you have multiple masses?  I hate to even think that way and maybe I shouldn't have gotten the films.  I wish there was a way to upload the picture of them both on here. So I am going to be honest with my board friends because I wouldn't breathe a word of this out loud in real life.  I am terrified that I am going to be told that I have stage IV breast CA with METS.  I know this is not the right attitude and having my imagination run wild, maybe that is normal.  I don't know because I have never been through this.   I just had to \"say\" it somewhere, to acknowledge that fear.  I have begun to journal what I feel to get it out, so I don't have to burden anyone IRL with it.  I think this started with a question before my pitty party.   Yes, it did.   Did any of your doctors withhold information until they had solid evidence?  As in, seeing more masses but reporting only one and then dropping the bomb later when it was obvious from the start?  Contrary to all indications, I was quite mentally stable before.    I'm good now.  This sucks and I will probably feel very foolish for posting this when the biopsy results come back.

She offered to throw me a \"scarf\" party, lol!  I asked her if I could borrow her synthetic breast for the biopsy tomorrow, planning on putting it in my bra as a third.  The humor has helped.   Laugh the tears away.",

My lump looks really anterior on the mammogram and ultrasound pictures, right behind the nipple (probably why it's tugging on it). I'm going to be a little upset if they chew my nipple off or suck it into that machine.  Okay, I can do this now.  Sounds pain free!
