I've been reading a lot of post here and was shocked to see how many women went from stage 1, or stage 2 to stage 4. I was diagnosed 2 years ago with stage 1 grade 2 er+ her2 - and my onco type score was 25. My oncologist suggested that i skip chemo because of my age...she said that at 43 I was young and the benefit of chemo was too small (2-3%) and the side effect would out weigh the benefits. I recently looked at all my reports again and found that my rate of recurrence is 20%. I find this to be very scary! Can any of you please tell me what I should do to make my chances better....or is it all just a crap shoot and we just wait and watch... :( Thank you for your time and for this great thread to help the rest with so much more info than what we got from our Dr's. God bless you all!",

I felt a lump under my armpit (same side as I had breast cancer 5 years ago) last week and called my Dr. and had a CT scan done yesterday and have a ultrasound scheduled for coming monday. My Dr. said that she is very concerned about the lump and infact she could feel 2 additional small lumps. I'm very nervous and having a very hard time waiting for all the reports to come in. Has anyone else gone through this? Are these lumps symptoms for recurrence or of lung cancer?",
