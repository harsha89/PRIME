The chemo makes you feel like shit, most of us can relate, but cancer growing in your organs and/or bones is way more painful.  Please don't give up, I hope you can find your strength to push through it. You have a second chance here...pull out all the stops.  You've done one, 3 more to go!  Private message me, I am here for you. xo Responding directly to your question - What happens if you pull out of chemo after one session? Any harm in that? I don't believe there is any true harm...maybe losing your hair for nothing.",

Today at 9 am I was dx with IDC stage 2.  I have 3 spots - lump 1 is 0.7 mm and lump 2 is .05 mm and is a mammary lymph node.  The last I don't remember off the top of my head but said it was smaller.  I am ER + and PR -, I am not triple negative.  HER2/neu results will be back next week.  When they started going over the results I lost my shit (can we swear here, I hope so), I just kept thinking of my kids. The hardest part honestly was to watch my sweet husband ( the sensitive one) cry and cry and cry.  My nurse navigator was amazing and just took the reigns.  It was so overwhelming - really information overload.  By 1 pm I met with the surgeon who reviewed the pathology report in much greater detail and we created a plan. Let me tell you the demeanor and knowledge of this man was calming for me.  I am a data project/process/risk manager so plans and data is how I process best.  After meeting with him I felt a lot better. Step 1 is dual path. a) start chemo for 4 months b) run additional tests to check spread and a genetics test.  I PRAY PRAY PRAY it has not spread.  They did think by the US that the axillary nodes have not been impacted but that's not confirmed until surgery. Step 2 is double mastectomy - i am going for the double bc of my age and probablility of it coming back.  Step 3 is possible radiation based on the lymph node tests. So that's my story and plan.  I hope to get some feedback on said plan from you ladies.  I just pray the scans show no spread and no lymph nodes.  I also was unsure of the chemo before the surgery (kinda just wanted it OUT) but based on his explanation I agreed at that time but said I reserve the right the change.  I meet with the chemo guy (a red sox fan so i'm gonna love his bluntness) on Thursday tentatively. Hopes all i got right now.  I feel really comfortable so far with the team that has assembled and the urgency they are providing.  Now it's just comes down to schedules :)  The company I work with has great plans /support- STD and LTD and flextime, I can also work from home most of the time. They also assign a case worker to help with everything I need. I don't really understand the insurance part of it.  I have BCBS HSA (6K OOP and 6k at 10% and then covered 100%).  I don't know much about in and out of network and if I should really even care about it.  We were so close to being out of debt, only 10k to go and were going to move to charleston in the spring...but that's ok we have a new plan and that's what it is. We live in CLT, NC so it's just as nice here. I don't know you ladies but I love you already. XOXO - - off to carve pumpkins. 39 year old wife and mother of 2 children, ages 11 and 8.

Out of all the scans I've had, aside from the very 1st one, this one i am terribly scared/worried about. This pain isn't like anything else i've had, most constant, no pattern btwn sitting and walking. No injuries to explain. Hoping for a pinched nerve or arthritis or just weaker bones from hysterectomy in 2013. Ugh, i hate this feeling.",

My MO has brushed it off and wanted to wait until I was a month out from chemo to schedule any scans (he's anti scan).  I see him on Tuesday, then have to wait for the order to be approved.  I had a bone scan in November that was clear.  Thoughts?",

The pain is not constant/all day but frequent occurrences through the day. I have not observed any patterns such as pain occurring after eating, or sleeping on one side or with activity or when pressing down on the area. The pain is a little harder for me to describe \u2013 some times a sharp ache and sometimes it feels like pulling. I had a chest scan early September so not sure how far down the chest it goes to see the liver area. The only thing it said \"small hiatal hernia is present. The visualized upper abdominal organs show nothing significant.\" I saw my onc mid December and labs seemed good or they didn't say anything: August labs ALT = 26 / AST 26 December labs ALT 38 / AST 31 I saw my oncologist yesterday and he wants to proceed with a scan to be safe - it's scheduled tomorrow at 9 am. I was curious if there were others that could describe their liver pain. I am not freaking out yet as the pain isn't there all day and the frequency isn't increasing day over day. I'm over here hoping for a busted gallbladder or something :) Any feedback is welcomed!",

I will be starting chemo in December, I meet with my doctor again on tues to review the final pathology report (which said of the 15 nodes, zero were positive) and determine my cocktail of chemo.  There is a chance they may remove rads from the treatment plan but I did have an inter-mammary node that was positive so they are discussing the approach since the guidelines don't distinguish a mammary node from and axillary node.  I betcha I will still needs rads. I can honestly say chemo is the part i am most worried about - I worry more about my ability to care for my kids.  After all the chemo and rads I will remove the left breast and start working on recon.  My genetic mutation test was + so lefty's got to go (and possibly the ovarians down the road) I don't even have a good understanding of chemo and the types - so I will be reading a lot about it between now and tuesday.  I will be pacing with everyone to know what's going on, SE and questions to be asking.  Thanks for starting the tread :)",

Today I saw my head shrink and it felt good to talk to someone about my anger and negativity and hopes to take a day at a time and not worry about dying every single day I look at my kids...as a control freak/planner cancer does not mix well with my personality.  She did agree that going back to work will be a good thing for me and that I will need to create normal expectations for myself as I go through this process.  She was really good and nice.  I used every single Kleenex in the office....I'm so emotional about all this and I want to stop crying all the time and as a control freak it pisses me off that I can't stop I can't control myself/emotions.  She talked a lot about outlets and processing decisions.  I don't have outlets or hobbies - my hobbies are paying off my debt and saving money (clearly hard to do when you have cancer). Damn it. To those asking ? about meds:  I take steroids the day before, day of and day after treatment.  I get the Neulasta shot the day after infusion. I take clariton the day before the shot and 4 days after to help with bone pain (however it didn't help me only percocet did). I get fluids the 3 days following my infusion because I could not fight dehydration.  I had a terrible 1st infusion but I feel like the changes they are going to make will make a difference for round 2.   I also second Kefir - I don't like yogurt at all but I do like the fact that it's thinner/smoother. The one thing that I did notice was that my 'cording' pain came back after my chemo so I am going back to PT to work it out. Today I woke up happy and ok.  So to treat myself tomorrow I am going for a 30 minute facial and then getting a pixie hair cut (probably a waste of money but it will be nice).  I am really going to make a conscious effort to round this negative corner...for myself, for my family and for faith and hope in my treatment. I pray everyday that I find the courage and strength I need to beat this and live a long healthy life with my DH and children. Everyday I get on here and am amazed and admire you ladies that have such strong spirits.",
