Needless to say the surgery never happened and the cyst is gone. (it may have made its way to my left breast..hummm interesting). Any way, just when I was feeling better,  the call from the doctor on the 25th Aug that I needed another surgery for re-excision because of the margins.  So on the 29th Aug I had another surgery which was quick less than an hour. They knocked me out.  It was so fast I didn't know it happened. One minute they were putting the IV then the next my husband was putting my clothes back on. It went well also. Now I am waiting for the margin call again, I guess. Also I sit here I still wonder if its worst than what they think. Also  having to decide on radiation and hormone pills or just hormone pills. Also I am scheduled to fly to Florida from Virginia on the 14 Sept.  I haven't asked the doctor if I can fly yet. My followup is that morning. hummm. It's 5 days after the re-excision, the area of excision was the bottom of my right breast  on  the crease. About 5 1/2 inch long.  Then 2 inch under my arm. cosmetically they did a good job. I am less than a B cup anyway. They didn't take much tissue however It could just be swollen.  My side is very sore if I don't take the any meds. I try not to take the meds. I have decided to change my diet to superfoods and natural nutrition. Rid my body of  chemicals, glyphosate and pesticides they put on all of our food. That's where this stuff is coming from. I use products that helps instead of harm us now.  Its scientifically proven to work. Anyway I really am grateful and wish the best for you all. Thanks for the motivation and inspiration.  Love and prayers for you all.   Thanks, L8dybell DX : 2 Aug 18, DCIS in situ, Right, 8mm, Stage 0. non invasive. ER+PR+       ",

I have DCIS earliest stage possibly non invasive so why do I feel helpless. It could be worst. I feel blessed it was caught early however I am still in shock.  I am barely a B cup now I\u2019ll lose that on one side and it was found because I had a lung ct scan from a cough that developed from  A respiratory failure episode last April 17 Mammo never picked it up cause I\u2019m so small. I feel so scared.married for 19 yrs and he seems to be handling it well but he hasn\u2019t seen me cry . I\u2019m trying to be strong but it\u2019s hard. I suffer from major depression I was a Alzheimer\u2019s care giver for my dad before he died last Jan 17. I work nights and I\u2019m tired. My hubby wants me to continue to work and go on like nothing\u2019s happening until surgery day. I\u2019m a an emotion mess actually when I\u2019m alone",
