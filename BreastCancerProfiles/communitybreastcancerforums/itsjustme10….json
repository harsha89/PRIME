That's why if it were me, I would get a 3rd opinion - and bring both sets of films with you so they can compare.  :) Good luck!!",

IBC is extremely rare to begin with.  Combine that with how unbelievably rare teenage breast cancer is, and you can see how unlikely that is. It could be anything - you are still developing, so you could be developing at different speeds on each side.  It could be your mom changed laundry detergent or fabric softener, and you're reacting to that.  It could be nothing at all or something completely normal - too much time in a soggy bathing suit caused irritation, you may need a new bra, stuff that's happened before, you just never really noticed it.  Some kind of cream could make it go away, or you might need nothing at all.  No one can really tell you over the internet - and if they say they can, run away!!!  Seriously, what I would tell my 15 year old niece would be to tell her mother.  If you can't find the words, email her this thread, tell her it's you that wrote this, and ask her to take you to the doctor.  But what ever you do, don't obsess over it - just have a professional look at it.

I'm not a doctor, and I would never ever tell you what kind of tests you should ask for, so I can't help (or won't) \"help\" you that way.  I figure you went to one of the top breast cancer treatment centers in the world, and they pretty much have a protocol for everything. so whatever tests they did were likely the right ones, and your doctor's opinion was only intended to be reassuring and an opinion, you know? I know this is the first time this has happened to you.  I totally understand that.  I understand frustration with medical teams (don't even ask how I ended up needing to use my 3rd surgical opinion - that was a disaster - LOL).  But, from what you say, it sounds like you were taken seriously.  It sounds like they ran the tests, that they, in their educated and experienced opinions, based on years of practice, and having actually seen you and your test results, feel that you needed.  And your doctor didn't seem to think it'll be malignant.  Those are all good things.  Waiting sucks. :)  But, hopefully it'll be good news. :)",

If I had to take a guess, I would say your doctor believe it looks consistent with a benign condition, based on the scans, and is trying to allay your fears. Obviously they can't say 100%, because no one knows without the biopsy results.    Have you ever taken one of your kids to the pediatrician, where they say \"doesn't look like strep\", but they take a culture anyway?  Same thing...they think it looks like fat necrosis, but they took a sample anyway, just to make sure.",

Calcifications, I hope Beesie comes along to explain, but I think that they're kind of an indicator, not the bad thing.  The cancer is in the tissue, that's why they put the needle where they did.  Calcifications can't hurt you - it's what they represent may be happening in the tissue that causes doctors to want biopsies,.  I hope you understood what I was trying to explain - technical medical information is not my strong point, but I don't want you to be concerned about what was or wasn't tested right now.  The feeling of the lump having doubled in size, could it be some swelling and/or bruising from the biopsy?  They did cut small pieces of tissue out, which does cause trauma.  Breat cancer doesn't usually grow that quickly at all, but if you're concerned, maybe call your doctor and ask. If you love your plastic surgeon back home, use his help to find a surgeon to do the mastectomies.  And if you're not comfortable with the personality of whatever breast surgeon you select, keep looking.  Trust is as important as anything in this journey.  As with any medical problem, it's 90% of the battle.  There are many top notch surgeons out there.  If you believe in them (especially since the pathology is tested afterwards to make sure they got clean margins), then it'll be OK.  it's the plastics guy whose work you're going to look at every day, you know?  And, like I said, he's probably seen how many breast surgeons work...that's your best resource for a referral.  He knows you, he cares about you, etc. I think it's a smart idea to get things done at home.  And I want to compliment you on how well you are handling this situation.  There are women on here that are 2 and 3 times your age that could take a lesson from you.  Best of luck, and please keep us updated!! :)",

Even though it's incredibly unlikely that it's breast cancer, you, as a budding doctor, know more than most everyone on here that they only way to put your mind at ease is to go to the doctor and have it checked.  That no matter how unlikely it is, any change to your breasts should be seen, as there is no dispositive way to determine what's going on by describing symptoms - especially on the web, where most of us are not doctors.

So, either go for the physical and let the findings be a \"surprise\" to everyone, or admit you have *something* going on to your family, and get yourself checked.  You are educated enough to understand ithat ultimately it's the best way to go.  Fear of the unknown is understandable, but ignoring it won't make it go away.

If you don't have a wig store near you, maybe check on line?  The ones I saw were flesh colored thin cap-like things that you put on then put the wig over it.  I just did a quick google search, but since I never dealt with any of the companies, I didn't want to link them, but it appears the liners come in both cotton and nylon.  Personally, I'm thinking cotton makes the most sense, as it would breathe, but there are options out there for you that should make your wig hold better and feel more comfortable.",

And, this is the first time I've checked this thread in a couple of weeks, so everyone can take heart in that...I'm about 1 year PFC right now, my hair is still too short for my liking, but it would not be considered short by people with short hair.  Hope that made sense.",

As to why they didn't order more testing that day, there could be many valid reasons...only a doctor can read your films and make a determination if further testing is needed.  Even if that happened right away, if the radiology group was booked, you would have to make an appointment for further testing no matter what.  Plus, depending on your insurance plan, you may need additional approvals, and that could easily take a day or more to obtain. As for your doctor's receptionist, no comment on her comments on thinking she can run another doctor's practice.... Depending on what permissions you granted the radiology group on your HIPAA forms, they may or may not have beeen allowed to have told you anything over the phone. Did you request a copy of the films when you were there, and to have a report mailed to you?  You are most definitely allowed to do that, and should - always get copies of your tests for your own records.  That way, these things can't happen to you.  It is frustrating, but part of how things work, so you have to learn to work around the system, 'cause you can't fight it.  Make sure you get a copy of the US or whatever you're having done Monday - they give you a CD - and ask them to mail you a copy of the report when it's ready.  They'll be happy to do that.",

It's now after 9AM on the east coast.  Why not call her RO who prescribed the original antibiotic (and who would be in the best position to tell you whether the latest problem is the same or different and whether it looks better or worse).  Or call her internist or primary care physician.  But, if there is that much of a medical concern, call someone who can see her - and make sure they see her today..  I think if it were my mother, I would start with the RO - bully him into an emergency appointment.  Good luck, hope its nothing but post-radiation discomfort.",

Since you're 14, the only thing i  will tell you is to never ever ever take anyone's advice who tells you to do things behind your parents' backs - that's really wrong...the internet is a wonderful place to learn things, but that's like the biggest red flag out there... don't ever ever let anyone, especially a total stranger on some random message board, talk you into doing sometiing your parents don't approve. or know of.  My niece is 15, and if I ever heard of anyone giving her bad advice like that, I would go absolutely nuts.  So, let's figure this out for you in a safe fashion. I do have one thought - if you are worried, and want to get it checked, but don't know how to talk to your parents about it - why not email them this thread?  I know you know how to email.  And the one thing I'm sure about is that no matter how good or bad you think your relationship with your mom is, the one thing that is certain is that she wants the best in the world for you.  She won't get mad at you for having a health concern - however, she might get mad at you for hiding it from her!!!  Parents are funny that way - you totally think they can't handle something, but then it turns out that they can.  Part of being 14 is thinking you can't talk to your parents about anything, because all they do is get mad and not understand, etc.  Well, I'm going to blow a big secret that your mom has probably kept from you for all these years...she used to be a 14 year old girl, too...she was a teenager, too.  She gets it - she probably lived through exactly the same things, too - well, minus the whole i-phone drama thing, 'cause there were no i-phones then, but other than that, she gets it, and understands more than you give her credit for. :) Now, get off google, quit looking at symptoms, and go talk to your mom!!! :)",

Please let us know what you have done, and when your appointments are. Good luck!! :)",

I do have a couple of practical suggestions for you, though... since October is literally around the corner, many communities have free mammos and/or ultrasounds.  Check the local county health department to see when things will be scheduled in your area.  You can then bring the films to any doctor you choose. Is your only health insurance the student plan, or are you also still on your parents' insurance?  If you are, then you have another option - why not wait until you go home for Thanksgiving, and then be tested?  I know you have a huge tuition bill, and hate to spend money on certain things, but the smart thing to do is to get it properly checked.  The odds are in your favor that it's something benigh, but why take a chance?",

It's a tough decision to make, and one you need to think about.  Talk to your oncologist.  My MO had me call the alternative medicine department at the hospital - I wasn't really satisfied with them - they went by her recommendations, but finally told me to research DIM and I3C, so I did .  But, I can't stress enough how important it is to make any decision in conjunction with your treatment team. Good luck to you.",

My Mom was diabetic for about 20+ years, most of those insulin dependent.  I can tell you that based upon the reactions of her doctors over the years, the 150 isn't horrendous (up to 100 is normal, 120+ is about where they start drugs, so 150 is not crazy bad), and would take a really long time to do any damage.  The steroid readings are not that bad for a diabetic on steroids.  During my mother's final hospitalization, the steroid breathing treatments she was getting raised her sugars to 350 - 400.  They did give her a tiny estra dose of insulin each time to bring it down, but when I say tiny, we're talking 3 units or so, right before a meal, whether she ate or not. ",

It sounds like your mom is on top of everything, and since the only advice I would feel comfortable giving you would be to tell your mom, you have done the 100% correct thing.  It also sounds like your mom is not taking \"no\" for an answer, but is willing to push to make sure you get answers that she is comfortable with.  There is nothing more you can do,  except wait, and keep your mom updated on how your symptoms are resolving, or any new ones that you get - exactly what you are doing.  I'm not sure where you read that the redness from IBC would come and go, but it sounds intuitively wrong - cancer can't be cured by antibiotics, it doesn't respond to creams, and it doesn't go away on it's own.  That's another problem with the internet  - it's hard to tell what is true or not - there is a difference between reading medical journals and reading personal stories, when you don't know who the author is, and whether what their saying is true or not, or accurate or not. Emily, you're 14.  Don't try to out-think your doctors. You can't.  Medical school is an additional 4 years after college - that's a lot of education that your doctors went through.  Of course you feel lost, and I'm sure you are worried - talk to your mom about it - from what you say, she really understands and cares.  That's who you should be getting your information from, not a bunch of people on the web. Your mom knows you best, and loves you the most in the world...you know she won't let anything happen to you!! :) Good luck!!  And if you feel like it, please keep us updated.  If not, it's all good - go out and enjoy your summer! :) I also wanted to add that you write very well. :)",

I had to wait months after finishing radiation to have my exchange surgery, which is what made it so long - I would say about 18 months or so from finding the mass to the exchange.  The 9 months between finishing radiation and having the exchnage was kind of a waiting period, more than anything, though - more annoying that the time wouldn't go faster.  The stupid TE's were a constant reminder, only because they weren't exactly the most comfortable things ever.  I chose implants for reconstruction, so once my exchange was done, I was almost completely healed.  People who choose more invasive procedures have different healing times, and it probably would push you closer to the 2 years. Your hair starts growing back right after your final chemo treatment.  I'm 16 months from finishing chemo, and my hair is past my shoulders - it's still a little too short to be comfortable wearing it up in a pony tail, but I look like me again - that's probably been  2 months since I've been comfortable with how the front looks, so that would be 14 months after chemo.  Of course, if you have short hair, your feelings on the matter would be much different.  I wore my wig for like 8 months after finishing chemo- I was not walking out looking like THAT, but there are people who are comfortable with really short hair and ditch the wig as soon as they have any coverage.  It's a personal choice, but it does grow back right away - it just takes time to grow enough for you to be OK with how you look.  That amount of time varies, as it's very personal to each of us. As for how long until you stop thinking about it, that's a personality thing, so it's really up to you.  Good luck!!  And, seriously, you will look back one day and realize how far you've come.",

Your mother has a bunch of chronic illnesses, and I\"m going to guess that she's being properly treated for all of them.  That means she's taking certain medications.  Some of those medicines may require staying away or limiting certain foods. Do you know if your mother is on blood thinners - something called Coumadin or Warfarin?  If she is, be very very careful before recommending that she eat greens - the Vitamin K in green leafy vegetables, like spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, etc. - all those that are good for fighting cancer - that works to cancel out the theraputic effects of the blood thinner.  There are certain foods you need to stay away from with gout.  Certain foods you need to stay away from with diabetes. Low sodium is important to remember with high blood pressure.  Try and make an appointment for yourself and your mother with a nutritionist in her cancer center - they would be able to create a diet, including portion sizes and recommend supplements, that would take all of her medical conditions and medications into account.  They know the side effects of her medications, and can cross-check that as against any food or vitamins.  Your mom's case is a bit complicated, but I'm sure her medical team has seen that plus more a thousand times over.  Don't try to guess on herbal supplements on your own - you're not taking her prescriptions medications into account.  Let the professionals do it.",

Doctors go through medical school, internships, residencies, board certification, etc.  One thing you will find out is what I have learned  -  that *my* defninition of immediate and doctors' definitions of immediate are two different things.  Hurry up and wait is the best way to describe it - everything is a week, 2 weeks, a month.  Supposedly breast cancer is usually quite slow-growing, so nothing needs to be done that second. You have a surgeon's appointment.  Call them every few days to see if there was a cancellation.  Tell them you're flexible, and you can come in immediately if necessary.  But, don't short-change yourself by settling for less than a board certified physician. Surgeons may have different ways of wording requests for tests than PCP's do.  It's not necessarily a question of having \"pull\" with an insurance company - although I have no doubt that some high powered doctors do - it's more of a question of knowing what specific words to use to get that elusive approval.  So, if your surgeon feels you need an MRI, they will find a way to word the request, so that it is approved as medically necessary. Good luck - I know waiting sucks, but unfortunately, it's the game we all play. :(",

It'll be easier once you get all the diagnostics behind you, and a treatment & surgical plan in place. ",

I wish there was a magic formula and someone could tell you \"yes\" or \"no\", but there isn't.  Even experienced board certified radiologists sometimes  interpret what they see differently.  That's why the gold standard is a biopsy.  Believe me, you don't want somone's uneducated guess that they word as a definitive opinion.  The truth is that no one could possibly know for sure until it's biopsied.  If your doctor were comfortable (either way) he probably would've given you a hint.  Waiting sucks.  But someone on some message board guessing wrong based solely on their own personal results, and not actual knowledge, and then acting like they kinow what they're talking about and telling you something that isn't true, would suck even more.",

That's a choice that only you can make, though... This is the hardest part, right now - the learning, the researching, the driving yourself nuts - once you get a treatment plan in place, things calm down, and you can take it 1 step at a time. :) Oh, and..if you really want to travel for other opinions, why not consider visiting either MD Anderson in Texas, or Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC - they're rated 1 and 2 in cancer care in the world. :)",

If you haven't had chemo prior to surgery, I would suggest contacting MSK prior to agreeing to do anything, because that's where they would be at the forefront of any newer protocols.  As for surgery, it's the skill of the breast surgeon, (and plastic surgeon, if necessary) that you need to believe in.  Which hospitals does your current breast surgeon have privileges at?

My biggest problem was getting in and out of bed, which I solved by first renting a recliner, then within that first month, since it was so comfortable, buying a LazyBoy recliner with a power button.  The pain killers made me sleepy - which I hated - so I kind of lived in the recliner all day and night for a short time.  Driving was kind of hard - well, the backing out of the driveway part was the worst, because turning around to see was hard.  After a short while, I alternated pain killers with Advil - and had completely stopped them, except for at night within a week or two of getting home.  The 4 drains bothered me - caused most of my discomfort - they cut nerves when they do a bmx, so your chest area is numb anyway.    Considering how big the surgery seems, when you think about it, it isn't all that terrible to recover from physically. ",

Please promise you'll have your dad take you to your doctor. :)",

It wasn't horrible - a bit red, some peeling under my arm.  Hopefully it won't get worse over the next 2 weeks.  They did tell me to keep using the Aquaphor for another month, so back to buy some more cheap t-shirts, I guess.. and now the countdown to when I can have the TE's replaced in about 6 months begins... :)",

I'm going to do the saline again soon - they said to do it 3X/day.",
