I like the idea of being more balanced and not having the hassle of a prosthetic, yet at what expense?. I can almost see it being easier having both breasts removed and living flat or with breast forms, but keeping the one seems harder to imagine/ deal with. I don't want to take both because the one is healthy and I still want the sensation in my healthy breast, and to preserve it. Have other people experienced this same dilemma and where did you land? Is there anyone who has regretted any decisions they have made because of this dilemma? Log in to post a reply",
