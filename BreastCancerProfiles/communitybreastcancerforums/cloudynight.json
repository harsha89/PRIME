I'm not really enjoying the infusions so far, and I've decided to not do cold-capping because I want to get each one over with as soon as possible. I'm pretty uncomfortable and anxious in the chair as it is; adding ANYTHING to the process is a bridge too far for me. Respect for all the ladies who've done it, though!",

He's not convinced by the evidence for it. Don't take too much: Large doses of B6 (like 500 mg-1 g/daily) can actually cause peripheral neuropathy (although there have been cases where taking less for long periods of time have also caused it.) The recommended upper limit is 100 mg/daily. He's also not all that wild about glutamine. He told me that the best way to prevent neuropathy is to realize you're having it, tell your MO, and adjust your dose down appropriately. It's interesting that so many MOs recommend supplements. I'm on the skeptical end of the spectrum, so I'm not taking anything except for Biotin, which has improved my nails in the past.",
