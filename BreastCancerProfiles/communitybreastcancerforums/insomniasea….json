For the first time I stood in front of the mirror to do it. The dimple was so slight I just thought it could be something else. When my son or daughter (1 and 3) have jumped on my I have felt my breast really soar. Tonight in the shower I found a really tiny hard lump behind where I saw the dimple. I was lying down and felt it again. I can only feel it with my arm raised. Iv not told anyone about the lump. I told my husband about the dimple. I can't believe I am here again - I am 33 and last year I finally got my 5 years clear from cervical cancer. I had fertility saving surgery at the time then a hysterectomy a year ago this week. Back to the waiting game again. I will make a drs appointment tomorrow and hope I don't need to wait too long for tests. The waiting is defo the worst so you are all in my thoughts.",
