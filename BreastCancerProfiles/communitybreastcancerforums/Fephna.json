Of course I would think about it but wouldn't be able to afford it. My main goal was to get the cancer out with clear margins. The area I live in doesnt have a breast specialist/surgeon. Plenty of general surgeons which I did consult with first. I wasn't happy with his opinion of the lumpectomy leaving a dent. He said no one would really notice. Maybe he didn't realize I would notice. I don't have the best breasts or body but I am single. I live in Florida and I have a pool. I do wear tank tops and bathing suits often. I think a dent would be noticeable. So I am very happy with my decision to travel to the bs. She is up to date with the latest treatments and surgery and is the head of the breast center at her hospital. She highly recommended the reduction. I liked the ps very much. She reassured me I would be happy with the results. I did have 2nd thoughts many times before surgery day! I had tons of questions for both surgeons. And here I am now 7 weeks post surgery. I had my dry run for rads today. Officially start tomm. The hardness and swelling of the breast has gone down. Tenderness and pain are less. Both are falling into a more natural look. I'm seeing now as its healing what both surgeons were talking about. Having this beast of bc and the long road of surgery, treatment then meds, I have lil smaller but perker breasts. And after rads they hopefully will be the same size. The bc breast was left a lil larger incase of shrinkage with the rads. I'm just hoping rads doesn't ruin my skin. I'm so sensitive. I noticed on other discussion boards not to many other women had the reduction, just lumpectomy. I think it is a personal choice. Also sometimes medically necessary if you have very large breasts. I also think it depends on your bs and what they are comfortable surgery wise doing. Or it's just a procedure that could be newer or under used. If your bs does it with a good ps I would consult with them. Ask hundreds of questions till you feel comfortable with what ever procedure you choose. Good luck wed!! Keep us posted :)",

If I did just a lumpectomy I could of done it close to home quick with a gs. But traveling I had the bs and ps but had to wait a month. Now I def don't regret it.

I remember the night before surgery I didn't sleep at all and night after surgery I didn't want to wake up lol I found driving after 3 weeks was still a little hard. Really turning around to back out of driveway or spot at supermarket is what hurt. Felt like i was pulling all the stitches. I also put a pillow under my left arm which helped. I used the pain killers for about 2-3 weeks. Then ps said I could start using Advil and I did that when I felt some pain. I didn't want to always rely on them but read when the body is relaxed and not tense from pain it heals faster. So I used them. I wanted to heal as fast as I could. I did no housework at all first few weeks. I couldn't bend. I would hold both boobs cause they felt like they were gonna fall off. Lol ps said that would never happen but that's the only way I could describe it. It was hard to reach over my head first couple of weeks and no lifting either. I slept on my back for over 6 weeks and I'm not a back sleeper. I would surround myself with all pillows to make it as comfortable as possible. I'm also a slow healer. Even tho ps said healing was on schedule to what she expected. But I think some heal much faster and some of these things are easier to do sooner after surgery. Today was last rads!! I'm so exhausted, but so relieved this step is over. I will write more about rads in the morning. I can't keep my eyes open. Lol Next step is oophorectomy nov 13, then meds. BC checklist is moving along now. Hi Nancy welcome :) TeamKim sorry about your hair. My cousin lost hers after a week after the first treatment. She looks just as beautiful!",

But clear again now so that's a relief. I'm gonna share how I felt after my surgery. Maybe at some point you may feel different about you new look. My first few weeks out I was terribly uncomfortable. My pain lasted longer but I took the pain meds. My first post op with ps when everything was unwrapped the first time I just wanted to burst out crying. They were black and blue and scary looking. When I got home I still had like a hundred steri strips on both. They were much smaller then I expected and I was told they were very swollen. That made me very depressed to think they will still be smaller when swelling went down. I took pictures every week to document my progress. I look back now and it doesn't look like they got smaller. I do see now how nicely shaped they turned out to be. They are so much softer and it has taken since aug for me to get used to them. I think those who choose a plastic surgery want to change something. People like us didn't want to change but had to so I think it takes longer to get used to the new look. I was not happy when they were swollen, hard and not shaped well. Maybe give it some time and then see how you feel and definitely talk to the ps about it. Gentle hugs :)",

The bs explained I could also have the right done after rads but it would be another surgery under anesthesia. Her and the ps have been doing this surgery together for years. She said they have had very good success in doing both at 1 time leaving the bc breast slightly larger for the shrinking during rads. I will have a 6 month post rads visit with ps incase either need any adjustments. My incisions are the same. Around the areola, from the nipple down to the crease and along the curve underneath. My ps calls it that part the T junction. Overall I am a slow healer and I am 7 weeks post surgery. I still have a few small areas that are not completely healed. On the right the T junction just closed. I thought it was infected cause it was still draining but ps kept saying it wasn't and to keep it constantly moist with Neosporin and just last week it finally closed. Very red but closed. I still can't sleep on my sides. Both breasts are sooo tender but finally soft. First few weeks they were hard as rocks from the swelling. I was so scared they were gonna stay that way lol Hi DawnCT I'm sry to hear the margins weren't clear. Which ever procedure you have next I'm sure the margins will be clear! I am happy so far with the results and honestly still getting used to my new look. My weight has been up and down thru the years plus breast fed both my boys, gravity was setting in. Now I can take my bra off and nipples are still facing out and not down lol. I would make sure your bs and ps have experience with this surgery. The reduction to the non cancer side is covered by most insurance. It is still considered breast cancer surgery but you get the plus of perky breasts. It's just a longer recovery time then a lumpectomy. I have my dry run Monday for rads and treatment starts tues. My bs wanted to make sure incisions on the left were healed enough. Have a good weekend and keep us posted :)",

It sounds like he is cautious and wants that wound to heal before further surgery. My mom had bs twice. 2nd time she had partial mastectomy. She didn't get reconstruction for a year. I do remember her saying she felt off. Kinda like being off balance and it hurt her back. She has large breast. Could be why bs recommends reconstruction. These are just my guesses lol I stayed at the hospital overnight so was pumped with antibiotics thru the iv. When I was released I only had pain killers. For a bra I had the surgical bra they sent me home in that I had to wear 24/7. At my 3 week post op check she said I could get sports bras which I did. Only recently I started using vitamin e oil for the scars and that's cause they are all closed now. But reading thru breast reduction forums different ps recommend different things. I just followed my ps orders. Since you are having partial mastectomy there might be some other type of bra or wrap you should wear. At the planning appt I would def ask alot of questions. :)",
