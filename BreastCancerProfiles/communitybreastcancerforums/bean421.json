Thanks for the B9 wishes. Happy New Year!",

Given that I have a very strong family history (mom, both grandmothers) he sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound that day.  Both reports came back without showing anything.  My Dr says I should be grateful, but I just can't help but wonder why something I can feel would not show up on either test.  What should my next steps be? I'm worried sick about this whole situation. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

You have all been so helpful.  This is such a scary time for me. I have an 18 month old little boy and the thought of not being here for him terrifies me.  The woman at the center was very helpful and they will be contacting my GP and having all of my films and reports sent to the surgeon before my appointment. Hopefully I don't have to wait too long. ",

The Dr said that he could feel one of the lumps but said it felt like fatty tissue.  Since nothing showed up on the ultrasound or mamm he was encouraged but has scheduled me for an MRI in two weeks.  I feel a lot better now and hope that the MRI comes back clean. Thanks so much for the support. ",
