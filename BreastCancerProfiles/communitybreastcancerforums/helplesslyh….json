My team only uses MRI as a benchmark once a diagnosis is made, and for good reason. My experience is similar to Suzette's. I had a mammo with u/s and it showed my tumor to be 1.7 cm. I knew it couldn't be correct because I could easily palpate the lump, and it was at least 4 cm. My surgeon went ahead and recommended lumpectomy and rads pending MRI results. The MRI showed an 8 cm tumor (IDC) plus diffuse sites of DCIS throughout the breast. Needless to say, the plan of attack changed radically. Now, after neoadjuvant chemo for nearly five months, my main tumor has shrunk to within lumpectomy limits as palpated by my onc. MRI will ultimately determine the surgical course at the end of September.  ",

I think this has been harder on my husband, who lost his father and many relatives to cancer. I don't have any cancer in my family at all. If anyone knows of any good hubby resources, please let me know :)",
