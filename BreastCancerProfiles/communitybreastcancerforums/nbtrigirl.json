    "Content": "nbtrigirl wrote: Hi all, I had to have a biopsy in Nov on a 'something' in my right breast. I say something, as I didn't feel anything, so it's hard to call it a lump! The radiologist called me and told me it was benign, but that I should have a follow-up ultrasound in six months. When I called to make the appt., I was told it's an ultrasound on the right side only and then I'll go back to a yearly mammogram (if no issues) in November. Call me crazy, but having an ultrasound on only one side has me more worried, than if they find anything! Is this common practice for everyone? I'm thinking worse case scenario is that they'll find nothing, but in the meantime, allow something to go crazy in the left breast. Thanks for reading! Log in to post a reply",
