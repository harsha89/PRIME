She was saying she may do more boosts and less regular treatments since my skin is so raw and damaged. But - It will end up being the same number: 30. So my countdown to the end remains the same.",

I was told after 18 (of 30) treatments that I would probably need some boosts after the normal treatments were completed. I will meet with the doctor again on Friday, but I'd like to have as much information beforehand as possible. Thanks for any information you guys may have! Log in to post a reply",
