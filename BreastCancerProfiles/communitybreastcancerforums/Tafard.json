I noticed some lumps, clear breast discharged and tightened in one of my breasts. I was seeing by breast site doctor, Dr. Vivian Yuen, at sunnybrook and she would refuse to send me for mammogram for couple of months since she would not feel anything and she would say all of my lumps and bumps and discharges are due to age and recent weaning of my daughter from breast. Anyways after two clear ultrasound she basically sent me home for good and said to come back by August. I knew something was not right, in my gut I knew so I insisted to see her again and eventually was given the appointment. She gave me same story of breast milk duct blah blah blah. I said with all do respect please right down on a paper this is not cancer and I will go and never bother you. She said she cannot and with anger she agreed to send me for mammogram which she believed would be very useless. On the day of my mammogram I was told there are two suspicious lump, had biopsy by next week and there it was HER2 positive invasive breast cancer. Thank goodness is not any part of my body and I started my chemo there after two weeks. They could not really give me stage as the lumps themselves are small but are couples of them and they some how effected nipple and some tissue tightness above breast tissue and therefore I guess I would be called locally advance! I do not care about what name they put for me. It is responding very well to chemo, it is gone by two chemo and after I would have double mastectomy (my gene was negative but I want to insist to removing the other breast) and at the end radiation. They are saying they are doing everything they can to guarantee my cancer will not come back....I am very positive. So my question is about the surgeon Dr. Nicole Look Hong. I never heard about her and I am so scared of repeated bad experience since mine is harder and is double mastectomy. I asked them to get dr. holloway but they say they are really busy and all surgeons are full and basically I do not have choice of choosing my surgeon. Have anyone ever heard of her please help. Also please I try to keep myself very positive so no scary negative comment about my stage of cancer. Thanks to you all Log in to post a reply",
