I went to my gyno, and saw the nurse practitioner who told me the lump feels like breast tissue because it is moveable.  I have had 2 ultrasounds and 1 diagnostic mammo come back normal.  The radiologist suggested I get an MRI (insurance will not approve it because I don't have family history) because of not only my dense breasts but because they do not see anything on the films. It's been almost a month for me and I still have no answers.  I am going to see a breast specialist on Thursday to see what they think.  My suggestion to you is to speak to your gyno about either a diagnostic mammo (you are young and probably have dense breasts) and going to see a breast specialist.  I've learned a lot while on these boards and one thing is for sure... be an advocate for your health. Good Luck. ",
