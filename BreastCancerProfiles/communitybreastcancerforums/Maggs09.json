I think of it as a \"chronic disease\", kind of like heart condition and many others. Of course it was a total shock at first, especially that I had 2 primary cancers (not related advanced bc and early colon). In addition I ended up with pulmonary embolism which significantly delayed my mastectomy and chemo. Believe me, that caused a lot of anxiety! But I remember this one young dr (my bowel surgeon's assistant), who interviewed me before surgery. Her words were: \"from what I can see here, you are not going to die from any of these cancers\". And regardless of poor statistics, I chose to believe that what she said was going to be true. Today I'm just a little over a year since my double surgery (umx and colon resection), almost 9 months since finishing chemo and about 6 months from rads. And I'm fine, my recent CT scans are clear. Of course I get some \"low\" days, and the fear comes back... But I try to overcome it by praying, focusing on listening or reading of success stories of long term survivors, taking long walks, researching additional \"ways\" of preventing reoccurrences. Chemo felt like a blessing to me, I actually imagined the cancer cells being destroyed by it! So, please, don't be afraid of your visit to onc. Make a list of questions, ask for explanation of your path report and what chemo regime is being recommended for you and why this choice? When is your PET? Did you have any scans before your mx? Try not to worry in advance, that doesn't help, only weakens your immune system. I know it's hard, but try to concentrate on positive side and you will be fine. Don't let anybody put you down with their stories or sadness. Honestly, I think most of us here, had to \"re-arrange\" our list of friends and acquaintances, (it was one of the most dufficult and awkward things I had to do), as some people, although they meant well, would cause so much stress and anxiety. I found many new friends through this experience and with their help and support I made it through and you will too! Good luck tomorrow, I will be thinking of you. Maggs",

That's a lot of estrogen! I stopped menstruating with the beginning of chemo and hopefully my periods will not return. I was told that otherwise they will be giving me drugs to stop it or surgery to remove ovaries. My recent blood test showed that I maybe in menopause, although onc is not sure if that will be permanent state, so she wouldn't give me AIs. As for menopausal symptoms - it's not to bad! I haven't gained any weight, (I actually lost over 25lb after surgery and while on chemo, but I did a lot of walking), keeping it between 125-130 lb. I also take Metformin off label and although I haven't lost any more weight while on it - it is possible that it helps me keep my weight stable. I also had CYP2D6 test done to see how my liver metabolizes tamoxifen, I will be meeting with the specialist on Friday. This will help me decide whether I'm going to stay on Tamoxifen longer or whether I should seriously speed up oopheroctomy and switch to AIs. I have a 14 years old daughter and she wants me to be around to help her with her children one day. So I have no choice but fight that ugly BC. It is interesting how different cancer centers have different approach and recommendations. But I've learned that it is important to follow own intuition as well. Hugs, Maggs",

I'm sure it's nothing malignant, but at least they are working together to eliminate such possibility. It is worth waiting those couple of weeks and get the proper chemo that will be suitable for your particular case. Wishing you all the best! M",

I'm trying to decide if it would be safer to have oopheroctomy and switch to AIs, (I could ditch blood thinner shots!) instead of staying on Tamoxifen. It is just that I'm not looking forward another surgery and would like to postpone it for later... Maggs",

I also have a couple of tiny nodules (2mm, 4 mm and a new one 5 mm) that cannot be dx from the scan or biopsied due to size. And although my ct scan report (from Dec, and recent from April) says: \"no evidence of metastatic disease\", I realize that they cannot know for sure. I finished chemo in Nov and rads in Jan; I was adviced to \"watch it\" for a couple of years, but the anxiety would be to much to handle. So I chose much more drastic approach. I'm having a lung surgery in less then 2 weeks to get these nodules out and run a full pathology on them. And whatever they are - there are still options to either treat it. There is a girl on BCO that had some nodules at dx and they didnt know whether they were mets or inflamatory. Her onc proceeded with chemo and she was suppose to have scan in April. I contacted her to see how she did and her scan came back clear! Her dr said they will never know what it really was. So, please, try not to worry. It is what it is (which could be just a scar tissue, fungi and thousand of other reasons to have nodules), get a 2nd and maybe even 3 rd opinion, before you agree with one doctor's recommendation. I have the feeling that your onc is not convinced that those are mets and by saying to do nothing - means to \"scan regularly and watch for any changes in size\", which could indicate whether they are b9 or malignant. (They usually \"watch\" for a couple of years and if the nodules remain the same - they pronounce them B9). I wasn't comfortable with this protocol, and although my didn't grow over 4 months (malignant nodules usually double in size in 1-6 months), I chose to have a surgery and know for sure. And, please, get another opinion before you make any decision. Maggs",

Those symptoms decreased a couple of months after finishing chemo. As for pains and aches from the hormonal therapy - they are very common, however I have to say - I am one of the luckier ones that don't get bothered too much by side effects from tamoxifen, so I can't really say .... But definitely you want additional testing to investigate the source of your symptoms. Wishing you quick and good results! Hugs, Maggs  ",
