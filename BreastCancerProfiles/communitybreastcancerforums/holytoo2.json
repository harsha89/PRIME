Because I have a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer, I went to see a genetics counselor. She tested me for the BRAC 1&2 and both came back negative. However, she said because of my family's history, she strongly recommend I have my ovaries removed as well as think about a mastectomy option. I consented to my blood being further tested for other genetic mutations, but the results won't come back before my surgery, which is a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy. Has anyone else had a similar story? If so, did you opt for the mastectomy and ovary removal? Do you think I am just worrying for no reason? Thank you for any advice you can offer. Surgery 4/28/2014 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel Dx 3/15/2016, IDC, Left, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/liver/lungs/other, Grade 3, 2/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My maternal grandmother was diagnosed at 58 (she had to get a mastectomy), my mother's sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 57 and died a year later. My dad's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at 60( she had to get a mastectomy because of multiple cancer tumors in her breast, and she opted for  a TRAM Flap reconstruction) My mom's brother died from pancreatic cancer (age of diagnosis was early 50's). I am waiting for the results of my BART testing. I have an appointment with the reconstruction surgeon on 4/25 and a GYN Oncologist on 4/30. I don't know about chemo yet. I will found out after my lumpectomy.  I see you had both a mastectomy and your ovaries removed. Did you have them done at the same time? what was the recovery time like? What type of reconstruction did you have? Thanks again for taking the time to talk with me. I really need it right now. Have a Blessed day!!",
