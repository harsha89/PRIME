I have already had a lumpectomy, but need to decide on rads or BMX. My oncologist says lumpectomy with rads has pretty much the same results (of course there is the 1-2% difference) but he seems to think I am being too radical with the mastectomy. He tells me if it comes back it will most likely be elsewhere...  Thank you for posting!",

I have been offered this and am trying to decide whehter or not to do it.. There has been so much in the news lately about Avastin that I am quite scared to partake in the study..  If I do not do it I will do dose dense AC x 4 then 12 weeks of T...  Otherwise I would be placed into one of three other groups with the Avastin (only one of the groups actually has you taking the Avastin).. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you very much!  Rebecca",
