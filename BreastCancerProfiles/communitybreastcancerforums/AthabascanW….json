I had expanders put in and had my second fill yesterday. We're taking our time on this one. I also started Iron, a few weeks ago as it looks as though I am anemic. In January I was diagnosed with Hyper-thyroidism (which they say has nothing to do with the cancer, :/ ) I guess weirder things have happened. I am moving around much more, taking my kids to school, picking them up. Girl Scouts with the baby (now 7!!!), basketball with the all-star and loving life with the teenage daughter. Life is good. Very good. Just on here looking up expanders, what to expect, what's not \"normal\". Hahaha. Yes, life is very good indeed. Sending love and warmth from Alaska... Rhonda",

As far as itching, I did have itching on my body, and at first we thought it was the cat, but it eventually disappreared. One of those weird off the wall side effects I guess. Judy~ I was on taxotere as well (6 rounds total) I hope I can say I was one of the few whose gained so much weight (25+ lbs )I think continuing to eat like crazy has something to do with this....hmmm, yeah, it does Thanks for the updates Mr. Clams, you and the Mrs. continue to be in my prayers! 9911~ Thanks for the update! You are so strong! Dukes~ Yay! Back at work! Makes me smile!  My little world~ Just trying to find my place. I found another lump in my other breast, my only breast left. I went in last Friday for a core biopsy and go in for Herceptin tomorrow, 9 of 17. I have to travel by flight an hour to the next city for this (there now) and I'm missing my kids. Tuesday will mark 1 week I've been gone. Hoping to get in early tomorrow to fly home tomorrow aftenoon. I'm feeling so down tonight, read an article in the newspaper about a woman who is having a reoccurance (?) and it's terminal. I have not allowed myself to EVER even THINK this could be me, and as I sit here alone in the hotel room, the thought looms. But I can't imagine that. I need a little uplifting ladies... thanks...",

I've postponed this three times already. Again, thank you so much for your reassurance, it's helping so much. I will bring my ipod and maybe a little Beibs will get me through (I'll think of my babies and smile).",

I think reading these posts get my mind off me and get me praying for others. I had my first Radiogist appointment last Friday and just realized exactly one month from surgery. Okay, breaking down. I have heard \"rollercoaster\" more than once on this website. That's it! I was finally staged at my radiologist appt and tomorrow will be my first \"dry run\". I actually start rads at the end of the month after Thanksgiving. I was originally told with a MX I wouldn't need the rads and now find that I do need them. To top this off, I found another lump in the other breast.I will go into see my doctor as a walk-in tomorrow, one day at time. My surgery went extremely well on the 4th last month. Able to walk and move my arm within a day. Sleep went great ever since. Blessed to have made it through what couldn've been way worst, my prayers are with all of you and your recoveries.
