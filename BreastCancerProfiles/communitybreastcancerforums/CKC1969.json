For some reason that I still don't completely understand they want to do chemo first and I have asked for a PET scan but they have not been responsive to my request. I also asked if they would do a sentinel node biopsy and have been met with no response. My Surgical oncologist said she would talk to me after the biopsy of my new mass on Friday but I'm just so mad and depressed right now I can't even be around family and friends as I don't want to ruin their New Years Eve.",

I know at some point they will take out my ovaries as well. I just want to make sure they find all of it, where ever it is. I lost my Mom to this when I was 3 years old and don't want my 4 kids to have to go through what I did. I'm trying to be a proactive as possible and want to know all my options for testing. Thanks!!!

My intentions when reaching out to this group was simply to help me better understand types of questions I should be asking as well as Iwhapt I might expect I. The near future. Each of you have done a fantastic job of offering questions, sharing your experiences and confirming that I need to take this one day at a time. Update on my test. 1- Still waiting on the Brac1 and Brac2 test. Test was taken on Dec.22 2- Yesterday I was scheduled for my MRI on my lower back to get a better image of the lump, but insurance company would pay for it. So I didn't have it done. 3- Went today to get the Bi-lateral MRI, just got a call that they found another lump in the same breast ( first lump is 2.8 cm they didn't mention the size dip the second one) They setup another Biopsy now for the new mass on Friday then following that my surgical oncologist wants to meet with me and my husband about other findings in the MRI and possible next steps. I can barely breath at this point! Oh well, onward and upward right? I'll let everyone know what the update is on Friday.     ",

I have called into my doctors office again today as they keep moving appointment around which keep moving other appointments around as I'm sure you expreiced as well. My concern is that the biopsy they now want to do they arent even sure they can do in the office and have set an alternitive appointment 10 days later to have the same proceedure done in the hospital is that normal? Seems very sketchy to me. If they cant do it in office like the last one why dont they just be proactive and schedule it in the hospital to begin with that way it can get done faster? Non of these makes sense to me. I dont handle the whole \"smoke and mirror\" thing very well. Thoughts?",
