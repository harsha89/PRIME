I'm also going to pick up some aloe and start lubing up in preparation for the big day. I figure it can't hurt. I'm also getting my first mammo post lumpectomy on Friday. I'm a bit nervous about the mammo. Although everything feels ok. Big day for me on Friday.",

It must be so reassuring to know your chemo not only worked but kicked butt!!! As far as your first appointment with rads its just to talk about what radiation is, why they use it and what you can expect from both the actual tx and possivble side effects. Then you'll have to go back another day to do a simulation where they place you in position (in my case they did 2) and use a CT machine to look at placement of where they want to hit but also to look at your anatomy (lungs, heart,etc) in relation to where they need to radiate. With that info they will come up with a plan. They will also tatoo at this visit or at the very least mark you in some way.You'll go back again for a dry run of the plan they picked and to readjust if they need to.Then you'll finally go back and start your treatments. I assume it's all basically the same no matter where you are. It's probably the same protocol. I hope this helps. Good luck and let us know how you make out.",

I hate that it affects more than just the breast but I guess its just another thing I have to accept. Boy this experience sure is teaching me alot of lessons. I picked up a couple of cotton sports bras that hook in the front which was suggested by someone on here. I couldn't find fruit of the earth aloe gel. The RO also recommended aquafor so I got some of that......Let the lubing commence.  Hope everyone is doing well. Peace and blessings to all. ",

At least working from home you can make yourself comfortable. Try to take a deep breath when your boss is bugging you and tell yourself that you are doing the best you can under the circumstances. Kudos to you for even doing it! Its tough being on disability. I have 3 kids, 2 of which are teenage boys with big appetities and the check barely covers the grocery bill but we're managing. Fortunately I had paid my car off the month before my diagnosis.  Aside from the paycheck I really miss the interaction with other people. Working from home wasn't an option for me. This board has been a true blessing to me. I wish I had used it more through my chemo, guess I was in a funk of sorts. My scheduled time is 11:30. That gives me alittle time in the morning to get some things done and where I go for tx is 35mins from my house. It'll take me longer to drive there and back than for the actual treatment. Oh well, ANOTHER lesson in patience! I hope your feeling better soon.",

I was told to see the radiation oncologist before my last infusion so that we could get the ball rolling. That visit was just informative. I suggest  to use this time while getting the infusions to start a list of your questions. I find it helpful to keep a running list going at all times because if I don't then I forget what I wanted to ask. I see the radiation oncologist once a week while getting the treatments. Blessings to you both and thank you for being so supportive of your wife. It means ALOT!",

It said \"something showed up on the mammo that I believe is benign, followup in four months with another mammo to compare\".Also had u/s and it said the same thing. Asked RO and she said report said its probably scar tissue but couldn't rule out neoplasm. So I get to sit and wait and worry for another 4 months! The area is in the surgical cavity but I did have clean margins at the time of sx. Still waiting on results of genetic test. Starting to wish I had done the masectomy instead of lumpectomy. ",

I do get twinges of discomfort in my breast every now and then but nothing constant. I have been wearing cami because the sports bras I bought rub on my port and was getting red and irritated so since switching to the cami it's been fine. Although I'm now concerned that the girls will be headed south from not being contained!  I know what you ladies mean about your (or lack there of). I check everyday in the mirror. I'm amazed at the fact that what hair I do have is completely white! I've been coloring it for so long I didn't know what was under there! Yikes.....now I know! I'm 49 and not ready for that, needless to say when it comes in enough for me to go \"wigless\" I will undoubtedly be coloring it again. When I look in the mirror and see all the white it makes me feel old. I know it shouldn't but it does. MizChiz~I know what you mean about telling your son about your dx. It was by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do!  I too told them they could ask me anything and I would be upfront and honest. I think that was very important for them to know it was not a taboo subject. They are doing fine and we talk about it very openly and even inject alittle humor. It's not easy for any of us but theres comfort in numbers.",

I had alot of abdominal discomfort after each tx. I think its fluid retention. My onc said its probably from the steroids. I also get some puffiness in my ankles and legs. Which onc says is also the steroids. It usually goes away after a week to ten days. It went away after the last tx like usual but has returned and its been 3 weeks since my last tx. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this delayed effect. I only took the decadron the day before tx and IV at tx. If anyone else has had this happen, how long did it last? Also, I have been going on the MARCH rads thread But I am scheduled to start on April 4. ",
