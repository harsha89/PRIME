Just asking cuz I'm new to this (only fighting LE since last year) and my PT wants me to go buy a compression shirt to wear for trunkal LE until I can get in to see them. My sleeve is not fitting well right now and cuts me at the elbow and on the upper arm. (I have a JUVO sleeve.) Thanks for all the help in understanding this!",
