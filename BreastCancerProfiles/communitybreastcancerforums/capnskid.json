I have my green tea and emu oil (thank you llama lady) and as several of you have mentioned, I'm glad to be getting this show on the road. Tomorrow, I've been told will be a longer day and I'm a little concerned about discomfort due to remaining cording in my left arm. But itsbetter than it was, so hopefully it won't be too bad. Have any of you used the green tea through 7 or more weeks of radiation? We're the results still as good as llama lady described?",
