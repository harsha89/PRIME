    "Content": "Heyu wrote: Hi All, I'm in my late 20s and had my annual screening MRI done last week due to high risk status (family history - Mom was diagnosed in early 30s). My baseline MRI was done last year and came back negative with no findings. The day after my MRI, this year, I received a call from the radiologist. A small mass was found in my left breast which is suspicious for magligancy and I was scheduled for a biopsy. The biopsy is tomorrow afternoon. I've had a previous biopsy for a fibroidnoma, so I'm not worried about the procedure, but am just concerned about the possible results of this biopsy. I know most biopsies results in negative findings and MRIs are notorious for false positives, but I'm just wondering where a mass came from in a year. Log in to post a reply",
