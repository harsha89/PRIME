    "Content": "SOIGNE wrote: Friday, 13th of June 2014, my 37 year old daughter as diagnosed with two different breast cancers. IDC & DCIS Stage 2B. At first they told her she could have a lumpectomy, but 5 min before the surgery, her surgeon told her there were too many pre-cancerous calcifications and she should have a mastectomy (right side). Feeling pressured, my daughter consented to the mastectomy (July 29, 2014). 3/16 auxiliary node involvement. 6 rounds of chemotherapy (cytoxan and taxotere) every 21 days - beginning in October 2014. Just before her 4th treatment, I (her mom), was diagnosed with TRIPLE NEGATIVE HIGH GRADE 3 breast cancer -Stage 3, not sure if it is A or B. PET & MRI don't auxiliary node involvement. 4 tumors - 2 in left breast, 1 just behind the chest muscle, 1 mid-line near sternum. Treatment options discussed but not confirmed. Chemotherapy will be before the bilateral mastectomy. My TN is a secondary cancer caused by the radiation treatment I had 25 years ago for Hodgkins Lymphoma. I'm a little worried. Not knowing what to expect. I'm more worried that I won't be strong enough to take care of my daughter. I have not met any triple negative grade 3 stage 3 (a/b) survivors. If you are out there, I'd live to hear the success stories. Dx 12/4/2014, IDC, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
