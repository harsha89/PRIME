I am confident that I will ultimately persuade my sister to check out this site.  While one would never call breast cancer \"normal\" or \"routine\", the matter-of-fact approach exhibited on this site makes it seem less scary.  I think it would help enormously.",

      "Content": "2ndsister wrote: I hope it is okay to post here as a relative. My sister was just diagnosed with invasive ductal, grade 2.  I have done a lot of reading, and understand the science.  My sister is not ready to read, so I am hoping to be able to help prepare her for what is to come-especially her upcoming visit with the surgeon.  What I don't have a handle on is the timing and hierarchy of physicians she will be seeing.  So, here are my questions.  Thank you for any help you can offer.  These boards appear to be full of very intelligent and positive women. 1.  We are waiting on the markers from path report.  My sister should be tested for BRCA1/2 gene mutations. Who would order that? Surgeon?  Oncologist?  It would seem that that info would be very relevant to the surgical approach,  and i see from reading these boards, that the results can take a few weeks to come in.  Does the surgeon generally wait for these test results?  Do all breast cancer patients receive this test, or must one request it? 2. My sister is scheduled to get an MRI and meet with a surgeon next week.  Any recommendations regarding that meeting?  Should she get a second opinion?  This particular surgeon has a notoriously bad bedside manner, and I am concerned that that might be hard on my sister.  But I don't want her to delay treatment in search of another surgeon if that will just add more stress.  What is the time interval from diagnosis to surgery, in general? 3.  Are the nodes generally assessed at the time of cancer surgery, or is that done separately?  Does this timing depend on whether it is sentinel node or axillary dissection? (I realize that sentinel node would need to be done before mastectomy, of course.) 4.  The surgeon apparently does nipple-sparing surgery.  Have people had good results with this? I have read that there can be problems with tissue death.  5.  Who coordinates the care?  I would have thought it is the oncologist, but my sister does not even have an appointment scheduled with that doctor yet.  Once the initial surgery is complete, is the  cancer surgeon pretty much out of the picture?   Thank you so much for any insights you can provide.  There is so much new information to absorb that I think it will help enormously if my sister has an understanding of key issues before she meets her doctors.

Beesy, thank you for all the information.  I understand your warning regarding the NSP,but please know that I have no intention of pressuring my sister in any way regarding reconstruction.  She  has expressed a preference for mastectomy- although that may just be her initial reaction to the cancer dx.  I am simply seeking information from those with personal experience with NSP- should she inquire about it.  There is so much new information to be assimilated.  My sister is still in shock, and I'm just trying to help. Thank you all for the information regarding BRCA testing.  There is no early onset breast or ovarian cancer in our family.  However, we are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and my sister is relatively young.  In the course of my reading, I found that the BRCA mutations increase risk for prostate cancer, as well.  Our family tree is such that, on our father's side, the closest female relative is our grandmother,who died of breast cancer (at around age 69).  Her two sons both had prostate cancer (and one died of it).  One of these sons had a son who had an early case of prostate cancer. BRCA2 is linked to an increase in stomach cancer, as well. The uncle that died of prostate cancer also had stomach cancer at an earlier time.    So, while all of this may be circumstantial, it might be valuable to know the status of these mutations.  But, maybe not in the eyes of the  insurance co. Lastchild, thanks for your info regarding timing of the BRCA results and the tip. Thank you, almy, for your suggestion that my sister make some additional, overlapping appointments.  I didn't realize that the MRI might be informative for involvement in the nodes.  Your experience getting different recommendations from the different surgeons does argue for getting a second opinion.  It also clarifies for me the role that the surgeon might play.  I thought only the onc would be recommending chemo. (Which is one of the reasons I couldn't understand why the onc might not have been scheduled yet.) SpecialK, thank you so much for sharing the specifics of your experience and the advice regarding questions for the surgeon and all the other details. Very helpful. I am sure that there will be more questions down the road.  I have suggested that my sister visit this site, but    she doesn't seem to be ready quite yet.  I hope that she will do so, in time.  Because I know I feel better for having read the comments and knowing that there is a community of strong and wise women offering each other support. Thank you all for being so generous with your time and sharing your advice.  This has got to be the most articulate health board i have ever come across :)",

This seems to be a center that does all treatment in one place, but it would be a bit of a shlep if treatments turn out to be daily.  Has anyone heard about this place?",

Also, is it a given that with one positive sentinel node, there will be chemo?  It seems like i have read some threads where that is not the course of action.  And, do they do an oncotype dx test if there are positive nodes? Thanks in advance.  It is so hard to know that someone you love is suffering.  Another sister is out there comforting her.  My role tends to be information lady.  So any info you can provide will be very much appreciated.",

I'll pass the info on.  My sister does have support, but is taking the dx quite hard.  The emotional aspect has already taken quite a toll, so dealing with the discomfort is an unwelcome challenge, for sure.   I hope you are feeling much better soon. Best wishes for a swift recovery to you and all the other sisters.",
