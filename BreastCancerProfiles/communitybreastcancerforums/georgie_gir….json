I am seeing my doc again later this week (finally made that appt)  You are right - trying to keep these things secret is not easy. The little bit of worry is always there.  I did confide with a colleague who was diagnosed a couple of years ago.  Her support has been great.  I have been getting sharp, stabbing, burning pain in my right nipple.  Probably hormonal - or caffeine!  But its awfully uncomfortable.  Don't even want to wear a bra at the moment.  Anyhooo...please let us know what happens tomorrow...",

The radiologist said that my GP will probably send me for an ultrasound, \"but talk to your doctor\".  That's it - he walked out.  Have not been for the biopsy yet.   With my personal and family histories, I am scared too.  But right now I try not to think about it too much.  Personal and work issues causing a lot of stress for me right now, so I am trying to stay as calm as I possibly can. Here's hoping your biopsy will be b9 too!  All the best. ",

I have since read a lot...interviewed BC survivors...vented my frustrations here!  I got some great advice and support.  The best advice I can give you, is take responsibility for your own well-being and peace of mind.  Make an appointment with your medical practitioner as soos as you can.  You have a right to be informed. Take care! ",

What is slightly worrying for me now, is that I used to have the breast pain for 3 to 4 days, but since last month its still around...sometimes so bad I don't want to fasten my seatbelt - and I NEVER drive without fastening my seatbelt.  I think I have health anxiety too...I don't handle / deal with pain very well. So thanks for sharing your concerns with me - I really do appreciate your advice and yes, actually the radiologist did say that my GP would in all likelihood recommend a biopsy - but he did not put that in his report and I reckon that's why my GP did not suggest one...",

I should probably stop that... I am very sorry, I will have to correct myself - (brain running at 180km/h) my GP did not say he does not \"believe\" in mammograms, but that he does not believe in mammo's for younger women, and definitely not annual ones.  He suggested I read up on that on the net - A new study in the US that said annual mammo's are not a good idea, or something.  I could not find the website he suggested - perhaps its only for the medical profession?  And he did say he most certainly does not recommend an annual mammo for me, no matter what the radiologist said. (He did not look at the mammo cd himself, just handed it over to me without opening it) I have very good medical insurance...But now I am starting to think what they tell people who cannot afford it (in SA its very expensive) and state hospitals are sometimes a worse nightmare than any illness...And because most people cannot afford private radiologists a mammo and U/S can amount to what a lot of people in SA earn per month...Goodness, I am a worrier! And you know what?  I DO pray...I am one of those people who pray everyday for everyone and everything and sometimes just to say thank you that I AM well...and even when I don't feel so well, I still say thanks that I'm still alive - because there are a lot of people who depend on me and care about me.  So thanks for that girl -  We all need reminders now and again!",
