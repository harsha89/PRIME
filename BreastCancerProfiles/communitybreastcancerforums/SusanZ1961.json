Thanks.  I am most concerned about pain and the drains.  I have never spent the night in a hospital except for the birth of two children. My surgeron says I will stay two nights.   I am in a new city and not familiar with the hospital.   ",

I have completed most of treatment and surgeries.  I am starting to feel really good again. Good Luck!",
