I would ask your surgeon at your follow up to explain why. I too am \"chubby\" and had large breasts. Really, the only thing you should have left on your chest is skin and rib cage, at least that is what was left for me! I hope others will add their experiences. Congrats on taking your first look. Good luck to you.",

Don't know what I can take for it, or what to do to knock it out sooner. Could this threaten my surgery? I left voicemail with nurse this morning, but of course I didn't here back. Any advice???

Really waking up after surgery the pain isn't bad. I couldn't do immediate reconstruction so I woke up \"flat\".  It took some getting used to. It wasn't always easy. But one year later, I had a diep flap reconstruction and I am on the road to recovery. Each stage, and hurdle can bring more tears and anxiety. Try to concentrate on one thing at a time and it will make it easier. Celebrate the little hurdles you get through and know that we are here for you.",
