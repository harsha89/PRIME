My radiation oncologist referred me back to my breast cancer surgeon because of redness and swelling to my breast. She said it is not normal to have these symptoms so early in the treatment. My nibble is sore and I have mild pain through out my breast. My lumpectomy was on July of 2018. Can someone add or share if they've had a similar experience and the result please.",
