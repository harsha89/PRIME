It is a tough situation for all of us and hope GOD will give us patience and resistance against all these chemos and the power to defeat this disease. I had my BLT Mast on 17 Nov. My surgeon said I  had Grade 3 Cancer bigger than 5 cm. He believes I should get chemo and rad. I have an appointment with my Oncologist on 6 Dec. I do not know anything about my HER2, Oncotype test etc. I believe my Oncologist is gone tell me. I am worried about everything. Especially not knowing what is gone happen. I wanted to put Port already. How long the surgery for port take. I believe it is easier to have it. Anyway, so many things to worry. All the best to ALL and will check on you. Hope",

When are you starting chemo? I also had Grade 3 and feel that my oncologist would say I should get one too. Are you having radiation too? My surgeon said he thinks that I should get both.

I would love to hear from you more on both and would be happy to communicate privately. All the best, Hope",

I have appointment with my Onc on 6 December. The path report i received from my surgeon says it is OK. Sentinels both sides are negatif, margins clear. But the cancer they removed is quite big. Am not sure about HER2. I will know more from my oncologist. But I wish I could know whether chemo is in for me or not. Is it the HER2 which identifies about this.
