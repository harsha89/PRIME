Chelev - what did you hear/read about Black Cohesh ?  I used that for hot flashes when I was in the throes of menopause and it worked awesome.  I know I can't take any herbs while undergoing chemo, but so many write that the hot flashes just keep on coming, even when chemo stops.  Figured I would just start popping the BC pills again.    Also, your sister... I don't even know what to say.  I just feel so bad that for you on that one.  Ball is definetely in her court though, you've reached out enough.     I'll keep reading this thread - know what to expect when I come out the other end of chemo hell.",
