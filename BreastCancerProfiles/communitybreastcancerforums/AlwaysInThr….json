Im uninsured though so a bit different but hear you on the pushed asidr part. They wouldn't take me seriously at 23 which is when I had a cyst aspirated, this same spot is now a papilloma and they are like well you're too young (now I'm 33) they say dont worry about C even though I have a family history. YET they are like we need to get this biopsy done to rule out any C since I'm high risk....so I'm like which is it...dont worry or worry? I was denied funds for biopsy surgery so its back to square one. The cracks that exist for the undiagnosed and the young is the hardest to climb out of, you got to stick to your protest and make them hear you. I cried all day at work and when I got home today. Swollen eyes and despair right now. Be your own advocate and I'll be praying for you! Please keep us posted!",

Yes I'm not too worried about cosmetic part bc surgeon said either way id be having surgery after biopsy. Surgeon actually recommended reduction due to physical pain I've been having and the weight is too much for my petite body. I will have nothing to complain about because I see firsthand with my family what breast cancer does. I asked where mine is and she said they will have to do wire localization to find it again. :( Your report has more specifics than mine, I will be praying for you on 27th for some good news! My report said intraductal papilloma with proliferative fibrocystic changes....which I'm told should all be benign so fingers crossed! Thank you for your prayers I'll keep checking on you!",

I'm due to have excisional biopsy in next two weeks its all about waiting on when I can be scheduled. My surgeon said they are usually benign but one can't help but worry. Then you have to wait again for pathology, I wish it were all combined and you'd get immediate answers in a perfect world lol. I think the waiting part has helped me think ahead and semi prepare for what's ahead. I'm Birads 4 as well, I will post as soon as I know anything which hopefully we can celebrate together for benign! Big hugs and keep yourself occupied, I've googled my issue there's isn't alot online about it, its all mostly same article posted over and over so on here it feels better to talk to those who have been thru it. I like this site and it has really brave women who have advice on when not to worry and comfort when its not the best news. Keep us posted!",
