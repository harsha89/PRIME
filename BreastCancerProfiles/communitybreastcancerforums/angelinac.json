My Mom had and beat breast cancer and my maternal Aunt and Grandmother both died of breast cancer. All of them had breast cancer before menopause. The gentics center I went to said that I have a 68% chance of developing breast cancer and a 40% chance of developing ovarian cancer in the next 5-10 years. I am thinking in the next 5 years depending on how the MRI's and Ultrasounds go I may consider a masectomy and also removing my ovaries. I am recently separated from my husband and have one child. I am confortable with not having any more children unless a future spouse is insistent. I am curious what your percentages were before you considered a masectomy?",
