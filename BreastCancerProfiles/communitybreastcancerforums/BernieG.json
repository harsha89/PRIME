I was diagonosed on 29/05/13 with DCIS and Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer.  I was started the day after on Tamoxifen.  The surgeons told me that they could do a lumpectomy however i could be left with quite a dent or gave me the option of Lumpectomy with Oncoplasty (think its also known as Theraputic Mammoplasty) which is what i have choose. We are going to the Carribean on hols on the 29th July and they have told me that it wont effect the cancer if i leave the op till i return.  I am having a wire guided lumpectomy and oncoplasty followed by radiotherpy.  They will also remove some lymph notes for testing at the same time. I have searched the internet and several sites to see if anyone has had this op and yours is the first i have come across. I have found a very usefull site on breast reduction that might help you with some of the questions. http://www.breasthealthonline.org/cgi-bin/mwf/board_show.pl?bid=3 Bernie x",
