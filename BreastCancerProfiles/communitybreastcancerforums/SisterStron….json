I had a real hair wig when I was going through treatment for stage 3 melanoma. I hated the maintenance so I'm hoping this is a better option for me. I didn't shave my hair last time since it just thinned tremendously. It finally had filled back in and here I go again. The salon at the hospital will do complimentary hair shave and then they will help me pick out a couple of hats and do a wig fitting. I just made my appointment for this Friday. I know that this is sooner then needed but it works the best for my work schedule. I am just going to be confident that I will be able to continue with Taxol.",

We opened and closed the cancer center since I had a pretty bad reaction but staff knew exactly what to do. I was better in minutes but I was terrified My MO came to talk to me and I decided to try again but at a much slower rate . They gave me additional Benadryl and Steroids and I did fine when they started again. I am praying that it doesn't happen again. I wish I knew the likelihood of it happening again. I had finally decided to shave my hair next week prior to my next treatment on Friday I felt confident with this decision but now I'm not sure. I would just be lucky enough that my body can't tolerate the Taxol and I would have shaved my hair for nothing. I just want to do it before it starts coming out on its own. I don't want to wake up and feel as if I can't leave the house. I'm not sure what to do Any thoughts? I hope everyone had a good week and that you have an excellent weekend!!!!! They are calling for a little snow. It\u2019s way to early for tha",
