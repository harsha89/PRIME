I finished 12 weeks of chemo- taxol and herceptin and will be getting herceptin every three weeks until the end of the year. My lumpectomy in November 2015 was successful- 1.3 cm, clear margins and no lymph nodes. Her2+. I am cancer free. Why do radiologists insist on radiation treatment? I am 63. And otherwise healthy. I am a 34dd size. I worry about the immediate and more so the long range side affects of the radiation. Overall radiation for 6 weeks seems like a lot followed by targeted blasts. I also wanted prone position treatment to keep my lungs clear of the Rays, but the doctor said I am fine to go with te treatment on my back. I am having thoughts that I think this is not necessary.",

      "Content": "Jun 2, 2016 04:33PM - edited Jun 2, 2016 05:19PM by WarriorCheryl I am having accelerated radiation too. 15 whole breast, and 5 focused treatments. The overall radiation levels are the same as the prolonged 7 week stint, but easier on the body. I learned the most important thing is to keep the skin moist. I have gotten some stance rash that leaves quickly, does't itch and isn't blistering so my Dr. says it's fine. I wan to share with you all a Rescue Cream that is working wonders to take out the redness and keep my skin moist. I apply it immediately after my treatment, and again at night. The Doctor checked it out and said it is ok to use. The company is here in San Diego and they will ship the cream for free. The owners are wonderful people.You can contact them to ask about their program for cancer patients. http://www.doctorschwabca.com/skin-concern/sensiti... ",
