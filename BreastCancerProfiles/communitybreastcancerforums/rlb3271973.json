Cany anyone tell me what I should expect? This will be my first one since I am only 34. Is it normal to go ahead and do an ultasound with a mammogram?",

I dismissed  it as nothing because at my age who thinks of cancer right? Anyway last week I checked it again and I swear it is growing. It is probably 3 centimeters in length, doesn't hurt, doesn't move and now I have a small dimple right above it. It is in the upper inner quadrant of my breast. It isn't attached to the skin because I can pull the skin up but you can feel it when you barely brush the skin. It does feel as though it is attached to something underneath. Now my big question is when they talk about a caner lump being hard, how hard to they mean? This lump is firm but I wouldn't call it hard. It is like pushing in on a firm peach. Should I even worry? Regardless I have a doctor's appt on Thursday and I talked to a freind of mine who has had breast cancer and she seems VERY concerned so I guess that is the reason I am even here. If she is worried then that makes me worried too. So if anyone wouldn't mind telling me what their lump felt like I would really appreciate it just for comparison sake. I am trying not to stress out but it is getting harder the more I read. So if you think this is nothing I would love to hear that too!!!! Thanks for any advice you can give me on the subject. Oh and FYI just one more thing. It does run in my family....... one of my grandmother's died from breast cancer at age 43.  Log in to post a reply",

I have the same issue but in my case they said to wait and then if it changed in anyway (other than getting smaller) with in the next 6 months they would do a biopsy. Mine is a lump in the upper inner quadrant of my left breast. I had a mammogram and ultrasound but they found nothing. I would rather have gotten a biopsy right away so I don't stress over nothing but guess I am not quite as lucky.lol Hoping everything comes out fine for you!!!!!!!!!",
