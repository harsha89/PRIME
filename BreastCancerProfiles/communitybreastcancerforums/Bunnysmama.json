Can I join you in the \"I Hate March\" club?  Not an hour ago I was telling my brother that I will forever hate March and it will always be the weirdest of months for me, so it was kind of bizarre that I found this post.  I was diagnosed in 11/06, and after two surgeries I was ready to start chemo in February.  Then I developed an infected seroma so my chemo was bumped back to March.  Two years ago today I got a call from my mother that my father had gone into the hospital for a scheduled hernia surgery.  When they ran the preliminary tests on him, it was found that he had late-stage, and until that point undiscovered pancreatic cancer.  He died on March 2, 2007.  His funeral was held the following Wednesday, March 7, which was also the first day of chemo for me.  As it had already been delayed, I did not want to put it off any longer so I missed my father's funeral. As for getting through the anniversaries, smithlme, it seems like you are doing some really positive things.  Exercising, raising money for awareness, staying busy...not only are they healthy and good for you, you are helping others as well! Best wishes to all, Bunnysmama",
