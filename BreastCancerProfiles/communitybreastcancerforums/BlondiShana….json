This totally freaks me out to see that. Yet the scans have been clean. I hate going for scans. It's so stressful. He doesn't do them routinely. He ordered scans following diagnosis and after complaining of bone pain. Which was probably caused by AI's aggravating arthritis. There have been things that showed up on scans that scared me. Once, a spot on my liver \"too small to characterize\", and \"edema in the clavicle\" area, which my onc attributed to rads. Scan;s also showed lung spots which turned out to be nothing also. You can just go crazy with what comes up on scans that turn out to be nothing. I am in NJ and I go to the John Theurer Cancer Ctr.",

I've had lumps following my nursing years and they proved to be nothing more that fibroidadenomas like chrissyb mentioned. Are they doing a diagnostic mammogram and fine needle aspiration? Also you mentioned that you were fearful of dying and your daughter not growing up to know you. Breast Cancer is not so much the killer disease it once was. Yes there have been many women on this forum who have passed away from BC, but for many BC survivors, treatment gives them many years with their families without the bc again rearing it's ugly face. Take this one day at a time, and trust your team of doctors. Once you know more you'll feel less insecure.",

Cancer was definitely not something I even wanted to educate myself about, but I felt I knew nothing so I forced myself to investigate. You are also facing this during the Holiday Season. That sucks.. I actually noticed the lump during the Holidays and went immediately to my doc right after New Years. It's the type of thing you just have to take one day at a time. Make sure you go to your doctors with someone. My DH was with me through the whole process. So glad his ears were in there listening to my docs.",

I tried Femara, but finally decided that taking the AI's and Tomoxifem are just too much interfering with my quality of life because of side effects. So now I'm off all hormonals. I Do take Vagifem and it does help with the vaginal atrophy, so there is less pain and bleeding. But I do like the coconut oil for lubrication. My DH and I have learned how to enjoy sex in new ways since the vag is kind of sensitive, though orgasm is always possible, so all is not lost.",
