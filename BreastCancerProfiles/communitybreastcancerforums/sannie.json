Doing pretty well with side effects so far, but have heard it usually takes a few days for them to really kick in.  Crossing my fingers every-which-a-way that it will be pretty tame, but going to take it as it comes! Hopefully down the road I will have some kind of wisdom to share with other new folks, the way you all are sharing yours with us \"newbies\" today.  sannie Dx 3/18/2010, IDC, 4cm, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
