Any help or suggestions would be so appreciated.  Just have so may questions.   Thanks so much!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

I really have no idea what questions to ask, what direction to go and all I get from my family is...follow the doctors orders and leave it alone.  Sometimes, that's easier said then  done.  I'm sure I don't need to explain that to any of you....",

      "Content": "soclueless1 wrote: Hello!! Soooo new to this.  I actually posted something awhile ago about my situation.  A mass was discovered during a routine doctor visit.  I had a mammogram done which showed another mass.  The radiologist ordered an ultrasound which I had done the next day.  Turns out one of them is a somewhat complex probable cyst.  MY OBGYN sent me to a breast specialist.  The BS didn't seem too concerned.  When my husband asked questions to get a feel for if this was something to worry about..the doctor said, \"I don't think this smells like anything.\"  Okay..good news right??  Well, he gave me 3 options for next treatment.  1) Wait 6 months and recheck.  2) MRI 3) he said I'll walk you over now and biopsy it.  I asked him what he thought I should do as I'm not a doctor.  :)  He said He'd like to do an MRI.  The problem could be if health insurance approves it.  Well..insurance did and I'm having that done next week.  Now I wonder if I made the right choice.  Should I just have had a biopsy done?? Can an MRI tell me what we need it to tell me?  Of course at what point do I just let the doctor do his job too and stop stressing over it.  Anyway, as this is all new to me, I just don't know what steps I should take, when to speak up and when to shut up.  :)  I am 40 years old and my grandmother had BC at the age of 78.  I do realize that a BIRAD 3 is only a 2% chance.  BUT, if it is, I'd like to deal with it now vs. later.  Any advice would be appreciated.  I think my family is over me stressing about it.  Which, I kind of understand.  :) Log in to post a reply",
