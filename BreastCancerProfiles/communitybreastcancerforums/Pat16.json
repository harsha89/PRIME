Talk about being scared.  If the pathology comes back positive I go through another surgery in 2 weeks after that to remove lympnodes.  I get to have radiation therapy, I don't know how much.  I have not told my boyfriend.  I am to scared to tell people.  I am afraid they will treat my like I have a plague or something or not want to come around me any  more.  So I pretend life is wonderful.",
