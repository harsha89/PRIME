One of the reasons was that the kinds of cancer my family had were fed by estrogen, which is stored in body fat. That was a relief in and of itself.....when I got within 20 pounds of my normal body weight, I had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction in August...just had the exchange surgery in November, two weeks ago. I did not do nipple sparing surgery because I was going for peace of mind. I had too strong of a family history to fool around with that. The mastectomy HURT...I strongly recommend getting a clear pain management plan worked out with your doctor. My plastic surgeon actually did my mastectomy, which was really nice, cause we were on the same page in terms of cancer prevention, but he was used to plastics, and not pain, so i wound up getting my primary to talk to him before my exchange surgery and worked out something that would work for me, as my weight loss surgery restricts the use of NSAIDS, and toredol....My bariatric surgeon recommended using IV Tylenol (non narcotic) and that was great for the exchange surgery, with some diloted....and percocet to go home with (which i did not use all of). The surgeon wanted to use toredol and morphine, but that doesn't really work on my pain and just leaves me feeling sort of drunk. So we had a talk about that before the exchange surgery. (A lot of people can take toredol and before my weight loss surgery (WLS) it worked great, but I can't use it following the WLS. The surgeon was saying that women don't have a lot of feeling in their breasts....well, I was in so much pain I was coming out of my skin...could have planned for that better...that is my only regret. And even the night I spent in the hospital for the mastectomy and expander surgery, when the pain was excruciating, I was still relieved on a level that was quite surprising. I expected some relief, but it was far more than I could have imagined or planned for. My family history was so strong i did not need brca testing to get insurance approval, which was nice..I don't really trust what insurance companies do with genetic testing, and since I lost so many relatives I already know, anyway, pretty much. Also I had more than ten lumps removed myself, and I couldn't go through another one emotionally....way too stressful. . The sense of relief I felt having my breasts gone MORE than made up for the pain, the surgery and the reconstruction process. I had expanders, but did not do any expansions, as I am pretty short and small framed. and done with the pain issue..I really don't care about the size of my breasts as much as I care about living...I am SO glad I did it....the expanders were uncomfortable. I actually had to drive the day after I got home from the hospital, cause one of my drains fell out and my ride and my back up ride flaked. I hurt really bad, but I did it. (avoided the freeway and took lots of breaks and no pain meds til I got home)..wound up having to go back every couple days to get fluid aspirated with a needle, which was a pain in the neck but not painful...the exchange surgery was easy breezy comparatively. I had a huge hematoma on one side after the exchange, but even then the pain was manageable, and really the peace of mind totally worth it. When it comes time to replace them, I will be close to retirement and probably skip it and use a prosthesis....I probably won't do the nipple reconstruction cause I don't like taking pain meds and am kind of sick of surgury and ready to start living my life. I didn't really realize how much of a burden was lifted off my mind once this surgery was done. I also had a hysterectomy (complete) in between the ex panders and the exchange surgery....it feels like i am getting my body back...not waiting around for bad news...it's really strange to outlive one's mother, aunts and grandparents, age wise....the sense of freedom I feel is something I am grateful for every day. Good luck with what you decide, and I wish you the best.",
