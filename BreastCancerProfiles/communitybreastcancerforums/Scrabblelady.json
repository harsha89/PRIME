Does anyone have any opinions about the TLC front opening cami that the ACS sells on their website?   When changing clothes, what do you do with the drains, do they just dangle from you like unwanted appendages?   If they just hang, doesn't that put pressure on the sutures? They make shirts so short now.  Are  the post- surgical camis   longer than most camp or hawaian style shirts that are sold?   How many drains do you come home with after a bilateral , with no reconstrution or TE's.  ( Im  going flat.        Dx 5/18/2010, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
