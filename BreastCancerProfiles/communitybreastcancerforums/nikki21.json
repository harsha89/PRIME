    "Content": "nikki21 wrote: I am currently breastfeeding (my 15 month old) and found a lump.  My gynecologist said it felt like a clump of cysts.  I went for an u/s (with an empty breast) and they said that the area was much denser than the rest of the breast, and there was some shadowing present.  So they recommended a biopsy.  I have an appointment with the surgeon next week.  What is the best type of biopsy I should be looking for?  I was hoping it was just a galactocele, but unfortunately it isn't.  I do have family history of breast/ovarian cancers, so admittedly I am a bit freaked out.  I lost my mother to breast cancer (diagnosed at 41) she lost her aunt to it, and we almost lost my aunt (my mother's sister) to ovarian cancer.  Although she was over 50 when diagnosed.   I guess I'll know more next week when I talk to the surgeon, but any specific questions I should be asking?  Thank you!  Dx 3/9/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 6/15 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
