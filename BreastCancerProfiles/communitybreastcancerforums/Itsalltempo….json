Saw your dialogue and realized that I too have a similar diagnosis (hormone positive, HER2 neg, small breast tumor, but lymph node involvement). I spent a LOT of time discussing the anomoly of the small breast tumor that is classified as slow growing but had already traveled. My surgeon, my radiaologist and my oncologist all agreed that the cancer isn't \"behaving\" as one would expect. That isn't necessarily something to be overly concerned about, but all agreed that it may require a more aggressive treatment - hence the chemo. (I am doing TCx6). They said that it could just be that the tumor cells have a propensity to break off and move, but the chemo would provide the protection needed to ensure that if anything had traveled, it would be knocked out by the chemo. I also had a bone scan and CT scan prior to chemo - they wanted to see if anything had metastized in the bones, chest or liver (luckily nothing had yet). The 3 docs felts that as long as there were no visible tumors developing already, the chemo should do the trick. BTW - congrats on kicking Hodgekins - you're a fighter! You\"ll kick this one with no trouble! Go get 'em!",

Can you tell me more about the hair regrowth? When you say it's growing - are you close to having a cute pixie length hair after 6 weeks, or is it just starting to grow back now? Just trying to get a sense of how long I will have to wear this wig! Got brave this evening and went without any covering to my yoga class - woohoo! It was quite freeing! And very nice not to have to deal with sweaty hair in my face or the pony tail that pokes into your head when you are doing exercises on your back. Its funny - people were extra nice. They kept offering to go get equipment for me (the straps, the blocks or the rubber ball). This was my first time exercising since I started chemo (I have completed 4 of 6 TC treatments). Felt really good to work out again - although I couldn't do half of what I used to do. Really felt the affects of all of this.",

With the money I am saving on hair cuts and colors, I can buy a fabulous pair of designer shoes AND the matching handbag 3. It's the perfect time to experiment with lots of new haircuts when my hair grows back - the pixie cut I was too scared to try, the stylish Kris Kardashian cut, the sexy Lisa Rinna cut, the Meg Ryan shag, etc 4. I never have to worry about my hair frizzing in the fog or going flat on low humidity days 5. Don't have to worry about my hair getting in my lipstick on windy days 6. No need to spend money on expensive shampoos, conditioners or hair products 7. I cut 20 minutes out of my getting ready routine in the morning 8. I can remain in denial about how gray I am really getting because I can't see my hair :) 9. I can be a red head, a blond or a brunette any time I want to! 10. My husband can sleep with a red head, a blonde or a brunette anytime without cheating :)",

Yeah, the hair thing is a tough one. After I was finally convinced that the hair loss was inevitable, I went and bought a wig (actually two). Just needed to get that purchase done and cross it off my \"to-do list\". I bought a really cute regular wig, and then I also got this other wig that is a baseball cap with hair attached (easier than a wig to throw on, much more comfortable and great for the weekend errands and Costco runs). I did a pre-emptive shave on day 10 - which fell on a weekend. I didn't want to see myself with patchy thin longer hair. I also didn't want to wake up one weekday with my hair all over my pillow on a work day and have to deal with rushing around and having my head shaved before work. It gave me a chance to \"practice\" wearing my wig over the weekend before I had to wear it to work. I also told people around me (friends, family and co-workers) when the wig as going to make its debut because I didn't want to be caught in that awkward situation where people would be trying not to notice. So far it has worked out really well! I really think the anxiety leading up to the hair loss can be more stressful than the actual event. On the other hand, no one but my husband has seen my \"tron-like\" bald head. I think it would freak out my parents. My 21 and 24 year old step sons are coming home in a week and haven't yet decided if I want them to see the bald head.",

The symptoms are MUCH more managable this time compared to the first. The doctor did tell me that the first treatment is the worst because it is such a shock to the system, and the others are easier. Just curious to know if it gets easier each time or stays this way for the remaining treatments?.

My Onc says that it may not necessarily be a side effect of the tamoxifen, but normal side effects of menopause. He said the estrogen level continues to step down over time triggering more side effects. At some point the body will even out and the hot flashes will stop, Of course, not string would be complete without some hair discussion. How is everyone's hair? I kept mine very short for a long time, thinking I could cut out the curls. Finally gave in an am letting it grow. It is still very curly, but iI am learning to embrace my curls.

Your comment about arm hair was very funny! teeballmom- totally agree- I am much more freaked out about the eyebrow and eyelash loss than the hair loss. I feel like I can hide the hair loss with a wig, but the eyelash and eyebrow loss is harder. I have been through 3 rounds of TC. Having thinning and no new growth of eyebrows and lashes - but still have retained some. At the place I got my wig, they had some great eyebrow stuff. It is a powder but almost goes on like a liner (but not harsh like a liner). I have been using it and will probably use it even after chemo is over.  I know this sounds strange, but is anyone experiencing great skin? Not sure how my body is doing this given all of the toxins being pumped in, but the skin on my face looks smoother and more even toned than it has in years! Not sure if I am just better hydrated than I have been or what? Who knew that with all those dollars spent on facials, and scrubs, the thing that would work the best is chemo!",

For all we went through with chemo it seems like it should be 100%!!!!). The radiation helps reduce the risk of recurrence in the breast. And the combination of chemo, radiation and hormone therapy together take the risk of recurrence into the low single digits for my type of cancer. (this disease is so darn unique to the individual!!) I wll be getting 7 weeks of radiation because the cancer went into my lymph nodes so he is going to hit the nodes in my underarm, near my clavical and near the breast bone just to be conservative. Then I will start Tamoxifen. Is anyone watching Parenthood? One of the main characters was just diagnosed with breast cancer (she just had the lumpectomy and was told she needs chemo).

I HATE my wig more and more each day. Getting very close to gaining the nerve to go without (I am not as brave as some of you!). Hang in there Ladies - we are making progress every day!",

I had my chemo on Thurs, then got a neulasta shot on Fridays. I would have some bone pain - but was managable with Claritin and 3 advils. It kept my white blood cells in the acceptable range (they did drop over time - but I never had to delay a treatment). From what I have read, so much depends on the individual and the chemo cocktail. I had Taxotere and Cytoxan for 6 treatments. I have heard that the \"A\" (can't remember what it stands for) is a bit harder on the body in terms of side effects, but many doctors prefer to use it in the mix. With regard to the germ factor....I was really careful. I washed my hands often and steered clear of sick people and salad bars. I didn't travel on air planes (the recylcled air wouldn't be good). But I didn't go crazy with hand sanitizer. I pushed the limits once during treatment and ate sushi. I was told not to because of the risk of bacteria (I just couldn't help myself - I was craving it!). I paid the price - it hit my digestive system pretty hard for about 5 days, then I was fine. Sounds like you are doing lots of reading and preparation. You will do great! mambr - Re: depression after chemo - so weird - I thought I was the only one! I had expected to be celebrating and jumping for joy when I was done with chemo, but when the day came I was the exact opposite. It was like I was afraid to be happy. Started obsessing about my chance of recurrence. Felt like I was on the verge of tears for quite some time. Finally, after about  2 weeks the black clouds lifted. Finally getting back to normal (at least mentally!). Now, if only my eyelashes and eyebrows would start growing. I have become the queen of eyepencil. Starting to mirror the Kardashian women in how I apply my make up! Heavy eye pencil to detract from my lack of lashes - tee hee hee! Oh and the hair.....I am thinking that by Valentine's day we should have some decent hair - right?",

I have had some skin reaction near the clavical and the doctor had to back off on treatments to that area for a while - but luckily the skin has not opened up.

I had a very exciting milestone last week.....I had to make my first appt since July to get my eyebrows waxed!! Woohoo!!! All of a sudden, about 8-9 weeks after my last chemo treatment, they grew in with a vengence! Eyelashes are starting to grow, but very slow. I have about 4 long ones on one eye and about 8 on the other, but little lashes are starting to grow and fill in the blank spots. My hair came in weird - came in thicker on the sides at first, and for a while I was starting to think I had some male pattern baldness going on! But it filled in. Now I am 10 weeks post chemo and I have hair all over my head (still super short - but it is my hair!!). I have had to trim (shave) the very ends because they are soooo fine. I ditched the wigs - and it feels great! Was thinking I'd like to donate my wigs. Has anyone heard of a good place to donate and help other women?",

Hair came in very grey and it appears that I will be sporting the chemo curls when it gets a little longer. DId a little research and it looks like they last for about a year.

We are all right by your side (you just cant see us :) Virginiab - after reading the posts on this site- I asked my doc about the 4 vs. 6 issue. He said something very similar to yours...there is no data to date demonstrating that 6 TC treatments gets a better result that 4, but there are trials going on now. My doc has told me over and over that he is very conservative, so he strongly recommended 6. I figure I am two thirds of the way through and as much as I want to be done - I can hang in there for another 2 treatments (or 6 weeks). Good to know we are at least hearing similar things from doctors in two different parts of the country!",

Feeling completely back to normal physically (even training for the Avon Breast Cancer Walk in Sept - walked 16 miles last weekend - woohoo!). While physically I feel the same, emotionally I am changed. I think I value (and nurture) my good friendships and family ties more than i used to. I might even be a little more outspoken. Just feel like I want to treasure the good things and have less tolerance for the nonsense. Anyone else feeling like that? One little humorous thing I noticed....life was quite simple when we had no hair! No eyebrow waxing appointments, no haircuts, no hair coloring. Hair takes a lot of maintenance! Still trying to figure out whether or not I like my very curly hair. Wish I knew if it was going to stay curly - and therefore I should go through that tough in-between stage, or if the curls will loosen up - in which case I won't bother growing it out. All in all - can't complain - its a good problem to have. Hope all of you are feeling better and doing good things!",
