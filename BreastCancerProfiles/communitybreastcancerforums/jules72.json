That's all I know so far and I have an MRI scheduled for Tuesday followed by an appt. with a surgeon. The nurse I talked to told me this is 99% curable and to consider it a bump in the road. I wasn't expecting this to be cancer as I had a fibroidenoma 2 years ago and the radiologist was 95% confident this was benign, she said it didn't look like cancer but the tissue just looked \"different\". This is a palpable lump. So after joining this board and reading since Friday I'm now really worried. Mine presented as a lump versus microcalcifications. The ultrasound showed it being up to 4CM long but thin - like a hot dog shape. After reading so many stories of diagnosis change I'm fearing the MRI and surgery will tell me this is just the tip of the iceberg and that I really have more areas of higher grade invasive cancer. I have very dense tissue and have had above muscle implants for 15 years this area has been itchy for years but I assumed it was just scar tissue. Now I'm wondering if mammograms missed it all this time. Are mammogram and ultrasound really that bad versus MRI and surgery for accurate diagnosis? I fear waking up with stage III all of the sudden and am not at all confident in my current diagnosis Dx 6/18/2015, DCIS, Right, 2cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, ER-/PR- Surgery 7/1/2015 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",

My mom (65) was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia last August and I spent 4 months in the hospital with her. My husband (45) just had spinal surgery two weeks ago and still need a lot of care himself. And I have two little boys who need me too along with a very demanding job. I had an early melanoma 10 years ago diagnosed 5 days after my first baby was born. I know so many others have it worse. I'm just feeling defeated. Keeping you all in my prayers.",

It showed up in a mass of other benign stuff so sort of incidental finding. My question is how bad is an ER/PR negative status? Also after MRI all looked good except for an abnormal lymph node. I did have a biopsy last week which left me with a nasty big bruise so I'm hoping the 1.3 CM lymph node is reactive just from that, however there is one side of it that has a 3.5 to 4 MM thicker cortex wall. We biopsied it so now waiting again.... I'm hoping that thickening in one spot can still be normal and that it's not \"too\" thick?

I had the same debilitating pain and some days were so bad with shoulder/neck/migraine pain that I would lay in bed for a day. After two years I\u2019ve finally got it mostly under control. Here are some things I did. Massage may feel good for a bit but it really dind\u2019t get in and solve my issue. I did PT and dry needling which got me 80% there. Then did chiropractic which helped a ton. I still go about every two weeks for a minor adjustment. I have my hubby massage the area every few days to keep it loose. I do have flare ups but they are manageable and more rare. Keep trying things. This can be solved but you have to retrain your body. Best",

I am now 3 years out and I still have some shoulder issues but very manageable if you stay on top of it. I echo what CBKsaid. Find a good PT. I went for 6 months and it wasn't the right one. Once I find the right PT with experience in this it got me 80% of the way there. One exercise that helped a ton was I's, Y's amd T's Reach out if you can't find that online. I also did some dry needling and a bit of cold chiropractic. So much better now. Massages as well to stay on top of it. Keep at it. It will get better and this is common. Nothing to be concerned about at all cancer wise so don't let your mind go there. Hugs!",

PT helped it get a bit better for awhile, less time between episodes, not as severe, and it moved up my back a bit so not as large of an area. Since I stopped PT it is getting worse again. We also tried some dry needling to release those muscles. The PT could tell my back muscles were really tight and the neck muscles were carrying the load versus my proper back muscles. I'm doing my exercises religiously now so we'll see if it helps. It's just disheartening when I have an episode, I usually have to miss work with them. I almost think the scar tissue is healing incorrectly, it flares up, I use massage or the theracane to break it back down, and it builds back up and causes pain again in a vicious cycle, but I don't know...",

I do I's Y's and T's exercises on an exercise ball every morning and night religiously it's 10 each and then one set of band exercises. My PT did some light massaging and some dry needling -highly recommend dry needling twice a week for awhile then weekly. I also worked religiously on my posture at all times. Chin tucked down, stretch neck and head up like there's a string to the ceiling. Shoulders down and back and keep holding it there often during the day. Feels great to fix my posture. While I always wanted to work on getting the knots out because it felt good for the moment it just irritated it more and stretched the muscles that were already stretched forward. I still sometimes feel it's crunchy back there but not if I perfect my posture. Now if I have minor flare ups the exercises help a ton and posture correction. I feel human again but it was a good 3 months of continuous work. Keep at it and it will get better. Know you're not alone and it is muscular.",
