In panic waiting for results which should come tomorrow or Tuesday. I can't calm down.  Taking Ativan like Xanax but feeling such panic.  I can't put this all on my friends. I don't have a husband and feel so lost and alone.   I know rationally to keep calm, I know statically most biopsys are benign, but the closer it gets to hearing the results the more irrational I am becoming. Biopsy was a stereo mammogram for calcification.   Radiologist said her gut says all is fine but need to wait for results. I want to lean on her optimism, but then I'm setting mysellf for good news when it could be bad.  I think I have never been so crazed, and scared.  I can't get a hold of myself.  I don't know if there is anyone even around to read this post. Or anyone who can help or reassure me. I'm just writing because it's either writing or hiding under the bed shaking and crying.  ",
