YEAH!!  I choose initially to do a surgical biopsy.  With the BM they did find another ductal insitu.  So now I am good.  I found out that we will do the oncocyte test to determine if I need chemo.  He does not think I will need it.  Also they are having trouble deciding exactly how big my tumors were.  He said that this is important to stage it properly.  So we will see about that too.  One more step forward.  Thank you for your support.  I am grateful.
