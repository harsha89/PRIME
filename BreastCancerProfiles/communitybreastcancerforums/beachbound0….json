Erin - I'm not sure what your doc's have planned for you but it was 5 months for me.  That's from the date of my mx, through my fills and finally to the placement of my implants BUT I was not having radiation afterwards.  I would ask, ask, ask especially now that you're 2 weeks out.  They may not have wanted to explain too much too soon after surgery.  I know I was good and doped up after mine and couldn't tell you much of what happened then.  Well wishes to you. ",

Earlier this week, I noticed my biopsy scar (biopsy was on 6/17/13) was looking a little different, almost like it\u2019s separating.  I showed it to my RO and he\u2019s watching it.  He said he may not want to do the boosts if it breaks open.  I happened to go to my MO the same day and he wants the boosts regardless.  I told my MO he could duke it out with the RO.    I\u2019m looking forward to a restful weekend and I hope you ladies are able to enjoy it as well!  Happy Friday!",

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here but I think of you ladies every day.  I\u2019ve been so busy at work and then the Rads take any energy I may have left that I just crash when I get home.  I had #18 of 33 today.  My skin is darker and constantly emits heat. I have a rash like area below my armpit and at the top of my implant.  My breast is tightening and it looks like my implant is slowly moving up my chest.  That\u2019ll be interesting.  I had to laugh at the thought of lefty chillin around my clavicle.  LOL!  I\u2019ve had more nerve pain recently and just started itching below the breast yesterday.  That itch is driving me CRAZY!!!  I\u2019m still surprised by the fatigue.  I went shopping this weekend and had to nap afterwards.  That\u2019s just odd for me.  Other than ALL of that, I\u2019m good.  I\u2019ll talk to my RO about the traveling boob and the itch tomorrow when I see him.  I know it\u2019s normal for the skin to tighten up during rads and I guess since I had a mx, it\u2019ll just move my implant up as it tightens.  Like I said, I\u2019ll ask tomorrow. Much love to y\u2019all!!",
