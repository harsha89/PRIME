Not one of them icky frozen ones either. We make our own batter and deep fry them. The kids love it. Good gravy I've never tasted anything so bad in my life. It actually made me gag and run to the bathroom. Lol  Fruit and salad tasted ok so I've been sticking with them, but only with Dorthy Lynch dressing, ranch is a no go. :( I was thinking the oil in the fryer had went bad, but the kids said theirs were good, so I agree, fried oily stuff is out for now.",

To do that, I would either need to get dentures made befor the teeth come out and wait 3 weeks or so, or get dentures after healing for 2 months. I was thinking this was a hurry up type of thing going by the way the onc was talking, so I set up to have them all pulled 2 days later. Four days after, I go back to see my onc, and he now says no chemo!! What the #$%!! I just had all my teeth pulled out!!! I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with no teeth. I'm so sick of mashed potatos the thought of them makes me want to throw up. Liquid diet for 2 months! I'm so mad at him. How could he let me do that for nothing?? How could he make such a big change in treatment plans without even talking to me about it??Now he just says\"it doesnt work as well on bone mets, so we are going to just do the Tomox for now.\" I wanted to scream at him so badly, or cry, or both.

I'm more worried about them getting treated, where we know there is cancer, than the mast scar where there should be none. The rad tech told me they only treat bone mets that are symptomatic, so they have just been treating my chest wall and nodes. What the hell!? So I go talk to the rad Onc. She tells me the bone met sites have been getting treated daily, but the boosts are just for the breast area. What exactly is the point of treating the breast area, that has had all the cancer removed, but not treating the bone mets? The mets can send out seed cells right? Why bother doing this if they are not going to try to get it all? What am I missing here that makes me not understand this treatment plan? It can't rain forever.

The original tumor was removed, should be no cancer cells in my breast area according to the surgeon, but that is where they are concentrating the rads and kind of ignoring the mets, where there more than likely are remaining cancer cells. This is what confuses me. Why only treat the one area that may have cancer cells but leave other areas that are more likely to have cancer cells untreated? ",

There was no way I could drive that daily, unless I didn't pay my rent or eat for a month, so I had to change to the local cancer center. Lucky for me, they just got set up to do rads in the last few months. I think the change in doctors is causing me some confusion, I can't remember who said what, but as far as I know, curative is still the plan.

They did a root canal and cap on the tooth and are now hoping it works. From what she said, it sounds like they don't know for sure if the tooth was the cause or the sinuses started it all.  So if the work on the tooth doesn't fix it, they want to do surgery on her sinuses.  Also wanted to ask, how is your dog?

I'm mad all the time, at everything and everyone, for no good reason. Except when I look at my kids, then I feel like I'm going to bawl like a baby. I almost lost it in Wal-Mart yesterday because one of my mom's friends that I hardly know asked me \"How are you doing?\" I said, \"Good, how are you?\", as I normaly would, and she responds with \"No, really, how are you doing?\" It took me a second to catch on to what she was talking about. When it hit me, I wanted to scream. I asked her did my mom just go down her list of contacts and call them all?? I still haven't talked to my mom because I don't think I can be nice about it. My boyfriend was complaining about some itchy bug bites he got yesterday and I had an overwhelming urge to choke him til he turned blue. He says Im so differnet since I found out about all this and doesn't understand why I can't be nicer to him. He says I treat him like it's his fault or something. I feel like I have wasted so much time, the more I think about it the madder I get. I can't look at my kids without thinking how they would be effected if I ..you know. It's all I can think about, but I can't even type it.  Is this the \"new normal\" for me? Does it get better? When? How do I deal with all this crap and not lose what few marbles I have left?

We also had a guy from China, one from India, another from Australia and a lady from I believe Germany. We were all talking about how we all used words that meant nothing or something totally different to the others in the group. We were explaining this word means that when I use it and means this when so and so uses it. I had heard the term wanker, never from my boss, but somewhere, and asked him what it meant in front of the whole group. It was the one and only time I ever seen the man speechless. After he regained his composure his reply was \"Oh my god! I can't tell you that!\"",

The stress from learning you have stage iv cancer is more than enough to cause these changes I believe. My dad has bi polar disorder. We had no idea til he was in his 50's. We had some family issues that caused him a great amount of stress and he just lost it. He went from being his normal happy self to someone I didn't know at all to a court ordered stay in a mental facility in less than 5 days. It was a drastic, fast, complete change in his personality brought on by stress. If the MRI shows nothing and brain mets have been ruled out, I would try a mental health specialist, ASAP. So sorry you and your mom are going through this. Best wishes to you both.",

They all introduced themselves, told me about their DX and treatments then asked about me. I told them I'm 36 and stage IV from DX. I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life. Their looks of interest turned to looks of sadness, pity and fear. All of a sudden I felt like I was going to drop dead right then and there. That's how they seemed to see me anyway. I excused myself and damn near ran to my car never to return.  I am so very thankful for these boards.

I've never been a girlie girl. Hate dresses,pink and flowery stuff still. I was into the goth thing back then, all black and leather with chains kinda stuff and she would send me these pink lacy things with fluffs and bows. With matching socks! I don't know where she got this stuff but I love her to bits for sending it, now, I didn't quite appreciate it much back then. LOL",

The other day, when I was mistaken for a man by the cancer center staff, I was grumbling about it to the rad tech. She's really nice and I like her, so I didn't take it personal, but still kinda ugh. Today after my rad treatment, she gave me all the info for the look good feel better thing, because, you know, if I put on make up and wore a pretty scarf or wig people would know I'm female. It's 100 degrees here. I have a wig that I love, but yeah..100 degrees, can't do it.  And make up..most days I have to force myself out of my jammie pants to put on clothes. Some days, I just stay in the jammies.  Make up, not gonna happen. I've never really worn make up. I'm a tom-boy. I not really one to do \"girly\" stuff. Getting dressed up to go to rads just isn't on my list of stuff to spend energy I don't have on. What I really would have liked instead of being told \"change yourself\", is to know that some awareness of \"no hair does not mean male\" had been brought up to the staff.  This is probably nit-picky, but it just irked me today.  Thanks for letting me rant about silly stuff. Oh and the religion stuff! When I told my mom my scan came back clear, she said \"See, you should really thank god for that.\" I told her I thanked all the people who went to med school and did research to make the drugs and treatments that killed it. I think they had much more to do with it than god did. She didn't agree.  It can't rain forever.

My bone mets and the huge tumor in my breast shrunk quite a bit with only the Tamoxifen treatment. It starves the cancer cells of the hormones they needs to grow and divide, hopefully killing some cells or at the least not letting it grow anymore. At stage iv, it's to late to try to kill it all with chemo before it spreads. I think what they try to do now is keep it under control as long as possible. Chemo is a \"big gun\" saved until needed for most I believe. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here. I'm still learning myself.",

Most likely won't ever meet my grand kids, or see my youngest graduate. I think it is harder as far as I feel so cheated.

      "Content": "May 13, 2013 04:52PM - edited May 13, 2013 05:00PM by Stormynyte Lynn, I'm so sorry. No family should have to deal with this crap, but to have it hit multiple family members at once..ugh. Treatment for stage IV is not the same as it is for lower stages. Being that your mom is 81, I can't say for sure, but if she is ER+, I think hormonals would be used before chemo. They normally try the easier things before the harsh ones. At lower stages, they nuke it and try to remove it all. At stage IV, depending on how much it has spread, the option of removing it all is past. They try to \"contain\" it, for lack of a better word. She may not ever get chemo if they can find a hormonal that works well for her. Radiation is also used differently on stage IVs. So the normal surgery, chemo, radiation thing probably won't apply to her.  As for as your questions.. \"but at what point do I (and my sibs) step in and tell Mom what she will do or not do and at what point do we say ok, it's your life, it's your decision?\" From this point right here and now you say it is her life, and her decision. Because it is. You can not \"tell her what she will do or not do\" at any point. You can recommend, you can share your experience, you can try to convince, but you can not force her to do anything. Unless she is incompetent and you are willing to go to court and prove that to get guardianship of her.  For Mom and Pop's relationship, that is theirs to deal with as they will. If your mom doesn't want dad to know something, I feel that is her right. As a very private person myself and one who hates hugging, I think I would like your mom.  What I choose to do, because it is easier for me, and easier on my family, is to deal with all this crap myself. Let her know you are there for her, I'm sure she already knows this. Don't try to force your way in, let her deal with it how she needs to. Don't take it personally, but let your mom do it her way, whether you like it or not. I actually had to have a fit before I could get my mom to stop trying to force her way in. She insisted on going to my appointments with me. I tried to decline politely, that didn't work. I finally had to just bluntly tell her that I would rather go alone and she was not going with me. I like to have the time after my appointment to absorb what the Dr. said and if necessary, have a breakdown, alone, in my car, where I feel comfortable. This is not something I could do in front of anyone, ever. When I'm ready, I'll tell what I choose to tell to who I choose to tell. Ultimatly, all you can do is let her know you are there whenever she needs you and be there when she does need you. Just my two cents. Best wishes and good thoughts to both of you.",

Anyway, she asks what the plan is. Told her scans next week since it's been over 6 months. If nothing new, we go on to rads, if there are new mets we find a new AI. She starts going off about \"When are they going to do something!?\" Told her again, for the 100th time, the damn pill is doing something. When this pill stops working, there is another one, till they all stop working, then chemo till that stops working, then I'm just screwed. She still didn't get it. I don't know what she thinks they should be doing, but she insists they are doing nothing. She acts like I'm just blowing it off. Then she went on to tell me what a rotten parent I am for the next half hour. When I go back for my scans, I'll be skipping lunch.    HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY Kelloggs!!",

Just go with her flow. If she wants to do it all herself, let her, but let her know you are there for her. A good support system is wonderful, but don't try to build one for her. Let her decide what to tell to who. Treat her as you always have and be there when she needs you, but let her have all the control. She is going to feel completely out of control of so many things that she can't do anything about. She needs to control what she can. Also, tell her about this site if she doesn't already know. There is so much information here. And so many wonderful supportive people who understand what she is going through. This site was a life saver for me.",

I had one when I was a kid that knew tricks and never ever bit. They are smart and have such great personalities. On the other hand, the birds I've had have all been nippers, loud and so very messy. It was very time consuming cleaning up after them everyday.  One of my fave pets was our ferret. They are so funny to watch and can be the sweetest lil snugglers ever, tho some of them I've met have been pretty nippy.  If I knew how to put pictures on here I have one of our lil ferret snuggled up sleeping with my 8 year old son. Just too darn cute.  I got the pic! But not where I wanted it lol   ",

I went from being sad to being pissed. Seems it's only getting worse since my mastectomy on the 17th. Every time I have to empty these stupid drains I get mad. Or when I try to move my arm to high and it hurts. Every time I look down I want to hit something. Just so friggin mad right now. I could rant about this all night. LOL I think we have to feel however we feel when we feel it til we move on to the next feeling. My attitude sucks, and probably will for a while, but I am pretty sure that is not what is going to kill me or save me.",

      "Content": "May 13, 2012 02:12PM - edited May 13, 2012 02:17PM by Stormynyte Thank you all for your replies. It makes me feel better to know I'm not just a jerk for wanting to tell them they are clueless. LOL When I read it today it sounds a bit harsh, but I was so mad yesterday. We were at my oldest daughters graduation. A friend of my dad's who I don't know was talking to him. She was an older lady and was wearing an awesome straw hat. She was telling my dad how she had just finished her chemo treatments and lumpectomy. My dad of course had to tell her I was going to be starting mine soon. After telling me repeatedly how she knows how scared I am and if I need someone to talk to and all that she starts with all the questions.  Told her mast is on Thursday, then radiation, then chemo. She asked me how many treatments I was going to have to do. I told her only 3 for now. Then she tells me how lucky I am and how wonderful it is that it was caught early and on and on without letting me get a word in.    After a few minutes of her telling me how it will turn out great and all that she asked what stage I was. I just said 4.  The look on her face was great. She then decided she didn't have much more to talk to me about, but insisted that she understood how I felt even after I said it's not quite the same. She then leaves and my grandma who was sitting next to me starts going off about the nosey old woman and how if I needed someone to talk to I could talk to her as she is a cancer survivor and knows what I am going through.  My gram is 80, had to have a hysterectomy (that was the total of her treatment) at the age of 65 due to some cancer she can't remember the name of.  My mom jumped in and argued with her about how it's not even close to the same and for her to leave me alone. Go mom! I was hoping that my kids graduation would be about my kid, you know, graduating. Stupid cancer.  Edited to add I love you girls (and the guys) soo much. Everyone here is the only reason I'm not in the loony bin! Happy Mothers Day and thank you all from the bottom of my heart!",
