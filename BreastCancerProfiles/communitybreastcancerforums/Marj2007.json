I was not told by my Oncologist about this possibility and at the time I was fighting gum disease and my dentist would have pulled a couple of teeth in the back of my mouth if I had gone to him before I started Zometa.  Now I can not have them pulled and must get my teeth cleaned monthly to keep them as healthy as possible.  I am lucky that my dentist has given me a break on the price since I come in every month but even with the price break it has added up over the last 4 years - but I do love to chew so I find the money. Bottom line - Please see your dentist and like everyone else above has said, you will be fine. Good luck, Marjorie",
