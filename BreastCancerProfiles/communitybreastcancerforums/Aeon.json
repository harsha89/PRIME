I had no blood work or tests done before surgery last week, but the hospital did call and ask a TON of health questions, which seemed especially focused around any potential heart, lung, sleep apnea, and stomach issues. She said that based on my answers I don't need any testing done. My pre-op appt with the BS was quick - she just looked to see if she could still feel the lump and we reviewed what would happen during surgery (I had lumpectomy w/ SNB). Good luck!",
