I believe it was called lose it. After awhile I no longer craved snacks and sugar etc. I was on ibrance/femera at the time and didn't have the physical limitations I do now. I had gained a huge amount of weight after my cancer diagnosis by eating my feelings. Weight loss is such a challenge, I honestly don't know how I stayed disciplined for so long to do it.",
