Initially she thought I had 1/3 nodes involved but luckily that was not the case after futher look.  This was such a bummer - the day she called me and gave me the news I was going to my OBGYN to schedule my hysterectomy.  So that will come later and he will remove my ovaries too.  I will post tomorrow once I know more.  ",

I really want to look at the overall complementary/intergrated therapies along with the traditional treatment plan.",

I can tell you my hardest day was the day I decided to shave my head.  It was an emotional evening in my house but the next morning I felt so much better. I was not great at journaling or blogging and I really wanted to be.  I kept a calendar with me always and every day wrote down how I felt.  That really helped me 3 weeks later when I met with my MO again. My chemo bag was stuffed full as if I was going on a weekend trip.  After the first treatment I knew what I needed to make my time go by.  I was fortunate enough to have my husband by my side at every treatment.  You will get to know your body better than ever before.  I could tell after 6 weeks if I had low potassium and magnesium.  I would tell my MO's nurse my symptoms and she would do my bloodwork in the office as a rush so the treatment area would know if I needed a bag of each added to the day.  I was never wrong.   A few pieces of advice - do not over do it on our good days. And when I had one of my worst days my favorite nurse told me to stop being wonder woman and take the pills (pain) they gave me because they do not give you these prescriptions because they are out of tootsie rolls.  You are all in my prayers. #kickcancersa$$",
