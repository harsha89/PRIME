This was to be followed up by radiation and then done. Well as you all know, plans change. Did 4 rounds of chemo that ended in April. On June 5th - this past wednesday, had a prophylactic BMX with no reconstruction and a prophylactic oopharectomy. Spent two nights in the hospital and am now home. My pain is being managed well and my energy level was pretty high yesterday but lower today. While I did not post over the last 4 months, I did get some great ideas on how to prepare by looking on this site, so thank you to all.",

Good to see everyone is mending. runner1987 - I see you are up for tomorrow. I will be thinking of you and sending healing thoughts. To those of you who are recovering - more healing thoughts are being sent your way. I got results back today and the margins were clear, no lymph node involvement. I was on the city bus when I got the message. Couldn't wait to get off the bus to take a deep breath. So I am putting today in the good day column! Kkuziel - so glad to see you have a date.",

Everything went well except that I could not handle the twighlight stuff so I had to have full anesthesia. From the time I got to the hospital until I went under, there was a constant stream of people coming into my room, asking questions, doing what needed to be done to move me forward. This was extremely helpful as there was no time for me to start really getting nervous. I know it is not always like that so I was grateful. I hope this for everyone. Not much pain today. Underarm incision is worse than the incision on my breast because there is muscle there. Looking forward to reading how everyone else fared. My thoughts are going out to all who are \"in the ring\" today.",

Fact is, your life already changed - the day you got your diagnosis and you got through it! Since then, you have learned more than you ever wanted to know about this and you have gotten through that as well. You will have a date soon! jojo2373 - Yep, lumpectomy and SNB - left side also but no drain. Sorry to hear you have to have one. I had them when I had my reduction surgery many years ago and I hated them. JRMH - thank you for keeping up with all of our updates. Knowing I was one of five going through very similar procedures was reassuring.",
