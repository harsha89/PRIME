I have been having trouble with my right breast, for a long time but extensively for the past 6 months. It's so swollen and has a red pigmentation to the front around the areola. I have a large oblong lump (more like a cluser of lumps) on the top of my breast and a smaller hard fixed lump underneath. I also have some numbness to my right breast as well. For the past couple of months, the problem has been going into my armpit/arm area and has caused me to have a \"heaviness\" feeling. One of my bigger concerns is that I have what I believe to be \"pitting\" and I've showed a friend who is a nurse and she reassured me that was pitting. One of my bigger issues is that when I lay flat on my back and give myself an exam, the tissue at the bottom of my right breast is gone. It started out in a small are of being \"sunken in\" where I could put one finger in to touch my chest wall. Now it goes from one side of my right breast to the other side. I can stick all 4 fingers into my chest cavity because it's so hollow. Lets fastfoward this story a little bit until last week. I decided that enough was enough and got in to see a doctor. My general doctor who I see for a cold, etc is a man so I asked if one of the female physicians could get me in. The doctor I saw was concerned and mentioned IBC due to the redness. My redness is not as red as photos I have searched online of IBC but it is still there. She could feel both lumps that I felt and scheduled me for a Mammogram and an ultrasound. I had both done today and the radiologist said that both were fine, and then left the room. I know that im NOT fine. Something is going on. Im not a hypochondriac and Im not crazy (well not in this matter lol). To add on to this, my 27 year old sister is dying from stage 4 cervical cancer which is why I prolonged getting myself checked out. I've been flying every month to go help take care of her and put myself on the back burner. Also, my mom's sister died at 23 of breast cancer. The family history is there so I would assume they would take me serious. I have a call back into my doctors office to see if she will refer me somewhere else to get an MRI and a biopsy. I've done a lot of research online from what Im experiencing and I feel that if it is cancer, its ILC. I've read too that SOOO many times that goes undiagnosed without an MRI/Biopsy. Did anyone end up having ILC and their mammo/ultrasound was clear? I just need to feel like im not crazy when I know something is going on in my body. I can't let this continue on longer than I have because if it is cancer I need to get it dealt with. My dad is watching his baby daughter die from this terrible disease. I can't be the next one. Thank you Kat Oh I should add that my right breast is VERY swollen...2 cups sizes bigger than the left. I can only wear a sports bra right now because of the swelling. Log in to post a reply",

I know im NOT fine. Something is wrong. A womans right breast just doesn't swell to double the size of her left in a 4-6 month span while other factors arise too. Why is it so hard to get medical personnel to really take their jobs seriously? Im trying to find out why the tissue is gone at the bottom of my breast. I can't find any research to explain it. It's not normal for you to be able to feel your chest wall lol",
