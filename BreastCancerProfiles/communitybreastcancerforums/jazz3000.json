I called my Doctor and she said it is normal for some of us to have this. Some of us bruise more than others and some have more extensive surgery with nodes, etc., than others. I'm fair skinned and not as young as I used to be and so my skin isn't what it was 20 years ago. There are a lot of factors. Healing is the pits isn't it. LOL",

So many remarks shared hit home and I found myself with my personal images of those who- from family to friends look at me as if I'm one of the 7 or is it 8 Wonders of the World. The look I love best is the \" Oh God - she's dead - what do I say.\" LOL. In general I find myself avoiding \"people of health\" But then I find myself remembering when I was healthy those same \"people of health\" were just as obnoxious as they are now. Do you realize we as BC survivors are one of the greatest Walking Medical Mysteries of and in the world. Cancer being such a frightening and mysterious disease. Before I got it I thought it was a death sentence. Pay back being such a B*%**#. ( This could be Bummer).  I see people of health as using me as a reflection of their own fears and lack of knowledge wanting to use me to explore themselves. Sometimes I find myself using the BC in very dramatic ways just for my personal enjoyment. More especially with those you've described. You know, the ones who came in, uninvited. The trespassers lacking a sense of limitation or sensitivities. On ocassion I resist the temptation to throw up my blouse and say, if you enjoyed hearing about i, you'll love this! But alas I don't. Thanks for your sharing and giving me a tongue in cheek laugh, that glides over the reality and pains we all suffer through. Blessings and Hugs to you and yours. Have a great one! Thatsvanity- I must say you are an endearing an sweeeeet sister in our fight. Your sister must have loved you so much. So sorry for your loss and so thrilled you posted your story here for us to read. You keep looking and you'll find what you're looking for.  I think the pure in heart always do. Blessings and Hugs dear.",

      "Content": "Sep 11, 2011 02:29PM - edited Sep 11, 2011 02:39PM by jazz3000 It's called Denial in my neck of the woods. If I don't see it, I don't have to deal with it. Sounds like a pay back for being the wonderful caring mother you've been. You're expected to do it all, take care of it all, and get through it all, while you make sure their needs are all taken care of.  So the answer to your question is NO, I don't think your being selfish. Me thinks you've been too unselfish with your time and love and concern where your children are concerned. It's just not hitting them as yet you might not beat this one as quickly or as neatly as you have all your other challenges. They'll come around a little at a time as things have a way of taking care of themselves that way. Their friends, associates, and community will eventually enlighten them as to what your going through and why your scared.  I think the hardest part of Cancer dx is dealing with family and their issues.  The word, \"NO\", is a real good start when your feeling low or depressed as your going through this. Define what you need for your personal health issues, (i.e., physical, mental, spiritual_), and share it with them openly. When they step over that definitive line, start using the word no and hold your ground. I always let mine know how much I love them and how proud of them I am, but right now it's necessary for me to care for myself so I can continue to care for them. Keep us posted as I love your little forum here. We all have issues with those we love and BC. You sound like a great Mom!  ps: I watched Gran Tarino with Clint Eastwood a few months ago and though it's the masculine side of our story it has as many truisms in for the feminine side where cancer is concerned. It's also just an enjoyable movie. You might catch it if you haven't. ",

It would prove so much more convenient. What's up with us anyway? I guess we're just not fitting into any of the Hollywood fantasies they've become so inundated with. Thanking the Heavens your here @ my beginning and that we have years of sharing the issues of BC struggles before we give them what they want. LOL",

I think a camisole without the bra might be an easier way to go and no one is going to notice. You can find some that are fitted with a bra insert but make sure they are a little roomier at the bottom. If you have a tendency to sweat rub you creams in very well and wipe off excess and use corn starch (not baby powder_ ) to stay dry.  When your airing out at home get some Benadryl spray and spray the rashy area to get rid of it.Great Luck with this and hoping it all gets better.",
