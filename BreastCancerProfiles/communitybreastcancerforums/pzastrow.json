The ultra sound showed the edges to be smooth so the surgeon said that is good and she feels better about is being a lower probability of cancer. I just watched my mom die of bladder cancer in Feb. She was diagnosed with stage 0 in Feb '08 and stage 4 metastasized in Sept '08 died in feb '09. Cancer scares the ~~~~ out of me. I've read several posts and feel so sad at the amount of you that have cancer. I am so sorry. Any one have this kind of surgery and if so what was the out come? I have had lumps since I was 18 and it's my worst fear. I am 48 and had a hysterectomy in 2001 and 2002. I take bio identical hormones. The surgeon said they are just as dangerous as synthetic. I didn't know that.",
