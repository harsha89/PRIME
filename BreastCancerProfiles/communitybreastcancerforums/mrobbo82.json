My story so far, I noticed In end Nov/beg Dec 2012, a long approx 5cm indentation/dimple down the outside of my left breast which appeared quite suddenly (my guess is within a week). I have no lumps or no family history of BC. Im 31, in fairly good health, I have quite large breasts for my frame (G-cup aus) 5ft2in, 58kg. The only time it has changed is during my week of my period it is less noticable. I have attached some photos i hope never done the URL thing before. (oh and the red dot is a pimple!) Quick approx timeline 26/11/12 - 09/12/12 - noticed dimpling (only every thought that BC was a lump so never heard of dimpling before, thought i slept on something) 22/12/12 - not gone away so I show my mum who says see Dr straight away (I have my own business and was very busy!) 27/12/12 - referred by GP - ultrasound normal (left breast had a simple 2.5mm cyst present between 11 and 12 o'clock. No further solid or cystic lesions were identified) 29/12/12 - saw GP with results who sent referral to hospital outpatient department 12/01/13 - letter from hospital received - appointment date is 26/02/13 !!! 19/01/13 - as i still dont know what it is I see another GP who referred me to a breast surgeon, with an appointment date of 25/02/13 !! I have tried ringing breastscreen australia who say I have to be 40 to use the service, I have tried searching for other causes or ways to get my diagnosis quicker but cant find anything! My questions are :) 1. Does this sound / appear familiar to anyone? 2. should I be waiting all this time to get my diagnosis? 3. Clutching at straws here but, could it stem from your back? I have had back pain for a number of years, worst was 2005-2007 when investigations showed I had a compression fracture in my spine (25%), bulging discs in 2 areas etc and had a scans to look for a tumour that was causing fracture as I hadnt had any trauma to cause it. Nothing came up but was told very minute cases the tumour was hiding or unable to see. 4. Anyone else had trouble getting tests / diagnosis due to being younger than the common age? If so, how did you get it all done quicker? Sorry this is so long, i just dont know what to think, where to go, what to do??? Thanks for your time Michelle Log in to post a reply",
