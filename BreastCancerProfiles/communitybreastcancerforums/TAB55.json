I'm religously using aloe to take care of my breast and eating lots of protein to help any damaged cells repair themselves.  I'm much more bothered by the hot flashes, and am not looking forward to homone therapy, when I think they'll be worse.  My RO offers free acupuncture which allegedly helps with the hot flashes.  I've had one treatment and hope it works for me.  If anyone has suggestions for relieving the hot flashes, please share them.  Hope you all have a good weekend and enjoy our weekly break from radiation.   kjiberty: I know what you mean about the chin hairs.  I had them removed with lasers a couple years ago.  I'm glad I spent the money to have it done.",

They aren't the least bit sexy...  And I'm hoping the RO is wrong about redness.  My mother was Mexican, and I'm counting on that good skin I inherited from her to keep tanning, not burning.   Everyone: Soon we'll be enjoying the weekend without any radiation.  That's enough to make me smile. ",
