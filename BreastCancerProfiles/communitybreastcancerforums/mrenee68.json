Once the pain was under control it was manageable. Take the pain meds if you need them you can't heal if you are in pain. You will need help for awhile, take the time and rest. I have had a problem with some of my skin dying, so I have had 100 cc removed from my expander and have to treat my skin with ointment twice a day trying to save it. The drains by the way are a hassle and do cause discomfort. You can do it, just take one day at a time, sometimes one hour or even one minute. Big hugs to you!",

Please know you are not alone, many of us have been where you are right now. Keep breathing and be good to yourself. It's okay to cry, I cried so much I'm not sure how I still had any tears left. I couldn't eat or sleep, I was a mess, I pretty much tried to avoid people because I couldn't take all of the looks of pity. You will get through this, but it will take time. Take it one day at a time, or one minute, or one second, whatever it takes. ((Hugs))",

I made the choice to keep my \"healthy\" breast and deal with whatever the future has for me. I had a hard time being okay with removing one breast let alone removing a breast that at this time is healthy. Do I regret my choice, not at all. It is stressful when it comes close to time for my recheck, but not as much as the stress and discomfort I have been through with my MX and reconstruction. Think it through and do what is right for you and what you can live with. Remember once it is gone there is not going back. Good luck!",
