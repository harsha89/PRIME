Due to the fact of his age and length of time he had symptoms without being treated he opted FOR the chemo. He is on his 3rd of 4 Taxotere/Cytoxen cocktails. He is going by the mentality of doing everything he possibly can to prevent reoccurrence. He will also be taking tomaxifen for 5 years after chemo. He has not had any neuropathy side effects. These drugs effect everyone differently.",

I know the docs are being overly cautious, I am pretty aggravated and sincerely hope they give him the bladder protectant regardless on his next treatment! He was supposed to have at least one good week before starting all over this Wednesday. He was also supposed to have something modified on his car that they screwed up!

We noticed a red rash at his port site this afternoon. He also mentioned the sides if his tongue feel weird. Any advice? I get lots of advice from others on different treatments for different cancers and from other caregivers, but would love to hear feedback from people getting the same 'cocktail'. Love and support to you all!!!!! Dx 2/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

Even hand served us lunch the day of Chemo! :) He just started to run a fever, I gave him some Tylenol and will check his temp regularly! If it persists throughout the night do you think I should take him to the hospital? All we eat is chicken chicken chicken! Lol! So I am hoping he is getting enough protien, I know it is extremely importent through the treatment. His mother bought me the Eating Well Through Cancer Cookbook, and I am carrying it with me like a bible! I have timers go off on his cell phone every 1.5-2 hours to remind him to drink! It is extremely helpful since he isn't always thinking of drinking! I have him rinsing with a baking soda/water mixture as the nurse recommended. He does have a sore throat but the doc said that was normal from the chemo, maybe I should add the salt to it too? I am cooking every night for him, I am too scared to order out or at this point even have him leave the house until his blood work is done on Wednesday. His boss expects him to come to work, I just emailed him telling him it may not be possible tomorrow. Just taking it one day at a time as his side effects are different every day. Again thank you all for the advice it is extremely appreciated!",
