My original diagnosis and medical journey in my bio. This reduction is my last effort to reduce or eliminate scar tissue pain in my radiated brest.  Am expecting NED but have not read much on these findings. My question, was cancer found in your tissue when you had a masectomy or reduction?

Chemo actually contributes to bone loss so in reality all women taking chemo should bisphosphonatee receiving a  to reduce the bone loss. Participating in this trial I get a drug, dont' have to pay for it and contribute to research. Osteoncrosis is a risk with any of the bisphosphonate.My dexa scan revealed I already have osteopenia at age 46. I really had nothing to loose only a gain. After the trial I will have a need to continue to take a bisphosphonate for the osteopenia. I have not been asked to take any vitamins or calcium supplements, but am doing so on my own. thank to you for participating in the trial",

The trial will be temporary closed on Aug 24,2009 not sure for how long. Apparently the trial is near its required qty to complete the trial. Entry into this trial has averaged +167 woman per month which is greater than expected. I am doing pretty good on the clodronate and even remember to take it daily; although I have not kept up with my Onc visits but will get there in the near future. I have just passed the one year mark for taking the Clodronate, hoping the next two years go just as fast. I keep reading the ups and downs on bisphosphonate that science research keep giving us. hoping we all make a good choice,",
