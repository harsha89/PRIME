However, I have noticed that in the last month it has grown considerably larger. I went back to get another ultrasound and they discovered that my mass has grown a third larger since the original ultrasound and now I have an inverted nipple. The Doctors are very worried and are having me do a biopsy on Friday. I am extremely terrified. I am 18 years old, I graduate high school in two weeks. I start college in 3. I don't even know how to function or how to even deal with myself. I need help I need someone to talk to that has been through this whole process. Jeanette Log in to post a reply",

The support, prayers, warm wishes, and advice that you all have given me has truly made me feel stronger about this whole thing. My biopsy is a needle biopsy (which I have no idea about). I just have one major question about the biopsy, will I be in pain afterwords? And Beesie I am currently just going to my family Dr. which makes since about what you said. I am going to wait for my results and then decide if I should go to a breast specialist or not, and one more question. If I do decide to get this lump removed will there be a large scar?",

I feel more vulnerable because of my lack of knowledge. But the web sites that all you ladies have given me and just your experiences have helped easy my mind. I cannot thank you enough! I will keep you updated on everything. First thing Tuesday morning I am calling to see if they can do the Biopsy any earlier because my finals are this week and I need to be able to focus on them as much as possible. How long did it take all of you ladies to receive your results? Hopefully it wont take too long, but anything longer than instant will feel like forever!",
