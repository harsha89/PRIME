I thought I would do DIEP reconstruction but both the plastic surgeon and my oncologist surgeon prefer the lat flap method. I need to reconsider my options. If I go with the lat flap I am on for Tuesday and if I want a second opinion then my surgery date gets pushed back a week or two. I found the lump myself end of Feb. and everything seemed to be going so slow and now it seems to be going so fast. What when into your decision? What have you done to prepare?",
