    "Content": "Apr 23, 2018 07:27PM - edited Apr 23, 2018 07:30PM by Rav3nmom I am 33 yrs old. I was just diagnosed 4/18/2018. Found lump myself, right breast, then the ultrasound found 2 more next to each other.. Still waiting to find out more specifics & having more testing done. I have a long family history of colon, ovarian, pancreatic & 2nd cousins with breast cancer (None within my first relatives had breast cancer though) so I will have genetic testing done as well. Breast MRI tomorrow then surgical consult Thursday. The only things I know so far is- it's IDC, grade 3, ER-/PR+ HER2+ (3+). I have been having other female issues so they're are getting my referrals together for more tests.",
