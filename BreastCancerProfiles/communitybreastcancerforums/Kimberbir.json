We are neighbors I live in Minnesota. So do you still have to finish the year on the herceptin? Are you going to have to take the tamoxifen pill also? How were your SE? Stay Strong! toughcookie my infection was on the right side non cancer too. I am getting my port on wednesday I will let you know how it went. To be honest I had 2 surgeries for my infection one on a friday July 14 and another on the July 17 everyday is better, still not quite there yet. Do you know when you are starting chemo yet?   ",

I started getting really cold and achy all over i guess that is not a good sign they said it should be easier next time. Got a port, first access was painful they say that will get better to, think I'm gonna be glad to have it. Sorry to hear about your TE hurting you, it will be worth it in the end. The one I have left not doing to good they found fluid around it (think that happened when i had the echo) they took fluid out but not sure whats next, told me to take it easy! If i take it any easier I'm gonna be in a coma! Yes I did think the mayo infusion center was pretty awesome, the nurses are way above and beyond, thinking about staying there at least until I'm on the herceptin only, maybe we will cross paths one day! Stay strong and beer is good, hehe!",
