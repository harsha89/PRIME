      "Content": "Longrun731 wrote: I had a core needle biopsy just over 6 months ago. My diagnosis was mastitis and I spent 20 days on antibiotics and seemed to get better. Six months later I'm still having problems. My breast is so sore and tender that it is impacting my daily life. It hurts when my kids hug me. I won't let my husband touch me. It hurts if anything brushes against it. Walking across the floor makes it hurt. And now I'm on daily pain medication because the pain is radiating into my shoulder area. It continues to get worse as time passes. I went back for my 6 months check up a couple of weeks ago and expressed my concerns. I was given a clean bill of health and told that \"sometimes breasts just hurt, take pain medication\". That was when I knew I was getting no help from that doctor. Really? They don't hurt for 6 months non-stop. Could this be from the metal marker placed in me? The doctor told me those don't cause pain, but I can't believe that anything else would be doing this to me. I had a lumpectomy several years ago and it was a lot easier on me than this biopsy. I also, just months prior to my biopsy, had a majorsurgery to remove a different medical device from my body because of all the trouble it was causing me. I just feel like my body doesn't play nice with foreign objects. Any advice on what I should do? Is an exacto knife and needle nose pliers to fish the crazy thing out my only solution? I feel like all the doctors at my clinic think I'm nuts. Log in to post a reply",
