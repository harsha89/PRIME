I have had lung mets and brain mets for 2 years now, also with liver, bone, and ovarian mets. Just when there was only one spot left in the liver 2 months ago, I wound up in the hospital with large pleural effusion in both lungs and a large pericardial effusion. I had the fluid drained from the pericardium and lung. My doctor switched my chemo and I have had no recurrence of fluid yet. He considers this just a bump in the road. I hope that it is and I hope this is the case for you too. Enjoy your time away with your husband. I wish you the best.",
