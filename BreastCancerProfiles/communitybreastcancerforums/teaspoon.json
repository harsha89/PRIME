      "Content": "May 24, 2014 07:52AM - edited May 24, 2014 07:58AM by teaspoon Hi rayofsunshine, Sorry that you find yourself here, and that you've been having such a difficult time of it this week.  I know that others will chime in soon (it's a holiday weekend and may be quiet here) and just wanted to reach out.  I remember how hard it is to be where you are right now!   The radiologist sounds like a Jerk with a capital J (hope you never have to see him again), and I'm glad you found your way to a breast surgeon.  I hope that you feel good about her. It sounds like she tried to explain the recommended procedure to you and what you've shared about that conversation makes a lot of sense to me.   My situation is not exactly parallel to yours - I didn't have pain, I had calcifications found on mammogram Bi-rads 4, went through stereotactic biopsy, results were B9, but had to go back for wire-guided excisional surgery (lumpectomy) of a radial scar, results were B9.  Along the way, I switched treatment providers/centers because that's what I needed to do to feel I was in the best of care.   One step at a time, get with a medical team you can trust, request copies of your treatment and pathology reports, don't get ahead of yourself, don't \"borrow trouble\", stay busy - all of these pieces of advice helped me.  Probably the best preparation for what's ahead is to do exactly what you're doing - choose a doctor and treatment center that you can feel good about, ask questions, get support (glad you're here!), know the timeline and your options, stay as sane as possible (not easy in the limbo of waiting, and if the anxiety is really crippling for you, you can get meds to help), and continue to live your life without this being a dark cloud.  The unknowns are hard, and statistics aren't always very personally reassuring even if the odds are in your favor, but make sure to leave room to think of a B9 outcome, not just the worst case scenario (which is where our minds naturally go when we're scared!).  So, as to the specifics of an excisional biopsy, perhaps you'll first have a wire-guided procedure (did your BS indicate this?), which may be done with mammography or an ultrasound and typically performed by a radiologist - this procedure \"locates\" and \"marks\" the target area for surgery.   The area will be numbed up, and they'll insert a special needle to the target area, then a wire is inserted through the needle and attached to the lesion, the needle is removed, and the thin wire left in until surgery.  Depending on the size/location of the lesion (and whether there are multiple lesions), sometimes there's more than one wire required.  You'll then go to surgery, where you'll get your IV anesthesia, and will be under the care of your BS and her team.  She's already told you where the incision will be and what to expect in terms of the pathology report timeframe. I was given an elastic compression tube top post-surgery.  I wore it for a full week and it was comfortable.  The bandages stayed on for two days, and when I finally got to remove those and take a shower, there were still overlapping steri-strips on the actual incision, so I didn't see the actual incision until those strips fell off about 10 days later (I was told not to pull those off because my surgeon had closed the incision with surgical glue).  I wore a sports bra for a couple more weeks mainly because I didn't want a regular bra to chafe on the incision area (my incision was underneath - on the crease of my breast about 2 inches long).  They prescribed Vicodin for post-surgery pain, and I took that for one day but hated being on it, and switched to Ibuprofen, and that was all that I needed for a few days. As you're in pain now and have been for a while, if I were you, I'd want to get into surgery asap and just get to the other side of all of this.  Removing the lesion will hopefully give you some relief.  And of course the best relief of all is no pain, and a B9 pathology report, which I hope is what you get to hear!   Please keep us posted on how you're doing and the date of your surgery.  ",

Thanks, hope you can enjoy your long weekend too - Tuesday will be here soon enough and then you can get start figuring out what's next.   As I read that you're needing a family member to come some distance to be with you, I wanted to make sure that you know that lumpectomies are typically same-day surgery.  I was at the hospital from 7:30 am till about 3:30 pm, the guide-wire procedure took almost two hours, but the surgery itself was only an hour.  I was back to work the next day (okay, maybe that was a bit too heroic) thanks to well-positioned ice packs (especially the pink Barbie-pillow-sized ones they gave me post-surgery which were my best friends for a while).   So whatever family member can accompany you on surgery day, hopefully all will go smoothly medically and you'll also get to actually enjoy a few days together, since it may not be often that you get to see family or they get to see you wherever you're living now.

The rest of the story is that there was an \"incidental finding\" - although not detected in imaging (I have extremely dense tissue), the pathologist found evidence of a radial scar in the biopsy sample.   My BS is now scheduling wire-guided excisional surgery to remove the whole lesion next month, to be 100% sure it's clear. Time to research radial scars, which apparently are neither \"radial\" nor \"scars\".  My BS answered my initial questions (and those of my husband, who was with me today), but this is something I'm just starting to learn about. And I forgot to ask for a copy of my path report while I was there. Still healing from the needle biopsy last week - not too sore, but very bruised.  The marker that was placed is now also the \"target\" for the radial scar excision, so I'll only need one wire placed in the next procedure. Not sure if I should post in \"high risk for cancer\" forum (or elsewhere?) about radial scars?",

Sorry to hear that you've also had a hiccup on your way to a completed biopsy.  The wait can be incredibly wearing.  I hope that you can find good company and support here in the meanwhile. Regarding the incomplete stereotactic, yes, we do have that in common and it stinks to prepare yourself for something that doesn't or can't happen and thus means a further delay.  I don't know anything about implants, but it does happen that the stereotactic is not always possible for a myriad of reasons.   I wish you well as you wait until March 10th, and I hope that all goes smoothly, and of course with a benign result.  Try to trust that you're on your way, especially now that you've now met with your BS and s/he has confirmed that the wire-guided excisional is the next step for you and that you are on the calendar for the procedure that is recommended for you.  Hopefully by St Patrick's Day you'll be all set with your results and it'll be reason to celebrate!   Please keep us all posted.  Everyone here can relate to how hard it is to wait.  Hang in there.",

Thanks, all, for being here. ",

This may mean a bit more of a delay on top of the 2 months I've already waited for a successful biopsy - but I am hoping that it will ultimately be a step in the right direction. ",

Hoping all goes well with you.   Keep us posted - I'll be thinking about you.",
