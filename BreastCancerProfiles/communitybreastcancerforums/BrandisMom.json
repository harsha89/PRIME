NO post either!!!  Chemo brain at its best........ Anyway, I was very upset at my onc yesterday when I was told that my CA27-29 had jumped up 20 points in 3 weeks!  It was taken 3 weeks ago as I started the Xeloda and new trial drug.  I had so many problems initially that they stopped the Xeloda.  Then they stopped the trial drug.  Then they resumed both at reduced dosages.  More problems, so Xeloda was stopped again.  I'm trying to tell myself that due to all the stops/starts, that the Xeloda/trial drug hasn't had a chance to work for me yet.  What do you all think?  Anybody else have tumor markers that initially climbed when Xeloda was started?

I'm not quite sure.  Being on a phase I clinical trial, the steps are so strictly regimented.  There is no straying at all.  That's why I have to have the tumor markers run -- in my case on day 1 of each cycle.  And a cycle is 3 weeks.  VERY often to be running TM's isn't it?  But that one doesn't bother me quite as much as having to have my chest, abdomen and pelvis CT's, bone scan, and brain MRI every 6 weeks.  Now THAT is really bothersome.  But........ it's part of my trial that I signed on for.  So, I do what I have to do. I am curious about you ladies that have been on Xeloda for awhile..... how is your fatigue?  I've been on lots of things.  Most of them always come with a side effect of fatigue.  But honestly, it was never really a problem.  On the Xeloda, however, it's a whole different beast.  I am so extremely tired that I can barely function.  I have to slap myself to keep awake while driving.  If I sit for more than 2 minutes, I'm out.  It's hard to get through a workday without constantly dozing at my desk (bosses don't tend to like that).  Have you had problems with fatigue?  If so, does it get better as your body gets used to the Xeloda?  I'm not sure how much longer I can take the major fatigue. Oh...... and one last thing, I was initially started on 4300 mg of Xeloda daily.  Now they've reduced me to 2300 daily. Thanks for all your valuable input! Hugs,  Debbie",
