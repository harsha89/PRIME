Im going to pick up my reports  so i can read it all for myself. I will be getting Zometa every 3 months now, instead of every other month. But i will still her every month which is fine with me. Still no word on surgery which is ok. I havent  had none at all. Life is good and i hope it contiues to go great for me. Thank you all for such great support. Remember there is always HOPE so never give up on that. Hugs DEE",
