After the ultrasound the radiologyst said it was complex and did a core biopsy there and then. He also found thickening on one of the nodes and did a needle biopsy of that.  Afterwards the clinic doctor said that if I were younger (i am 64) and they had not found the node they would be grading this as probably benign but still needs more investigation to be sure. But because of my age and the node they have notched it up to may be cancerous, but could still be benign . I have to go back to next weeks cinic to find out the result, and if necessary discuss a treatment plan. He emphasised that cysts do not lead to cancer, and a simple cyst can even be left alone and nothing will happen, but that a complex cyst just might be the first sign of something else happening, which may or may not be cancer and needs a biopsy to be sure.He also stressed it was not the lump itself that caused concern, but the node and my age. I too had difficulties understanding his language and had to ask him to repeat certain things several times to make sure i understood. They are very forthright at the clinic and so I am very optomistic about the outcome. But I only have another 4 days to wait.I feel for you having so long to go before you know what the next step is, especially with your famiy history. No point telling you not to worry,  just hoping that more information will reassure you a little. But it really does sound as if you have a cyst that just needs an eye keeping on it in case there is something else going on as well, I dont think any doctor would leave a call back so long if there was evidence that it was more than that.",

The biopsy from the surrounding tissue and node found no cancer. They seem pretty relaxed. Waiting four weeks to do the lumpectomy, going to die my nodes blue to make it easier to find and test them. If it's all clear they willnjust take the cyst and surrounding tissue. If its spread then they will have to take more and give me further treatment. We are quite hopeful that it is all ok. These cyst cancers seem to be non aggressive and very rarely spread. So do keep on top of your checks.. I do not know how long ago your mum was diagnosed, bit year by year detection and treatment improves. I would carry on loving your boobs- just take care and be glad that you are aware of the importance of early detection, and if in the future you do have another scare you know you woo have caught it early. I am 64. Apparently it's normally people my age who get cancer in the cysts",

I did not even need a paracetomal afterwards and the scar is quite neat. Unfortunatly when they took they cyst out they also found some malignant cancer cells that had not shown up on the scans. so i needed a four week radiation course. Apart from being time consumine and a bit uncomfortable at times after treatment had finished it was fine. I do get tired, but know to give into it and rest.  I am just glad that they found these small cancers early and we were able to zap them before they got too active.  good luck with your follow up. I am sure it will be fine, the seem to be just wanting to keep an eye on it rathert than being worried ",

Perhaps she is following a similar policy. My doctor was convinced that my lump was not cancer but because of age and skin changes she got me seen within a week.  Perhaps they have a similar fast tracking system in Geneva and Plus Vite just means you have popped into the quicker catagory.  The glands can swell and be painfull for lots of reasons, usually an infection, but  because you have BC in the family it is good that she is not taking any chances.  Of course you are worried, the waiting is terrible, and googling makes it worse, support forums are much better places to get reassurance and advice. But thank your stars that you have been sensible and gone to a doctor and that they fought your corner and got the earliest referal they could. Good that it is an ultrasound, not a mamogramm, much more information that way.  On the day you go do not use perfumes or deoderant. Then if they do need a needle or core biopsy and have the facility they can do it there and then. If you are wearing contaminants they might have to make an apppointment for another time.  When i went for an ultrasound there were several women in the queue before me who came out of the exam and the radiologist had told them that there was nothing to be found. So I was gob smacked when they found a thickened node that the doctor had not felt. But even that has not made them think my lump is definately cancer, they say its your glands job to defend you body and they get hard and painfull for lots of reasons that are not cancer.  ",

Can someone tell me how this die thing compares to those? Also my surgeon mentioned one injection, others here mention 4. I have a intracystal carceanoma just above the nipple, and the node they are targetting is just above that. Is the pain the needle or the burning of the die? Does it stop as soon as the needle comes out or carry on? I was told the needle is the same as a insulin needle, very small",

      "Content": "May 22, 2011 05:36AM just-starting wrote: hi, Yes arn't one stop clinics great. The NHS have got something right. I went along last thursday. I  had found a lump that my doctor was not worried about, but I also had skin changes which did cause her concern so I got the appointment in a week. The skin was back to normal by the time i got to the clinic. The specailist said it was either a simple or benign cyst. had a mamogram that showed it well. Had an ultrasound  5 mins later that showed it was a complex cyst and also found one node that had slightly thickened. The radiologist did a core biopsy on the lump and a needle biobsy on the node there and then. They could give me the results of the biopsy, they wanted to do more complicated tests on it that they had facilites for on the day, but lots of women in the queue before me were given results that day. The were nearly all negative, which backs up the statement that a high proportion of lumps are not cancer. I am going to the next clinic to have one or two meetings. The first will be for the result, and then if necessary I have a meeting with a team assigned to me to get a treatment plan together. Good luck tomorrow, no point telling you not to worry. Everybody reacts differently, and you cannot change how you feel. I have not been scared (well i was scared about the idea of a biopsy cos of my needle problem) I am more in shock. Not so much worried about the result, but the meeting is in my  mind the whole time, a bit like an interview with the headmaster or something.  Take something to do whilst you wait for your turn. And in case they did not tell you, do not wear deoderant,cream or powder. Just in case they need to take a biopsy, they interfere with the results.  If it is not absolutely all clear, make sure you have all the info you need before you leave. Ask to see the breast nurse and ask her what the results mean and if necessary get her to write it down for you. I took my husband but to be quite honest he was more for someone to talk to and shoot off to starbucks for coffee every now and again than someone to remember what was said. Not all men are necessary better at taking things in than us.",
