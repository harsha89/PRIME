Had labs, onc appt. then chemo...But I really don't feel too bad! I'm tired but no nausea--actually not much appetite and food tastes kind of bland. I too am using lots of salt ( someone else said that...can't remember who). I will have to go back for the herceptin weekly but my chemo nurse said future infusions will  be much faster and I don't have to have the benadryl next time since I had no reaction today. Terry, when I was diagnosed I had to get an mri on both breasts and a pet scan on my whole body as a baseline. That was kind of scary because of course I was afraid of having cancer somewhere else. I didn't but I think in the future every mammo will be a traumatic experience. Denise, my onc said that the hair that AC didn't get, taxol will get. I cried when I met with him today--not so much because of that but I had been feeling sooo great this week and then the reality that I'm not done yet. But I'm 5/8 done with chemo! I finally tried the Lindt skin care stuff I got samples of and it is incredible! My mom uses the body butter from Body Shop and really likes it. Garnetann, I'm right there with you on the hot flashes! Enough already! Especially if your head is covered...but at least at home I can uncover it to cool off. I don't even use a sleep cap. I'm so impressed that you worked out! I've thought about it but haven't got farther than that...I have really packed on the pounds and if I gain anymore, my fat jeans won't fit. DebbieM, thanks for the positive thoughts. I don't want to be 'cancer girl' forever but I will be a different person--I'm sure of that. Dawn, was your recurrence in the same breast? I think you've told us before but I'm not sure. My email reminders stopped for some reason...this new format will take some getting used to. Cyndi Cyndi",

I also have stubble left from when I shaved my head but really, an objective person would say I'm bald. I think I might be getting some new eyelashes in though. Also, I've had to shave my legs and I think that is just not right!! I want hair on my head, not my legs. But I'm preaching to the choir here...we all want hair! Two women in my \"live\" support group are at the stage where they have really short hair and aren't wearing wigs anymore.

I actually had to go to the emergency room Sunday night because I had a fever and my UTI had gotten worse even though I'd taken all my antibiotics. They were afraid I was neutropenic. I wasn't so they gave me IV antibiotics and another prescription and it's finally clearing up. It's been almost 2 wks. Today I'm so tired I slept all afternoon and I am still ready for bed at 9pm! Gracie, thanks for the port removal info. Was it creepy to have them take out the catheter part? Just the idea freaks me out but I still can't wait till I can get mine out. I hope your arm is ok. Dawn and Garnetann, I'm inspired that you are able to work out. I can't wait till I feel up to it. It is really important for preventing a recurrence. I also now have high blood pressure. I think it's from the weight gain. I have to take medication for it and I'm really feeling like my body has completely betrayed me. I was really healthy (or so I thought) till I got BC. Okay, I really wasn't kidding about going to bed at 9pm! Good luck tomorrow Garnetann! Good night everyone, Cyndi",

I've got enough stress already! Hope you all had wonderful days with family and friends. I have had 6/33 rad tx. So far, no problems but I know it's early. My biggest annoyance right now is my skin and eyes. I have had mild rosacea in the past and really had bad flare ups since Taxol. It clears up when I take antibiotics but comes back again and I think it has spread to my eyes (this is called ocular rosacea). My dermatologist called in a prescription for minocycline and that is supposed to clear up eyes too. My radiation onc said her brother is an opthomologist and will get me in right away if I need it. It doesn't hurt but I look awful. My face is broken out and my eyes are bloodshot. Add this to the baldness and lack of eyebrows and eyelashes and it is not pretty!! My eyebrows are coming back and they stick out randomly and I don't know what to do with them. Can't bring myself to pluck them...Oh well, if nothing else, I have lost my vanity with this disease. Did I mention that I'm also heavier than I've ever been except right before I gave birth? Here's hoping 2008 is a much healthier and happier year for all of us!! Cyndi",

I also saw a new onc at our cancer center as mine is out of town. I liked her very much. I like mine too. My infusions take about 5 hrs total when I'm getting the taxol. The taxol takes 3 hrs. I don't have any reactions but I get very sleepy due to the benadryl. But our cancer center has private rooms with beds and I always ask for one of those when I'm getting taxol. I just dose off and on and read a little. I've had no neuropathy. Last time I got a lot of pain on the 3rd day after. Because I will probably finish chemo in mid-November I will probably not do rads till January. So I get the holidays off! I start crying every time I meet with my onc--either my regular one or the new one. I don't know why! I think it's partly because they are so caring but also it makes it so real to me when I'm sitting there talking about it. I'm just emotional... I was told today that taxol is easier on the immune system so there is less risk than the AC. I remember being at the school uniform place this summer and a mother said to her son \"oh, you feel a little warm\" and I started backing up! Dinner time here--I hope I can taste my food. That's the other SE I get with taxol. Just for a few days though. take care, Cyndi",

It reminded me of when I shaved my head at the beginning of chemo. My mom did it but couldn't get it really close so I had like a crew cut at first. My son (10yrs old) looked at it and said \"I've seen that hair style on girls before--it looks good.\" Linda, I was told to take B6 for the numbness. I haven't been as diligent about taking it as I should but there is very little left in my feet. I am going to try putting my legs up too, Laura. Kathleen, I just said the same thing about 2008 last night! 2007 was just not my year! But I'm trying to remember some of the good things that happened--like my stepdaughter moving in with us. She has been a joy to have around and a big help too. Shrink and Cy, you know we are all pulling for you...you're in our thoughts and prayers as you continue to fight this monster.

Dawn, I get so stressed by Christmas and end up not really enjoying it because of that but this year I am actually not feeling stressed because I'm just not doing as much as I have in the past. I have a great excuse this year anyway. I didn't send out cards, put up minimal decorations, no baking and I'm just concentrating on the kids for gifts. I still have lots of wrapping to do but that's the one part I actually like. But I do need to get organized in other areas! That's a great goal for 2008. Maybe I'll join you... Debbiek, I will be starting rads Thursday. Tomorrow I go in for some xrays (or something) and then I'll get started. I really want to get it going and get it done! What do you mean by weepy? Does your skin ooze? Is anyone else having problems with their eyes? Mine are so gunky and red in the morning. I can't figure out if it's from allergies (never had this problem before) or because I still have no eyelashes to keep stuff out or what. It's really annoying and some days it's really bad. I've had people ask me if I was prescribed medical marijuana cause my eyes are always bloodshot! take care everybody!! Cyndi",

I just had my 3rd taxol and still have one more on Nov. 15. Taxol #3 hasn't been as bad as #2. That's the same situation I had with AC. I've got a lot of joint pain but don't have those really bad body aches that made me not want to go on last time. Shrink, I've got that soft white fuzz too but nothing with any color yet. How are you doing now? Are you going to have rads or surgery after chemo? I will have rads but probably won't start till the first of the year. Barb, isn't it easy to get freaked out by other women's recurrence? I had to stop reading on other boards because I just let my imagination run wild. I have had 4 AC, will have 4 taxols, had a lumpectomy, will have rads and a year of herceptin so there isn't much else I can do except a mastectcomy. I never want to go through this again...I'm not taking any vitamins right now but might after I'm done with chemo. My plan is to eat healthy, exercise 5 days a week, limit alcohol to special occasions and take whatever anti-hormone drug they put me on.  After that, it's in God's hands. DebbieK, thanks for the hair info. It seems like it's slow to come in on the top for a lot of women. I agree with you that I wouldn't want my friends and family to know what it's like. But it is so great to have everyone here that understands. Where in the NW are you? I have friends in Eugene, OR and we love it there. Hope everyone had a nice weekend! Cyndi",

I have noticed that some of the no color fuzz on my head has darker roots! So that must be new growth. Nothing in the eyebrow or eyelash area though. Terry, thanks for the good thoughts. I hope you click with your new onc. It's such an important relationship, isn't it? I had my blood sugar tested last week but haven't got the results yet. I was supposed to go today but cancelled because I just didn't feel like going. I had gestational diabetes and both my parents developed type 2 so I am at high risk. I totally understand ignoring it during BC tx but make sure you watch it. It can cause some nasty problems. DebbieK, glad you didn't scare your co-workers! It must feel so good to not have to cover your head. When you say your port is on your bad side, do you mean the side you had BC on? I hope the soreness goes away soon.

I do have some friends that pretty much disappeared during this. And then some that I hardly saw or talked to very much that really made a point of calling and asking how I was.

I've finished rads, still getting herceptin though and that makes it seem like I'm not exactly done but it's so easy that I really feel like I have my life back--different, but better in a lot of ways too. I started on Aromasin yesterday. So far no SE's. I still have joint and muscle pain which no one can say why except that for some people the effects of Taxol linger for a long time. But I'm used to it and it doesn't really hinder me in any way. Got some hair and I never cover my head anymore! Impossible to say what color it is yet--let's just say BORING! But I will color it as soon as there is a little more. It's about a 1/2 inch. I actually love it short and will definitely keep it short for a while...I'd like some length on the top but I LOVE the fact that I can get out the door from shower to dressed in about 20 minutes.

I'm pretty computer literate so it must be chemo brain! Shrink, there are times when I cry all day for no apparent reason except that someone is kind. I also find myself thinking \"at least you don't have cancer\" a lot--whenever someone complains about something I think is not that big of a deal. I haven't cried at an infusion but when I went to register my son at school this year I ran into a teacher and told her what was going on and I could not stop crying.  I felt bad for her cause I made her cry too. I have a great dog. She may not have known I had cancer (or maybe she did) but she is the greatest comfort to me late at night. My huband doesn't get home from work till 4am so it's me and her on the bed for most of the night. Then she decides she needs to eat at 3am...might be one of the reasons I don't sleep through the night. DebbieK, I hope you are feeling better now. Garnetann, I hope the gel things work. I have been wearing my wig a lot lately because I'm getting out more and it comes off as soon as I get  in the house.

My pet scan was before surgery and the tech let me see it. It was really amazing--like looking inside your body. The only \"hot\" spot was in my left breast where my tumor was. Terry and Bonnie, congratulations on almost being done with chemo. I know we will all be there in the next few months and I for one can't wait! If I stay on schedule, I will be done with chemo in mid-Nov. so I will have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But I have a whole year of herceptin so I won't be done with that till Sept. '08.  My first Taxol/herceptin was uneventful until Friday (2 days after tx). I got so much pain--muscle pain, joint pain, all over--that I was unable to get out of bed yesterday. It still hurts today but not as bad. I have been taking Lortab and it barely makes a dent in the pain. I really hope it doesn't happen on my future chemos. It's almost worse than the AC... I too have some peach fuzz on my head. But I am a long way from being able to go natural. I did dream that I had about 2 inches of hair last night. My hairdresser said she was going to give me something to keep the folicles healthy. I don't know if it's Nioxin or something else...I'll call her this week and find out. DebbieK, I hope you are up to your work meeting. I'll cross my fingers too. Make sure you take something (motrin or whatever works for you) so that you are prepared. Garnetann, my nails are also really growing and much stronger than before chemo. I like mine short too and now I have to trim them much more often. Kathleen, I still wear a little mascara too and my eyelashes are really sparse as are my eyebrows. I had to learn how to do eyebrows since I had plenty before. When I don't have make-up on I really think I look like a cancer patient. After I finished AC, I really had a very positive feeling about everything and I still do but I have been kind of depressed since my first taxol I think because it really hit home that I am not done yet. I always feel positive about survival but not so much about treatment. It just seems like it's so long. How is everyone else handling the emotional part of this? Cyndi",

I haven't notice an increase in fatigue but I've only had one taxol tx so far. I'm feeling pretty good physically but emotionally is another story. My good friend Barbara's husband has been fighting lymphoma for years and the end is very near. I feel so sad because all these years that he's been going through chemo, I never knew how hard it was on him till I had to go through chemo too. I don't know what to do for them. Cyndi",

And that was so thoughtful of you to take a cake and gift certificates. The nurses do become a part of your life, don't they? You are so right about this site. It is the first thing I think of doing when I have a question or want to vent. What makes it so great for me is having others at roughly the same stage of tx. My support group has women at all stages and that is great too but they have told me that they forget quickly what chemo was like. I hope that's the case for all of us. Actually, AC is fading from my memory already... Cyndi",

My friend just called me today to complain about the hot flashes she's getting since starting it and another friend of a friend has decided to have her ovaries removed rather than continue on it. I don't have ovaries so I'll be on an aromatase inhibitor. Don't know which one yet... I have such bad aches and pains from taxol #2. It is much worse than the first time.

I haven't posted much lately because I have a new job! I'm doing research for a big company here and I'm able to do most of it from home. And it's really interesting too so that helps.

Dawn, I really hope the liver counts are meaningless and your mom is doing well. Terry, cancer sucks so much! But I may be one of those that likes her life more now than before--doesn't mean I'm glad I got it though! I'm glad you are tolerating the Arimidex. I'm on Aromasin and I really don't notice anything--I still have joint pain but I've had it since Taxol. Melody, thanks for the hugs! As far as palpitations, I have had them my whole life but they do seem to occur a bit more often since chemo. But I've had an EKG too and my heart is strong. Since I've always had them (so has my mother) I don't really worry about it too much. In fact, I will say that I am strangely not too worried about a recurrence either and I thought when I was done with tx that I would be. I felt very depressed during rads (even though I had no problem with it) and would cry all the time but within days of finishing I felt so good. I was so sad for so long that I was sure I would never feel joy again. But I do! I feel really joyful now...I think it's a combo of being done (and I'm not really done since I'm getting herceptin), having some hair (about 1\") and our beautiful spring days (we had a very cold winter--for us). I'm just glad to be happy again! And I do feel that many things (not health related) are better now. I have a clarity about what's important to me that I didn't have before. Cyndi",

I thought everyone that was her2+ got it. I will have rads after chemo. We'll be doing that about the same time... My schedule issue is so frustrating. I did meet with the scheduler today and the problem is that my onc sees current patients on Wednedays, consultations on Tuesdays, new patients on Thursdays. So they schedule me on Wednesdays every 3 weeks. I'm seeing a different onc next week because she had an opening on Thurs. She's a breast cancer specialist so I'm ok with that. On a happier note, last night I went to a cocktail party celebrating the arrival here of a digital mammography van (the Hope Coach). My friend is in charge of the health plan for a big gaming corporation here and they paid for most of it. So it will be at their hotels about 1/2 the time so women can get mammograms at work. No referral is required for women over 40 and there's no charge either. The party was incredible with 2 kinds of pink martinis that people could vote on their favorite and that will become the \"official\" mammogram martini. I think they are going to serve them at the van to encourage women to get a mammogram. They also gave everyone that attended a Brighton breast cancer charm bracelet. In our state (NV) we have a really low rate of women who should get a mammogram actually getting one. And they are really trying to change that. Anyway, it was a really nice party and I wish you all could have been there with me! Cyndi",

And great cake (great kids too). I know I'm extra emotional now but your pictures made me cry--happy for you, can't wait till it's the rest of us. Kathleen, a friend of a friend that is also a BC patient had the same thing happen. Her onc told her to go see her OB/GYN. No answer yet. Let us know what's up with you. Terry, I would have been upset too. I realize they see a lot of patients but really it would be so easy to just look at your chart before coming in. It might just be their job to them but it's our LIFE and they should remember that. I think you will be having so much fun at the wedding you will forget you are wearing your wig. It happens to me once in a while! DebbieM, I think I only knew one person with BC before my dx and since then I've either been called from friends I haven't seen in a long time that have had it or I'll just be talking to someone new and they'll say they had it or their mother, sister, aunt, etc. It feels like an epidemic sometimes. Did someone already say that? Gracie, I'm sure you will find something meaningful after tx is done. Maybe volunteering at a cancer center? Ours has a lot of cancer survivors that volunteer and it's really nice to have people around that understand what you are dealing with. Also, your fear seems normal to me. My friend (finished tx about the time I started) still fears every ache, test, etc. But it's got to get easier, right? I'll say a prayer that  your scans and port removal go well. Denise, have you found it harder to think clearly on Taxol? I have. I joked about chemo brain while on AC but now it's all too real. I sometimes can't remember words or things that happened and I feel really scared that my brain will stay this way. Also, my herceptin is also 30 minutes with no side effects. I don't have any benadryl with it since the first one so I'm not tired after either. Shrink, I'm so glad things are going well. Mel, it's good to hear from you again. I hope you and everyone else has a great weekend! And I hope I didn't miss anyone--if I did, it's not intentional! Cyndi",

It's been high the last month or so. I think it is mostly from the weight gain. They told me I need to see my primary for it. I really don't want to be on another medication... Cyndi",

My treatment was kind of anti-climatic but that's probably because I'll still be going every 3 wks for herceptin till the end of next summer. So no big farewell to the nurses but I did get a little teary and then when I got to the car I sobbed. My husband didn't understand but I'm just so relieved to be done with this part. I feel like my life has been on hold for six months in a lot of ways. And part of the tears was because even though I'm done with chemo and everyone expects me to be back to \"normal\", I know that it will never be the same. The challenge now is to make sure life is better than before BC. Kathleen, welcome back!! Your trip sounds wonderful and I hope you can post some pics. And your LAX story was so great! It just shows you that we have a huge sisterhood out there that we are not even aware of. And it makes me realize that anyone I run across could have been touched by this. I'm exhausted so I think it's bed time. I'm so glad to join the \"done\" group. There were times when I thought I wouldn't make it...BUT I DID!!! Cyndi",

Cyndi Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me\" (Psalm 23:4 NKJV). Today's Word from Joel and Victoria:  Do you ever feel like you are walking through the valley of the shadow of death? During the tough times, it's easy to get to discouraged. I love what it says in the verse, \"though I walk through...\" No matter what you are facing today, know this: you are not alone, and you are just walking through. You don't have to stop and live in the tough times. They are only temporary. I encourage you today; don't allow fear to paralyze you in the middle of \"the valley of the shadow of death.\" Remember, God is with you. He is walking beside you. He is strengthening you. He is making a way of escape for you. He is lining up people and situations to bring you out of that tough place into a place of strength and victory. Don't give up! Press on and walk through! Begin to get a vision of your life on the other side. See yourself more loving, more faithful, stronger and more blessed than ever before. As you keep moving forward and walking through, you will get to the other side and experience the victory God has in store for you!",

I ran into a friend in the radiation dept. and they made sure that we got back to back appts. So we will visit and maybe go have coffee or breakfast a couple of times a week. Kathleen, yuck!! That would have really freaked me out! We actually have an ant farm in our house right now. It was a gift for my son's 10th birthday. It's got gel instead of sand and I have to say they are fascinating to watch. But that doesn't mean I want to shower with them! Bonnie, good to hear from you! I've heard that fatigue after rads is common. Are you completely done with tx now? Take care everyone! Cyndi",
