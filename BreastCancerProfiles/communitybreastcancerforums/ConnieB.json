    "Content": "Jul 24, 2009 06:41AM - edited Jul 24, 2009 07:01AM by ConnieB I have had a radical mascetomy on my left side with two positive lymph nodes in 2007.  It seems that every complication due to breast cancer that one can possibly get, I have gotton.  I am getting to the point where I stay as far away from a hospital as possible.  I have gotten blood clots, to infected port infected PICC line, developed asthma and now lyphademia is the latest of my list of complications.  I have finally finished with the chemo and radiation last February.  But now I have just recently been diagnosed with Lymphademia in my left hand and arm.  Worse in my hand and fingers than the arm.  Every time I leave the therapist office and try to practice at home, it never comes out quite right.  Does anyone have step by step instructions on how to manually wrap a hand and arm?  I don't use the foam that I have seen online in a few places.  I use artiflex to wrap the hand and fingers and three different sizes of short stretch on top of that going all the way up the arm.  Thanks. ",
