    "Content": "foreveryours wrote: Hi Everyone, Let me start by saying how supportive everyone is and how informative this forum is. Here's my story..... I am currently 41 years old, married with 2 teenager and live in Ontario, Canada. About 10 years ago, I found a spot on my left breast went to my GP and she said it was nothing, I insisted on a mammogram which came back as \"thickening\". I then insisted on an ultrasound, just to put my mind at ease since I have a family history of BC. My grandmother and aunt (on my mothers side) both died of BC six months apart from each other. My grandmother was in her early 50s and my aunt was 28 (she leave behind a 6 month old son). I continued to have yearly mammograms just for follow-up. 2.5 years ago I had Gastric Bypass and subsequently lose 95 lbs. Previously, I had very large dense breast which made it difficult to pin point any lumps or bumps. After the weight lose I went from a 40 FF to a 34 C. Unfortunately, i was too occupied enjoying life 16 sizes smaller that i didn't request followup mammograms like I previously had. This past June, I started to feel a \"pressure\" in the same spot has before. I doesn't hurt its more like a dull pressure. After examining the spot I noticed there was an actual lump now. Not sure, if it was always there and now with my weight lose I can feel it. I went to my GP in September and I had a mammogram on Nov 5, on Nov 16 received a call that a \"mass\" is present and I need a followup mammogram and ultrasound which happend on Dec 12. After the ultrasound, the Radiologist came in to redo the ultrasound even though the techinician had already taken over 60 images. The Radiologist said that I would need a biopsy to determine \"for sure\" if it is cancer. The DR and the Technician spoke amongst themselves in what seemed to be a foreign language as she preformed the additional ultrasound. However, I did pick up them discussing micro-calcification, shadowing and multiple lesions and the lack of defined edges...... based on that it sounds like cancer to me. I wasn't prepared with any questions...I think I was just in shock. I truly thought that this appointment would be like all the others, which turned out to be nothing. My biopsy is now scheduled for Jan 16, I'm worried that it is over a month away, and if it is cancer time is of the essence. But then I think, maybe it's nothing because they are not in a hurry to get me in for the biopsy. I'm thankful that I live in Canada and that I don't have to worry about the expenses associated with healthcare, however the waiting times are crazy. I'm not sure how I'm going to cope with not knowing over the holidays. thank you for everyone that reads this, i just needed to put it \"on paper\". Log in to post a reply",
