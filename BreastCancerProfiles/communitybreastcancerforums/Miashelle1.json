I have to say with the greatest of respect that you are the most amazing group of women I have ever had the privalage to read about. I have followed several 'storys' on these forums and I feel humbled. I am just a housewife sitting at home doing my stuff with a husband who works away from home but, I want you all to know that you have touched me in a way I could never put into words. Also I have gained a lot of knowledge that has helped my sister in law. Alaskadeb...I hope you feel as well as you can, Please know that are people out here saying prayers for you and hoping that you are home soon with your family. God Bless you. Michelle in the U.K.",
