I went in to have a stereotactic biopsy but they could not see the calcifications in the films while I was on the biopsy table. I next had an appointment to have a wire localization and a surgical biopsy. Well that could not be done either. The radiologist refused to do it saying he was afraid he may puncture my lung or rupture my implant. So now what are my options. The radiologist rated my mammo a birads 4. Has anyone else been in my position? Log in to post a reply",

I did contact the PS office and they said if your implant ruptures we can remove it but the Dr does not do breast biopsies. How are you doing?Â ",
