I had my 4th A/C today and my next drug was supposed to be Taxol for 4 treatments.  The doc gave me information derived from an article in Reuters Health dated 10-19-07.  It seems that Taxol may not be helpful for me due to my Dx.  Soooo, I've been researching for the past 2 hours trying to figure out the best course.  It was really a lot to absorb but I think I've come to the conclusion that Taxotere (no steroids required) might be a better choice for me.  I'll wait to discuss it with the doc, though. Hugs and prayers from Sharon. ",

I definitely need the Senokot and something for burping.  As I'm already overweight, I didn't like reading that gaining weight is another possibility. No migraine tonight, thankfully.  Had one with first chemo Monday, then the start of it on Tuesday evening, but not tonight.  I'm waiting for the pain to set in from the Neulasta shot I got on Tuesday - they said it could happen anywhere from 12 to 48 hours after the shot.  I do have some aches in the joints and hopefully it won't be more than that. It was good to hear from the ladies who are done with their treatment - lots of good suggestions.  Thanks to you both. Sharon ",

Sorry to hear about Paxton and Marietta going to the hospital.  Hope you are both OK now.  I've been thinking of ways to cuten up the little hats that the chemo center gives away (some wonderful people make and donate them).  I think they need something to give them some height and am thinking about adding flowers or ribbons to the top for that effect.  Will let you all know how this works and also if I get lots of laughs at their look. A little about me:  I live in Wisconsin, retired at 62, now 63.  We sold our home in 2004, and are living in an apartment.  This spring we started building our new home up north and hope to have it completed next summer.  I was up there most of the summer before I had to return to the Milwaukee area for chemo.  I am very thankful that God has shown his love and direction in so many ways along this journey - I couldn't have gotten this far without Him.  Sharon ",

Definitely call your doc about these side effects - they have lots of different options to help make you feel better. Good luck and I hope you get relief soon. Sharon ",

This is my first visit to this site and I must say it's been very informative.  I've written down lots of notes for my chemo doc. Thanks to all of you and I look forward to sharing the journey.",

Walgreens.  I just took the pill and do seem to be having some relief already. I must say I have sinus involvement as well - also not uncommon for me this time of the year.  Soooo, tomorrow I'm starting on Mucinex to get rid of the drainage that upsets the stomach.  I'm on the dose dense regimen as well (every 2 weeks).  I asked about Emla cream after they had already successfully placed the IV needle in my port (really astute of me, don't you think).  The nurse just sprayed some numbing agent on the port and I didn't feel a thing when she put in the needle.  She said you have to put the Emla cream on at least 1 hour before they place the needle.  Lucky for me the numbing agent worked well because I didn't have any Emla cream. Hi to Marietta and Paxton.  If I can get through this migraine and know what to do for future migraines, I'll be fine.  Thank you so much for your concern. If you guys see lots of \"edit\" notes, it's because I can't get used to pressing the return once for a paragraph.  I hit it twice and have to back space up to the correct distance. (just did it again).  Marietta, what is Maitake D-Fraction?  Also, I think I'll ask about Zantac because my food seems to be staying in my stomach and making lots of gurgling noises. Thanks again to everyone in the September group - I always learn something. Delachaum",

Was bummed about learning my sister-in-law has stage IIIC Uterine Cancer.  It just brings my own fears back to the forefront.  I'll be alright though. Marietta, saw your comment and wanted to let you know I've had a shot of Neulasta the day after each chemo treatment.  The only side effects they told me to expect were possible joint pain and to take tylenol, or if you need it, something stronger.  I did get the pain and it centers in my neck and head.  I was told it happens when you get a spike in your white blood cell count from the shot.  You may get more than one spike in the 2 weeks following the shot.  The pain isn't really that bad (for me).  A good thing is that my white cell count has been very high and I don't seem to be experiencing the mouth sores other people get (I think it might be because of the shot - not sure). Good luck to you and I'm sure you will do fine.   P.S.  I got my first angel gift package in the mail - what a great uplift. Sharon ",
