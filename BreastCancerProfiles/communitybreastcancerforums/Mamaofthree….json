She wouldn\u2019t say any opinions about what she thought it was. She scheduled my mammogram and ultrasound for the 14th of March because that\u2019s the soonest they could get me in. I guess my question is, is that a good sign they aren\u2019t rushing it? Or is that normal? Also I feel like if it were something serious it probably wouldn\u2019t be as big so fast or is that just wishful thinking? Also, does location of lumps matter? I\u2019m only 30, my grandmother had breast cancer but I was too young to know many details and she has since passed but that\u2019s my only history for that. I feel quite dumb for not doing exams like I should have been. Any information or advice would be great! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

This board is full of such supportive and knowledgeable people.I didn\u2019t think waiting would bother me and then it crept in. I guess I was hoping since it\u2019s on the inside of my breast not the outside that the chances of it being something were even more slim than the 1 in 8. I feel pretty good about my odds but my poor husband is stressed. He thinks that the odds aren\u2019t in my great. I guess it\u2019s hard because he is a firefighter/paramedic and sees worst case scenarios all the time. I wish I could make him more calm about it all.  ",
