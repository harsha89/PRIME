      "Content": "Aug 8, 2018 01:35AM - edited Aug 8, 2018 02:57AM by nosure After 10 days of tablets and observation, Lump which was like marble turned like bag of peas. Now when i touch, it feels like peas. (not like marble anymore) Its PAINLESS. Doctor said its firm, movable, bag of peas when touched. Surgeon asked for excision biopsy. he said even if its benign there is chance it grows. so better to remove full as early as possible. I have decided for surgery in another 5 days. Is there anything i should be worried? will there be breast deterioration? Am so worried about later consequences. will they remove my breast in any case during surgery? am so worried. am 23 year female. Please help me. -------------- Could you please tell what this report says (FNA) Microscopic features: A (right breast 3 X 3 cms ) - Smears show chiefly monomorphic loosely cohesive sheets of round to spindle shaped cells with round to oval bland nuclei, moderate to scant spindled eosinophilic cytoplasm, occasional foamy cytoplam seen. Focal plasmacytoid cells and mulinucleate giant cells seen. Few clusters of ductal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells seen against a background of RBCs, no evidence of atypia mitosesr /granuloma seen. B ( left 1 cms size ) - Smears are cellular and shows branching monolayered clusters of ductal and myoepithelial cells. Focal apocrine change noted. The background shows bare nuclei.",
