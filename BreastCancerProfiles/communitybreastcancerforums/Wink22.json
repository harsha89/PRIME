Mquara, can\u2019t wait to see those sprouts that you mentioned..so much emotional meaning attached to hair growing back. I just want to look like my old self again. We are going on a family holiday next week to Queensland, which is nice and warm at this time of year. Will be good for body and soul. iz1999, have you had your thyroid checked? A friend of mine had issues with hair thinning and was found to have thyroid problems that she then could take medication for. Hoping for an answer for you",

Feeling pretty nervous the last few a days about everything. I have confidence in my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon, but it is a 4 hour op which freaks me out a bit. I had two lumpectomies earlier this year that failed to get clean margins. Wlo002, I know what you mean about getting snappy and grouchy lately in the lead up to surgery. I felt like I handled things really well during chemo but for whatever reason I am more anxious now. I think that i will turn that energy towards packing for surgery. Good luck and healthy vibes to you all:) Wi",

Day 1 was no fun with a fair amount of pain but once my pain relief was sorted out I started to improve. Now moving around the ward and doing a lot more for myself today. I have 4 drains, one of which will come out tomorrow. I actually feel better than I thought that I would at this stage, I hope all who have had their ops are feeling well, healing vibes to all:",

The chemo monthly support boards here really helped me. Hoping for good news from here on in for you. I\u2019m going home tomorrow! Last two drains coming out tonight if all goes to plan. Can\u2019t wait to sleep in my own bed. I had a look at my chest today, not as scary as I thought it would be. I have aero expanders and the surgeon put a very small amount of air in during surgery, that plus the LD tissue is enough to make very small beginnings of boobs",
