Good luck tomorrow, Kathy - I think the waiting for all the info is much the worst part of this whole ordeal. Once you know, and can set a treatment plan, you start to feel like you have a little control back. It's also been heartening to read about the advances and better outcomes just in the last few years. We CAN kick its ass! I haven't got my BRCA results yet. One last piece of the \"how much to remove\" puzzle. Ugh...Crossing fingers for both of us.  Angela",

Doesn't it feel (a little bit) better to have the action plan under way? I remember feeling like at least I got a little control back when we started treating my first bout of DCIS. Waiting is hard! I can imagine you had to think long and hard about your options but I suspect I'd have made the same decision in your shoes - especially since the BS is right there with you.  Keep us posted, and I'll keep you posted. :) Angela ",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2009 09:53AM - edited Apr 2, 2009 10:13AM by Tabbygirl521 Kathy, you and I are in almost the same boat. My MRI showed what looks like a normal intramammary lymph node, but because it is near my just-diagnosed DCIS, they are going to biopsy it tomorrow morning. Once you're diagnosed, they check EVERYTHING, which is of course to our advantage, even if the waiting drives us insane. This is my first post to this site and I haven't added my dx info yet, but this is my second round of DCIS - left breast in 2005, NED as of last week, but now DCIS is in my right breast. They didn't do the MRI last time so just having it ordered this time freaked me out. But then I began to understand that they were taking additional screening precautions due to my history. I was even urged to have the BRCA screening (which I did) even though my family history doesn't seem to indicate anything...but I have a few female relatives I can't account for, so again, extra caution. I'm OK with it, but I am truly sick of not having enough answers to get going with treatment. ANYWAY! I understand right where you are, and I will be thinking about you! Angela PS, I just tried to add the dx info to my profile but I don't see a field for it - help?",

I just got back from my biopsy and the radiologist said, \"I think it probably is a normal lymph node...but\" of course they must check it out. He is the 3rd doctor not to sound dreadfully concerned, I know that can be false hope but this at least helps me from being completely stressed until the results come back Weds. I hope everyone is doing OK, and that we can all do at least a little relaxing and detaching over the weekend. We had sloppy snow today near Seattle but it finally went away and now we have a touch of sun.  Angela",

I work close to the treatment facility so would walk about a mile round trip to receive treatment. I generally kept up my usual activity level and I didn't notice fatigue until after I finished treatment - if I did anything strenuous, like a hike, I would just...run out of steam. I didn't feel short of breath or like I had sore muscles. It was like I just had to stop. And I wouldn't recover as quickly. It's hard to describe. I would say that diminished within about 6 months or so. Aside from this happening after a strenuous activity, I felt fine. I was 52 at the time. Oddly, my skin was just fine during treatment, too (aloe vera gel is my friend) but a few days after the last treatment, THEN it started to peel. It was kind of gross for a few days, then healed up quickly. So I think it's funny that I had my only issues AFTER tx. I'm about to go through this again shortly with my other breast, and I'm very curious to see how the experience goes this time around.",

I've had 4 lumpectomies in 4 years and the anesth always stopped by so they could get any info they needed from me when deciding what to give me. For example, I react very strongly to narcotics - they hit me like a ton of bricks and I hate the feeling they give me. They always accommodate this. If you tell them about the reaction or aftereffects you had, they should be able to figure out what to tweak in your cocktail. Whatever it is they do for me works - I wake up easily, feel great, and am hungry right away. My point is, someone there should be listening AND responding to your concerns.",

I had rads in 2005, also, and tx started 2 months and one day after surgery. I did really well - not much at all in the way of side effects - and I always wonder if the longer healing time helped.",

I haven't seen him again yet to schedule but I plan to ask a lot of questions; I have high hopes. From my reading, I gather that, in appropriate cases, IMRT is as, or more, effective than the standard longer period of treatments.

It all seemed very dramatic and bad-dreamlike, but in fact, it WAS just a cyst. So you can see that a lot of us had doctors who took the time to check us out very carefully - and then got an all-clear. I never like the idea of watching and waiting - if something's benign, I want the good news yesterday :) and if it;s not, of course we want to get cracking on treatment.

      "Content": "Jul 2, 2009 12:00PM - edited Jul 2, 2009 12:01PM by Tabbygirl521 Hi, Karen, I have had DCIS twice now, with 2 surgeries each time. I found I was more fatigued after my second surgery this time. It wasn't awful but I took a little longer to bounce back. One thing I also noticed is I was STARVING for days and I just went ahead and ate my head off. It may have helped :)  I felt completely back to normal within a week or so. But as others say, it's not uncommon to be fatigued - the anesthesia gets ya, the shock (mental and physical) can get ya. Oddly, if you can stay active, that seems to help. I had rads on my left side 4 years ago - I may be unusual but my breast looks and feels just as it did before (well, except for the divot!). It had the weird polygonal suntan for a bit and the skin broke a little after my last tx but when all was done, it was back to normal. I'll be starting rads again on 7/20 and am curious to see if the experience differs much; it's the other breast but basically the identical dx as last time.",
