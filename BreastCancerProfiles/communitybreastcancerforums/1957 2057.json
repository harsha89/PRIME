He said the surgery area does not have good blood flow because of scaring and the regular dose of radiation does not work as well in that area that is why the boost with a higher power. Made sense but my mind was hearing bacon frying. I hope to get my first treatment appointment next week, I know it may sound strange but am glad to get started. I can handle anything if I know what it is and how much, guess I need to see the goal line. When I had my MRI they measured my cancer at .4cm so I was pleased. After surgery the pathology measured it at .9cm so then I was scared. I waited for a month for my Oncotype which came back at 18. Just over the line for chemo and my cancer was .9 cm which was just under the line. My surgeon sent me to the MO and I was so nervous for 2 weeks till that appointment, she said no chemo for you, I just cried. Although I was glad to not have to do chemo I am still nervous and hoping the radiation and hormones will keep me from hearing the \"C\" word in the future. So far I can't say enough good about my surgeon and both of the oncologists that I have seen. They are so patient and caring. My husband has been my rock. My faith has kept me calm through all this. I am grateful that I do not carry the gene to pass this on to my 2 girls or my 4 grand daughters. I can't say enough good about this site and the boards where everyone shares what their treatment is and how it is going. It has been the quiet thing I have done to keep me sane through all the waiting and not knowing. I feel so much better prepared for my treatment from reading everyone's comments, thank you all. The past 2 months I felt like an airplane circling the runway without direction from the tower. Now I feel as though I have landed and am coming home. My mind has been numb like this is not happening to me. Every time the doctors tell me something I must have the strangest look on my face. I work full time and plan on my treatments not interfering with my work schedule. I am hoping for early appointments so I can go in a bit late and work a bit late. My boss is the best and will work with me on it. I know I could take the time off if needed but working and keeping thing as normal as I can will help me more. Boy now this has been a long post, sorry for rambling on. Have a great New Year's day all. I hope you all enjoy family and friends today. Helen    ",

Got the call from the rad nurse Thursday. Here is the strange thing, he explained the first time I will have 5 xrays then the RO will review those then a regular treatment, 2 xrays and my treatment. Why 2 more xrays I ask? Well you get 2 with every treatment to assure positioning on the table. I don't know why but this really bothered me. I mean heck I am getting all this radiation why do 2 xrays a day bother me? I told my husband by the time I am done he won't need a night light I should give off a glow. I also opted to participate in a study of 2 cremes, Curcumin and HPR Plus. Of course there is a third one which is a placebo. Told my sister to pray for me that I at least get one that isn't the placebo, it will probably be butter - haha. I thought hey it might help me feel like I was doing some good while going through this. Maybe the results of the test will better help someone down the road lessen their SE's. Whatever I get I am to use 3 times a day starting from treatment 1, nothing 4 hours before treatments. I get to schedule all my treatments Tuesday as well. Hoping for very early am appointments so I don't have to come and go from work. I plan on taking my gel ice pack with me and putting it on afterwards over my clothes on my way to work. I am hoping it will cool the top layer of skin enough after to maybe help lessen my SE, I have heard so much about the cooling cloths. Shaved my armpit for the last time yesterday, RO said I should not shave it during radiation. He said it would just be more stress on my skin. I still feel sometimes like this is all not happening to me that I will wake up tomorrow and think wow what a crazy dream that was. Best wishes to everyone for next week, I hope you all have relaxing trips to this crazy tanning bed. Thank you everyone for all your comments and information, why they call this a support group I don't know as it is so much more than that. Helen    ",

I just had my 3 year mammogram and got an all clear. I still am seeing my oncologist every 6 months now. I take arimidex. Last year at this time I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer so I had surgery to remove it, one parathyroid and 15 lymph nodes. They found papillary cancer in 5 lymph nodes so in February this year I had to do radioactive iodine treatment. The worse part of that was living in my bedroom for 5 days. I am happy to say I am doing well, minor complaints but nothing I can't live with. I may have the energy of a slug but I am happy to get through every day.

Not sure what my center does when you are done but you can bet I will be skipping out that door when I finish.

Hope to get it back to normal on my own, sure don't need to have another pill to take. Hope everyone has a great rest of their week.

My ceiling has the pretty pink flowered trees as well, must have been the standard sell when they designed our rooms......

Got my special cream for the trial I am doing. It is the color of popcorn oil, I jokingly asked the nurse if it had butter in it to help me fry, lol. Smells like it has aloe in it so at least that is good and more of a gel than a cream, not greasy at all. I could feel the radiation, strange feeling not burning but there was a feeling in my breast. Area was tender later in the morning but feels fine now. Had a headache after but think that could have been the stress of the day. Anyhow yeah at least I am starting, 1 down 32 more to go... Oh got one more tattoo. 4 total now. Keep hearing the song in my head of Lydia the tattooed lady. Husband said he will let me know if I start to give off a glow. He is so ornery, keeps my spirits up. My nurse said no lotion 4 hours before or 4 hours after. I had heard before but never after..  Best of luck to all those finishing and those starting this week.

Geeze I was a mess there for about 3 weeks. Skin under arm broke down and the entire side of my breast where I had the boosts. I was lucky, no infections or bleeding just lost layers of skin. I walked around in a scarecrow pose for about a week and a half trying to let the area dry out. I now have all new skin so that part is great, still feels like the new skin is so thin, makes me afraid I will scratch it and rip it. No underarm hair yet, I think this is the one good SE. I have had quite a bit of itching in the side of my breast and figure that is from the healing so I rub that lightly. Excuse my bluntness but the skin on my nipple feels tough/thick. No problems with it. I am noticing soreness now in my breast that I did not have before, I assume healing as well but it seems like the tissue (not skin) inside is getting dense in areas. Not a lump or anything just kind of a firmness. Is anyone else experiencing this 2 months out from Radiation? I am so proud of all you ladies and yes myself too. I can't believe that I made it through surgery & radiation. I am about 8 weeks into the Arimidex, this past week the hot flashes at night have been horrible. Not too bad through the day but I am up like 4 times a night with them. I do have a bit of soreness in my knees and shoulders but nothing I can't live with. I am glad our weather is getting nice as I am getting back in to walking. I have gained 10 pounds since starting the meds. That needs to stop right now... I worked all through radiation, am proud to say I never missed. That was somehow important to me that this not disrupt my \"normal\" daily life. Fatigue was awful near the end. I was in bed by 7 pm most nights, now I can make it till about 8:30. Mother's Day was great, I made it through without a tear..... Proud of me. Sorry to drone on, glad everyone is managing. Please let me know if you are experiencing the dense breast tissue. Helen       ",

Last week was my first full week of rads so finished with #9. Thought I was doing good but Thursday I hit the fatigue wall. Have been resting as much as possible to hopefully stay ahead of it but bamm. Last 3 days I have been going to bed way early and slept well but still feel as if I can nap at the drop of a hat. I sure hope the weekend sets me straight, I don't want this to be worse. I have been hydrating to the point where I am spending more time in the bathroom than any room in the house, lol. Does anyone have any good diet tips that help with fatigue? I am eating healthy but would welcome any advise to keep this at bay. I plan on working full time all the way through but if this gets much worse I don't know that I will make it. Next week will have me seeing 1/3 way through all treatments and also 1/2 through my 25 full breast. It does seem to be going pretty fast. Other SE are not bad, little tender in the breast and notice a little tenderness in the rib area. Skin is doing well so glad of that. Once again hats off to all the soldiers in this war, we will beat this enemy. Helen  ",

Underarm has 2 spots and under breast has a line in the fold that are very red. Feels like rug burn and starting to seep just a bit. RO feels it will be fine. Just praying it doesn't get too much worse before I finish these last 4. Will be so glad when those are done and I can start healing. Been using the gel I have from the study and poofing cornstarch on it. Got a little emotional today when he said oh it's fine. I feel like I am overreacting but thinking how bad can it get. I am ok if I keep my arm up and the air gets to it. Looks like a bad diaper rash, lol. Hope everyone's week is going well. Husband has a cold so I told him I am not sleeping with him, don't want him breathing his germs on me :) All I need is that cold and I will be a basket case. Thanks for this site and allowing me to rant.... Helen  ",
