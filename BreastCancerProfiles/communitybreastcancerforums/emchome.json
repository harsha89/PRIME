It wasn't due to a plugged bile duct - checked that with an ultrasound. We suspect it was due to a chemo I was on (Gemzar) but my liver is full of tumors so can't be sure. I went on Carboplatin as it is processed by the kidneys and in the 5 weeks I've been on it (and Herceptin), my bilirubin has come down to just under 3 and I don't have yellow skin and eyes. Hopefully the Doxil will do the same for you. Take care, Evelyn",
