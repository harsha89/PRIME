If I had then I think I would have done things differently. And I also went through the treatment feeling it was a bad decision, but at the time I was overwhelmed. I try to keep pressing forward and not think about what\u2019s done, but I occasionally have a bad day and the regret comes rushing back. I still have swelling and discomfort from the rads which is a constant reminder of my decision. So for now, I am trying to keep my body as healthy as possible with diet, exercise and supplements. I don\u2019t worry as much as I did right after I was done and with time I think it will continue to get better. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime! I completely understand what you are feeling and I hope with time you will find peace in your decision. Btw...will you be starting tamoxifen?",

I\u2019m not sure what your plan is, but about halfway through my 21 treatments my skin started getting pink and I felt my breast was swelling. I started using Emu Oil and it was amazing! You would never even know I had radiation unless you look closely. I know everyone has their preferred lotion, etc., but keep Emu Oil in mind if you have trouble finding something that works.",

I'm 46yo and just finished 16 full breast radiation treatments and 5 boosts and am having regrets. I made it through the treatment with flying colors...very minimal skin irritation and breast pain and virtually no fatigue, but just recently learned about a long term side effect that I can't believe I missed. I research EVERYTHING to exhaustion and I am kicking myself that I missed this. I'm losing sleep over the chance of a secondary cancer occurring(sarcoma) from the radiation. So much that it's making me physically ill. I admit that I was told very briefly that it's very rare and a very low risk and when I asked how it's treated I was told by a mastectomy, but she never told me the prognosis is poor. I don't know why I didn't look it up, but my doctor made it seem like it wasn't a big deal at the time and I was overwhelmed. I felt like she was more concerned over heart and lung damage because I have small breasts than the secondary cancer. So here I am in tears wondering how I missed this important piece of information. I think if I had looked it up I would have opted for a mastectomy, but now it's too late. Can someone please help me ease my fears. If I could have a mastectomy now to prevent the sarcoma I would, but I'm sure it's too late and the damage has been done. I hope I don't sound silly, but I just can't stop crying over this revelation. Thanks in advance for your support! Log in to post a reply",
