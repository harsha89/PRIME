And I regreted it. Those three together made me very, very ill. So I ended up having one round of TAC and then 5 rounds of TC. I am 7 months PFC and my hair has fully grown in!",

She is one of the best known and busiest oncologists here in SA and out of all her patients she only had one from taxotere. She did however say, that permanent hair loss can occur with other treatments as well,  not just tax.-- or if you have been treated several times and hair has fallen several times--but it is very, very rare!!   While I was shopping today I noticed in the Aveda store window they have this new system for thinning hair--comparable to Nioxin I would guess--so I bought it!! Like Aveda fashion, it smelled yummy! We shall see how it works!",

This is to encourage anyone that had thinning hair before chemo and is worried about how or if hair is going to come back.  My hair was thinning before chemo, and almost four months later most of my hair that I had and quite possibly then some has grown back. It is hard to tell because it is only an inch or so long, but it actually seems thicker!   The first few months were torturous and with many tears waiting and wondering if it was going to come in. It came in very weirdly, as my top and back came in first, and I kid you not-- in mohawk fashion!!  My sides/temples were the last to fill in and remained bald until the three/three and a half months pfc. Now four months pfc I have coverage all over and it gets better and better daily!  I just wanted to put this out there because I know that I would appreciated some encouragement while waiting for regrowth. Just because your hair was thinning before chemo doesn't mean that it won't come back, and maybe it will come back even better than before!!!",
