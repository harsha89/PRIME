I considered going on tamoxifen -- I have a strong family history breast cancer -- but chose not to.  This past January, I was diagnosed with ILC, IDC and DCIS in my left breast -- had a partial mastectomy and will be following up with chemo, radiation and hormone therapy.  I'm not saying that this would not have happened if I took the tamoxifen, but I do wonder sometimes.",

Has anyone here undergone CMF?  It would be great to have a \"real world\" view on this. Thanks!!  Dx 1/19/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
