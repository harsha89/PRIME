They helped me more than you could know. \"We will not hold in sorrow long that she is gone but rather rejoice that she was here.\" Rest in peace sweet Mommy. With love and admiration, Susie",

Soccermom, Momma started her WBR on Monday of last week and does not seem to be tolerating the treatment well at all. She is very nauseous - all the time. She told me the other day that just having me near her brings her comfort. So yes, I am thankful I'm close and get to see her everyday. Most of my free time is spent just laying in bed next to her as she sleeps. Gg085, I hear you and understand completely. This is about supporting her - period. Right now I am using the strength she gave me and taught me to stand up for her as her advocate with the doctors because she cannot do it for herself. Refusing to accept their answer that there is nothing else they could do for the nausea. I was told, \"We are giving her the best medicine there is.\" My response, \"It may be the best medicine, but it is not the best for her, please, can we try something else?\" The doctor wrote her a different script yesterday, as of last night it seems to be working - yay! My father is so amazing. Their love is so strong and to see her suffering is horribly painful for him. He asks me a lot of questions about what is the right course considering her overall health and quality of life and whether or not to do chemo immediately after radiation. I can't answer those questions because they are not mine to answer. All I can do is be there to hear the information from the doctors and relate it back. \"The decision to continue or not to continue has to be Moms. The only other person I feel has a right to an opinion about it is you Daddy. And, whatever the decision is, I will fully support.\" If love could cure this insidious illness she would be well. Alas it cannot. She is my primary focus and I will continue to show up, continue to wipe her tears, and continue loving her, and him, through this. Cherishing each moment as the precious gift it is. MOX, my heart binds with yours in your loss - ouch! There are no words to describe this journey - Thank you for sharing your story. We may not be able to stop this but this will not stop us. It will only strengthen our love. We will continue to walk with her through every single step filling her with as much laughter and joy as we can. She continues to teach me about courage and I will continue to honor her as the warrior she is! Thank you again for the kind words, suggestions, and support. Love and light beautiful warriors!

She had found a lump about a month ago, we were awaiting the results of the biopsy when she was rushed to the hospital because of difficulty breathing. They discovered she had blood clots in her lungs and was admitted to the hospital. During her stay they ran a bizillion tests. The tests revealed that the cancer has spread to several different places chest wall, spleen, adrenals, lymph and 12 brain mets. She was released from the hospital a couple days ago. She had her first appointment with her primary Dr. yesterday and appointments are set with the oncologists on Monday and Tuesday to find out exactly what we are looking at and the course of treatment. So far two doctors have told me they suggest, looking at the whole picture, hospice to keep her as comfortable as possible. however, the oncologists suggest treatment and says he believes the can manage it. So at this point to say that we are terrified is a huge understatement. My parents met 52 years ago Yesterday and will celebrate 52 years of marriage in October. Mom is 70 and has the spirit of a champion boxer. With the exception of a bad headache and weakness from the clots (which are resolving and we are told no longer a threat) she is not experiencing any other symptoms. Dad is 73 and is the most amazing man in the world. I live near my parents and am so grateful to be close so that I can be there for both of them daily. I am doing my best to remain hopeful and positive but remain realistic with the whole picture. There are still so many unanswered questions. I joined this site to gain knowledge on how I can best support my Mommy (and Daddy) through this. I know that courage is never absent of fear and we are doing our best to face this and not allow the fear to overwhelm us. Your stories and strength have had me in tears of sadness and triumph for a few days as I am struggling to hold onto to hope. It is not my intention to offend any of you beautiful courageous women by posting this and I am cheering for all of you. Love and light. Log in to post a reply",
