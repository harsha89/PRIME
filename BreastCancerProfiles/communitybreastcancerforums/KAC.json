Wait, gets better,had my pre-op testing today and had to wait over an hour before they took me back and all I had to do was paperwork, you know, health history and stuff like that.  Wouldn't surprise me if I have to do it again on Tuesday when I get there.  I had bloodwork done at the Dr. last month and I had told them this when I made the appointment. Best thing of the day, DH took me out to the beach for dinner!  It was great and refreshing.  Of course, then we stopped for dessert at Perkins on the way home.  Had a hot fudge cookie sundae. It was awesome.  I'll just have to be good the rest of the week. tomorrow will be a better day.",

All along, Dr. kept saying I wouldn't need chemo, then, wham, the oncotypedx came back at 27.  she said she was really surprised by this and wanted me to do ATC and then Femara.  Radiation was out of the question since I already had the TE in.  My hubby and I talked for days about what to do and decided to get a second opinion.  Well, same recommendation to start but after talking with me a while Dr. said I could just do the TC regimen and then Femara.  Going over the chart from the oncotypedx test I had a 17% chance of distant recurrence.  This was the number using Tamoxifen vs chemo. When I questioned about Femara supposedly being better and to give me numbers for that, the chance went down to 8%.  Adding chemo would take it down to 4%.   After a lot of thinking, writing lists of pros and cons, reading, and discussing I decided not to do the chemo and take the Femara.  Have been on that for about 3 weeks now.  Will have my final reconstruction surgery on the 15th. YEAH!  Have been keeping positive attitude and I think it really does help recovery.  Looking forward to 2010(and my new chest). Thanks for letting me vent here.  Have to go to work now. ",
