DX on Nov 1st with DCIS on RB, had a  RBMX on Dec.9, found there was lymphnode involvement (1 of 17 not too bad)... Im involved in a clinical trial for Herceptin. Traditionally I would be categorized as HER2-, however there is a slight elevation on that cell. I will be on AC chemo for 6 rounds and herceptin for 12. Normally they wouldnt do the herceptin in low or negative HER2 patients but the study wants to determine wether it will give me edge over traditional care.  Is anyone else involved in this study? Any suggestions on how to deal with the before and after of the first day of chemo? Much appreciated Miriam",
