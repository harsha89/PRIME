Had a Lumpectomy and 2 lymph nodes removed on 5-30-18. Invasive tumor was 1.5 cm. Both nodes were positive for cancer, so next step is a cat scan to make sure it hasn't spread anywhere else and then begin chemo. Just writing all this down gives me the willies, but this is my new reality. Before my 2nd mammogram in April, I had no idea anything was even wrong. I'd been told after my 1st mammogram, something 'suspicious' had been found. Biopsy was done on May 7. I hope my cat scan will be ok Dx 5/11/2018, DCIS/IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 2/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Surgery 5/29/2018 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Underarm/Axillary Chemotherapy 7/15/2018 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",

Waiting to hear from my doctor's office about when I can get a cat scan. Called Monday and was told they'll let me know as soon as my insurance approves it..grr Patience has never been one of my virtues. Lol The treadmill has been my faithful friend in helping to keep me sane through all this. I always feel better after my 3 miles on it,almost every day. Physically I'm feeling great, just ready to get to the next step and get that dang scan over with. Already got a few pretty beanie caps for when I lose my hair. Took 2 days to get them out of my mailbox, but I got er done eventually :-) Rose",

Yeah, it's terrifying thats for sure. My doctor had kinda made me feel confident it hadn't spread to the lymph nodes and I'd probably only have to do radiation, but it is what it is. This waiting is the hardest part..not knowing what is going on inside of me. I just wanted to say thanks for posting here and good luck to you as well! Reading this thread has helped me too.
