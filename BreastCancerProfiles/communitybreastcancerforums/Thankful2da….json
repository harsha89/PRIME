Mt physical therapist told me the recliner was my enemy! I am 17 days post op and still get stiff and sore, but ha e been sleeping in my bed since last Tuesday. Make sure you try to pull your shoulders back. Its natural to roll them forward as a guarding, but that only makes them tighter. Good exercises are \"snow angels\" while laying flat and putting your hands behind you head and do \"butterflies\" and try to touch your elbows to the bed. (Kind of like sitting with your feet together sole to sole and pushing your knees to the floor while keeping your feet together) I don't know if anyone told you this either, but when you take a shower, tie a shoelace around your waist and hook the drains to that! Good luck to you and God bless!! Dawn",

My left breast is pretty bruised, as the PS had to nip and tuck it....and I actually rubbed a blood blister under the right one! Go figure! I think it was from the ace wrap and working all day.  I am sore, and still can't sleep. I guess I expect too much too soon??  Mama, as far as squishies........they are not! At least, not yet! The implants are 500cc, and sit pretty high! Not as high as the TE's, but they need to settle into the pocket and that could take some time. I start back at PT next Friday and can't wait! My shoulders ache, and my chest hurts.  I'm sorry for complaining...........I feel like such a heel sometimes, because I should be thanking God every day (which I do), that I didn't have to endure any chemo and/or radiation with all of the surgery.  Thank you all so very much for your support!! You all have helped me so very much through all of this! I reccommend this site to all my patients!!  God bless each and every one of you!!!",

I know I'm only DCIS, but should I ask them to do an Oncotype to be sure? It's not that I want chemo, but I just want to know I'm going to be around for my 2 year old!

The sponge should be cut to the size of, or a little bit smaller than the wound, never bigger! When it gets turned on, breathe through it because that can be a bit painful as the sponge is \"sucked\" down into the wound. Once its flat, you should have no pain and it should hold at a constant pressure!! Good luck!!",

I thought I would be able to sleep on my side right away, but the tissue expanders really hurt. What you have to realize is just because the drains are out, you still have a \"raw open space\" on the inside where the drains were, and it will be tender for a couple of days. I can now sleep on my side! For those of you that don't know this, you are entitled to breast prosthetics, bras, and wigs (cranial prosthetics), by law when you have breast cancer! Make sure you push your Drs to write the prescriptions for them! If you have not started PT after the TE placement, I know they teach the walking up the wall, but you need to try to have your arms at your sides and then lift them out like you are going to fly. That is where the tightness is going to be in the muscle! I found this out the hard way! I could lift both my arms straight out and up in front of me and the the PT pulled my arm out and I lost it! She said surgeons never tell women to stretch the other way, so I figured I would share that tidbit of info! :) Oh, there are also post op bras that zip up the front and have Velcro pouches on the inside to hold your drains in so you don't have to pin them to anything! If anyone has questions please ask and if I don't know I will find out for you!! You are all doing great and are constantly in my prayers! Love and gentle hugs to you all! Dawn",

It's funny, I was going to ask my PS if we could do this in our operating room instead of exam room and he said this evening, \"You know, I would rather do this in the OR because I will have better light and it's more sterile than the exam room! :) Great minds think alike I suppose! Lol (Tparksprof) I am so sorry you are going through this, my heart aches for you! I am saying extra prayers that you heal quickly! Having worked in wound care for 6 years, I can honestly say the vac is an amazing thing and you will be surprised at the results it produces! It helps so much to speed up the healing process! Good luck to you sweetie!! ((Pat)) I know this is everyone's own decision that they have to make, but after working in an oncology clinic for 7 years, I saw many women that decided to do a unilateral mastectomy, went through chemist/radiation or both, only to have it come back in the other breast! I am not trying to scare you or make you feel worse, but I know that when I worked there I always said if I ever got breast cancer both breasts would go because I didn't want to give the cancer anything to come back to. Mine was only DCIS, and a few docs thought it was a bit overkill for double mastectomy bit I knew that I would not be able to sleep at night thinking about it coming back, especially since my diagnostic mammogram was negative just 4 months prior!! Do your research and ask TONS of questions!! Working for my PS has been so helpful as well because I have heard his take on things. Not only will you have more of a symmetry by having both taken off, but even he says from an oncology standpoint, it would put more women's minds at ease. He told me that he has had 12 cases of the \"good\" breast coming back positive for cancer as well. Not that many since he has done hundreds of recontructions, but it is something to think about!! Whatever you decide, God bless you and I will be praying for you!! Maureen, thank you so much for all you do with keeping up on all of us!! You are a true angel!! Love, prayers, and hugs to you all!!

There is a resin for everything that happens, even when we don't understand why!! I'm so sorry you are having such a hard time!! I have had that same feeling, but I know that I am going through this for a very special reason to help other women! I am 4 weeks post op today (by the way, the excision went very well under local! Didn't even feel the needle and it was very superficial!) I still have what feels like a boulder sometimes in my left armpit where they did the node dissection. Keep going to pt to help work those trouble ares out! Know that you are loved and thought of daily by us and we are here for encouragement!! Hugs to you!! ((((Carrie)))) I am so sorry to hear of your journey and your Mother and Brother with what they have gone through! Will be praying for an easier time for you and your family!! The drains were the worst part of all of this, so I feel you on that one! :( One day at a time and sometimes we have to take it one hour at a time!! Hope those drains come out soon for you!! Hope everyone has a little less pain this weekend!! Prayers to you all! Dawn",
