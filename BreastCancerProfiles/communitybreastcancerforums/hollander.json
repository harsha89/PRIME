Looking for a bright spot here.... my hair has been thinning on the faz and aromasin. MO said it will probably start growing back on xeloda :) . I'll be posting over on the xeloda page, but would appreciate any suggestions, advise, etc. that you all might have. I like to be prepared and think I need to shop for some chemo SE remedies this week, but don't know where to start... Thanks for all of your support and encouragement.

At my monthly appt. on 10/10 for Faslodex and Zometa, my labs came back with tumor markers up to 94 (had been 68 5 weeks before). I was on Faslodex for 5 months before my tumor markers even rose beyond the \"normal\" range, so seeing them jump that much is a new thing for me. Also, my liver numbers were both elevated, and they've never been anything but normal. I'd been on vacation the week before, and had a few margaritas that I don't normally drink, and I'd taken 2 lortabs for pain the day before my appt., but I don't think any of that should be enough to cause the liver increase. I've been having abdominal area pain, but my last scan 3 months ago didn't show anything but stable lung mets (small nodlues) and a very small area of activity on my pubic bone. My ribs have been feeling sore, and I have occasional pain in my lower back and mid-spine. It's so hard to know what's cancer pain and what's SE's. Advil is usually enough to lessen the pain when I have it. This cancer is supposed to be slow growing, and not aggressive based on the path report back in Feb. But if I have even more bone mets and new liver mets, how can it be slow growing?? Maybe I should ask slow compared to what?!? I asked my MO's nurse if it liver mets, what medication can I expect, and she said they are not even thinking that it's liver mets, so I shouldn't be, either. So I have to wait for the report, and for my MO to return to the office a week from today. I have a almost a whole week to wait. And worry. And all the busy days at work, pretty weather, nice walks, appreciating every day and positive thoughts won't change a thing. As much as try to think positively about long-term planning for everything, news like this (or potential news, at this point) brings those dreams crashing down. I try to keep it real for my family without freaking them out (scan+ new activity= new treatment plan), but my heart just breaks when I think about the long term reality. Unless some new wonderful cure comes along, it feels like each new scan brings news that robs me of time that I thought I would have. My sweet mom always says not to worry about things you can't do anything about, so technically I shouldn't worry until I meet with the MO next Monday. But I just don't have a good feeling about this. All that being said, reading about those of you who've had luck with treatment for assorted mets does reassure me, so thanks for posting on all of those threads. You give hope when it's hard to find anywhere else!! And thanks for sending prayers my way-- I need as many as I can get!!!

Results are a good news (in my mind, anyway), bad news combination. Good news first. My lung nodules are inactive, and didn't light up at all. No new bone activity, and the one area that showed up last time hadn't changed. Apparently the pain I've had in my side has been caused by a fractured rib that I didn't know I had. Who knows how that happened-- haven't fallen, haven't had a bad cough. The PA emphasized that there was no cancer in my ribs. I had a normal bone density test in August, before I started Aromasin, so who knows. Can't do anything for it anyway, and the pain isn't constant. So it seems that the the weird wandering aches and pains I've been having are either SE related or just aging related. I can deal with that. But now I wonder if a PET scan is the best for showing bone mets? The bad news... I have a new spot on my liver, approx, 1 cm by 2 cm. The PA was really surprised. Even though my liver numbers were up some on my blood work, she wasn't expecting to find a met there. But my tumor marker was up, too, and the liver activity does explain that. She thinks the MO may want to biopsy it to see where it came from, since I've been on anti-hormonals. I asked her what the next treatment might be, and she said depending on the liver biopsy, it could be xeloda. Yikes. I've been in the stage IV club since February, and I hate to think we're already looking at one of the big guns. It seems weird that each scan is showing that treatments are taking care of what has shown up on the previous scan, but there's progression somewhere else. We are really playing whack-a-mole!! I hope whatever treatment comes next will slow this beast down. I feel good right now and haven't had to change my routine-- still work 40+ hours a week, take care of the house and yard, etc. I am worried about how xeloda might change all of this. I would be most grateful for any suggestions or advice any of you who have been down this path might have. I was on Femara for 5 years, so that's not an option. Are there other hormonals that might work, or is a chemo really the next step? I'd love to have some info from your experiences when I have my appt. on Monday morning. Thanks again for all of your kind thoughts and prayers-- they help me know I will get through whatever comes next in this journey.",

I've been lucky with xeloda, knock on wood!!  My main problem has been some hand and foot syndrome, but I moisturize and that helps with the peeling and dryness.  Neutrogena foot cream is great, and I also use Vanicream.  My dermatologist likes coconut oil, but you definitely need to wear socks since it's so greasy.  I've had some occasional abdominal pain (like gas pain, not nausea), and Gas-X usually takes care of that.  I loaded up on side effect remedies before I took the first dose, and haven't needed most of them.  But it helps to know that I have them, just in case.  Be sure to take xeloda with food, or within 30 minutes of eating, and drink a big glass of water when you take it.  I hope I can continue on it since it's been pretty easy for me.  I hope it works well for you, and treats you gently! ILC is such a weird little beasty.  My MO has described mine as \"indolent but persistent\".  So far, each treatment has taken care of the most recent progression, but has allowed another one to pop up somewhere else.  It really is like playing a game of whack-a-mole!  Let us know how you're doing.  Saying prayers and sending (((hugs))) to you. ",

Unfortunately.  As fas as weight gain, I've gained about 10 lbs. since 2/13, and it's been more a case of the \"creeping pudge\".  Some of it may be meds related, some may be ice cream related :).  I know it's not alcohol related, since I rarely have a drink.  I miss it some, but like to think that I'm helping my liver out.

Looking forward to parents' weekend with my daughter this weekend- big football game, tailgate fun, and time with my DD and her friends.  It should be a good distraction as I wait for results, which always take a few looooooooong days.  Sending (((hugs))) to all of you!",

My liver numbers were finally back in the normal range at last month's appt.  I should get my results from Thursday's labs tomorrow.  Fingers crossed that everything is still normal, and TM's are closer to normal.  I hope your MO and PCP can give you some good news!",
