I am still so unsure and confused about doing something that will make me so poorly. I can't get my mind into a space that accepts that I have to have something so toxic. I,m trying but keep coming up against a wall of resistance and despair . How do u get t o a place where u can accept having chemo especially when u feel perfectly healthy?????

I feel tired after a normal day looking after my 14month old never mind if I am sick. All these Questions keep going thro my mind so many uncertainties when I start chemo so many unknown side effects an possible problems. These seem so huge and alien, I keep thinking the cancer has been removed should I have chemo because the cancer cells might be there. I feel sick just thinking about the 31st oct. I know there is a possibility the cancer will come back and I don't want this but this is a possibility chemo side effects are a definite. I feel so low and lost as to how I get through this.
