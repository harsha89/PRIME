    "Content": "Mar 22, 2017 04:25PM - edited Mar 22, 2017 04:31PM by Botgirl I could use some help since neither MO I've seen has answered this- what is the likelihood of developing ER /PR positive tumor if my core biopsy is ADH ER/PR negative and my lumpectomy was benign so no further tests were done on the later. My MO has put me on anastrozole recently with some concerning side effects. She feels that the sample size was too small for correct hormone testing on the core biopsy. Should I get a second pathology opinion",
