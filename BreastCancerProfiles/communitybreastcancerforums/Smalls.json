That new 4 runner sounds great.  I know you will enjoy.  We are not so overwhelmed with evaluation stuff.  Our complaint is with this new reading intervention stuff, passed down from NCLB and the state.  We have a literacy leader dictating when we do this and that without giving us time to do any one thing really well, and without all the materials.  I am working myself crazy these days and getting no where fast.  But we will survive and it will all work out I am sure.

I hope this finds everyone doing okay.  I have completed the next part of the reconstruction.  I am glad to have that done.  It is healing well and I return to  see dr. on the 6th of March. How about this flu stuff in East TN?  Anybody else out of school for this?  I've enjoyed my time off, but our kids sure have been sick.  Bless their hearts.  I hope they get well soon. It would be great to hear from folks. Take care. Janet",

How about that men's game today??  Wow, that was great!  I have high hopes for our Lady Vols tonight.  Tomorrow is an early day back to work so I probably won't stay up for the game.  I hope this post finds everyone doing well.  Carol, Sherry, and others how are you all doing?  I am doing well.  I have had my nipple reconstruction done and will be getting the tatto in June.  My appointment with the surgeon for my mammogram, ultrasound, and check up is in April.  I am looking forward to getting that done and over with for the next 6 months time period.  Bonny, hang in there.  I hope you feel better soon.  Take care of yourself. Happy Easter to all!  God Bless Janet ",
