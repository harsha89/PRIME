I had the surgery Nov 19.  I am glad that I did although I'm still fairly sore (they did reconstruction at the same time).  My pathology was negative.  You could argue that the surgery was not needed as the pathology was negative but...the only way to know is to have the surgery.   I will have a scan in Jan to see how the lung mets are doing.",
