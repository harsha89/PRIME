And as I lay there I kept thinking over and over and over \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this!\u201d Reading everyone\u2019s posts helps keep me from throwing in the towel. But I had a week from hell - had a Zometa infusion Tuesday, which made me feel I had been in a car accident - no way did 20 weeks of chemo make that SE feel like nothing!!! The next day 1st Rads and I felt nauseated and nearly fainted, but was told nausea was not from Rads (yet I feel it just after each Rads, so hmmmm.... thankfully, it goes away.) pulled myself up by my bootstraps and worked from home all day... emotional? Heck yes! I was wondering about dosage, so thanks for the explanation, Palesa2018. Curious if the tightening I\u2019m feeling in my skin is because it\u2019s starting to burn or psychosomatic. Time will tell. My docs told me to use any cream I was already using (except any with alcohol) including coconut oil, etc. and not get anything special. Fingers crossed! Spoonie77, thanks for posting the exercises. I feel like I should have gotten something like that. This has been a long hard road since I was dx\u2019d a year ago July. I am so tired! Working full time at a stressful job doesn\u2019t help. Having a community of ladies like you all does help. I am grateful. Love and hugs to you, my sisters.",

Based on recommendations, I cover it with saran wrap and tape it up with first aid tape, making sure a big glob of cream covers the whole bump- easily a quarter size. The wrap doesn't come off until the nurse is ready to access the port. All I feel is a small pressure of the needle going in - maybe a slight prick. I believe that my port is placed lower under the skin than some because my BS prefers to slide it under a layer of fat whereas most are just under the skin. Don't know if that means more need for longer coverage of Emla, but even those of you who have it just under the skin could do the same saran wrap treatment.",
