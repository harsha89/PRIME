I'm most worried right now that I'll have to cancel a family vacation that we've been planning for over a year that will begin on March 31st! Talk about bad timing! So, #1 question to ask my doc is to biopsy or not biopsy before that date. Although I expect he'll suggest to do so beforehand.",

I guess as much as you will yourself to think positive and remember statistics are on your side, your subconscious thoughts get the best of you!",

The internet is such a wonderful resource; it's like joining an instant support group. Years ago, people would have to leave their home and rarely would people in my situation who have yet not been diagnosed one way or the other be able to get advice from so many other people who have or are going through a similar situation. It's very comforting.",

I don't really attribute any of the office equipment to causing cancer. It may just be one of those conincidences that others before you in the office have gotten cancer. Other than people on these boards, I only personally know of a very few people who have had breast cancer, and no one in my immediate family or close friends have ever been diagnosed so that gives me strength and comfort during this waiting period in addition to the many wonderful kind words and good thoughts sent by people who take the time to post a message on these boards. Are you getting your biopsy next Wednesday or just meeting with the surgeon? The radiologist recommended I need a biopsy but first the surgeon scheduled a consultation in which he'll review my films and then I suppose he'll schedule a biopsy....I'm thinking he'll do an excisional biopsy but I won't know until next Wednesday. Let me know how you make out.",

From everything that I've researched, I'm feeling very positive about a good diagnosis. The report shows a solid lesion measuring 2 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm. It's rated a birad 4 - suspicious - biopsy recommended. When I looked at the ultrasound film, it clearly shows a perfectly round mass with no irregular borders and from what I've researched, this is a good sign. I will update everyone after my consult with the doctor on Wednesday.",

      "Content": "mahamc wrote: Hi, everyone. I have a very palpable lump on my right breast. I made an appt. with my GYN a few weeks ago who sent me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. After a lot of research and conversations with people, I had myself convinced it was a cyst. I'm 39 years old and seems to be a common age for these things. So, when the dr. at the radiology center told me it was a solid mass that would need biopsy, I was in somewhat of a shock. I also know that 80-85% of solid masses are b9, so I have a positive outlook. My question - I haven't had a consultation with my GYN yet about the test results since I just had the tests done yesterday and they were faxing to my doc. and I plan to speak with him Monday morning. What questions should I ask about the biopsy or the results of the xrays? Can they usually give an opinion based on the mammo and ultraound whether it's b9 or not? Will my GYN refer me to a surgeon to get the biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
