One at 2 o'clock (left) and one at 10 o'clock (right) he had me feel the one on the left and I definitely felt it. The one on the right is a little smaller. (Honestly I don't even know for sure if it's there since He didn't have me feel the one on the right) He sent me for a 3d mammogram and u/s. I had that done Wednesday last week and they didn't see the lumps in either breast. So radiologist said I don't need u/s. I read my report and it says birads 1 and my breast density is breast composition a, which every thing I've read means I have fatty breast. obgyn said don't worry about it, I asked my Pcp today because I am a huge worrier when it comes to my health and he thinks I shouldn't worry as well. (Pcp was my obgyn before I decided to switch back to my old one). Do you ladies think I should request the ultrasound or do you think I'm being overly cautious? I have read that mammograms are highly sensitive in fatty breast. And of course now I am sore in the spot of question due to poking and prodding I've been doing almost daily. :( Log in to post a reply",
