I had a wig, and hats and scarfs, but mostly I just walked around bald. I was more comfortable that way. I actually got very used to the way I looked. When my Taxol hair started growing in, I felt that I looked like a man. Anyhow, My last Taxol was August 13th, and my brows and lashes all fell out a month later. Luckily, they seem to grow fast, so they are now at the point of wearing mascara again. I rarely have to shave my legs, and not a single hair has grown in my armpits. I hope it stays that way! I wish I had a bumper sticker that said \"I love Hair\". My husband says it would send mixed messages!!! LOL! Take Care All, and happy hair growing!  I LOVE HAIR",

All I know is I am over it. I work in a very conservative office, so PJ day might not go over so well...kind of makes me laugh to think what my boss would say if I showed up in PJ's though! When I was going through chemo, my feet got very swollen and I did show up in flip flops one day. No one said a word. I think I came in withou my wig that day also, so they were all scared of me. Mouse6 - Sorry to hear about the positive biopsy. I had a bi-lateral due to the fact that I have ILC and it tends to spread to the other breast. I do not regret my decision at all, but it is a very personal one for each of us. The entire process is very confusing, take your time and ask lots of questions. I remember I used to feel dumb asking questions, but how the heck are we supposed to know...unfortunately, this is new to all of us! Take care all! Crystal",

I went in 2 1/2 weeks ago to begin the reconstruction.  I developed a horrible infection in my right expander and had to have it removed. Now I have to wait another 3 - 4 months to try again.  Balsie- I am with you on the PJ's. They are my favorite outfit.
