I met with him on May 1 for my 1st \"post-op\" appointment, where he deemed 1 of my drains (on far right side, NOT the side with my DCIS & IDC BC) was OK to be removed, based on its diminished \"output.\"  OWWWWW!!!! I was literally biting down on the fingers of my right hand to help mitigate the pain during its removal -- which seemed to take FOREVER!!!... even though every RN and med person on our BC staff I talked with assured me the removal would NOT be painful! I do have remaining percoset pills from my post-op... I DO think (risk of being constipated be dam*ed!) that I'll be SURE to take 1 or 2 of these several hours prior to my appt!! Geeezz! WHY can't people be truthful anymore, huh?? :( One thing concerns me: I think 1 of the RNs told me post-op on April 25 before I went home after my surgery that my BS likes to see the drainage amount to be like 20-24 (or did she say under 30? can't remember due to the post-op drugs I was on) for 2 days in a row - or more! With that in mind -- and I put this question out to all of my BC sisters who may know -- does the \"total amount\" figure pertain to ONE drains TOTAL output in a 24-hour period?? OR -- would the amt of 20-24 be a TOTAL COLLECTIVE amount added up for all THREE REMAINING drains I have?  OR -- could this figure pertain to just ONE \"output\" reading taken during the day (e.g, I take THREE readings - would the \"tally\" pertain to just ONE of the 3 readings during the day of just ONE of the drains?)  I am just so totally confused by this issue! OMG - I hope and pray it's just ONE drain's \"tally\" - vs. all (remaining) 3 I have -- or I'll NEVER get these things offa me for a number as low as 20-24!! :( I go to see BS next on May 8; he told me at that appointment, depending on the \"output,\" at least 2 of the drains he'd likely be able to remove. Of course, I'll have a FIT if just 1 is still on me - at the 14-day post-op mark! :( Any insight and/or feedback would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!! :) \"I want to live, not merely survive!

I especially enjoyed not having remnants of both my size B/C girls my BS left behind post-BMX (for future recon) bobbing up and down while I walked! Looking through my workout wear closet, I found a GREAT compression-type bra (made by BestForm) that is a kind of stretchy \"all-in-one\" kind of bra with a T-back/racer-back style, which I previously \"tested\" with aerobic dance and jogging. Great in that there are no hooks, wires or traditional bra straps that are a PITA to keep ON my shoulders!! It really holds those girls in \"tightly\" - wore it during a 3-mile AHA Heart Walk last Saturday - it felt like heaven to be moving again, without my 2 girls a-bobbin! ;) Unfortunately, can't remember when or where I bought it... but from here on out (I'm really nixed on ANY notion of me having ANY recon in the future -- after all I've been through so far) for sure, it's COMPRESSION bras for me! :) \"I want to live, not merely survive!
