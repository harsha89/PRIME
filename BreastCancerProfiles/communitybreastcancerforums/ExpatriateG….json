I've been an expatriate for the last 10 years and lived and worked in 4 different countries on 4 continents away from my own home country in Europe, so I've learned to deal with all kinds of 'uphill battles' and take everyday as it comes. Today I finally shared with a few people at work and it was a relief. They were really supportive and I realize that I do have a good support system in my co-workers if I should need it. Two of them shared that they are bc survivors, which I didn't know. They were like; Honey, anything you wonder about, need to know, worry about and need-let us know. We were in that 'business' and around the bc block a few times. They said it with such humor that it made me smile and laugh. They told me that no matter what it is important to keep busy, invite humor and laughter and push worries away. Just like your advice, so that's what I'll do. Thank you also for pointing me in the direction of the forum for women who've had stereotactic biopsies and for the recommendations for what not to take prior. I'll check that out. In the state of Connecticut where I live and work, the law states they have to tell you if you have dense breasts, so I know mine are in the 50-75% range. I guess that's why they are having such a hard time figuring out what the vague distortion on the 1 image of the last 2 diagnostic mammograms is. Since both the ultrasounds and MRI were clean, I'm really perplexed to how the special mammogram they'll use for the biopsy will even find a spot to put the needle in. Oh well, I'm glad they they are thorough.Keeping calm for now. Hope all is going good for you. kindly, D",

No atypical cancer cancer cells'. A 6 month follow up is recommended. As I was worried that the radiologist didn't get the right area in the biopsy, I asked my doctor about it. She said the clip seems to be in the right place when they look at the images. Apparently, they are also making my case a 'case study' for benign breast disease and they were discussing my case and other similar case in a conference the doc told me. She called from the breast cancer conference that is currently happening in San Antonio. I also asked her if she thinks I need an excision surgery done and she responded that she for now is OK with a short term follow up since the breast MRI and US were clean in all screenings. I am thinking of all of you on this wonderful site and always send a light of hope to everyone out there in cyberspace who is going through this particular life journey. I can't thank everyone enough for the support and feedback I've received on the worries I had. I will continue to check in with y'all and pay it forward. Kindly, Di",

As every single post in this forum confirms, the waiting for the unknown/scary/overwhelming takes such a toll on your entire being that is sometimes even is hard to breathe with ease. Even though you're trying to stay positive, the human mind always expects the worst when we are scared. Today when then the nurse navigator from the breast center called me and told me that the pathology report from the stereotactic biopsy I did on Tuesday showed B9 results, I should have felt joy and relief but instead all I felt was a weird sense of anxiety/numbness. She then said that the radiologist who read all the images from the 4 mammograms (3D tomosyntesis), 2 ultrasounds, 1 breast MRI and 1 stereotactic biopsy (which he performed) I've done in the past month, has asked the pathologist to take another deeper look at the tissue sample. He doesn't think that the report correlates to the architectural distortion in my right breast. This ad is only seen on the cc view on one image and is really vague. So vague, that it infact took him 1 hour and 20 minutes to find the area to biopsy. Even then he said: I THINK this is it and we should biopsy it. THINK?! I rather that he was sure!! So now I'm worried again that he didn't get the area he's questioning. I have a feeling my breast surgeon/specialist will suggest excisional biopsy based on his request. I haven't read the pathology report yet, but I don't think I can take more 'probing' at the moment.Especially as clinical exam, US, MRI and biopsy didn't show anything. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Thanks for any feedback and always thanks to all for your support. Kindly, Di",

I just received my MRI results today and the MRI was clean and didn't show any signs of cancer. However, the breast surgeon is recommending that we now do a 'stereotactic biopsy' to find out what the 'vague distortion' in the superior, posterior right breast is. This biopsy will be done in 2 weeks from now. I don't often feel worried or scared of any type of medical procedure, but the process of the 'unknown' and waiting for weeks to find out what the distortion might be is taking a bit of emotional toll on me. Also the fact that I, as an expatriate am on my own here, away from family and close friends, so the support is over Skype mostly. I have lovely co-workers, but I haven't told them. I stay active, feel healthy and read up on research in preparation, but in the back of my mind I can't let this go. So from end of April I've had 1 screening mammogram and 2 diagnostic ones in which the vague distortion only shows up in one image in cc view, 2 clean ultrasounds and 1 clean MRI. Has any of you ever experienced a long process like this? How did you cope? Has anyone ever had a a 'stereotactic biopsy'? What was it like? Any feedback would be much appreciated. Light to y'all.

I hope you get B9 results back. :) Thank you for sharing your experience from the biopsy with us. I'm doing my first ever 'stereotactic core needle biopsy' tomorrow and am a little worried it'll be painful. I guess I'll keep reminding them to add anesthetics as they're doing this. :) My biopsy is based on a vague area of architectural distortion they found on 1 mammography image which has persisted for 6 months. I've done 2 ultrasounds and 1 breast MRI following the mammogram and neither showed anything suspicious in either or anything at all for that matter. Even so, the radiologist put a Birad 4 (up from Birad 3 on mammogram) on the report. Like you, I'm wondering if the radiologist will be able to find/verify the 'vague' spot for the biopsy... I think they have a screening 'flow chart' of some sorts they are following to ensure no stone gets left unturned. Please stay positive and let us know how it goes. We're all in it together and rooting for each other. Kindly, Di",

Just like in your case, the earliest I'll hear back is tomorrow. I've kind of resigned to the 'unknown' and am putting faith in that no matter what the results are-I'll be ok. I think this way because whatever is in my breast already has an outcome, I just haven't heard it yet verbally. So me worrying about it isn't going to change the outcome. In a sense, that's how I'm trying to find peace. All the reading and researching is good for building knowledge and knowledge is power, however...and I'm quoting this one from 'The Notebook'; Science only goes so far...then comes God. Just have faith in the process of life's hangups...you will be all right my friend. You have great doctors and cyber friends on BCO! Please let us know how it goes.",
