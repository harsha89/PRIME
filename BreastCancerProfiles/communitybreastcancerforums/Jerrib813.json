    "Content": "Feb 4, 2017 01:27PM - edited Feb 4, 2017 01:33PM by Jerrib813 I think it is very important to note that not all of us are having the same treatment and still everyone has different reactions so, please don't think that you are unusual if you are different from the norm. With that being said, I'll share my experience because I know it helps all of us with knowing what others are dealing with. I finished Taxol 4 weeks ago after 12 rounds and having 4 rounds of Adriamycin and Cytoxan. I didn't notice any changes at all to my brows or lashes until about the 10th round of Taxol when they started thinning. Just this week, I noticed that they were all gone. I'm with all of you who said that this was way more upsetting to me than losing the hair in my head! DO NOT waste your money on products that say they will keep your lashes. They are misleading... Nothing stops the fall out. If they worked, these companies would be endorsed by every oncologist out there! You can use these products once your lashes start growing back, but remember, that they may fall out again, so do so only if you have the money to spare! As for the Latisse users, the company specifically states on their own website not to use on lower lashes and if the product gets in your eyes, it can change your eye color by darkening it. Just my 2 cents worth... Good luck to all of you fellow cancer warriors and survivors! I'm hoping mine grow back as quickly as some of you who have said a couple of weeks, but then I'll worry about losing them again. ðŸ˜ž. Guess I just need to focus on the positives and stop worrying about stupid hair.... There are way worse issues to deal with for many. Count me thankful. ",
