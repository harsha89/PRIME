I had a lumpectomy 4weeks later, Had no problems with surgery woke with no pain. I had very small breast, so getting a full and clear margin was not possible. I was then told that a mastectomy would be needed. I elected to have both breast removed (DCIS in left breast). More DCIS was found on left breast after mastectomy, right breast clear. I awoke again after surgery with no pain! little discomfort only, mostly due to drains, one on each side. I was also told like you \" the best kind I could get\" no matter, still very unsettling. Stay strong, and positive thoughts only.",
