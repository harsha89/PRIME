    "Content": "newmom88 wrote: Hello Everyone, I am 24 weeks pregnant and for the past couple of weeks have noticed a red patch of skin on my left breast. The other day I was going in for my 24 week apt and realized it was worse. It had grown and was pink at around just about 1/3 of left breast. My nipple was darker than the other but that had been present through most of my pregnancy. I went in to see the specialist today and he found thickening of the skin, edema (peua d'orange or whatever) and the redness. He did an ultra sound and no lumps so he also did a biopsy. He said IBC if rare and its unlikely and maybe just infection. I have already been on antibiotics for almost 24 hours but the rash still remains. I don't think I have a breast infection since I only have a 99.2 fever. Has anyone else experienced this when pregnant and all was well? We get our results on Tuesday. Log in to post a reply",
