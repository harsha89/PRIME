OK, 5 mos. have gone by, I have been to 6 DR.'s, showed them the rash and red streak on LB. I have been sent for knee shots, I have been given toreadol shots and pills and finally Dr. from ER could not diagnose me so he sent me to a thyroid DR. By this time I could barely walk, she saw the rash right under my left breast and 5' red streak and told me I needed markers out immediately. Went back to imaging office, ask for a nurse, she saw I could barely walk and called DR. who did biopsy--she agreed the markers had poisoned me or she had hit a nerve sending signal to left side of my brain and it was emitting signals of pain. She now is setting up surgery for me to get these things out of me. Also, she has to put a guide wire in my breast at her office, then someone has to drive me to hospital for surgery. Also markers gave me chronic fatigue and I am a type a person. Why are women not notified about this practice and do it without permission. I have suffered 5 mos. with this mess and I told every Dr. what it was when I wound up in 2 ER.s. and no one would believe me. The pain was excruciating and I felt like my left leg was on fire, my bp went up to 325, DR. got it down and said he did not what was wrong and I showed and told him I must be allergic to the markers, I rarely get sick and I am not a regular guest at DR's office. Now, I am having to go through this TITANIUM MARKER mess because the nurse said plainly, we left markers in for our convenience in case we need to go back . Is there a convenience clause I missed? In 10 yrs. there will probably be a bad report on these markers just like leaky silicone implants. I told the DR. when she explained how small they were to put them in her hose, then her shoes and see how long she could walk around in them. I am very frustrated and I will never have another biopsy and every woman should be given a choice in this matter and who is going to pay for all these bills? ?? Log in to post a reply",
