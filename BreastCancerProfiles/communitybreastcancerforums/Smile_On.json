Kathleen.  My nodes didn't show up on the MRI either, and I didn't get a PET scan since they were rushing to get me into surgery as quickly as possible.  My involved node was significantly involved too,  With that being said I'm not sure that it just missed the cancer there or if the time between MRI and surgery the cancer grew that much.  I know in the month from my ultrasound to my mastectomy the reported size to the actual size of the tumor in my breast went from 0.6cm to 2.5cm with a very tiny tumor growing next to it.  I know it did grow some since it was barely palpable when my gyno found the lump, but before surgery it was quite noticeable.  Not sure if it was just that I became a lot more aware of the lump and that the technology misread my tumor or if it really was growing that quickly.  My \"node obsession\" comes and goes now.  I'll go a week living my life and not thinking about cancer and then wham something will bring things to tear level again.  I'm hoping/guessing that those periods of not worrying will start to get longer as I get further from diagnosis & am not still going to doctors every 3 weeks, but I think the worry will probably always creep up before check-ups and other triggers.  I'd love to hear from people a year or two out from diagnosis about how they are coping.",

When my skin started to get very sore from radiation I put on the silky button up pajama tops I wore after my mastectomy.  Because of some loss of sensation in fingers from Taxotere I only buttoned 1 button.  The first night I was amazed at how easy it was to pop that button and open up my top to allow cool air in, then when I am finally cooling off I redo that button.  Other than that I do a lot of whipping blankets on and off--it seems if I'm not sweaty hot I am freezing!
