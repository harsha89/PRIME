Both my surgeon and oncologist calmly say 'you have plenty of time to decide on treatment options, the important thing to remember is 'the cancer is out of your body\". No, the tumor is out of my body - the cancer is still there. It will always be there (somewhere waiting). They get a bit sheepish when I give them that reply. I know they mean well and want me to 'process' all the data and be comfortable with my decisions; and you can't start anything until you are healed from the lumpectomy surgery, but don't try to make this any less serious than it is.",
