    "Content": "Sep 1, 2016 08:22AM - edited Sep 1, 2016 08:34AM by Jean68 Hi Sunflower , I am 48 and found a lump in my left breast 8 months ago, had US said it was a cyst and follow up US in 6 months. The follow up US said the cyst had dissolved but they found another lump very close to where cyst was. Also had mammogram but breast tissue too dense to see it clearly. Lump was thought to be either fibroadenoma or lipoma. BS decided excisional biopsy. Had it removed end of July. My lump was a vascular neoplasm. The lump removed did not have clear margins so I go back in next week to remove more tissue to get a clear margin. The lump removed all shows benign but if some of it has remained it could regrow. I guess my story is, you do not fully know until pathology checks it all out. I am glad it is out but I do have concerns about change to my breast after this wide excisional biopsy next week. Can any ladies tell me how their breast looked after wide excisional biopsy? I know it needs to be done and want it done, one lady said to not think of this as final step and you can get reconstruction done if needed. My left breast is already a little smaller after the biopsy. I have a very fine neat scar at about 7 o'clock on my breast, about 3cm long. I wish you well whatever your decision. Anyone I discussed with all said they would have it removed for peace of mind but we are all individuals.",
