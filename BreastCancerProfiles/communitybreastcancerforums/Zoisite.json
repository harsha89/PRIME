I have a question for you can you do the dmx with reconstruction instead of lumpectomy? Maybe skip radiation if possible? I had lumpectomy and radiation then ended up having to have dmx when they found more cancer. Reconstruction can be more complicated after radiation some women can skip radiation all together if the have a dmx. I have had done problems with the skin and muscle that was radiated. Either way I wish you all the best.",
