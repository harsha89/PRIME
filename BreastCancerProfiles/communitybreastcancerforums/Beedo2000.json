I was called back for a diagnostic mammogram after my screening showed \"linear-oriented microcalcifications\" in my left breast. This was my third screening...I am 42. Also noted on mammo \"heterogenously dense\" breasts. Diagnostic mammogram showed a cluster of pleomorphic calcifications located slightly superior and medial in left breast. Bi-rad 4. Recommended biopsy, scheduled for Thursday. From what I have read...I have an 80% chance of a benign diagnosis. Is this correct? Does location of microcalcifications have any impact on those odds?

I asked the radiologist about the bi-rad rating. The letter they sent me home with just said \"abnormal-requiring biopsy\". I requested both my screening and diagnostic reports from my primary physician because after I heard biopsy, I kind if blanked out in the rest! She promptly posted them on my health portal...on a Friday night...she is awesome! She also sent me an e-mail and said she was sorry about the biopsy and to try not to get my mind too far ahead if itself because it can still be nothing. Easier said than done, but grateful for a fully supportive doc!",

I need a magic switch to turn my brain off at night! I have been so up and down. One minute I feel like this will absolutely be B9, then the next minute I find myself thinking \"no, you're one of the 20%\". Try to put it out of my mind completely...but it's always there!
