    "Content": "May 6, 2008 07:45PM - edited May 6, 2008 07:47PM by melissatf I was taking Abraxane, Carboplatin, and Zometa for 7 cycles (3 weeks on, 1 off).  I asked my Onc to test my body's threshold, due to the aggressive nature of my disease. I seem to have had minimal side-effects from previous chemos.  So we agreed to go 7 weeks straight on Abraxane and Carbo.  Unfortunately, I did not make it to 7 weeks.  I made it to 6 weeks.  My counts were severely down and there was discussions about possible hospitalization and blood transfusion.  That sent me begging  my Onc to let me go home and nurse myself.  I was give a 6 week chemo break and had a PET/CT performed following the break.  The PET scan revealed one tumor near my right hilar lymph node or 1.93cm.  The CT scan revealed the same findings as the Pet with the discovery of a 5mm paratreachal lymph node. This was impressive since previous scans had identified numerous lymph nodes in my mediastinum and myocardium.  The only lasting side effect is neuropathy in my baby finger.  This happens to be the baby finger on the side of my port.  This was the first time that I suffered from severe fatigue.  I am currently on another drug and feel good that I can always go back to Abraxane and Carboplatin.",
