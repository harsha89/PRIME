But it also has negative side effects and I don't sleep well when I take it. But since I don't feel normal everytime I take codeine I started to look for something else to relieve pain. A formula I never used before was Oriel herbs which are herbs and antioxidants. Anyway, I have been using this formula for several months now and the pain is better and reduced my codeine dose. But later, the pain has become bearable that I have stopped codeine completely and now I use ordinary pain medicine such as aspirin or ibuprofen.. I recommend Oriel formula for cancer pain, it has fixed the codeine problems. By the way, Oriel is also for cancers, not just for pain..
