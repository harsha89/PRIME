Maybe I will revisit the marinol idea with my onc when I see her next week. Fluffernutter, I think probably, like me, you are sitting there appreciating all the advice, but probably have tried most of the suggestions.  Maybe there's a couple you haven't, like acupuncture (sent to me in a private message).  That's one I might consider but would need to feel confident about it working since it would be costly.

Ne'er a scan and a yr and a half without even a tumor marker test. Took my GP to find extensive spread to the liver after I finally came down with symptoms two yrs later. In retrospect the onc says the mets were probably there all along and admits that 'theoretically being a little cancer vs a lot of cancer' I might have had a better prognosis if we had known about it earlier.",

The reply was that \"We don't do that anymore since sometimes we see things that aren't cancer and end up alarming people unnecessarily\". I agreed with that since my mother's scan showed a shadow on her liver that ended up being nothing. He also added that if i had metastatic disease I would have symptoms...not true in my case. Still there seems to be something wrong with being \"monitored aggressively\" every three months by cancer specialists and it takes my GP to send me for an ultrasound of the liver after having flu like symptoms to discover mets. Yes it sucks...but i understand fully the \"unpredictability\" in medicine and life in general and i would prefer to think that scanning wouldn't have made a difference in my case anyway (although it likely would have). Just throwing it out there for one perspective on the scanning issue.",

And she suggested going back into the center for intravenous fluids and antinauseas in the IV since they are more effective that way. I have to say I had my doubts but I followed to the t exactly what she suggested and that round was much more tolerable. Hope you find a solution or can move to something more tolerable!",

I am currently on doxil which is my 8th chemo in four years. Taxol, Xeloda, Navelbine, Gemzar, Carboplatin/Taxotere, Perjeta/Taxotere, Kadcyla, and now Doxil. I am awaiting my second doxil infusion as we speak. Kind of hard to judge side effects based on only one treatment but definitely not a chemo hell. Carbo/Tax was chemo hell for me. So far this is a piece of cake. Personally I would try it. If the side effects are mild and you can still change your mind at any point, what's the harm?",

Not sure how long you've been doing this but I'm past three years with extensive liver mets and really feel the game is getting close to over. I had a good normal functioning for three years though so not complaining but I've been barely functional for the past few months. If you can do it financially, moving to part time might be a good idea...not too many people die wishing they had spent more time at work. But i wouldn't judge it from how you're feeling right now 'cause my guess is right now you're not up for working at all. If you're going to continue this regimen you might have to consider short term disability for a while if it's an option and play it by ear. Maybe you'll switch to a different treatment eventually and feel perfectly fine again...and perhaps will appreciate a part time schedule anyway at that point.",

I did go in once two days after the infusion for intravenous fluids and got intravenous Ativan but I honestly am not sure that that did anything...so the rest was all oral.

It was the first time I was soo hoping treatment wasn't working because I didn't want to continue it. Did three rounds. I had had nothing but progression...mostly to the liver for over a year. Well the carbo / tax shrank liver tumors from 6cm to 4cm. 3.5 cm to 2.9 etc. Should have been good news but I found it hard to celebrate. Anyway I suggested she try my new insurance company..Medicare ..on the perjeta and they approved it so we switched the carbo for perjeta. Long answer to a short question you probably never asked. :) Looking back at pictures I want my hair back too! although some might wonder why. I had hair for a whole year after not having it for two. Sorry to see you're her2-...no tdm1 in your future. Probably in mine...and I'd like to end on a hair note if possible. ....and have the energy to enjoy it...too much to ask?",

I do feel that a lot of emphasis is put on detection, prevention and maybe some want to lock the stage 4 failures In a closet. i actually felt lucky at a support meeting with all these women complaining about lingering side effects from long ago treatments that i in treatment don't suffer from.

They keep me on the phone for at least 45 minutes and then send mounds of paperwork for me and onc....every six months! It seems they are trying very hard to find reasons not to pay. Maybe you could ask your onc how they would complete the paperwork for you, basically as far as how sick they would make you look despite being NED. They certainly could still make it work since treatment has side effects etc. Maybe you should talk to them about it. Hopefully some NEDsters will come along with their experiences.",

I have been exercising every morning since I was in my twenties! Nothing big..sit ups and such...but really. I jokingly warned her not to treat me like a \"newbie\". She had never heard of Ritalin for this use and oddly enough neither had my onc so they referred me to the palliative care team at Yale. With some arm twisting I got them to meet me in the infusion room when I had to be there anyway. Very nice dr who agreed to accommodate me on my schedule. Prescribed 2.5 mil twice a day while telling me that it should be at least 5 to work. I didn't mind 'cause I want to start off slow anyway. Been on that dose nearly a week. So far it has made me a little jittery..has not helped the fatigue..and is keeping me awake at night. I have an Ativan prescription which I use mostly for MRI claustrophobia but occasionally I'll take half a mil at night if I feel sick and can't sleep. I called to get more of that before my trip cause I don't want to be without it. My onc prescribed only 20 because she doesn't like me taking it because it has to metabolize through my compromised liver. I know many of you take it regularly for anxiety but I never have cause I'm just not anxious generally speaking. But if I were, it looks like she wouldn't give it to me. I mean am I not at the point that it really doesn't matter? I think the palliative care people would be more willing. I love my onc and she is realistic but maybe coming more from a point of \"healing\" and not doing further harm where the palliative care people now it's more about symptom control?",

So that's like being on nothing. So if you've been on nothing for two months, can you go another two...and then scan and then make a decision depending on whether there's progression then? That's only four months and if you progress in that time you may have progressed anyway on yet another ineffective terrible side effect chemo severely cutting into your QOL. Your body probably needs a break. And I wholeheartedly agree with Bestbird on the diet, supplements and whatever thing...which is odd coming from me because I most certainly do not practice it.

Hormonals for a stage four cancer was something totally unbeknownst to me until I 'heard' many of you on this board talking about it. At my last visit after discovering liver met progression, I did ask about going back to something since I read someone on here was doing just that...out of the US...she stated as many of you have that once you've had progression on something you don't go back to it. I also asked about hormonals and she said for me, it may be a possibility in the future but I'd have to get pretty stable first. Kind of a confusing answer to me since If chemo was making me stable she'd just keep me on the chemo until scans showed progression...and if progression..can't do hormonals. Maybe its a possibility if chemo makes you stable but you can't tolerate side effects?",

Bear in mind that everyone is different...and most of what i have to report is good. The xeloda initially knocked me for a loop..severe diarrhea and mild nausea...taking it two weeks on and a week off. Dr reduced the dose and changed the schedule...to a week on and a week off...much better! I was back to normal! She wanted to give me tykerb at that time but by the time they got an approval for it i wasn't tolerating the xeloda well so we stuck with xeloda and herceptin. I was also having excellent scans on xeloda. It was actually shrinking tumors where the taxol (17mo of it) was just keeping it at bay. Due to recent brain mets we switched the herceptin for tykerb a couple months ago...so far so good. Unfortunately xeloda and tykerb both have the same side effects..diarrhea and hand/foot syndrome. So taking them together can give you a double whammy. I was very apprehensive when we added the tykerb but so far so good. My fingers get cracked sometimes making it hurt to bend them...but not intolerable. I put bandaids on my thumbs where they bend. It keeps them moist and then they're fine. My feet get red and burn on the bottom sometimes..like walking on hot sand. Its really not all that bad so i hope im not making it sound bad. These symptoms come and go...it's not like they get red and stay red and get progressively worse..not at all....in fact I dance regularly...if it causes burning feet I just ice em when im done. Not into following rules...like avoiding heat and friction....if its going to interfere with my quality of life. Don't get discouraged if you don't tolerate it well in the beginning. Hated it with a passion initially...hated hearing that the taxol was no longer working..even was upset at the plug being pulled on my regular weekly infusion routine. But now I can almost sing its praises. Plus i got to grow hair after two years! Not necessarily a good thing since it's a lot less tame than the wig...but it's mine! Good luck with it...and don't despair. Ive heard lots of reports of good scans on it.",

I was a little taken aback because I wasn't expecting it but I guess it's common for that treatment center. The best way I could describe it is like a contact lense case...albeit a bit smaller. I guess they do that so they can alternate which one their using and maybe have a back up if one fails? If they have spray that they can give you there you're probably good to go...but if it's Emla cream you'll probably get it in a prescription that you have to fill and then apply it prior to treatment. I didn't get my prescription until AFTER the first access! But not everybody is that sensitive to it anyway. It's just good to know up front just in case.",

Never done it before but very much looking forward to it..Also may get back to subbing for the same Adult Ed organization...which should work well in terms of scheduling scans, infusions etc. And yes..I should add that I am fortunate enough to feel energetic enough to do it...I very seldom suffer the fatigue that is so common for most people.

I used to get fifty mil but then they reduced it to twenty five and I would say maybe I'd be ok on that amount an hour and a half or so after treatment ended. I probably drove under the influence a little more than I should have. But it's not always practical to have someone bring you especially if it's pretty much weekly ...and for years. Really they do recommend you not drive if you're getting Benadryl. It affects everyone different too. Kind of good that I don't have to worry about that part of it but I do miss it....I really liked the effect. One hint...you can ask for a lower dose if you're managing the chemo ok and also if they drip it in quicker I found the effects wore off quicker. But I insisted they drip it over half an hour instead of fifteen minutes because the quicker time frame tended to make me agitated.",

I look forward to catching it later though since I was most looking forward to this topic. Another thought...if you're liking doing it and at least a few others are enjoying it I wouldn't stop so soon. To me so far it has sounded pretty professional. You seem to have a knack for an easy conversational flow and keeping to a reasonable time frame with callers without sounding rude or like you're cutting them off. With anything like that...it takes a while for the word to get around and for interest to build. I've belonged to several meetup groups and the most popular ones have been around a while. But the first several months of course there were very few attendees. And the next topic sounds interesting...I know we've talked about that subject quite a bit on here too.",

Doubted her answer so researched it myself. She was 'dead' wrong! Not only could I keep the life insurance, but also am exempt from paying a premium due to the fact that I left work due to a 'disability' prior to retirement age. I'm 54. Not only that...but if your dr says you are expected to live less than x number of months (for my Anthem plan it was 12) you can take a percentage of the money before you go..anywhere from 50 - 100 percent depending on the plan. Anthem was 75 percent and I took it. It is also a tax free transaction by the way. And with the Anthem plan if you should miraculously recover you are not required to pay it back. The 25 percent remaining is still there for my beneficiaries without my having to pay for it",

Jcb51 regarding unemployment...used to be ...at least in CT that u have to be available for full time work in order to collect unemployment....that changed..I believe in 2006...now if u have a documented disability you can be seeking part time work and still collect unemployment and yes at the same time as SS disability...I have been doing just that until recently when the unemployment ran out :(.

I'm glad to hear you say that. I think you have certainly inherited some of your mother's strength and positive attitude. The above quote is something I have tried to explain to friends who seem stuck on the not so pleasant ending of the lives of their loved ones. I have also said it to my kids. If the last weeks or hours of life produce suffering try not to dwell on that. It pales compared to years and years of memories. If your mother suffered at the end, for her it was short lived. I'm sure she wouldn't want you to carry it forever. I lost my mother who was my best friend to metastatic breast cancer exactly two months prior to my mets diagnosis. I feel like our closeness somehow has made the loss easier to bear. I hope it will comfort you in the days to come as well.",

After taxol failed and just before the start of xeloda, a little more than a year ago I ran to the cancer treatment ctrs of America in PA...mostly because of hearing about chemoembolization from their frontline salesperson over the phone. They confirmed there that I was not a candidate for it because of the number of spots on the liver and maybe the wide area they cover? I know that that procedure should be easily covered by ins. I believe SIRT, from what I understand, works a little differently and may be able to be used for multiple liver mets but it looks like its current use is more for primary liver cancer or metastasized colon cancer. I did discuss it all with my onc who seemed to feel I was not a candidate for either and that the SIRT under my circumstances would not be something insurance would consider...it was apparent to me also that had I not mentioned it she was not considering it at all herself.",

I remained on COBRA at around 600 per month for just me..no spouse until Medicare eligibility this January. It was a struggle but necessary. In the beginning when my income just didn't support it I have to say the luck of a shed collapsing due to snow and other related house ins claims gave me some unexpected funds that I paid the insurance with as pathetic as that sounds. I also took advantage of assistance from the Healthwell foundation who helped me with premium payment assistance...1800 in total which was a godsend. There are other funds out there that might be able to help assist paying other things so you can pay your COBRA. I realize that I might be somewhat \"luckier\" than you I the sense that I did not have a second income via a spouse that might have made me ineligible for certain help. After going out on ss disability I was able to collect Unemployment while looking for part time work which was legitimate due to the disability. Also..having worked part time even a minimal number of hours made me eligible for medicaid for the working disabled which has income/ asset limits that are much higher than the low income eligibility for most people. Aside from that..if you have a life insurance policy you might want to consider taking an accelerated death benefit to help you in making your COBRA payments. Just writing this makes me realize how many countless hours of my life over the past few years was spent on this issue just struggling to stay afloat financially including a year long dispute with the ct state dept of social services that just got resolved a couple months ago after sending a certified letter to the commissioner and then several politicians. I am so resentful that I had to go through all that but we do what we have to. I am finally at the point that I can just focus on my rapidly deteriorating health. Anyway..I hate that you or any of us have to deal with this nonsense on top of the health woes but hope that maybe something of my experience might be of help.",

In the Anthem book it specifically states that if one leaves their employment due to a disability that precludes them from working prior to retirement age then they can continue the coverage without the payment of premium. Sometimes they check periodically to be sure the disability is continuing to be sure you're still eligible for the waiver of premium. But it is the health insurer in my case that has waived the premium.",

If you pay attention they actually advertise 90 percent \"patient satisfaction\" not cure but chances are many people read it differently. Unfortunately many of my friends and relatives are easily led by their silly \"no expiration date\" commercials. I did actually go for a few days a couple years ago to the one in Pennsylvania at the urging of family and friends. They would have paid to fly me there..limo service to the facility etc. All very curious. A good friend drove me instead and they reimbursed her for expenses. Other than a minimal fee for the hotel I ended up with no out of pocket expenses. The food was great and included! I would say their main difference was the holistic approach. Everyone is assigned a nutritionist, a naturopath, religious or other counselors, massage therapist etc. I wondered how these peripherals were paid for since the insurance companies won't pay for that...unless they padded the other costs to cover it. The facility reminded me more of a hotel than a hospital and I saw more employees than I did actual sick people...which I found odd. Each member of your \"team\" met with each other and then with you so everyone was all on the same page and no miscommunications. It seems they did have some good concepts but ultimately their treatment plan didn't vary from what my onc had already recommended at Yale and I frankly was glad because I didn't want to leave her. I have never been dissatisfied with her. It also puzzles me why CTCA chooses to focus solely on advanced stage cancer. Niche marketing maybe?",

Because I know if there any options left after this one fails, they are few.  That's why.  I'm feeling like its time to pull up the stakes and move on.  The gig's up.  The party's over. I've skated through the past few years just living life.  Not feeling any particular anxiety even knowing death was inevitable, because I also knew it was not imminent. But now is different.  I feel more pressure than I ever have to use this healthy time wisely, lest I get caught off guard.  I am paralyzed by indecision of how I should be using this time.  I completed my will and designated my life insurance beneficiaries a couple years ago.  I agonized much over those hard choices that had to be made too but am at peace with them. I pulled the \"important papers\" folder from my file cabinet and assured myself the important stuff was done.  Looked through the pictures I've chosen for the funeral display and was satisfied with the photo choices I've made too.  Found a sticky note and wrote down the names of a few favorite songs and added it to the folder.  Not sure if someone would sing them, play them as background music or what, but I'll let someone else figure that out. I semi joked more than once with my friends, mostly my journaling group, that they will be doing my eulogy.  I'm not religious so if a few people who know me spoke and said what I meant to them that would be good enough.  So that's covered.  So there, I guess I am packed and knowing that does lift the anxiety somewhat. I needed to write this all out because it helps me to put my thoughts into words if I can find them. I hesitate to share this with all of you because I know you all relate.  Many of you are still suffering horrible side effects and some even much closer to the end than I.  Many of you are struggling with the fear of leaving young families.  I am no worse off than any of you ultimately. So im not looking for sympathy nor a list of chemo options.   I already know what's out there and what I've already tried.   I'm a practical person so I will ask for some practical advice.  Where does one have a funeral service if you're not religious?  Do you ask a nearby church if you can use their facility?  Use a room in a funeral home?  Rent a hall?   If I can put that decision to rest I will feel more settled and can hopefully get back to enjoying the rest of life.  Any thoughts? bone, liver and brain mets Jill Dx 10/6/2009, Stage IV, mets Dx IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/8 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Fact is every time I see someone on here with a young family it just makes me sad. I am a bit older than you, Leftfoot....54....with grown children. But I have been living with extensive liver mets since October 09 and have tolerated many chemos quite well. I have had brain mets since December 2011 and will be having my second gamma knife procedure tomorrow. If that ends up being your route of treatment I can say that the gamma knife procedure is not that bad. I wish I lived closer so could offer some real help..like cleaning or child care or something. I love blaineJennifer's practical advice. And I agree with everyone else who says you will come to a period of relative calm once you have a plan..no matter what it is.

At least you can be happy and proud that your kids are all on their way to decent independent lives. I have the opposite problem...a very full nest with three adult children who continue to need me more than they should at this point. Although I admit it's nice having them close sometimes. Yes meetup groups are a good idea for a social outlet. I think with or without illness in my experience the dating world isn't all it's cracked up to be. If you join some adult group things without worrying about finding a partner then maybe it will just happen and if not you can make some new friendships, male and female. It's a transition...and transitions are always hard. Wishing you better days ahead.",

I liked my job and didn't want to leave it but it came down to the job or my health so I opted for the better doctor. Financially it continues to be a major struggle but even if finances we're not an issue I wouldn't make a rash decision at the onset of hearing stage 4. Not to minimize the diagnosis but bones mets in particular seem to be the one people are living longest with. Tough that your family is out of state. Make sure it's really what you want to do and know that you can make the decision at any point in the future. Don't rush it. My original onc also was telling me I could leave work on disability but the last thing I wanted to do after hearing his grim prognosis was to give up on my regularly scheduled life...which included my job!

He called to say he was wondering if I might like to go on a motorcycle ride with him. Totally unexpected. I was in the middle of a family crisis at home with one of my kids...so it just made me cry...but if he calls and offers again...I'll take him up on it!

Despite the fact that there still is no cure, I think if we were living with mbc years ago we would have died a lot quicker. I think that's why the general public doesn't get it and doesn't understand why if we're dying...why do we still looked good and often function normally. It dawned on me when a fb friend who knew I was dying 3.5 years sees I'm still here and asked if the prognosis is different now. Years ago when you had metastatic disease and you were dying you did it rather quickly. The fact that we can now prolong life in some cases for years is due to medical advancements. So I understand now the general public's confusion.",

Because I know if there any options left after this one fails, they are few.  That's why.  I'm feeling like its time to pull up the stakes and move on.  The gig's up.  The party's over. I've skated through the past few years just living life.  Not feeling any particular anxiety even knowing death was inevitable, because I also knew it was not imminent. But now is different.  I feel more pressure than I ever have to use this healthy time wisely, lest I get caught off guard.  I am paralyzed by indecision of how I should be using this time.  I completed my will and designated my life insurance beneficiaries a couple years ago.  I agonized much over those hard choices that had to be made too but am at peace with them. I pulled the \"important papers\" folder from my file cabinet and assured myself the important stuff was done.  Looked through the pictures I've chosen for the funeral display and was satisfied with the photo choices I've made too.  Found a sticky note and wrote down the names of a few favorite songs and added it to the folder.  Not sure if someone would sing them, play them as background music or what, but I'll let someone else figure that out. I semi joked more than once with my friends, mostly my journaling group, that they will be doing my eulogy.  I'm not religious so if a few people who know me spoke and said what I meant to them that would be good enough.  So that's covered.  So there, I guess I am packed and knowing that does lift the anxiety somewhat. I needed to write this all out because it helps me to put my thoughts into words if I can find them. I hesitate to share this with all of you because I know you all relate.  Many of you are still suffering horrible side effects and some even much closer to the end than I.  Many of you are struggling with the fear of leaving young families.  I am no worse off than any of you ultimately. So im not looking for sympathy nor a list of chemo options.   I already know what's out there and what I've already tried.   I'm a practical person so I will ask for some practical advice.  Where does one have a funeral service if you're not religious?  Do you ask a nearby church if you can use their facility?  Use a room in a funeral home?  Rent a hall?   If I can put that decision to rest I will feel more settled and can hopefully get back to enjoying the rest of life.  Any thoughts? bone, liver and brain mets Jill Dx 10/6/2009, Stage IV, mets Dx IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/8 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

This is one of those times that misery does NOT want company, certainly not the company of a young mother. So I hope you're wrong. I hope we're both wrong..how's that! Located a funeral home walking distance from me but they were closed. Spoke to them on the phone and made a tentative appt to stop there this week to talk to them. I think I'd want a traditional calling hour thing...and would prefer the actual service to be elsewhere but don't think it's practical since I'd also want a burial after the service and a restaurant or home thing after that. Took a drive around town and this funeral home, two cemetery choices, and a restaurant/ catering facility are all within a mile of my house, walking distance even. So maybe if the funeral home has a room that's not so funeral looking we could do a service there and then burial and then move either to my house or the restaurant facility. Thought about using a room at the catering facility but don't want people sitting around at restaurant tables trying to listen to speakers talk about their memories of me. I want their full attention! My cemetery preference is right in my back yard..there's a brook at the edge of the yard and the cemetery is beyond that. Who else could be buried in their back yard legally?? I've contacted them four times in the past couple years...last time being yesterday. Seems they're always giving me the run around for some reason. It's an old cemetery and she told me yesterday they're still looking at maps to determine what's still available. But she'll have someone get back to me.",

But the bigger reason is I want a big stone with my name on it! Maybe I should be leary of the cemetery behind me since they're still analyzing old maps to determine where the available plots are. Years ago my mother bought the plot head to head with her father's stone so we could engrave that side of the stone for her. (different cemetery) and when it came time to bury her four years ago and they dug at that spot there was someone else buried there! They gave some nonsense story about the ground expanding and contracting and all the graves somehow shifted....yeah right! Not a good time to find out they had double sold her plot.",

And it's funny I also keep fearing getting to the anger stage...thinking it will be all downhill from there...and I get there every time I have progression and a treatment change...and I've had two in the last couple months...I'm currently on my last hair-sparing option but am already making plans to get better at makeup and wigs for whenever...determined to look and feel as normal as possible! I agree with BHD1, once you get on your new treatment you will probably settle in and get your 'you' back! I did...at least back into denial again....for now. Allow yourself all the grieving and venting you need! Don't beat yourself up over it. You're still human...and still you. No hugs...just sending good vibes through mental telepathy;)",

Maybe there is something about going back to an infusion chemo vs oral xeloda? Funny when I failed on taxol and went to xeloda I was very upset. Even upset about missing my weekly infusion routine! But after the initial side effects and a schedule change and dose reduction xeloda became my best friend...mostly for the hair growth I must admit. And I , like you got just a year on it before I had further liver progression...and I was quite upset then too. Same path too....switched to navelbine..required a port that I didn't want. As others have said..generally speaking navelbine is well tolerated....side effect wise..I didn't have big problems with it...it just didn't work. Now adjusting to Gemzar ...and not doing a good job of it but I think I will get there! Looking back now I say ....hey...I got a whole year on xeloda..not bad! This is sounding like a a pep talk and I don't want it to. Fact is your young and should be enjoying sky diving and all the other things life has to offer and not dealing with this BS and the fact that you are makes me angry actually. And you sound like a very lovely and lovable positive person and without even knowing your DH or your loved ones I am sure they are willing to help you through it all...no matter what comes your way. So here's hoping navelbine is the magic bullet for a long long time...but if you hit some bad times...lean on the people around you...it's ok and they probably want you to. .",

Like what? Like my latest scans showed new progression, I just failed on my fourth chemo so it looks like I'll be dying even sooner? While I had her on the line I asked if she had the clerical people there revise the form where they incorrectly report the \"minimum benefit\". Something she promised to do last time...but no..she didn't and doesn't think she can. But they can send me a verification of benefits letter. And by the way..after January if I'm able to work they will take fifty percent of the earnings away from my benefit. I DON'T CARE! We are talking about 100 dollars a month! She hit a nerve too because I had committed to teaching an adult enrichment Spanish class again for 8 weeks every Tuesday...ended up sick with fevers three Tuesdays prior to the start date of the class so had to back out because I really can't commit to it. I offered to teach just the first class since the new person couldn't do it that night. It was my herceptin only week so I felt ok...really enjoyed it...and so did the class..I could tell...but I walked out of there sad at the end of the night. It felt so good and normal but I knew I couldn't do it every week. I was just about to make myself a cup of coffee this morning...having gotten up very early to bring my son to the methadone clinic, then my grandson to daycare, have to bring my daughter to work at 11. So I told her to just send me the verification letter. She said I'd first have to send her a request in writing..

Well I'll eat my words now. And don't feel guilty because the cancer \"is only In the bones\". I may have it in bones, liver, and brain but now I feel guilty because I feel well most of the time. You really shouldn't have to suffer that much. And maybe a switch to chemo might not be a bad idea...or even better...maybe just stopping the hormonals for maybe a month? You must have so much of the effects of it in your system now...both good and bad. Definitely worth discussion with you doctor. Hope it gets better.",

Have to say i did get a little chuckle out of your mention of Farrah Fawcett because while my mother was dying of cancer..brain metastasis....Farrah Fawcett was also dying and filming her journey. For some reason that greatly annoyed my mother. Not sure if it was the pressure of the tumors on her brain or if she just thought she shouldn't publicize her personal struggles...but in any case when my mother learned that Farrah passed all she could say was \"IT'S ABOUT TIME!\"",

Their frontline salesperson told me about chemoembolization on the phone which is partly what sold me on going even though I suspected I would not be a candidate for it, which they confirmed I was not.

Living in CT and not knowing what the weather will be like I will shy away from anything outdoors. However my daughter remembers my telling her years ago that I wanted a memorial bench on a nearby biking trail so if that comes to pass, that would satisfy the desire to be remembered at a place that reflects me. Maybe I should check to see If that's even a possibility because I don't want her stressing over it if she can't do it. It's really not that important to me. Thanks for introducing me to the word \"celebrant\" Diane. Ashamed to say I didn't know what it meant but gathered the meaning from the context and looked it up. :) I will start scouting out possibilities...maybe even today. Found a local funeral home that may be bigger and have more parking than the one I was familiar with. (perhaps I overestimate my popularity) :) Just spent an hour and 45 minutes (most of it on hold) on the phone with the local state dept of social services who wants to cut off my medical benefits at the end of the month. Long story short..I need to find some employment so I can get back into the Medicaid program I was on for the working disabled that has much more liberal asset and income limits. So I'll be out and about over the next few days both funeral shopping and job hunting. At least I now have a purpose and know how I have to spend this \"well\" time. I don't imagine there is anybody in my usual circle of friends that can relate to that. But I suspect some of you out there can!",

But he was cremated so his family didn't do the traditional calling hour thing or burial which I think I want. Also I'm not sure if I had a memorial thing down the road if people would show up other than family. And I'd rather have it all done at once for my kids so perhaps they can move on quicker. I think that would be their preference too. They're young adults, 32, 30, and 23. I plan to go back to the Adult Ed office to see if I could sub for their English as a Second language classes again. That's what I did when I first became eligible for Medicaid for the working disabled. Although it's not always the easiest thing to do for 3/4 hours at a clip. Sometimes I get painful muscle spasms ...they don't last long..at home I either yell or breathe through it and it usually passes quickly. Have to be on your game all the time teaching a class. They might not even need me. I think I can find something though, and hopefully soon!",

Had to fill out another brief application because it's a new school year. Also need to wait for board of ed meeting so they can vote on it. Went from there to the local funeral home I was considering. I am very pleased with that choice. Spent at least an hour there. Got a real good feeling from the woman I was speaking with. So I basically pre planned the funeral. I can't tell you how good I felt when I left there. I know it sounds odd..but getting that out of the way I came home and practically skipped across the living room I felt so good. Almost wanted to post my day on the\"what are you doing for fun\" thread! Now that I have a plan....going to get back to living!!!",

But we'll all be there sooner or later. And I think what I hear you saying Chick is it's the decision part of it that worries you. I'm with you on that. Just as I'm hoping my scans of yesterday show definitive progression. No need to make a decision to end the treatment that I know I can't tolerate anymore. I know you've suffered a lot over the past few months on Ixempra. Hopefully you'll have lots of good healthy days on whatever your next plan is...you earned it! But I, like you, hope the decision to eventually end treatment is clear cut. It would be so much easier to be to peace with it then. And Spamgirl....I've been saddened to read your posts of late. So sorry you've been suffering so much! I have heard you state before what death is like with liver mets. Personally I never ask those questions. But have found your description comforting. Just got a call from my oncs office while in the midst of writing this. Liver progression...moving to Tdm 1. Soo looking forward to healthy days. I wish the same for all of you....",

My onc's office is always good about things like that. It's bad enough that you have to spend precious time applying for such things just to stay afloat financially.

Anyway..on a more positive note...it seems my kids have been tripping over each other lately to clean up and organize things.

You'll probably end up doing scarves anyway since you don't find wigs comfortable. I always wanted the scarved look that apple has in her picture but could never achieve it so ended up wearing wigs only..also never wanted to look like a cancer patient. There was one look I did occasionally in public...and always at home...i wore a comfortable three seam turban and sometimes tied a colorful ribbon around it. Got them online at a place called hats with heart.",

I also applied to the Dept of Social services for Medicaid insurance for the \"working disabled\". I took some teaching sub jobs in order to qualify for that.  The income and asset limits are much higher for the working disabled program also known as med-connect. And there is no minimum number of hours you need to work.  I also was eligible for a few years off and on of unemployment compensation since the new laws ...CT anyway....don't require you seek full time work if disabled.  So that helped greatly toward being able to pay the COBRA.  Rather than have the state give me Medicaid insurance they agreed to a premium purchase arrangement whereby they picked up my COBRA premium.  This way I had a private medical plan vs state which might have afforded me more treatment options if needed since some facilities or procedures don't accept Medicaid.  After being eligible for Medicare I was also at that point low enough income even without the working disabled program to be eligible for  Medicaid as a secondary insurance.  I'm comfortable now but those two years prior to being Medicare eligible were a struggle and a constant researching of funds, filling out forms etc to make it work. All this is more relevant if you are self supporting.  If you have a spouse with good medial benefits I imagine you could go on his policy despite when regular enrollment is due to this being what they'd call a \"qualifying event\".",

Hope you get good news...not knowing of course what good news would even be at this point. I don't think about scans when I have them...other than it being an appt that interrupts my regularly scheduled life...probably all part of the denial. But most of us have them on the regular...in my case bone, muga, and cat scans every three months and MRIs every six weeks. I don't even think about them other than being sure not to miss the appts. That's probably why it knocks me for a loop when i get a bad scan like the last cat scan showing further spread to the liver...i guess I just don't expect it. As far as thinking events will be my last...of course I do that too....every night I spend on the dance floor I wonder if it will be my last...and Ive been dancing most weekends for 2.5 years now...so...we carry on....don't we.....",

Never got that either because of a chemo switch again. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again if need be.  I am hoping that they have another solution to nausea other than the usual zofran, compazine, emends etc.  None of those things ever did anything for my nausea if it was severe.  Staying on steroids for a while did lessen the nausea somewhat for me.  But I would guess you've already been on them.  I sure hope they can find a solution.  I gathered from a comment you made on another thread kind of marveling at people who can still get out and enjoy life, that you weren't doing too well.",

Bought a card for her for the card shower that remains here and blank. The 'writer' couldn't think of a thing to write. Somewhere in the back of my mind I guess I really did think I would meet up with her one day and we'd bike together in Key West.....silly me. Do you think it's possible in the after life? Do think it's possible that Kita, Apple..some of the others have connected?",

Last time the nurse tried to give it to me intervenously I stopped her and asked for oral instead. As far as staying on top of constipation ...of course different things work for different people...but I take three stool softeners and three sennas (both generic) and that usually works. I never take compazine because I've had bad reactions to it in the past....super jitteriness.",
