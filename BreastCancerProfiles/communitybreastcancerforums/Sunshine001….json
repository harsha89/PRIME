My sister was recently dx with stage 4 metastic colon cancer and my father passed away from melanoma. I have had 2 aunts on my mothers side pass from breast cancer in their 40s as well as one still living with it. I was encouraged by my oncologist to have genetic panel and came back CHEK2 positive. I began high risk breast management and last week had 3 mri guided biopsies. One came back as atypical ductal hyperplasia my o.cologist is on vacation and they are wanting me to meet with her and a breast surgeon affiliated with her practice when she gets back. With all of the family history as well as genetics i really just kinda want to know thoughts from women who have been here and what q to ask as well as what route is most generally taken. I really dont want to spend the next 50 years or so with 6 month mammo 6 month mri if i dont have to. I have 3 teenagers and a husband and we enjoy being active togetherðŸ˜ƒ",
