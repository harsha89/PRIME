My husband stayed home one week. I spent two nights in the hospital. For me, it was harder than I thought it would be. The pain isn't bad...off narcotics after 18 hours. They put some sort of numbing medication around the implants that lasts for five days. I was just simply wiped-out. I had four drains and you really need someone to help you strip them twice a day. You definitely need help with bathing and dressing for at least a week or two. I think you'll be fine without your husband for week 2. Most woman sleep in a recliner for a few weeks. I bought a wedge off Amazon, stayed in bed, and had my husband sleep in the other room. You will need space! I would wake-up every 2 hours and hubby would help me roll on my 'half side', not quite on your side, and prop a pillow behind your back to keep you there. More importantly, make sure they send you home with Valium...that helps tremendously with the muscle spasms with the added benefit of a decent night's sleep. Also, if you are prone to post-op nausea and vomiting, ask for Emend pre-op. I also bought a shower chair off Amazon as you can't shower until your drains are out (1-2 weeks). Use a hand-held shower and have someone there with you...you will not be able to wash all of you. You will NOT be able to get yourself out of the tub for a few weeks. It was at least two weeks before I was able to do simple thing's around the house. Accept whatever help is offered...meals, etc.. I agree with Meadow about the zip hoodies...cotton ones are best. If zip hoodies are too warm, wear old undershirts and pin the drains to them. The hospital staff should show you how. Buy yourself front-close cotton bras...you will need them. After 2 weeks I wore cotton pull-over sports bras, that I pulled on from the feet up...you can get them (Fruit of the Loom) at Walmart. Wishing you the best and check-in with us!  ",

He said negative nodes have a better outcome but it can still escape via your blood. He also said no surveillance...meaning I did not have a PET scan, MRI, etc. at diagnosis. Said prognosis same whether it's found early or when you become symptomatic. Sigh.",

I cannot tie it to anything but it occurs 15-45 minutes after eating and lasts several hours. If I am still having problems Monday I will contact my MO. I had a friend that passed 2 years ago, at the age of 52, from BC. Her initial dx was 2 years prior. She developed nausea and was subsequently dx with mets. Of course,  I'm a little nervous. I've never had issues with nausea in the past.",
