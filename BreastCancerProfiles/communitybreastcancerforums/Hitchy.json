I do however have a different cancer and I trust my oncologist and God to help me beat it once again. Chemo sucks but we need to do all we can. It's temporary and then on to a great life. Good luck , I know it's a tough decision. Laurie",

Our hormones are going crazy right now trying to figure out what's happening. I take xanax when I need to. Especially on chemo day and to help me sleep. I'm about six weeks out from my surgery and still have days when I cry alot. It's a huge loss and our bodies and spirits need time to grieve. I just let it come and most of the time I feel better after a good cry. Speak with your doctor about it and see if he can give you something to help. Take care, we're here for you, Laurie ",
