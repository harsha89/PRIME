My Oncologist stayed with me and put my mind at ease. I have been taking a walk everyday I find that the walks give me more energy. I do have to say that when you are tired just rest. My next chemo is Nov 17th that is a week from Thanksgiving but I feel so blessed that everyone around me is cooking something and bringing it to my house so that if I need to rest for awhile I can and dont have to worry about messing up anyones holiday. I feel so good about that.",

I read where a lot of the symptoms are cumulative as you go on. I am on adriamycin and cytoxan. I will make sure I talk to the dr about this also.",
