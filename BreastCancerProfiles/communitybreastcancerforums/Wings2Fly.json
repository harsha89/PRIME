I have an appointment scheduled for this Thursday with a Breast Surgeon and Plastic Surgeon and am going out of my mind with worry.I have a great fear of doctors and needles. Too many surgeries made me this way. I am looking to see how the healing process is for most. Is there a lot of pain involved? What are your arm movement capabilities? How do you go to the bathroom? Do they draw blood several times a day when you are in the hospital? My veins are the worse! I am known as a \"Hard Stick\" and it takes them several tries before they get a vein, which is very painful to me. I will only have help for the first week I am home after surgery and from what I am reading and researching, it doesn't seem like that will be long enough. I don't have many people I know around me and I'm panicking that the 2nd week I'm going to be in a pickle by myself. Any information would be greatly appreciated. I can't remember the last time I had a decent nights sleep. I'm just filled with anxiety, fear, worry and depression. Don't even know if I have the strength and courage to go thru with this all. Just going thru a ton of emotions here right now. Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",

It's funny that you traveled from Arizona to Illinois, as I lived in Illinois most of my life and moved to Arizona about 2.5 years ago. What part of Illinois did you go to for your surgery? What part of Arizona do you live in? I can't believe you were up and walking that much so quickly. That is awesome! One question for ya on that. Since you did so well walking on the treadmill, how were going up and down stairs for you? I live in a 2 story house and I'm thinking I will be in a recliner for the first couple weeks at minimum to sleep in, which is on the main floor. But my shower is upstairs. And also, my doctor said that you can't shower til the drains are out. Were you able to shower with the drains? And you said you were able to go to the bathroom once you were up on your own. Hate to get so personal but...... was it difficult to wipe? I'm sort of a hygiene nut and the thought of not being able to wipe properly or shower makes me cringe. In 2009 I had a partial nephrectomy. Which is removal of a duplicate partially developed kidney on my right side. Super rare! I had like a siamese twin kidney. The kidney specialist/surgeon told me it was a sheer miracle that I carried full term and delivered a baby with this condition. But that was a 10 hour surgery and all the doctor did was make like 5 small incisions in different parts of my abdomen and I swear to you, when I woke up from surgery, I thought I was going to die from the severe pain! I was in the hospital for 6 days with that procedure and I wish I had stayed longer, but the doctor was pushing me out! It was the most excrutiating pain I ever felt. So, with having just 5 small incisions and that kind of pain, I am horrified what it will feel like to have a cut from hip to hip! But I'm glad you are honest with me and I definitely will take advantage of all the pain meds I can! I have a pretty good tolerance for pain to a point, but once that pain crosses a certain threshold, I'm a big baby!!! Thank you again for taking the time to reply to me. Hope your recovery continues to get better for you each day!",

They called me in the morning to let me know that if I could come in earlier, I would meet with the Plastic Surgeon first because he had an emergency surgery later. So I met with the Plastic surgeon and he told me my case is very complicated, because my right breast is quite larger than my left, which is the one that was radiated 17 years ago. He said the skin on a radiated breast does not stretch as well and he is concerned about the blood vessels in that breast as well. Then he proceeded to tell me this is a huge surgery and very complex and lots of possible complications and risks. He scared the hell out me. Then I told him about my kidney surgery and the pain I had with the 5 small incisions and he literally said to me, Well if you were in that kind of pain with just 5 small incisions, then you wont even be able to prepare yourself for the pain from me cutting you hip to hip. I almost fell over on the floor from my chair! Instead of feeling hopefully better after talking to the doctor, now I was totally terrified and thought, there is no flipping way I am going to have the courage or strength to do this procedure. He tried to convince me to just do a flap on my radiated breast and do a breast reduction on my right side. I told him I do not want to have to do mammograms ever again and I'd prefer to just do the bilateral. He said to talk to the breast surgeon, which I was meeting after this appointment and we left it at that. So my meeting with the breast surgeon wasn't much better. Again, same story, very complex procedure, won't have symmetry after the first surgery because of the difference in size between the two breasts. And again the worry about the skin on my radiated breast. All I could think was I wanted to run out of the room and just drive as far away as I could from this all. Ugh! So after I told the breast surgeon that I had atypical hyperplasia in my right breast, then she changed her tune and said I probably should do a bilateral. She asked if I was tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. Told her no and she recommended that I should get tested, so as of right now, I have to go back this Thursday and do the genetic counseling and a ct scan, so they can see what type of blood vessels I have in my abdomen. Just so done with this crap already and I haven't even started the nightmare of the surgery! I'm just so depressed and terrified out of my mind.",

I am two days away from seeing the surgeons and as each day goes by and those appointments are getting closer, I'm an absolute mess! The anxiety and chest pains I'm having because of all of this is unbelievable. I understand your concern about help around the house. I live alone and have a brother who lives practically across the street from me. But I am very independent and do basically everything by myself and I am OCD about my house being spotless! My brother will help me out with the more \"MANLY\" chores around my house as I might not have the muscle to do certain things, but overall it's just me! So I am freaking out about being dependent on someone else to wait on me hand and foot. I am usually the caregiver and nurturer. So I know this will be extremely challenging for me to have to surrender to my duties and let someone else take care of me for awhile. Ugh! But I'm not even thinking that far ahead, as I'm too focused on the recovery process and dealing with looking at my body after surgery. I'm so afraid of the pain involved and being down for awhile. It also saddens me that there are so many of us out there going thru this. It just breaks my heart that we as women have to endure this type of pain and suffering. I have a tiny 5mm nodule in my left breast that came back as IDC. Same breast as 17 years ago. So my only option is masectomy. So I figured, I never want to go thru this again and stress and worry like I am right now, so take them both and be done with it. But easier said than done..... I can't seem to wrap my head around the fact that something so small, can turn your world upside down. Why such a drastic outcome for something so small? Why do we as women have to lose our breasts because of this damn \"C\"? Why can't we just take a pill and it would be gone? I guess life is unfair sometimes and we must face the cards we are dealt. I would love to see all this pain and suffering all end for all of us women. Keep me posted and let me know what you decide and I truly wish you the best.",

I am doing a bilateral masectomy with immediate Diep. I researched alot and consulted several local Plastic Surgeons and finally decided I want the best. So PRMA here I come! Absolutely terrified! I belong to several closed groups on facebook of women who have already had the DIEP and some have a great recovery and others run into complications. And the complications for some, are quite drastic. I pray to God that I will be one of the lucky ones without complications. But it's all in Gods hands. Do you have a date set yet for your surgery?",
