Thanks!  ",

Before Zometa, I had a follow up bone density from two years ago.  I expected that 5 months of chemo would have damaged my bones.  Not so!  I've had osteopenia for years, but not osteoporosis.  Of the 3 things they measure on bone density, hip, etc.., only one of the 3 went down one tiny tick.  The other two things actually improved a tick.  Go figure!  My MO's office warned me that because I do not have osteoporosis, I may have to pay for my infusions myself.  At most, insurance would have covered one of the two yearly visits, since there are only successful clinical trials on the effectiveness for it as a bc recurrence preventative.  In my Northern VA office, the cost to me will be $350.  I'm told it adds 3% against recurrence.  I will gladly pay that out of pocket if need be. \"MinusTwo 4 years ago my MO's plan was to put me on Zometa (already had osteopenia) once I finished chemo because there were studies that said it prevented bone mets\u2026 then at a conference another study said it didn't so she then decided against it. 6 months later a bigger study came out and proved it did but we never revisited the issue.\"",

Notbuyingit,  Your hair growth looks terrific.  So you add 1/2 cup diced onions to your bottle of Nioxin.  Is that right?  Notice that you don't have the white hair!  Did you color it? I have been using a product called Brow Lash on my brows only (comes in a silver tube kinda like mascara) which is applied with a thin brush.  It's the poor man's Latisse.  I'm afraid to use it on my eyelids (especially not now with eye infections) because I had a friend who used it and she had way, way too long lashes that looked almost creepy, plus there was discoloration under her eyes from it.  Just sayin.  I had sparse brows before all this and now they are practically non-existent.  I am putting on the Brow Lash though as it helped thicken them before chemo.  You can find the Brow Lash in Bed, Bath & Beyond.  I always have tons of 20% off coupons because they never expire (even though they have expiration dates), which brings the cost down to about $32.  One tube lasts for at least 3 months.  BTW, if you use any lash product on your brows, you should first go over them with a Q tip or something with alcohol on it and then pat dry before applying.  Heard this tip on TV as other creams and such will not permit the brow product to work properly. ",

My last chemo was July 24 - so I'm 13 weeks PFC and my growth is now at a standstill.  It was growing at an incredible 1/4\" per week, but has not grown any since it was measured on Oct 2.  What's with that!!  It's about 1 3/4\" on the sides and nape of neck and 1 1/2\" on the top.  Did anyone else experience a rapid growth and then a slow down?  And if so, how long did the slow down last? Also, lots of it is white tipped as the top quarter of it is white and the rest of it my normal color (as near as I can remember).  I am no where near feeling comfortable going out without a cap or my wig.  When it is long enough to go topless, I think I will color it, as I don't like this new salt & pepper look.  I asked my MO if it was OK - permanent or semi permanent hair color both fine.  Also, before my hair was straight as can be.  Now it kind of waves a bit in front near my hairline and seems straighter elsewhere.  So weird. I'm grateful to have hair, but long for my former hair.     ",

It never occurred to me to not buy a wig.  When a friend in my book club first joined, I recall her looking so pretty and thought her blonde hair was beautiful.  I had no idea until much later that she was going through chemo (same chemo as me) and that it was a wig.   She had cancer 13 years ago and had such a wonderful attitude.  She was one of the first people I contacted when I was diagnosed and knew I'd be losing my hair.  Hers was an expensive natural hair wig, and I knew immediately that's where I wanted to get my wig - cost be damned.  The experienced stylist there took a brown wig and highlighted it with several colors to look almost identical to my hair before chemo.  Most people at my church never knew that I was going through bc treatment because my wig looks so close to the way my hair used to look.  I long for my old hair, but realize it will probably be two years before I get it back to the way it was (if ever).  Meanwhile, I'm glad to be getting back any hair and am trying to do the best I can with it.  The only thing good about it is that it certainly is maintenance free:-)!! Another thing about this lovely friend from book club.  Her attitude was the greatest.  She (and another friend - 23 years out from bc) both had the same ACT I did, and both of them tolerated it very well.  They were my shining role models.  I never wanted to come to these threads until I was well in to my chemo, honestly because I didn't want to read of anyone else's bad experiences.  And when I did come to the threads and if someone was about to undergo chemo, fearful of the outcome, I told them of my positive experience.  I know everyone has a different story when it comes to chemo, and no one goes completely unscathed from it, but knowing of just one other person who did well is an amazing booster.  Back to the hair...I got my hair buzz cut 2 weeks to the day from first chemo and it didn't fall out until about 10 days after that.  It was empowering to loose my hair on my own terms.  When I was bald, it was winter and cold in the house.  I never walked around in the house without a cotton cap on and slept in a very lightweight cotton sleep cap.  If I went out, I wore my wig.  I have two very cute cotton stylish caps that I wore to chemo treatments and the like - places where I felt comfortable going without the wig.  I exercised nearly every day during treatment, sweated profusely, and wore cotton \"skull\" caps to the gym.  Today on the elliptical I was so darn hot even with the fan blowing on me, and I ripped that sucker off.  Felt great!  My regular gym friends are SO supportive, I don't care if they see me without the hat.  However, I don't want others who have only seen me with the wig without it until I'm completely comfortable with my new hair.  It will be awhile before I'm there - maybe another month or two.  The difference is drastic.  I've noticed that younger women feel more free to go without the wig or hat.  I met a late 40's woman who decided to go bald throughout her treatment.  She had very short hair when I met her, but I knew she had gone through chemo.  She told me later that every trip to the grocery store took longer because she would have about 5 people approaching her in the store and telling her they'd be praying for her.  Lol.  Needless to say, she's an awesome approachable person.  Bottomline, everyone is different and should do whatever makes her feel most comfortable.  All that said, I cannot wait until I no longer have to wear the wig all the time.  It looks great, but I'm SO tired of wearing it, and the first thing I do when I come is take it off.  ",

At this point (last chemo 7/24/14) my hair is so thick it has to be thinned out when I get haircuts so it will lay to the side, and with my new short do, I need to get a haircut every 4 weeks! I love and am embracing my short hair!! I feel like I will never go back to longer hair and my previous styling regime - 45 minutes! - to get my super straight hair to have some body and curve to it. This hair is effortless and takes me 5 minutes!! I now get it highlighted (you can see my dark roots-I'm due to get some more next visit). My immediate post-chemo hair was very curly in the front only - that curl has nearly grown out completely and I'm back to my straight hair. Its so short, that I need only to put some mousse in damp hair, blow it quickly dry (no styling required) and use a bit of a mini flat iron in front to make sure the ends are straight. I get lots of compliments, but what I love most is the ease of short hair. I can actually thank chemo for that. Who'd thunk it-:)! In my post professional career, I took up acting about 15 years ago. I could not submit for anything as long as I was in treatment for a year, my eyes were watering (thank you dry eyes post chemo, but now OK!) and funky post-chemo hair. But now I'm brave enough to audition when that rare opportunity presents itself (I'm 68). I've auditioned twice recently. Didn't get the first one (for Medicare) maybe because my hair was still kinda weird in the front. But, with this current look, I was cast in a national commercial at the second audition, which filmed last Monday! Yay!! So much fun. Don't know when or where it will air. I live in Northern VA & was told it will air on West coast. Want to give hope to all you ladies who are just post chemo and think you will never be happy with your hair again. You will. And a huge thank you to all of you who posted when I was bald and grew Yoda hair post chemo. Your posts got me through that phase.",

I don't know if I will keep it short forever, but one thing I do LOVE is that it only takes mere minutes to do my hair!  My pre-chemo hair was great, but it took about 30-40 minutes every morning to blow it dry, spray it within an inch of its life & use the curling iron all over.  Ugh.  I do not miss that one tiny bit!

She recommends that I get fitted for an LE sleeve and glove and that I wear them whenever I fly.  My first flight will be in Oct to go to Disney World with two granddaughters.  I'm getting the sleeve fitting tomorrow, so I'll have it in plenty of time.  I have no signs of LE so far, but it was good to know how to avoid (as much as you can) and what to look out for.  I already had some nice looser nylon non-underwire bras, but before I go any further in treatment, I found some 95% cotton sports bras at Walmart at a bargain price - 2 for $10.95.  Cotton is preferred as being kinder to the radiated breast.  Good luck to all of us as we begin our treatments.",

I had been going to an acupuncturist once a week during Taxol, and after finding an NIH study which showed that it could also be effective in helping with radiation fatigue, I've continued to go once a week.  Maybe it's just psychological, but I feel it has helped.  I see my RO after every Monday's appointment.  This past Monday, I asked the nurse how long I could expect some fatigue post rads.  She said 4-6 weeks, which really surprised me.  THEN I asked the RO the same question, and got a totally different response.  He said that was not accurate, that the TGF Beta (which causes the fatigue) in rads only stays in your system for 10-12 days, so any fatigue should be gone in two weeks post rads.  I liked that answer a whole lot better and that's the one I'm going with:-).  I also asked if the boosts (last 8 treatments) lessen fatigue since you are getting less of the radiation.  Answer - No. Several weeks into rads my rash got worse and coincidentally I had a dermatologist check up later that day.  She prescribed a compound mixture of Aquaphor (480 gm with about 1/8 of it removed), mixed with two tubes of a steroid ointment - fluocinide .05%.  As my derm predicted, insurance had a problem w/this being mixed at the pharm, but she told me exactly how to do it and it worked like a charm.  I used it with the permission of my RO.  Previously, I had been using Calendula cream & ointment only.  Now that I'm in boosts and the rash has cleared up, I'm back to using the Calendula cream only - twice a day.  My skin is a little pinkish but in pretty good shape. Wishing any newbies and all in treatment the very best! Paula  ",

One of my friends from book club who went through ACT 12 years ago (still cancer free!) swears that the chemo does something flattering to your skin.  Really??  She says that she was constantly complimented on her skin while going through it.  If true, very weird silver lining.  Lol",

I started the actual radiation treatments one week ago today (exactly 2 weeks PFC), so I've had 6 sessions and so far, so good - but that's what I would expect early in the game.  I basically did well on chemo, so I'm hoping and praying that rads will go well too.  That's my philosophy until proven otherwise!  The set up session was a piece of cake, then went back the day before the first actual treatment to make sure the measurements were correct.  My rads are an easier commute than chemo - only about a 15 minute drive.  Door to door, the whole thing takes me about 45 minutes total.  I put on Calendula cream 2-3 x a day (once immediately after rads--so they recommend you have 2 bottles & just keep one in your purse) & the ointment version of it at night.  I told my RO that it was hard to spread and she said since I'm small breasted at least for now, I really only have to put on the cream at night too.  Several months ago, I posted some on the Spring 2014 Rads thread because I wanted to see what's coming.  So I will look for the Summer & Fall Rads threads.  Haven't noticed them?? I thought I'd made a post somewhere about my port removal two days ago in the surgeon's office (rather than the hospital), but don't think it posted for some reason.  It was so easy.  I put lidocaine on the port area few hrs before, still felt some stinging from the Novacaine, but the actual removal was quick and painless.  My husband held my hand throughout.  Didn't have to go to the hospital fasting and run the risk of getting an infection there, not to mention the aftereffects of twilight sleep.  The suggestion of getting an education and baseline arm and hand measurements from an LE PT is a good one.  Mine was a few months ago, and I have an appointment to have a sleeve and glove fitted next Monday.  I was told to wear it proactively when I fly - my first time will be in early Oct.  Don't know about orange eyelids someone mentioned, but did have swollen ones, and eye doc confirmed I had an infection in both eyes a week ago - used steroid eye drops 4 x day & infection gone today.  Lost all my eyelashes - again - and thought maybe that clogged up ducts caused swelling, but she said No & to use hot compresses for that.  Eye infection = no liner which makes me look like an alien.  My whitish stand up hair is growing, and I've decided it makes me look exactly like Yoda - the little guy from the Star Wars movie.  Lol!  ",
