I had just had my 2nd child and noticed that my left breast was leaking a bloody discharge. i let it go a few days and then went to my dr. she said it must have been an infection and put me on antibiotics. So the bloodiness went away and i was left with a clear discharge that i thought was normal. i was bad i never did self exams and didnt pay much attention i felt i was too young...( now i regret that) so the clear discharge has continued since then and my left breast now kinda hurts but not all of the time. Also my left breast and nipple have become very itchy, my left nipple has even cracked and is bloody where it did so. im really scared. i went to my PCP and she drew blood, and also did a culture of the discharge to look for abnormal cells. she did yell at me and told me that i should have came sooner which kinda scared me even more. anyways she found a small lump on my breast and has referred me to dr weiner, in phoenixville pa? his website says that he is an advisor on this website so im hoping hes a great doc. all of my blood test have came back normal, so my pcp doesnt think that its a hormonal issue though i assume its still possible? im really really nervous and dont know what to think or expect. my appt is july 3rd with dr weiner and im anxious, yet very very scared of what he may have to say. if you have a story similar to mine and wouldnt mind sharing, or you have advice please share with me. thank you in advance, it means alot this group is keeping me strong....fingers crossed....
