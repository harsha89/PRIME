Partial mastectomy end of September, where they knocked out a tooth, gave me a fat lip and dropped me. Saw the primary oncologist and he said the tumor had doubled in size due to the surgery delay, and was now stage II-sent me for a PET scan-showed hilar lymph node (one) involvement, radiology report stated: probable metastasis, breast radiation no longer indicated. The interventional radiologist said a biopsy was not possible due to the size and location of the node, so they agreed to radiation to the breast, just in case it was not mets, and two weeks later, the radiation oncologist sent me for a CT, which showed 2 lymph node involvement and now a nodule in the lung. Biopsy can not be done unless they open me up. The primary onc and I talked. We both agreed this is stage IV and that open biopsy is too risky. Also, continuation of breast radiation would compromise any future lung radiation, so I stopped the radiation and started arimidex. I have diabetes, COPD, asthma, HTN, current fibromyalgia flare, am post failed C-spine grafts, also had two 10 pound tumors (non-cancerous) removed from my uterus, so am not healthy to begin with. Went to have disability paperwork completed (cannot work right now) and my PCP and I argued. She said there is nothing in my chart to indicate metastatic breast cancer and that without the biopsy, cannot put it on the disability paperwork. Told her I am not risking my life so that they can fill out a death certificate with the cause of death being metastatic breast cancer. She insists that this might be 2 distinct cancers and not metastatic disease.  This is all making me crazy! The arimidex has caused my legs to swell X 2 normal size, headache and have had a cough since the radiation. I am exhausted and can barely walk and it seems that every step of this has been a fight- not with the disease, but with the lack of coordination on the part of the doctors. Each doctor says something different. Worse, I work for this medical corporation and feel like they are killing me with all of the stress, etc. I have another CT on Monday, but at this point, am frustrated beyond belief- I need some advice and possible suggestions- Does everyone go through this or am I just lucky? I feel like I have no control---and now they are compromising my money, too, not just my health. Log in to post a reply",
