      "Content": "Jul 3, 2011 08:04PM - edited Jul 3, 2011 08:08PM by mollie4 HI, I'm new to the site, & wondered if anyone had a hypersensitivity reaction to the Taxotere. I've had 2 cycles of T/C, & 2 reactions, in spite of the Decadron. Had to get to get extra IV Benadryl & Steroids, after the reactions, but then was able to tolerate the infusions at a slower rate. Now my Onc. wants me to switch to Adriomycin, for the next 2 cycles, which I'm probably going to refuse. I already have some heart issues, & I'm not crazy about starting a Med. that can cause heart failure. Anyone have any advice?",

That time I just had chest pressure, slightly less flushing of neck & face, & a slight feeling that I couldn't take a deep breath. Both times they stopped the infusion, I was given additional IV Benadryl & IV Solu-cortef, & the infusions restarted @ a slower rate, which I tolerated without any further difficulty.",
