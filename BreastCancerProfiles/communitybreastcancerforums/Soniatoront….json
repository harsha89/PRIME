We have a group of ladies from all of the world who have this pain followed the surgery and the post mastectomy radiation and chemotherapy. I would like to invite you, who have this pain to our wonderful group, where each of us tells about the treatments, their outcome and a place where we can vent The FB address is https://www.facebook.com/groups/759940397434876/ I am in Richmond Hill, Canada and I had my mastectomy on Febr 2010, but the pain started one year after the surgery! The level of the pain was 6-7/10 and sometimes ( rainy days) jumped to 8-9/10 Currently I am under medication with 1200 mg/day Gabapentine (Neurontin) Cesamet=nabilone pharmaceutical marijuana, and slow release Oxycodone ( one a day, 5mg/2.5 mg naloxone for bowel motion improvement) Also I have a compounding cream with a mix of Lidocaine/Ketamine/amytriptilline/ketoprofen and clonidine. The cream I apply when the burning of the skin (allodinia) is unbearable. It helps until the next medication. For ex. I apply it at 5 pm and the medicine I take at 7.30 pm If you have questions, please write me at soniatoronto2010@gmail.com Gentle hug Sonia",
