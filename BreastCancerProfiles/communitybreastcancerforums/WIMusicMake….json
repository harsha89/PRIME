Finding out I need chemo was harder for me than my diagnosis of breast cancer. I am discovering that the anticipation of every procedure is much more difficult than going through each procedure. I hope that is the case for chemo too! I had my chemo class today and it helped calm, but did not totally diminish, my fears. I looked at some hats today and I am just not ready to buy any yet. I am determined that I will do fine. I will continue to exercise as much as possible and my doctor and nurses will help me with everything else. Good luck to everyone and I will pray we all have minimal SE. ",

I guess I can expect more nausea then I did on T/C as I picked up a prescription for Emend and instead of starting steroids today, I start them tomorrow. Cross your fingers for me that all goes well. As more and more ladies are losing your hair I wanted to share with you a hat I found at Target that I LOVE! It is made by Champion and it wicks moisture away from your head. I wear it when I go walking and even around the house. I also wear it under other hats. It is so comfortable and feels nice on my head! I bought a black one but I think there were a few other colors. Also if you sew or know someone who sews, I have been making bandanas in all sorts of fun fabric in a finished size of 30x30. I am going to make one with snowflakes on it next. I ordered some hats from tlc and found they did not fit quite right. One last thing, with the extra week off from chemo, I have noticed my nails and hair are growing like crazy. There is hope for all of us after chemo! We will not be hairless forever! ",

I thought I would share in case some of you are as sick of plain water as I am! MRBerton I feel your pain! This last time I had horrible acne on my scalp. I did put a Neutrogena product on it called Clear Complextion and it seemed to help a little. It will clear up. I am 13 days post last treatment and my head is all clear. I have been very lucky in that I have not had any mouth sores-one of the few side effects I have not experienced! I use Biotene toothpaste and mouth wash. I brush every time after I eat. I also suck on ice during treatment. A quote I found that hit home with me is this: \"You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have\". I wish you all strength today!",

I am really happy for those finishing chemo and others with just good news! My heart echo came back and nothing has changed with my heart-yeah! But is doesn't explain the tightness I am feeling in my chest. Is anyone else on A/C feeling a tightness or heaviness on your chest? I think my doctor thinks I am crazy. Due to all the problems I have been having, he is going to let me decide if I want to continue chemo-ugh! I am scheduled for November 29. I am leaning toward trying it one more time and if I have the same trouble or worse stopping after that. It is weighing heavy on my mind. For Thanksgiving I usually have my side of the family (25-30 people) over to my house. This year it will just be my husband and three kids. We are going to make the dinner together. We are going to keep it simple and enjoying our time begin with each other. Of course we will be watching the Packer/Lions Game! Since I am lucky enough to not be working during this, I have found several TV shows to watch during the day. A new show that I really like is called The Chew. It has 5 different hosts who make many different recipes each show. When you feel like eating or cooking, I highly recommend you check out their website for recipes. They have had many recipes for Thanksgiving the past two weeks. I am off to conferences for my daughter. She is a great student and it will be fun to hear all the nice things about her! I hope everyone has a great day! ",

I am worried about being up for it when I go back. I am also very concerned about insurance now. I did have to complain to my insurance company because they were denying payment on both of my ER visits. It was sorted out once I complained to my HR department and they are now going to cover them.

I hope for all of us a healthy year filled with making great memories with family and friends. Thanks again for helping me get through it all. Mary ",

My radiation planning session was also scheduled and we talked about my return to work. YEAH! It is the start of going back to some normalcy in my life. Yesterday went well. I was not as \"fuzzy\" headed after which felt good. I did have a lot of nausea last night and had to break down and take a compazine on top of the Emend and Zofran. Aside from waking up to go to the bathroom several times, I slept pretty well. So I am crossing my fingers and toes that the nausea can continue to be controlled. My DH asked me what I wanted for Christmas. It would be really hard for him to give me a cure for cancer, or an easier treatment than chemo. Anyone else having a hard time coming up with a Christmas list? The things I want won't fit under the tree! Just being together with the kids and enjoying our time together will be enough.  I know many of us have treatment this week. I wish all of you minimal SE and I hope everyone else is doing okay. Have a great day! ",

Seabrook-I am achy but only when I start walking after I have been sitting. I walk it out after a minute or so. It is getting better each week. My MO said this is to be expected and it should get better with time and yoga/stretching would help. My aches got worse-about a month or so after chemo-before they started to get better. I have been going \"topless\" on my head since my last day of radiation. My hair is starting to grow very fast and is about an inch long on top. It is very straight so far. My last chemo was on 12/27. I have taken 4 doses of tamoxifen and am doing fine. I hope that continues. Last fall my husband and I planted over 300 bulbs.

The drip was started very slowly and they kept increasing the speed. I did very well until they put it up to full speed and my arm started to tingle and my chest felt like a heavy weight was placed on it. The nurse pushed benedryl into my iv and I felt better instantly. The cytoxan went well and took only an hour. I was sleepy from the benedryl so I slept through most of it. I am feeling tired and my stomach feels a little funny. Also my cheeks flushed for most of the day. That is a reaction to the steroids!

After crashing yesterday from stopping the steroids, I awoke feeling pretty good this morning. I am holding my breath that this feeling lasts throughout the day. When I went in to get the neulasta shot at the hospital the nurse was wonderful. She explained it hurts because the medicine is suspended in alcohol and that stings. As soon as it started to sting, she stopped injecting, let the sting go away and then slowly gave me the rest of the shot. It did not hurt at all! I hope all of you have people as compassionate giving you your shots!  To those who are still waiting for your first tx know that it is totally doable. You will get through this. The drugs they give you do work. Make sure you take them. The claritin is doing the trick for me also. Some things that have helped me the past few days include: I have taken a walk every day. It was nearly impossible to drag myself out the door the past two days, but I felt so much better once I took the walk. Throughout the day when I start feeling achy again I go and walk around outside the house. Keep moving! Biotene toothpaste and rinse has been great. My taste always seems to change for the worse as the day goes on but these keep my mouth feeling fresh. Dentyne cinnamon gum has helped and Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Cookies have been great for the taste and feel good on the stomach. Smartwater has been a life saver the past two days! st jude I hope you have a good time driving-a little bit of gaining your freedom back is always a good thing.  Tappy I hope your port feels better soon. I found the chemo class to be very informative and helped to lessen my fears. Carla I hope you can find the right combination of drugs to help you through this. LoriKristine I hope you woke up like me this morning and feel more like your normal self. Perts1 my only advice is know you can do this. Take it one day at a time and put one foot in front of the other.  We are strong and we do this!! I hope you all of you have a wonderful day! ",

I have been talking to someone on staff at the hospital as it is a part of the treatment plan if you choose to do it and I chose it. She has been very helpful to me. The A/C was A LOT easier on my system than the T/C except for the breathing problems. I am feeling less pressure on my chest with each passing day. I can't help but feel like I am being played a bit. Somewhere in the oncologist play book is a chapter in \"give the patient some control and it will make them feel better about chemo\". My onco knows I will keep going. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't give this everything I can. So on Nov. 29 I will go in and get #3 and then I will see what happens and make a decision on #4 (which I will end up getting too). I am going to decide in my mind that I am done with ER visits and overnight hospital stays. I am stronger than this #%$%@!%@ chemo!!!!! I can keep 70 middle schoolers at one time engaged in their learning (I am a middle school band director) chemo is not going get me down. I have become a mad woman about washing my hands, using hand sanitizer and yelling at people in my house for doing things like reaching into pretzel bags and cheese bags with their hands. I want everyone to use spoons or pour things into bowls! Are you making plans-thinking about what you will do differently in the future? I am spending a lot of time thinking about this. Of course I have been thinking about being a better person, having more patience, stop worrying about things you can't control or silly things, and taking more risks but what else do you want to do?? I don't think I shared before that my husband and I planted over 300 bulbs in our yard in September. I can't wait for spring to see them open up! I also am thinking about places I want to travel. Over spring break just my husband and I are going to take a train ride down to Chicago and spend a few nights. Then I am looking at: Key West, Alaska, Bahamas or some beautiful islands in that area, Charleston NC, Hawaii, traveling up and down the east coast starting in Maine. Notice the water/beach theme?? Then with more time to save $$$-London, Paris, Austria, Italy. What are you planning?? I hope you are feeling well and have a great day!",

I am sorry you were in the hospital but so glad you are out and feeling better!  I have not experienced watery eyes, but my nose is constantly running! I had a radiation planning meeting today. One of the biggest surprises is they really do not want me to go back to work full time but part time is okay! I was anticipating going back to work some time in late January. She said that I would really need an afternoon nap by the 3rd or 4th week. Also I am eligible for a clinical trial that deals with the amount and length of radiation. Instead of 61/2 weeks, it would only be 3 weeks but at a higher intensity. More decisions to make!!! FYI to any of you who are going to radiation after chemo, they said they will start radiation 3-4 weeks after my last chemo which is on Dec 27 for me! I think all of us are going to have ups and downs during this process. Think of everything we have been through from the diagnosis, surgery, chemo, and the constant waiting for test results and the next appointment! We need to give ourselves some slack right now and when we are through treatment and better healed we can start living our life in a better way! Every day we wake up we can start all over again! I wish all of you beautiful, brave, and bald women a joyous holiday season! Thank you for being here and sharing your experiences as we go through this journey together.",

I was given an increase dose of prilosec and I hope that takes care of the acid reflux.  I went to my radiation mapping today. I am now sporting 5 small tatoos on my back! For those heading to radiation next, it was a breeze. I start on January 25. The 4th chemo dose has really kicked my butt! I usually feel so much better my now. At least everything I am feeling is not too bad and I can put up with it. My return date for work was set today at January 23. I am only going back part time until a few weeks after radiation. I am so excited! The walls in my house are closing in on me. My DH and I have been getting on each others nerves. I want to start gaining that part of my life back. I also think the students will help with my recovery. Middle schoolers are a blast! My DD reminded me today that some of them will ask me where I've been the past 5 months, even though I have been very open about my cancer and sent multiple messages to them! Have a great night!

I will not be allowed to go back to work full time until one month after my last rad. I have not heard of people in the US staying anywhere during rads unless they live really far away from their treatment center.  St. Jude I hope you are feeling better today. I am 18 days pfc and I have a five o'clock shadow of hair all over my head. It actually starting growing a bit before my last chemo. The top is a bit longer than the sides-maybe 1/8 an inch long. I find myself putting my hand up and rubbing my new hair all the time. Losing my hair was the saddest part of my experience and it makes me very happy to see it growing back!  We had our first major snow storm in WI yesterday and it is beautiful outside. I was happy I didn't have to drive in it!  10 more days until I return to work! I have never been as excited to go to work! I hope everyone is feeling well today! Mary ",

I am sorry you have this problem too.  My right eye twitched a lot during chemo and it continued for the first 4 weeks after I was done, but it has not twitched in weeks. I still need to take prilosec every day. After my last chemo I had to double my dose because my stomach felt like popcorn was popping! I tried to go back to my 1/2 dose at the beginning of February and my stomach still couldn't handle it. I wonder how long I will have to keep taking it?  My husband and I finally went out to celebrate being done with chemo last weekend. I had my first drink in months-it is a favorite of mine-it didn't taste good to me. Maybe someone is trying to tell me not to drink! Take care! Mary ",

On A/C I did not have the energy to exercise and I spent a lot of my time watching TV and napping. Yesterday (day 7) was the first day I felt up to being active.  As far a nausea, I was told I could continue to take Zofran as long as I felt nauseous. Zofran only takes about 20 minutes to start working and I found it to be very helpful.  I also have gained weight this round. I am constantly hungry and what I want to eat is carbs!

Your head does feel a lot better once the hair is gone. I asked my beautician about caring for a bald head and she told me to still use shampoo and conditioner. My head was really tender at first but as it has been exposed it is less sensitive. I have to confess I have been holding out on you. I was waiting for my appointment today. I had my 2nd chemo on 11/1. It was my first A/C because I was allergic to T/C. On day 3 post chemo I started to get a tightness in my chest. It continued off and on over the next few days until it got so bad I was having trouble breathing and made a trip into the ER. After getting some oxygen, having many tests and 6 hours of time, I was sent home. Over the past few days, I have felt the tightness off and on. Today at my doctor's appointment it was decided I will have another heart echo next week and delay treatment a week to Nov 29 to hopefully allow the tightness to go away. Depending on the results of the echo and how I am feeling I might end up stopping chemo. The echo may decide it for me if there is some kind of damage. I would still have 6 1/2 weeks of rads and tamoxifen. I would be lying if I didn't say that I am doing jumping jacks at the possibility of never having chemo and terrified at the possibility of not completing my chemo regimen! So I will be playing the waiting game to see what the next step will be for me..... Here's hoping this evening finds all of you well with minimal side effects. ",

I am sending good wishes and prayers your way. Let us know what happens. Carla I finished 7 of 33 rads today. So far it has been a breeze. The actual appointment takes 5 minutes. I have been faithfully using the lotion they gave me. I am tired but I really think it is more from going back to work than it is from the radiation. This has been much easier than chemo! Fran-I am not sure what questions to ask! I will have that same appointment in another 6 weeks.  Take care everyone!  Mary",

First the tumor grade is important because it determines how fast the tumor grows and also how well it reacts to chemo and other treatments. With grade 3 tumors, they are fast growing, but because they grow fast, they respond well to chemo.   One test that might be suggested is an Oncotype. I encourage you to have this test done. It will give the doctors more information about how well your cancer will respond to chemo and it might even help to determine that chemo will not benefit you. I wish you the best. Your doctor will determine a course of treatment for you and you can have some input. Don't hesitate to get a second opinion. Being in No. Ill, there are many good facilities. I am in WI but contemplated going to Northwestern. Good Luck!",

I have a radiation simulation planned for January 5 and will start 2 weeks or so after that. ilovetennis-I will be on my stomach for rads to try to avoid any damage to heart, lungs and ribs. You might want to see if that is an option for you. I am also a middle school teacher and have been out all year. I was hoping to go back full time with the start of second semester at the end of January but my radiation oncologist thinks I should go back part time. She said I will be too tired! I am also eligible for a clinical trial and am trying to decide if I should join. I would be put into one of two treatments-one would be the traditional 6 1/2 weeks of rads or the other would be an accelerated 3 week program with a slightly higher dose every day and a boost at my tumor site. I guess the shortened 3 week program is something that is done in Canada and UK but is not standard yet in the US.   Chemo has not been a easy for me so I am hoping rads will be so much better! I too, am looking forward to a wonderful 2012! ",

It sounds more uncomfortable than it is.  Lucille-what subject/grade do you teach? newsksmom-think of your MO as your primary care physician for your breast cancer. Even though you will be working with the RO first, after you are done with radiation your MO will be the doc you see for all your follow up appointments for years to come. I also think they want you to meet the whole team at first. Have a great day! Mary ",

FYI the mold gets really warm so don't have on your wool pants and socks! They did a cat scan, marked my body, put 5 tatoos on my back and a piece of tape on my breast. I was most worried about the tatoos hurting and they didn't! I do have to keep a piece of tape on my breast for the duration and that seems like it might be a pain. I was given a special cream that I am supposed to start using today. It is called Restore. I will not be starting until January 25 partly to enable me to recover from my last chemo and because my doctor is leaving. She is trying to get all the initial planning and appointments in for all the patients she started. I have been off of work since my surgery, I am a teacher, and I will be going back part time on January 23 and I CAN'T WAIT!!! I am a band director and I will get to see all of my 7th and 8th graders. I miss then so much!  Good luck to everyone! Mary ",
