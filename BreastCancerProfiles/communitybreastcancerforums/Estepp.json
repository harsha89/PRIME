It really hurt as my period came close. I was told , a long time ago.. they could take it out for me and that would rid the pain... but if I just left it in there it would stop hurting on its own as my body stopped producing estrogen. Estrogen spikes is what makes them hurt. I remember if I would have three glasses of wine at a party.. WOW.. hurt hurt hurt... now I know alcohol spike estrogen... Well.. YEAR later I got BC... and I had them take the healthy breast too.. the one with the fibro... so.. no more pain for me... I did not have hormone positive BC either.. I was 100% Her2. Anyway...

They do not have to continue and you can ask to have an IV sedation. She said that some woman do have pain do to their liver not processing the pain meds.. etc.. so, I know.. I will never have pain like that again. AND.. I was told by her to DEMAND it. And trust me. I will. She will sedated me for everything I need in the future. EVERYTHING.. and I will demand it. About 10 % of woman have this pain she told me... and I believe her. So you will most likely be ok. If you feel any pain with the first  biopsy.. and they are doing another.. you demand IV or some type of sedation.. the kind they give a person while a colonoscopy  (sp) or like when you have a tooth pulled. They will sedate you for the whopping ten-15 min.. numb you WHILE sedated i and then you wake up.. right after.. YOU WILL BE FINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Question.. when you got a filling or a tooth pulled.. did the Novocaine numb you? If so.. you probably will not have any pain with this. If you did have that pain.. then you might wanna tell them you want a little IV sedation PRIOR.. I have gotten REALLY tough in the past week of my life. I will never let pain happen to me again.. not when it can be prevented! DEMAND what you need! If you look at the posts I have posted in this past month.. you will see I am getting much stronger! Thanks to the women on here and KNOWLEGDE! YOU WILL TOO !!!!!!!! Do not be scared of the pain of this.. if you know these fast ahead of time.. you can make SURE you have no pain. If they tell you... you will be fine and have no pain.. they are probably right 90% of the time.. but if you are like me.. 10% chance is bull @%&#! So I would not allow it! You have that right! Even my beautiful PCP told me that if she had known, that I has this small chance of pain,. SHE would have demanded it for me! Remember.. this time is SOOOOO scary for you, but you are in the the drivers seat... your call, your way! You are going to be FINE! Muster up the tough @#$ that I did not have three weeks ago when I was you.. You can ask for temp. sedation.. AGAIN>> YOU CAN ASK FOR TEMP SEDATION! mine was ultrasound guided.. they could see exactly where they were in me.. and I should have been more proactive! Let us know.. I will PRAY for you , for your peace and for your strength to demand what you want. I am sorry this is so long.. but I just did this and I am MAD at myself for not taking control of that moment. I did not bruise and I have no pain now... never really did after.. I had three biopsies at the same visit..it was only those few minutes..and I know now, I am worth those few minutes and have my PCP and now breast surgeon saying I was worth those minutes too. YOU WILL DO FINE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love and peace ! Laura",

I was told that the compression garment's I have can be worn to bed, and it is a good thing. The airplane garments is never to be worn to bed., and is really only good for plane travel. You all have SO much more info that I am being given. I LOVE my LE specialist. She has been a specialist in this for the past 10 yrs. I wonder why I am not told about a \" night time garment\" and I have no hand gauntlet(sP).. my hand is just wrapped with the daily wrap. My hand has never swollen. My LE PT told me that I will never swell big. No one but CLOSE family could ever tell I had this. PT told me that she will never let me get to a point anyone could tell. WHY do I read so many different things on BCO threads about this. All the different wraps.. and the shirts for trunkel LE.. like I have. I got all my swelling down in two weeks of wrapping. Maybe this is why. All my measurements are normal again... and I will continue this therapy for 4 more weeks. Then.. I use the wrapping as a home treatment if needed. This is what I am told.",

You have to tell your doctor that you cannot deal with doing this, yet know you have to... so you not only want the numbing of the area... but you want the same twilight they give colonoscopy patients. I just HAD to tell you they do this... they may tell you.. \" oh... it does not hurt... and it only take 15 min,,\" You tell them right back that you are glad it only takes 15 min... and that you know that the PREP work to get you under twilight also ONLY takes about 15 min.

I have settled with the drugs that do not cause me issues. Flexural at bedtime allows my painful sleeping body to sleep 7-9 hours a night. Ultram ( pain med) taken 3 times a day, allows me to live and function with a low pain level of about 2. I was an 8 daily and I thought I would go insane. I have WAY to may people who depend upon me , so going insane was not an option. Ultram is a non narcotic. It may not work for everyone. but it did me. I take them as I need them.. and do not fear being hooked on them. Heck, when my doctor saw how well they worked for me.. he gave me a script for 180 a month of these pills....lol.. I HATED needed to take pills to Rose. And I seem to be known at my Cancer Center ( as told to me, by my PT) as a tough cookie...   I now keep my pills with me at all times... If I feel pain coming on even a tiny bit.. I take a pill. I REFUSE not to have at least 80% quality of life. REFUSE. It will be ok. I was offered Lyrica.. Cymbalta..etc.. and I personally refused. But my situation might be different. If one of those drugs gave me 30% better life... well.... my other drugs that I was willing to take give me about 80% better life.. so I a ok with that. God Bless ALL you sweethearts in pain. Someday... future sisters will not deal with this. I hope we see it in our lifetimes ! Laura",

I would have put a port in my arm before my chest. I could not have a PicLine in the arm as I am like you.. Her 2+.. which means many treatments.... But I think.. the port in the arm would be do much better. I am almost done with everything.. and when I wear a strapless.. you can see my litte scar..

With the cancer I have, it is not such a local recurrence we are afraid of, but we still could get yet another type of cancer later... so many choices to make.

And out of the older living and deceased ones, not one passed before age 80. Do to 1 node involvement, I am having Bone,chest.. etc scans next Wednesday.. and staring Chemo right away after knowing these test. Chemo should end in Dec. Then she will do a bi-lat saving all my skin and have the PS of my choice put my implants in. I will not have scaring she said.. only where the nipple was.. and tattooing will cover that. She said I will only look like I have had augmentation. I do not know if I will have rads... WOW.. anyone of you had this.. or.. had the bi-lat with implants.. I am a B now and she said she is sure I can go to a C cup.. but might put in B cup fills to start to fill my breast out to look like they do now.. and fill them over two months to get C's. How does all this sound to you? I am at the St Lukes Breast Cancer center here.. this is all they do. ..I have the best insurance here.. and so I pick this center.  All the Nurses I met today were 4-15 year survivors and boy.. it was a great experience as far as it goes. I love my surgeon. She is aggressive and told me he was treating the cancer and that it is curable.. she wants to be this way so that she never has to see me in 10-20 yrs with s recurrence. She cannot grade my cancer as surgery will be after Chemo.. what she knows now and cans see now.. I am a stage ll... we will know more after scans.. and the \"clean out\" as she calls it. She said it is like taking a small hole ( size of my nipple) taking out all the inside..all nodes needed.. and putting in a new breast. I will not have scars across my chest.

I take Ultram only during the day. I admit, I can still feel ALL 18 pressure points, ALL THE TIME. I am aware. But the actual PAIN in these 18 hot spots is a level 2-3. I personally can deal with this. I was a pain level of 6-7 all the time.. 24/7...... soooooooooo a 2/3 is like the common headache to me. Think about this cocktail for yourself.
