Going for the wig on Thursday - we live in a small city, so I hope they have a decent selection. I agree about the bald thing. It would be a lot easier to accept if I could keep my hair. Some of the other side effects sound like pregnancy to me - but they were tolerable because they meant I was having a baby, not receiving cytotoxic drugs! But being bald is a different story all together. Makes it all public, even with a wig. I'm confused about the low white cell counts - can I go to the mall? See my granddaughter? Do I have to be a hermit to avoid getting an infection?",

I called the nurse and she said to drink plenty of fluids and watch my temp - which is fine. I wouldn't be giving this a second thought if I wasn't on chemo. Also find I'm very weepy. Could be the steroids (finished those last night). A friend told me that when she was on steroids for Crohns, she would cry at home improvement shows - so touching when they see their new house! I think I'm going to lay low today. No nausaeu though. I guess so far so good, but what a trip!",

It wasn't so bad, better than watching it fall out over the next week, at least to me. It feels like another step towards the post-cancer diagnosis me, a different me. Lots more scars, but hopefully stronger. Courage, chemo sisters.",

Sometimes I have felt very alone and have to come to terms with this, because a large part of it is singular. It was me who had to have the surgery, tests, treatments.

Perhaps if this would have been considered as a real risk factor, I would have been having ultrasounds/MRIs every year and this would have been caught sooner. But, I can't go there for too long - it could have been caught later as well and mine was found in a regular mammogram. I hope that this \"upgrades\" screening for women with dense breasts though.
