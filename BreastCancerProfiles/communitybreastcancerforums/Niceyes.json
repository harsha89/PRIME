    "Content": "Niceyes wrote: Hi All. I am writing here just to share my thoughts and hope to get some advice. Sorry in advance about my English. it is not my mother tongue :-) I am 42, diagnosed with BC left( carcinoma ) CT1, CN0 CMO G2. In February 2017 when I was diagnosed, the tumor was 17 X 15 mm. I did some non mainstream treatment like whole body hyperthermia, IPT with low dose chemo. 3 courses of of iscador injections. I don't eat meat, just chicken and fish maybe once a week, no sugar. Lost my weight from 69 kg to 62 kg ( and I am 182 cm). The tumor was positive, in June my periods stopped. The recent pet scan showed that the tumor reduced up to 13 X 11 mm. No metastasis. I am at a loss what to do now. Obviously, the IPT and stuff costs heaps of money and I don't want to spend the rest of my life shrinking the tumor. I want to do double mastectomy, refuse the chemo. Please, let me know what you ladies think. I have somebody to live for. My little son and a husband. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
