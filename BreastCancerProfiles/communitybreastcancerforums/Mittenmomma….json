Peace and hugs",

Surgery to remove breast done March 9, 2009. I need a couple hair cuts, getting half off day before and shaving the rest before next apt. I do bookkeeping at home which will help, I can work in p.j.'s if I want, but hope I will be able to keep up with my work load. Thank you for sharing your experience(s), thoughts, and helpful antidotes.  Any ideas how to keep from having chemo brain? Don't want to lose my job.",

The women that poked right thru all three said it \"wasn't her\" so she said on the 3rd one she would go get someone else, at that point I did tear and tell her I was only able to use that arm, other arm had nodes removed and is prone to lympodemia & not going to chance it.  I also informed her I was getting upset since it is exactly 6 weeks from my surgery and I don't want to get behind, I want my chemo on time, not only that, I couldn't see trying to get in at this late date to have a port put in just for 4 treatments. Luckily someone else came in, she took a look at the back of my hand and wrist and said \"wow, what a war zone\", when I had her explain what a blown vein was I just gulped, I told her I had never ever had one before, she added \"you have great veins\".  Needless to say, I will be requesting her by name, and will even be calling ahead to be certain not to get the other women. Hope non of you have to go through that, and as an added precaution, don't let a newbie go more than one vein. Not worth the upset, the bruise, or risk. I appreciate being able to share, hope this wasn't too gross for anyone, and I do hope it will prevent any of you from the same bad start. Now to lighten it up, Saturday I stressed my self out, bit of a melt down, then Monday I felt awesome; cut my hair half off; very cute till it falls out, went for a saline fill, and started the steroids day before chemo; those 3 things are better than antidepresents! Hoohah!",

( go key word).  Also, Nico 1012 (BTW thank you) mentioned the American Cancer Society has announced that compazine is not adequate to treat chemo nausea, they recommend using it with the addition of either Emendo or Zofran.  I will be asking my onc to call one of them in for me, tomorrow will be day 3 and I expect what I had will wear off.  Sending big wishes for comfort speedily to you, Mittenmomma",
