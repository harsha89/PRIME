I did start taking iron so I hope it helps. No wonder I have no energy and I am a high energy person so it's been hard. Traii- I loved the pictures on FB, so glad you had a great time.

Yes it was higher than the protocol but not by much and it did go down not up. Again she said a lot of Oncologist don't run them due to the fact that they can read high for any reason.  Not sure if my new one runs them I will find out Sept 10th.  I don't mind having a scan I just didn't want to have it done by my old oncologist.  Back in March I did go to another oncologist within the same group she agreed on the 6 treatments instead of 4, but I just think the entire group is not that great! Out here in California Scripps is a wonderful place.  She is with Scripps and specializes in Breast and Ovarian Cancer.  My good friend went to her 10 years ago.  Debbie was 41 at the time and she was ER-PR- HER2+.  This was before Herceptin so Dr Kroener put her in the trial for Herceptin and she is a 10 year survivor!  She wanted me to go to this Dr when I was first diagnosed but my group was closer to home and I just thought it would be easier.  Just out of curiosity, how many of you have Tumor Markers done at your check ups?  OK enough about me.  I need to read to catch up on everyone.  Have a wonderful weekend.

So my surgeon did do a Axillary node dissection.  He took 22 nodes and they were all negative. When I went in after surgery to see my Oncologist he told me the pathology report had good news, turns out I do have some hormone recepts so I am not a true TN.  My entire treatment plan changed.   Now only 4 cycles of Chemo and only Taxotere and Cytoxan.  I have a Chemo class on Wedneday so I plan on asking a lot of questions..  Still kinda sore from surgery two weeks ago but not too bad.",

IDC I really wasn't surprised.  The hardest thing was telling the kids.  Two married daughters and an adorable grand-daughter who will be 3 in December.  Two son's, the youngest is 15.  I didn't break down until they all cried.  They know I am going to be fine, it's just hard to hear the news.  I think the shock for me is the fact like most of us I go every year for my Mammogram and do self exams.  As soon as I felt it a month ago I went right in.  Well I can't think about that now just move forward.  No stage yet until surgery but he said it was about 2cm and probably grade 2 looks very contained.  Surgery will be done before December 2.  I have decided on a bi-lateral Mastectomy.  The right side being the Prophylactic with reconstruction.  I see a plastic surgeon on Wednesday.  He did say I would probably have Chemo.  But said I would wait until after surgery to meet with an Oncologist.   I really would like to find one now and at least have a consult.   Thank you all so much for your concern!  You will be hearing from me a lot!  I have all of  you in my prayers!

So glad the new meds are easier on you.  Do the SE's of Taxotere get worse each time.  I know it's cumulative so I am expecting it will be. Liefie, I bet your hair looks great..  I am setting here thinking about putting a little cap on, I didn't realize how cold a head can get. Websister, Luvmy, Bevlee, I hope you are all having a good weekend. Benny, Caitlin, I hope you both are OK! Love you all, Carla",

I've been a little down lately. I have put on almost 8 lbs and I can assure you it isn't from over eating! My NP and NO told me not to worry it's the Chemo and it will come off after treatment. Plus Chemo through me in to menopause!! Which I guess I've been lucky since I'm 52.. I know its a small price to pay to kill the \"Beast\" but it still bothers me.. A lot of it is water retention..

Lifie - BEAR! That would scare the heck out of me! Edi- I am right here with you, I feel much better physically but mentally I am having a harder time now then when I was going through Chemo.  I really think it's because we knew we were killing anything that might be lurking, now we are on our own.  Makes me crazy that I even have negative feelings at all. Caitlin- Like I said so jealous! We were watching on TV, Mike has been there but not during the Race..  So happy for Tony Kanaan!! he so deserved to win.  I am more a Nascar fan but in my house I better like it all..  and I mean all Football, Baseball, Hockey, Golf, Racing ect..  Which I do but football has my heart. Gee I must be married to a coach...  Oh and so far so good on Tamoxifen..  Hope it helps with my low hormone receptors...  Iceburg- Thinking of you.. Alive- I hated my drains I had 3 two on the left and one on the right.  I was lucky I only had them for 7 days..  That is the one thing I dread about reconstruction drains again! Wirdgirl and Delvsey welcome. Maria- Hope you are doing well! Benny- It was so so so nice to hear from you!  I think about you everyday, you started this group and we miss you! You are a strong woman and you will be just fine! Websister- Any news on the MRI? Traii- Surgery date yet?  Luvmy, Dakota have a great day!! Anyone else on Tamoxifen???? Love you all, Carla",
