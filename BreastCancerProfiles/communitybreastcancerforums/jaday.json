The treatment center closed over the long weekend and I have 3 stickers that have been on for over a week and I feel like They are loose or coming off. I obviously go back Monday but am concerned that one might come off. I plan not to Shower (sponge bath) to keep dry but I feel the oil from my skin is contributing. What do if one comes off?? Thank you all!! Julie Log in to post a reply",
