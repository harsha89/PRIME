From what I understood HER2 is more aggressive and has less treatment options then hormone receptor positive. But I am very, very new to all this and may be wrong. p.s. I'm planning on being a long term survivor -- but I'm only 6 months in :)",

      "Content": "Feb 20, 2018 12:46PM - edited Feb 20, 2018 12:49PM by tinyturtle Hi PixiePixie --- I just turned 41 this January and was diagnosed last Summer. The closest MBC support group was like 45 minutes away and when I got there -- everybody just stopped and said \"We just have to know how old you are?\" I'm an artist and I probably dress like a teenager to some. I did meet another artist there -- and she was diagnosed at 45 and has been at it for 7 years! That gave me a lot of hope. My biggest issue is menopause -- I've been having rage, sleep issues, sweaty, and I have always slept in until 10 or 11 and am now waking up with the sun -- hot flashes make my eyes roll back in my head. What's cool though is I have been waiting my whole life to be an old woman -- with crazy outfits and no longer caring about what anybody else thinks. My friend reminded me that I can be 80 at any age :) and I have become more direct, and I'm buying those more flamboyant clothes. Some mornings I wake up crying and then the next day I'm happy about how this really put everything that mattered to me in close perspective. If only I could have been living like this my whole life. Some days it is super hard when I'm fatigued and confused -- here I am with all this free time and strong sense of self and I can't do anything at all but lay in bed. I think I've learned that I have that new older woman role in life -- I'm mentoring young artists like crazy. And for some reason the wisdom coming out of my mouth even surprises me. ",

I just got diagnosed 4 months ago --I felt a huge lump while rolling over in bed... I actually felt it with my arm. I immediately made a doc appt - and I could tell by her face that it didn't look good to her. So if the current docs aren't worried, that could be a good sign - or it could mean they aren't doing their job. So definitely try someone new to put your mind at ease. So after seeing her face and before my biopsy, I had no diagnosis, I just knew. I spent a night of throwing up and hyperventilating in secret and then started watching documentaries. My pre-freaking out served me well when I got the bad news for real. Hang in there, but if you feel like freaking out, don't let anybody make you feel bed for doing so. <3",

I've only been on the pills -no IV chemo yet. It happened today while I was in the kitchen fixing lunch. I was in a great mood (so it wasn't triggered by stress) - a little tired but not too bad - and I hadn't had any coffee or greasy foods. There's never any warning. And all you can do is panic and cry and hope you dont go through all your clothes while you rush toward the shower. This time was worse than the others. After showerimg I returned to the kitchen to find a tiny puddle and a trail of drips. Thank god no one was home! Perhaps there was some warning though because I had frustrating leakage thay last 2 days.. Like I forgot to wipe..I blamed it on my treatment-created hemorrhoid! At least after you're done crying you can search the internet and end up on this thread ..finding some comfort that you aren't the only one. :) Anyway Im super mad.. I was in a great mood and was excited to go do stuff. Im going to invest in some pee proof undies (I have no problem with urine incontinence but it has to better than nothing!) The worst part is locking yourself inside all day after an incident.. And running to the toilet frightened over any twitch or feeling of pressure. After the 2nd time this happened a year ago - out of fear I bought a waterproof mattress cover. I was afraid to sleep!! For today though, Im going to be my bravest and IDGAF-est and double up on underwear and throw on a panty liner. (Triple protection!!) I'll also have a squeeze bidet and spare undies in my bag as well. With this arsenal (lol at 'arse') I'm going to wait a couple hours and then try to go out into the world anyway -- because the last 2 times it happened, it only happened once in a day. #fingerscrossed !!",
