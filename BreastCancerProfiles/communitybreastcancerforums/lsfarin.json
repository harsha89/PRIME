I whined so much in my MD's office that he took mine out after 10 days (even though my fluid was still at 40cc's). I had to go back twice to have it drained, but 3 wks. post-op I was down to almost nothing (it helped that my doc basically forbade me to do ANY exercise - and the one time I tried kayaking within those 3 weeks I could tell immediately that it was too soon by the amount of fluid that sloshed around in there!) Actually, my drain wasn't uncomfortable at all until they took the dressing off about a week after my surgery -- then it started moving around and felt like it was just pinching or digging into my skin. I finally put a huge band aid over it, plus some first aid tape and tried to keep it as still as possible, but every time I moved my arm it pinched and I got so I couldn't stand it. It was worth it to have it taken out early even though I did have to go back twice.Â ",
