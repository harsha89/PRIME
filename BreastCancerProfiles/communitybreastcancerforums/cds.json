      "Content": "cds wrote: I am 43.  My doctor found a pea sized lump in my breast at an annual exam on Thursday, so she referred me to mammogram and an ultrasound.  I was not that concerned because I could not feel the lump myself, and I had just had a mammogram in December.  However, I was a little curious because I had gotten called back after the mammogram in December for an additional mammogram and ultrasound after which I was assured I merely had \"dense breast tissue\" with areas that looked like they could be masses.  So yesterday, I expected the same conclusion -- dense breast tissue, etc.  After the mammogram and ultrasound, I was completely shocked when the doctor told me I do have a tumor and that it is \"probably benign.\"  But she said she wants to do a biopsy on Tuesday.  I am very very upset about this.  My father died of colon cancer 20 years ago, and my mom (a non-smoker), died of lung cancer 2 years ago.  When my parents receive their diagnoses, it was totally unexpected because neither of them had cancer in their families and then they died very quickly.  My mom went from healthy to dead within 3 months.  I told my girlfriend and my sisters that I am scared and they were very dismissive -- it's nothing, don't worry, you're overreacting, etc.  Am I overreacting?  Am I stupid?  I feel stupid even posting this.  Log in to post a reply",
