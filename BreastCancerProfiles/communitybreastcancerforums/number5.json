Everything went well in there-and the lump/mass was closer to the surface-which made the excision much quicker.  The surgeon wouldn't dare tell me what she thought one way or the other.  She said she did that once and would never do it again-of course I completely understand.  The pathologist said he'd have the results by next Wed or Thursday, so I just need to call tomorrow to set up an appt with the surgeon for Thursday. Regardless of the fact of what may or may not show up, I feel so lucky to have a great hospital staff here.  A lot of it has to do with all of us being military and whatnot, but being that we are such a small community, I'm sure it makes it that much more helpful.  Oh, the lump was just over 1 cm, and the doctor did say there were tiny cysts attached to it.  I'm just going to try and not worry-try being the operative word here.  So far I'm not having any pain-and I hope that holds out. I'll keep you posted.  Ciao e pace!!",

So, it's off to the other doc tomorrow, and then we just go from there.  My husband and I are of course hoping for the best, but aren't naive enough to not expect the worst.  We already have made contingency plans for 'just in case.'   Being that we are overseas with the government/military, a little extra planning for us weighs hugely on our minds.

I know that I read recently that it is possible to still have children after chemo, though I'm sure, like everything else, it depends on the person. We (my husband and I), went through many years of infertility before we adopted our eldest, and then we were finally able to go through IVF-which was successful.  I don't know how much egg harvesting costs, but that is something you could look into.  As for being an adoptive Mom, that was the most rewarding experience of my life-that was the day I became a Mommy. I hope I don't sound like I'm lessening your feelings regarding having a child-I'm not-but I do know the joy of parenting through adoption.  It truly is a beautiful thing. Good luck to you!",

I promptly went home and looked them up and realized that MRI's don't do much for calcifications!  I could always call the radiologist, though he is the only one we have at our Navy hospital here.  My provider seemed not too worried.  Before and during this time, I've been experiencing major anxiety (for the first time in my life), which has made all of this stay in the back of my mind!!! On Thursday I will go to our hospital and be taken to the Italian hospital that has the equipment (fortunately the Navy will have a translator there the whole time).

I tried my sports bras, but they were way too tight.  My regular everyday bras have worked well.  I will admit that my boob looks bruised, but I'm not sure if that is from the surgery or when the radiologist was inserted the needle for the wire-he tried twice.  The surgeon even made a joke that if I had a bruise, it was all the radiologists' fault.:) All in all it hasn't been too bad!  Let us know how it goes!",

It just started feeling a little bit 'stingy' about a 1/2 hour ago-my surgery was at 1100 here in Italy and it's now 5:33 pm!  Actually most of the pain is from underneath where they had the sticky stuff-my boob keeps getting stuck to the skin on my rib cage. Take care!!",

I've had 4 abdominal surgeries previously (infertility stuff and a c-section), and I never had any problem with anything-I guess this time it's different.  I actually tore some skin off and have blisters on another part where the bandage was (I have the steristrips over the stitches). Other than that it's going well.  Thank you for asking!  Pace!",
