A friend recommended (an bought me a large tube) of Jean's Cream- she had no redness at all. She wouldn't take any money-but said pay it forward. My dr. said just do not apply anything within 4 hours of treatment. She also said it may be advantageous to try different things and change them up. I'm also using a variety of other things recommended. Maybe a little overkill!  ",

A fun area too-lots to see and do. As my RO has said and I have found true-the best defense against the radiation fatigue is exercise. If I sit down- I can be asleep in 5 mins. But if I am active, I have so much more energy. Despite the fatigue supposedly being cummulative, I have been feeling better than I have felt in a year-when I started chemo. My radiation was delayed by a broken machine and the New England weather, but I have 4 more treatments/28 and will be finished Tuesday! Good luck to you.",
