This is typical with her, I haven't for years felt that I am getting the best care with her. I can go many months before I see my doctor again.  But I think I may make another appointment and see where this gets me.  thanks",

It actually feels like there is something there that shouldn't be. I have been letting that go as well for too long, been about a year now with that, perhaps something I should press on. My doctor will actually yell at her patients. I have seen and heard her do this often and I heard other's say their children have anxiety when they have to go to appointments. I know I am off topic here but I guess I am having a bit of a release with my frustrations.    Other wise I did book a mammogram! Jan 22 :)",
