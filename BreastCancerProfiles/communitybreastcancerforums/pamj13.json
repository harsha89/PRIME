Nodular density is seen in the right breast deep to the nipple, inner portion of the breast on the right CC view and measures up to 1.4cm. The borders are slightly lobulated.

Recommend spot compression and ultrasound for further evaluation. 2. Implants Result: BI-RAD 0 incomplete Any and all insight in this would be Greatly appreciated. Thanks so much.
