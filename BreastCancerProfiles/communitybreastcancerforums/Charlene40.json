THANK THE LORD IT'S NOTHING! After 12 additional mammogram shots, they determined it to be just a dense area.  I didn't even need an ultrasound they are that confident.  Turns out a white mass was showing in my left deep in the center.  Apparently after so many shots it disappeared in some, which means they were finally able to separate overlapping tissue. I was getting nervous that the tech kept coming back to take more with different types of plastic plates.  She said that if it was a growth of any kind it would have stayed the same in all images. Needless to say, but I am more than relieved.  However, this was a HUGE wake-up call for me.  I'm 40 now.  No spring chicken.  Could definitely start eating better and exercising to fight my increasing odds for this and all other delights that come with age. And, I need to keep myself educated on here so I don't have that 'deer in headlights' feeling again.  I finally told my mom today.  She was relieved, then confessed that when my brother and I were teens and she a single mom, she had to have a couple biopsies and they found calcifications.  She had to go back every 3 months for a year.  She didn't want to worry us.  So, when it was nothing, she just didn't mention it.  So, now we've both said 'I wish you told me so I could have supported you,' but both understand why we didn't at the time. Blessings and good wishes for everyone.   I wish everyone peace as well as strength for the journey Log in to post a reply",

I wish only the best for you.",
