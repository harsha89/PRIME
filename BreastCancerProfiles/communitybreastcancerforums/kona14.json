I go for my last chemo the 5th and then for a cardiac ablation for my SVT the 19th.  I will be all patched up except for my new foobies by the new year!  I just hope in time my heart can heal b/c I miss my babies so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

No rads for me b/c already had 27 rads 22 yrs. ago for Hodgkin's disease.  I cannot have any more radiation to the chest area.  All is well except this morning I am having my cardio abaltion being done for my SVT.  I am nervous, but my doc is well-trained and one of the best.  Hopefully he can fix my SVT and I won't have to worry about getting an attack on the plane to Vegas in Jan.! My avatar is of my baby Riptide who passed.  I miss him and my female Shepherd Kona very very very much!  We did get a new puppy from a breeder and she is sooo darn cute!  We named her Viva (Spanish for to live).  She too is a shepherd and full of energy.  I lost 8 pounds since stopping chemo and getting her!  Puppies sure make you get up and go!  A diet plan I did not expect! Stay well and positive everyone.  I too really appreciate everyone on this forum!",
