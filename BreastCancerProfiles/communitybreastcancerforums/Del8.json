      "Content": "Jul 8, 2017 08:59AM - edited Jul 8, 2017 09:18AM by Del8 Chemo round #2 ..Today was a good news day for once :) ! Had my #2 of the TCHP today .... and got some good news about my tumor.. my MO measured it .. and from Round #1 it has shrunk by 1/2 !! it was at 2 cm at the first chemo ( really less she was measuring with tissue around it ) but now its about 1 cm ( again really less due to tissue she was measuring with it ) . With one treatment its 1/2 the size!!!! MY MO said this was excellent news ... it means the chemo is working!! Its destroying the tumor and anything else that may or may not be out in my body... I cried .... I sat at Panera's this morning eating breakfast with my Husband and broke down and cried... I just didn't want to do this .. just no.. but after MO talked to me and the Oncologist Pharmacist ( who FYI I adore ) talked to me ..plus my MO measuring me .. I was like \" Yeah.. lets kick this shit out of my body!! \" It was proof this is working.. MO said my labs looked good except one my Creatain ( sp?) was a little wonky ...which meant I was a little dehydrated ... so \"I\" suggested maybe I should start coming in on the Monday or Tuesday after chemo to get fluids... everyone was on board.. So after each chemo I will be going for fluids.. maybe I can keep myself out of the ER ... maybe.. My MO agreed that my fevers on day 5 ad 6 where from the Neulasta ...... I can go walking when I feel up to it.. and she said if I wanted too I could go swimming??!! Which I'm not but she said it would ok if I was in a pool.. not a river or lake... AND Vanderbilt Cancer Center standard for running Herciptin is 1 hour after you get your loading dose ..I was worried about it from what I have read here on the boards and other places that it's best to do 1 hour to 1 hour and 1/2 with Herciptin .. it helps with the sx. A pt. can request 30 mins and up to 90 min. but for my Cancer Center it's standard care is 1 hour for maintenance dosing ... :) . Woot! If my sx get worse I will get them to do hour and 1/2 .. no problem .. I had the Neulasta injector put on my stomach this time .. I'm not sure if I'm going to like it.. I keep bumping it on stuff.. .... Very tired.. came home and took a 3 hour nap... didn't get any sleep last night... plus they gave me some Ativan in my IV ... makes me sleeeeeepy ... It was all uneventful really, sat there and watched tv with my hubby... ate lunch... took much less time about 6 hours including MO appt. So down the rabbit hole of chemo I go.. wish me luck.. if I don't respond right away .. I will much love love love Denise love in TN",

Honey you have every right to cry .. scream.. shake your fist at the sky.... this is about as real as it gets... and its hell.. its not all \"cute\" pink ribbons... this cancer has an ugly side... its all ugly ... but.... Its here and we have to deal with the best way we can with what is .... For me I decided for whatever time I have left here... be it 2 years or 30 years... I'm going to live my life as someone who has came out of this hell a better person... I wish the Universe would have been a little nicer in getting my attention about tearing me down to rebuild me .. but I don't get choose ... But like a Phoenix I will rise out the ashes of the old me.. and be reborn into who The Creator meant me to be.... I will be better not bitter.. Yes less hair.. and many scars ... but these I will wear proudly ... it shows that I went to battled for my life... Many hugs ... from TN. Denise",

Best advice I can say is ..take your medicine on time ,stay hydrated my MO said I should be drinking 1/2 my weight in fluids. Gaidor aid and Pedi Lyte worked well for me. With the Pedi Lyte I add Lemon aid . Eat when you can whatever you can . For the first week it was peanut butter and toast. Baked potatoes ,lays plain potato chips mash potatoes and apple sauce. Oh and soup.... Then the next week ate better ,now I'm back to normal. But eat what you can even if it's crackers . It did help me keeping something on my stomach Rest rest rest ... Ice down your hands and feet ..it's not just because of the nails. Taxotere can cause neurothpy in the hands and feet. Not in everyone... But it's worth the prevention just in case. Also if can get a hold of a cold cap for you head , that might help with the hair lost . And to know you will make it through this. And you are stronger than you know. Hugs from TN Denise    ",

So extra precaution needs to be taken to make sure you don't catch anything ... but during that time can I go for walks ? Not to crowded places, and if I feel like I'm up to it.. ?? Or should I stay in and do yoga and stay way from folks.. I'm not working now... so I don't have to worry about that... Thanks for any advice Hugs from TN. Denise",

Think about it as your body getting rid of the cancer .....that hair is diseased ( not really but work with me here :) ) and your body is getting rid of anything that is connected to that disease.. if that makes sense.. Also, for me seeing my hair lost a lot like a snake shedding its skin when it has out grown its old self.... This cancer is creating a new person out of who we were.... we will never be the same.... I like to think we are becoming who we really was meant to be.. because after all this ...only the important things in life will be in our world.... all else will be back ground noise... And like the snake shedding its skin .....our hair is our body's way of shedding the old us ....so the new us can be reborn...

Any advice or words of wisdom would be welcomed .. My husband is on a business trip and won't be back until later this week.. so the timing of this is pretty bad .. but when is it ever good ? I have a mass that is 17x14x14 .. it is IDC with a high grade w/ one lymph node positive .... that's all I know ... My NP said that right now my stage is clinically stage 2 ..didn't say a or b .. but my mass is less than 2 cm and it involves one lymph node .. so what I've read its 2a ? It is estrogen positive.. My NP said that what I have is the most common breast cancer there is .. I think 80% of all breast cancers are what I have... I'm going to surgeon on June 2nd .. but they hope to have an MRI and appt. with the Oncologist before then .. She said that if it seems that like its awhile to get a an appt not to worry.. that this mass is not going to change over night or even change in a week or month.. at the start she said that it was a \"slow growing\" She also said this type of cancer has a good prognoses and is treatable... but is it curable ??? Now my stage may change after they get in there and take it out to look at it ... I know that I will do what needs to be done .. that's including have both of my breast taken off.. it will be hard ...but its doable.. There is only one other person in my family that I know of that had breast cancer than that was my mother's sister ... her's didn't show up until she was 80 ... So here I sit... numb... my kids are grown... but they're still my heart... I think I have a good support base.. with my kids,husband.. in laws and friends.... One part of me is almost relieved... the other part is scared out of my mind... one part of me has one foot in the grave.. the part of me is a saying \"OH NO.. we're a Warrior!\" but mostly I am numb and cold ( shivering ) .. I think I'm shock... srly .. again any words of wisdom would be welcomed.. I 've read so many of y'alls stories and they are encouraging.. Thank you in advance ..

I'm stage 2a 1.7 tumor w/ one node known to be involved...others from the MRI and US looked good .. Its Grade High/3 which means its aggressive but the MD's feel like I'm still in the early stage of my bc . I'm also Triple Positive. At first I was falling apart but since I talked to Surgeon and Cancer MD I feel better.. You know our mind go to the dark places when you don't know what's going on ... The Doctor said that my prognoses is good and its treatable.... I have a shot of being cancer free... Its not going to easy...and its not going to come without complications.. She said \"don't be overly optimistic but don't be overly pessimistic either\". It is what it is... and we're going fight it together... First is 6 rounds of chemo given every 3 weeks... to see if we can shrink the tumor or even get rid of it, if all goes well then I take 4 weeks off... then surgery .....maybe radiation maybe not we'll its all up I guess the lymph nodes then back to chemo for the hormone drugs add...for a total of 1 year in chemo... then I will have to take the pill form up to 10 years .. Like I said in the beginning ..... I finally have hope....I didn't have that before yesterday ... as my NP would say its going to be a long haul but you can do this... Every little victory .... even being handed a little hope .... just wanted to share",
