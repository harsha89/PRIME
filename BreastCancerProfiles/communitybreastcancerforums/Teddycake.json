Let us help future women who might get this device put in their bodies without proper discussions pre-surgery or at least force the maker to address the problems with their device. My radiation oncologist said the device made no difference to him and he thought it was unnecessary for his treatment for me. Again I am so happy that it was removed. I would rather lose my nice looking breast than have pain! Although, now I look tough with my surgery breast...so don't mess with us cancer survivors! Thanks to my surgeon, I am feeling so much better FDA info: Best to email questions on medical devices than to call DICE@fda.hhs.gov Complaint forms are online but I am not allowed to post the link. So go to their website, search \"forms for reporting to FDA\". Then I believe the correct form for us is \"FDA Form 3500B\".",
