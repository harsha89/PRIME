The cancer was devastating but then, stuff happens.  I am fine and it was 10 years ago.  I lived it and am still dealing with the effects but am actually happier today than before the 'event'. The current book I am about to finish is called THE LUMP.  It deals with the different treatment methods and the effects of them.  It also suggests a few things that will be more helpful than the gloom and doom we feel in the begining. You can see more about the books and me at www.tittatts.com or www.charlavan.com",
