    "Content": "wolfwonderess wrote: So, almost two weeks ago I discovered a rather large lump in my right breast, which freaked me the heck out, especially since I don't currently have insurance (but I applied for it and am waiting on a response). It's pretty large, but very moveable, round, and doesn't feel rough as I heard cancer does. There have been no other changes in my breasts, no discharge, nipple inversion, or scaliness, but I'm still worried and anxious to get my insurance to get tested! Ack. Can breast cancer be moveable? ^^;; Or can you typically not move a cancer lump? Yikes. Log in to post a reply",
