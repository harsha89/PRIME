    "Content": "new_direction wrote: Hi everyone. I finished chemo a year ago but I seem to recall I read somewhere here on this forum - possibly with a link to an article - that surgery could reduce the effects of chemo (maybe because of changes in tissue and vascularity). I have searched and searched and can't find this. As I recall it it was in a very long thread and there was a discussion going on about what affected chemo response in positive and negative ways. I never posted in the thread so can't find it by using my name. it is not exactly what I'm looking for but this article gives an idea of what I'm talking about; will post here if I find more about the subject... http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(07)00571-6/abstract Log in to post a reply",
