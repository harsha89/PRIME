Like all the other ladies said try not to worry to much until you have the facts. And as for the chip you won't know it is there. That is placed so if they have to go back in to do surgery the doctors know the area the biopsy was taken from.. On a better note I heard you say you are a Red Wing fan, so are we and we live in Florida lol. My husband is from Allen Park. I would also like to tell you something else uplifting I am only 43 diagnosed at 42 and I am cancer free and finished with my reconstruction. I work out with a trainer 4 days a week and I feel great! So not matter what your results are everything will be ok! Best Wishes, Dawn",
