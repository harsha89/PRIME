After I read Purple's post, I went back to check the name thinking during a groggy night I may have posted it! I've been attempting to sleep on my back as well due to shoulder pain. I have truncal LE. So, that aggravates my shoulder pain, too. Today, I got the results of my yearly full body bone scan. No cancer on anything!!!! But, it did show arthritis in my collarbone area. The doctor said it probably contributed to the shoulder pain.My collarbones do not hurt at all & the doctor said it was an odd place for arthritis to show up in someone who'd not been in a wreck or someone who'd not been a prizefighter. Between cancer & LE, arthritis ain't a big deal!! I'll figure out how not to roll over.",

Thank goodness, I knew to ask for the path report. I'm at a loss what to do now. They've set up an MRI for Tuesday & a surgical consult for Wednesday. Even though the surgeon is well respected, he is a general surgeon. I do not want someone taking out a gallbladder int he morning operating on mybreast at lunch. I want a specialist. I am 2 hours from Atlanta (where my late aunt went to a BS who is a PS & Surgical onco) and 3 hours from Charleston, where the breast clinic is. I dont know where to go or turn at this point. My GP, who is also my neighbor, told me that they may want to do radiation first, or removed the place and do a masectomy later on. He told me if given the choice to do a mesectomy. I'd already decided on that. I watch my aunt die with BC & took care of her. SHe had 1 breast removed, then 10 years later cancer came back in the other one... and it came back with a vengence. I am 52, so I am not ready to give into this and want to lower any chance I can of spreading or coming back.",

He's also seen it at its worst. Family doctor and oncologist seem to ignore it.  I just had a horrible bout of cellulitus, too. The infectious disease doctor told me anyone could get cellulitus. I know they can, but mine stemmed directly from the lymphedema. It is frustrating.",

Most time during the day, I am fine. Some days though, it feels like a tennis ball ball is under my skin about 3 inches down from my underarm. The right side is the worst, where the 9 nodes were removed. No sign of seromas, just the feeling of a ball, a painful on, at that. |Same on the right side, but not as bad. This worsens at night. I tend to side sleep. I will roll to my side & awake in pain. My ribs on my left side are terribly sore most of the time regardless of sleep position. It feels like I've been punched hard! It seems to cramp.I can't really tell if it is swollen since I can feel my ribs. The tennis ball feeling does feel swollen, but not thr rib. No arm/hand swelling at all. Is the Lymphdema?

He said his job was to keep me alive till a ripe old age and he did not want to look back 5-10 years down the road and wish we'd done chemo. That hit home as I had a beloved  aunt diagnosed at 57. She never wanted chemo, had 1 node positive, took tamoxifen and another drug afterwards. The cancer came back at 68 and she died quickly thereafter, but did do radiation this time, something she said she would never do. I took care of her during the last months and while she never mentioned wishing that she'd done chemo, I always wondered if it would have made a difference. I stated that once I found out I had BC. So when the doctor mentioned that, I knew I would have it. Scheduled to start, next week. I do not want it, but I do not want to wish later on that I had.",
