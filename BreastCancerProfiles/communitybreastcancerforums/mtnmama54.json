Saw it in the mirror after showering. There is a lump there too, but I'm in denial about that lump.  I am terrified!  The waiting for tomorrows appt is just awful!  They said that I will meet with radiologist doc while I'm there, so results immediatly.  Hubby is going with me. I'm 54, total hysterectomy in 2007.   Any thoughts?  Anyone?
