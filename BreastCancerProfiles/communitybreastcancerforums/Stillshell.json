PR+ and HER2- My Mom is 55 years old and  has IDC with three small (1.5cm) tumors.  She underwent chemo and didn't do well.  She was bedridden and sick the whole time ending the course of treatment with sepsis and almost dying in the ICU. She had surgery last week.  The removed her breast and underarm tissue.  10 lymph nodes were removed and positive (based on sight).  The doctors also said \"we didn't get all of the cancer\".  We have not been told a stage for my Moms cancer nor have we been given a prognosis.  She is supposed to go to Radiation next. Questions: -My Mom now requires oxygen all the time 2-4 liters...why? -They stopped taking lymphs at 10, how do they know if there are not more positive ones??  I understand that they will use radiation.  But what if there is a positive one in her collar area?? -Is there any way to figure out what stage she is in?
