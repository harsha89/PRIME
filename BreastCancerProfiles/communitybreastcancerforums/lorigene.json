She has the Triple Negative Aggressive Breast Cancer and that is why this lump came up so sudden since her yearly mamo in December. By the time we got into surgery it had spread to 3 other places in her breast. They do surgery first on this type of Breast Cancer instead of Chemo first. On Tuesday 24 she had a double mastectomy with the flap reconstruction. Surgery took 11.5 hours and while in there they came across other issues we didn\u2019t know about. She had 4 hernias so they had to call in a hernia specialist to do that and close in the hole from that before they could finish their part of the flap. After the surgery it was issue after issue. She needed 2 units of blood, kidneys were failing, she was barely urinating so they put her on Lasix, then she started filling up with fluid so they inserted a tube down her while she was awake to suck the fluid from her stomach out. My poor momma was in so much pain, gagging, throwing up and crying as I was. Just horrible to watch and there was nothing I could do to help her. Then with that tube she couldn\u2019t eat or drink anything and she just gagged and threw up daily for 6 days. She feel into deep, deep depression. She didn\u2019t want to see anyone, you would go in the room and she would cover up and turn away and close her eyes\u2026even to me. They thought maybe they pinched her bowel, but CT Scan and Xray later they didn\u2019t and there was no other blockage it was just simply her body was still asleep and wasn\u2019t moving yet. Last Monday they pinched her tube closed and waiting all day then hooked it up and nothing came out so they took it out being her bowel had started working, urinating etc. She went home Tuesday night late, home all day Wednesday, then Wednesday night she started running fever. I went over to help her shower and she was so swollen and red around her incision etc. I went to my moms to check on her and she had been running 102 fever all night so I called doc. And they wanted her in ER right away. So we go there they didn\u2019t an US to make sure nothing ruptured and it hadn\u2019t and she just had a bad infection in her incision. So they put her on anti. Thursday through Sunday and swelling had went down and she wasn\u2019t near as red, but still swollen down there. So Sunday night at 8 she went back into surgery and they cut some of her incision and inserted a sponge and drain to absorb the infection. So now today she had another surgery this morning to remove that sponge and insert another one and they will do that again on Friday and Monday. Each time the sponge will be smaller. Whenever she does finally get to go home, home health will come out twice a week and change this sponge till the infection is gone. They said its excruciating pain to change it so that\u2019s why they are doing it In the OR. They will try one time at bedside to do it to see if she will be able to stand it. Just been a long, exhausting, emotional time. I could drive down town in my sleep as many times as I have made the trip back and forth. We have been swapping out nights when I can and I stay so dad can go home at night. Just sad. If anyone had an issues after I would love to hear...or are we alone on this? Log in to post a reply",
