They also aren't quite sure of the exact location of my unclear margins so doing surgery is kinda risky.  I would hate to go through another surgery where they can't get it all (again) Thank you for your kindness!

I opted for a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy because of the fear of radiation and unclear margins.   Now it appears that I'll have to do the radiation anyways.  Melissa (Mama of Twins) Dx 4/23/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
