It says that it is so fragmented that they can't confirm more than this (has no post diagnosis): Focal fibroadenomatoid changes and focal ductal epithelium suggestive of papilloma. Background: 34 years old, healthy, no breast cancer history in family (only ovarian cancer) I noticed unilateral spontaneous discharge, went in for a mammogram and ultrasound. The ultrasound showed what they said was a papilloma (small .3cm by .4cm). I went in for a biopsy, it wasn't fun, she mentioned it was in a hard spot to get to. Then I get these results. Anyone have a similar experience? I will make an appointment with the surgeon to see what she says but I don't understand why the sample is so bad. Should I get another biopsy somewhere else before jumping to any conclusions? I know all of this is so likely benign and I'd like to avoid removing something unnecessary but I also need to know what is going on and take the safest course! Any guidance would be appreciated. I don't hear from the doc until Monday and it feels like FOREVER. Log in to post a reply",
