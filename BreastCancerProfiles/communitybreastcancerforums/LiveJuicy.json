The whole way from my hips to shoulders, the skin was very tender.  I found very soft fabrics were best.  I had planned to wear some of my husband's shirts, but they felt rough.  I wore a lot of rayon batik sarong tops (like caftans, only to the hip), super soft t-shirts.  I wore a lot of button-down night-shirts in super-soft cotton knit for the first week.  I also picked up a silk knit cami from Dharma Trading that I saved for when I really wanted to pamper my skin (http://www.dharmatrading.com/html/eng/645172-AA.shtml?lnav=clothing_silk.html) The hospital gave me 2 tight, zip-front/hook-back mastectomy bras that had detachable pockets for the drains. If you get sports bras, make sure they open in the front.  I also lived in my velour zip hoodie jog set, every time I had to go to a doctor appointment.    I've seen folks on these boards suggest silky pajama bottoms to make getting in and out of bed easier, and I wish I had had them for my Mx.  I am having DIEP reconstruction next month, and silky bottoms are definitely on my shopping list.  Which reminds me, I came home from the hospital to satin sheets, and they really helped.  Be sure to read through the \"shopping list\" thread, too.",
