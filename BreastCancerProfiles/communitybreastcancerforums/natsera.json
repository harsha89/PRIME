I had my surgery on March 7, and the BS referred me to the lymphedema clinic, although I have no signs of it so far. So she read me the whole riot act, and told me to get a sleeve because I'm flying to Israel in May, and she said that the changes in pressure are a risk. Plus the thing about not injuring your arm -- I'm diabetic, and I typically test my blood on the right hand, which is the side the breast cancer was on. So they told me not to test on that side, but geez, I've been doing it for 25 years already, and the habit is hard to break, plus I play string instruments, and want my left hand to be as natural as possible, with no scars or calluses other than what the instruments cause. And it's hard to figure out just where on the finger to test. So I'm bummed. On the other hand, I REALLY don't want to develop lymphedema, and just don't know what to do. How much can the advice (rules) be bent? I do understand the need to prevent infections, because the damaged lymph system might not be able to handle the increased liquid volume, but what really is or isn't a significant risk? If you get any answers, please share them with me! ",

Anyway, I thank you for your good information. It does appear that I am at some risk because yes, my hands swell up when dangled and also are swollen when I wake up in the morning after having had swollen legs the previous day. However, at this time, the swelling is equal, so I don't think it's LE right now. The trick will bee to stay alert for it while not letting the fear overtake my life! The cording is in my armpit and I can feel that it's different from the other armpit, but it is small and really not giving me any problems.!It's a little bit sore but certainly not acutely painful. I wonder if it will stay stable! About BG testing, the precautions you mention are well-advised. I HAVE had a few infections in my fingers, although never testing related. I like the idea of having wipes available. I guess I'll take your kind advice and see what happens!",

Tell me a little more about it, please. Sandy, I was also advised to get a sleeve for flying, so I did. And then it didn't fit and I only realized it after wearing it for a flight, so I had to get another one. I think I should wear it for physical activity and repetitive motion. Like you I'd much rather avoid problems than have to deal with them. It's kind of sinking in that the story was NOT over after the surgery -- stuff can still go wrong. But I just figure I'll do my best and not let it slow me down. New question: the LE therapist who evaluated me said I have some cording. But I'm not feeling it. And it's not causing any problems. Is it likely to get worse, and start causing problems, or stay stable or even go away? Does it put me at more risk of LE? Also, I do get regular edema for other reasons, and it goes into my arms when I lie horizontally, such as when I sleep. Does that cause any additional risk for LE? I know it's NOT LE because both arms feel the same -- puffy and somewhat taut, and it goes away when I get vertical, but I just wonder if it adds to risk.",

I was never warned that radiation could cause lymphedema, and told that since I only had 2 nodes removed, I was at very low risk, and radiation would reduce my risk of recurrence from 10% to 1%. So I agreed to it and now, starting 6 months after the end of radiation, I started developing visible and palpable lymphedema. I also wonder whether a bad fallbackward in December, which resulted in a badly pull pectoral muscle could have triggered it",
