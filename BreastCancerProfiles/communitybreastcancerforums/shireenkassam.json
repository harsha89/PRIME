She is currently healing and now faces the post-surgery treatment dilemma. She is ER/PR+, HER2- and had a grade 3 tumor that was <2cm in her left breast. There is also possible evidence for microscopic vascular cancer as some cancer cells were seen in the blood vessels of the tumor that was removed. Our oncologist has recommended 4 doses of TC (Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide) followed by Tamoxifen for 2 years then Aromatase Inhibitors for the next 2-3 years. She is considering only taking the Tamoxifen instead of both the Chemo and Tamoxifen due to the undeniable side effects both long-term and short-term, that could arise from Chemotherapy. She has been told she will definitely lose all her hair and can expect nose bleeds, low white blood cell count etc. Has anyone denied chemo and opted for only hormone therapy? Any thoughts on her situation? Log in to post a reply",
