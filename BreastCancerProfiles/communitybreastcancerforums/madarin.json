      "Content": "madarin wrote: I'm a newly diagnosed 46 year old mom of one, still trying to wrap my mind around the reality of my life which has gone so radically awry for me in the past 2 weeks. Scheduled for a mastectomy and sentinal node removal tomorrow, and learned last night that my breast MRI found two more lumps in the right breast, and two very small ones in my left breast which didn't show on the mammogram. As if all this, plus chemo/radiation to go through, I just learned that I may be unable to work for at least 6 weeks following surgery tomorrow! Is this really the case? Has anyone gone back to work before then? I simply cannot afford to take 6 weeks off from work, no way. I was counting on my job to keep me mentally busy and give me something creative to focus on. What are my options? The mastectomy will be on the right breast, and i am right handed. Does that matter? I know its weird to be obsessing on my job, but I'm so close to screaming out loud all the time, that if I don't do work, they'll carry me out in a padded bus. Thanks for your input.
