I've been in a slump for a couple of days and haven't been able to write, but today i've sort of picked myself up off the floor and am trying to move forward. I'm even beginning to see some humor in the situation, imagining what I must have looked like this morning trying to wrestle myself into my clothes. Luckily, my right hand is still working (at least for now) so if I can put my hand in place with my left hand, I can still do things like type with both hands on the keyboard. I try not to think about how I will manage if I lose that capability, but I know from past experience that when something I dread happens, I always seem to be able to deal with it. I think I'm just in a state of mourning. When you lost the use of your arm, did it happen gradually over time? Or did it happen fairly quickly. Mine has been coming on slowly but seems to have taken a dramatic downturn over the past week or two, and that has been hard to accept. If it had continued to come on gradually, even if I ended up in the same place, I think I would have learned to adjust gradually too. Meanwhile I'm off to chemo. Thanks again for writing. Christine",

The problem is inflammation caused by the recurrence of an invasive cancer in the pectoral muscle that is affecting the nerves in the brachial plexus. All my doctors agree that the only thing that will stop the progression of the plexopathy is to stop the progression of the cancer, and the clinical trial is for the cancer. But even stopping the progression of then cancer may not result in restoration of function. I'm started working my way through the 500+ messages in this thread and I see that some people have been dealing with major loss of function, but I have not yet come across messages that describe how they dealt with things when they first began to struggle with this, and some of the messages are so old that I'm not sure if the posters are still actively following the thread. It would be really great if you could get some previous posters to respond. And thank you for the link. There is some great stuff in here! Christine",

I am currently receiving chemotherapy for a BC recurrence and was recently diagnosed with brachial plexopathy. They think it is the result of inflammation caused by my chemo drugs (Gemzar/carboplatin) rather than the radiation I had in 2001 because I only have pain for a couple of days after I have chemo. My radiation oncologist says that if the BP was caused by radiation, the pain probably would be continuous rather than sporadic. We'll see what happens when the chemo ends. Christine",

I haven't received any occupational therapy yet because I'm in a sort of a treatment limbo, waiting to go to Boston to participate in a clinical trial, and my physiatrist thinks I should get OT while I'm there. Meanwhile I'm losing the ability to do much of anything with my right arm. I live alone and I'm wondering how I will take care of myself if I only have one functioning arm. Is there anyone out there who has been through this loss of motor function who can tell me how you learned to deal with it?",
