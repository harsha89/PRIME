Dee Dee I hate that feeling of nothing being able to touch it! Thank you so much for being honest. I am happy that you are almost done and I hope your pain subsides.  I have been a bit nervous about the pain of radiation or sensitivity since it seems I already have so much after surgery which doesn't seem normal. When I told the PS about the pain on Monday he told me to touch or aggravate the sore area while at the same time saying to myself that this doesn't hurt so I can retrain my brain. That was when I broke down. I started crying in his office which made me mad at myself for breaking down in front of him, I just thought is was so messed up.",

I don't really know because my PS is not the kindest, or more informative. I made an appointment with a new PS today. Life is too short, why am I wasting my time with him. I want to be able to ask questions and have thorough and not condescending answers.  I feel more empowered after I made that appointment today.

It has been a life saver to me. Dani I am so excited for you that you are almost done :)  I am cheering you on and hoping the rest of the session breeze by. What is the rapid healing you mentioned? I haven't heard of that before Egregious so glad you are feeling so great a month out! That makes me feel hopeful :) LPLibrarygirl thanks for the input about your shoulder and sorry that you have frozen shoulder (ouch). I started youga today. I couldn't do much with my right arm, but your post inspired me to try and stretch that area  Joytx I was thinking of you today and hoping your pain has subsided a bit.

I was hoping to take time off of work for radiation. Are most of you doing that? I am feeling a bit guilty like maybe I should go back to work but would really like to not have to rush around to Rads then work which is stressful. I would rather take time to recover. If you are not working Did your Radiolosts give you a hard time about writing you out or is it common to not work during rads. I feel like people that don't have cancer are telling me rads is easy and no big deal, but I am not sure",

I am so glad that you vented, because it makes me feel like I am not alone and that people understand.

I feel like all even the doctors are like ok you can do everything now, and I feel like wow! this whole thing just hit me and I am exhausted. I have so many appointments for doctors in between RADS and I can't even pick my time for RADS so it would be hard to work. I am currently doing the same as you; I found a silk work tank top that I had,  and I wear that under my bra or under a sweatshirt when I am at home so that I don't feel that raw, nerve pain along the incision lines. It helps so much. I am sorry about your tattoos, I hope you can get them covered like you want :) Also hoping that your work week flies by for you. Egregious :) Yes! Cocoa/chocolate is the answer. Thanks for making me smile. Did you have stickers for RADS? The tech told me not to moisturize the stickers, but around them. Were you able to moisturize right before RADS or do you need to wait until after. I am having it for my lymph nodes as well so I will start moisturizing me whole arm pit to my back like you mentioned. Thank you all for sharing your experience, strength, and hope :)  ",

It sounds miserable. I hope the tank tops and weekend help you to recover and you find some comfort. I don't know why doctors minimize se. It is really frustrating. I keep think about my PS saying that my pain was phantom pain and that I should touch the painful areas and tell myself that I don't hurt as to retrain my brain. It really makes me depressed. My incision lines from LICAP flap are throbbing after only  4 days of radiation. My breast still has a blackish blue hue from surgery that was 8 weeks ago. I am worried because it hurt befire radation. Trying to take it one day at a time.",

My score varies as my range for Er is 98-100% so I put 300 for Er and feel good about that but my range for Pr is 41-50% so when I do what they say here to calculate: All the required data is generally present in the surgical pathology report. The hormone receptor results will require the semi-quantitative H-score. If not reported initially, this can be easily calculated by the case pathologist by reviewing the immunohistochemical (IHC) stain slides. H-scores are calculated based on percentage of positive cells showing none, weak, moderate, or strong staining intensity. The score is given as the sum of the percent staining multiplied by an ordinal value corresponding to the intensity level (0=none, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong). With four intensity levels, the resulting score ranges from 0 (no staining in the tumor) to 300 (diffuse intense staining). For e.g. a tumor showing no staining in 10% cells, weak staining in 30% cells, moderate staining in 40% cells, and strong staining in 20% cells; the H-score will be calculated as follows: (0x10)+(1x30)+(2x40)+  I could have anywhere from 120 up so not sure. I enter it a bunch of different ways and I get anywhere from 16 to 20. ",
