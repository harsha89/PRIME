I was diagnosed 8 years ago and a few years back I decided to only let myself worry a few days before my mammogram. I even put a note in my calendar and allow myself the time to let that worry out. Tomorrow is my 8th year mammogram and it is anxiety time. In fact, during this anxiety time each year, I also visit this message board. But, I think as time goes by, it allows us to put worry in perspective and in it's place. I am down to scan anxiety, you will be too. My doctor termed this deep worry as medical PTSD. This worsens without help. I needed medication for a while. But, truly, time heals a lot of things. For now, get the help. Lola.",
