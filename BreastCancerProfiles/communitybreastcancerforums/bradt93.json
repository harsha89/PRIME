She always has this fear of recurrence, she had the bilateral masectomy and didn't need no radiation or chemo. She has to be on tamoxifen for 5 years. Every time she has a cold or cough, she thinks it came back. If she caught it early and neede no radiation or chemo, she should be okay right? What can I say to make her feel better? She has to keep getting mammograms and MRI's which I find strange, or is that not unusual? I hope you all can help put my mind to ease and my moms. thanks. Log in to post a reply",

I thought I was trying to make you feel better by telling you in my own way to keep a positive attitude, that's what my mom is doing. I will never know what women go through with this diagnosis, because I'm a guy, but I know the fear, because my grandfather died in 2000 of colon cancer and he was in remission. I think he caught at mid stage though. The cancer made his skin turn yellow and to this day, I can't get that horrible image out of my head. I was only 12 years old too.",
