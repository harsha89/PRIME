A little lost on this forum as I\u2019ve posted my own post but can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere.. But here I am worrying and waiting too and wondered if anyone could give me some hope... I have found myself here based on hours of trawling through posts hoping to find a reason/answer other than BC as to why I have these symptoms. I'm 29 years old with a little boy (nearly 3) and I noticed a change in my right areola. A change in texture and appearance- almost like a patch of lighter skin. The patch got substantially more noticeable in a short space of time and I noticed an indent- made worse when I lift my arm over my head. I didn't think anything seriously of it until I saw a fb post about dimpling and then my partner made a comment about it when he looked at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I went to the doctors and she did a full examination and said she could feel a lump. I was shocked to say the least as I hadn't felt it myself but I guess she knows what she's looking for. She made an urgent referral and I have my breast clinic appt on Tuesday. I am trying to be logical and trying to think positive but the nightmares I'm having are awful. I'm just looking for a bit of support really on here please and to gage and idea of what else it could be. Do benign tumours/cysts present themselves like this too? Could it be hormonal? Thanks in advance Jessica",

I\u2019m even feeling collarbone pain and a full a ache- which I\u2019m im sure is psychological. I hope you don\u2019t have to wait long! Do you have your appt soon? I\u2019m planning my best friend\u2019s hen at the moment so that keeps me busy, as well as my boisterous toddler...  Cathy I\u2019m so sorry to read about your husband! Hopefully you have other family members and friends to support you! And I can see that many find this forum reassuring. Sending lots of cyber hugs to you : ",

I am very grateful for how proactive my dr has been and how quick my appt is. I\u2019m not quite sure what my appt with entail. Whether they will send me for a scan or how long I will be there and how much I\u2019ll be told after. A bit apprehensive. Thank you for your wishes too- means a lot.",
