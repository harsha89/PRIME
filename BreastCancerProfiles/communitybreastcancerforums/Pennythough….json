      "Content": "Oct 16, 2010 11:25PM Pennythoughts wrote: I am only recently diagnosed with BC (Sept. 14).  I had lumpectomy and SNB on Oct. 4 and am still waiting for pathology results of surgery.  All the core needle biopsy revealed was Invasive Ductal Carcinoma but we don't know how large the tumour was, if the margins are clear, or if the node was positive or negative.  Don't know about ER/PR either.  So the last month has been like a ride on a nauseating roller coaster. Prior to this Dx, I had a major trauma in my life 3 years ago.  It took me almost one year to give myself \"permission\" to go to a doctor and get a prescription for an anti-depressant.  Up until then, the idea of having to do that was unthinkable.  Type A personality, perfectionist - - whatever label you want to put on it - - you get the idea - -  I really believed that I should be able to overcome, control, or fix my depression.  I had been conditioned (long, long story) to believe that depression was a character flaw or a sign of weakness and that to need meds for it was even worse.  But I finally began to realize that I had \"shut down\" my emotions so many, many years ago, and the traumatic experience simply opened me up to me to start \"feeling\" again.  The pain of depression was almost unbearable. In retrospect, I had likely suffered from depression most of my life since adolescence but simply could not acknowledge it.  To cope, I put myself on auto-pilot and shut down emotionally and operated that way for years, even though I was quite tormented on the inside. My doctor prescribed 20 mg of Celexa.  Her explanation to me was simply that my depressed state meant that I was lacking in serotonin and that my body needed help to stop blocking the serotonin.  Whether the depression caused the lack of serotonin or the lack of serotinin caused the depression is kind of like asking the question about the chicken or the egg - - which came first?  At this point, I didn't know and it didn't matter anymore.  I realized that if I had any other medical problem, I wouldn't hesitate to take the necessary treatment, if it could help me. So the Celexa was a success for me (except for the well-known side effect of lowered libido).  At my age ( then 46) and pre-menopausal state, I certainly didn't need any help in that department.  The libido has been lagging for a few years anyways, even without the help of the Celexa.  My poor DH. Of course I began to feel better but was the last to know it.  The change is so gradual.  My DH and SIL told me approx. 6 weeks after starting the med that I was definitely a different person.  I was quite surprised.  Even though I had been fairly severely depressed, it just kind of melted away when \"normal\" began taking over.   What they meant is that I didn't look constantly sad all the time, and that I wasn't always on the verge of tears, moving in slow motion, barely able to work or focus or think straight.  All the med did was regulate my mood so that I was able to cope with normal life.  Everything didn't look so bleak.  I wasn't weeping throughout the day over I-don't-even-know-what.  And that is the nasty part of depression.  Who knows how it starts - usually some trigger or other (hello - BC?) - - but then, it becomes a downward spiral and a vicious cycle.  Negative thoughts and feelings become so engrained, that you become helpless to stop yourself from having them and they get worse.  I knew I needed meds when I couldn't stop the cycle no matter how hard I tried.  I could NOT talk myself into a good mood.  And I couldn't pretend anymore that everything was OK. So after almost a year of feeling normal on the Celexa, I decided I didn't need these meds anymore.  So I slowly weaned myself off of them.  I did great for about 3 months (during the summer).  And then came the crash.  I was devastated.  Even though I thought I had gotten over the \"stigma\" of being on anti-depressant meds, there was still something in me that thought I shouldn't need them.  So I went back on last Christmas.  Then in June, I thought I was OK again.  I always feel better in summer in the sunshine and heat, so once again, just slowly stopped taking the meds, mostly because when I feel better, I just forget to take them. I felt myself crashing again around the end of August.  I had pretty much decided to go back on in early September, and then the Dx of BC on Sept. 14.  These SSRI's take about 6 weeks to kick in, so I wasn't really stoked up with them in time for the Dx.  Talk about another devastating crash.  For a person who has recently been easily overwhelmed with small things in life, this seemed like too much.  I am now resigned to the idea that if I need these meds to function normally for the rest of my life, then so be it.  Especially now with the battle I have embarked on.  I just can't do it on my own, especially going into a long, cold, Canadian winter.  (I am sure I also suffer from SADD) My DH has suffered enough the last few years with my terrible lack of libido, so I have just asked my doc to switch me to something that does not have that particular SE.  So I am starting Wellbutrin (sp?) in a couple of days.  Hopefully I will tolerate it well and hopefully it will be a help and not a hindrance to the BC journey.  Granted, the BC Dx doesn't do anything for my libido either.  Having sex is about the last thing I want to do in my life right now, but maybe that will change in time . . . does it . . . anyone??? I only shared my story because I saw so much of myself in your original post - the resistance to the anti-d meds, the feeling terrible but faking it for everyone else.  Of  course you must do what you feel is right for yourself - - that is all any of us can do.  But I want to encourage you that if you should decide to try meds, it does not mean that you are deficient in any way, shape or form.  You are not weak, nor are you a failure as a person.  God knows that this disease is enough to knock any good woman down and if depression results, you have permission to do whatever you need to do to help yourself, even meds. I wish you the best Suzy. . . and thank you all for being so encouraging in your posts.  I have no one in my life that has ever been through this, so I feel incredibly alone, even in the midst of loving family and friend support.  All of you ladies are great and brave.  I know I will draw strength from you as I go forward.",

I was told flat out that if I refused radiation, my only option was a mastectomy, which would basically yield the same results as lumpectomy + radiation.  What a horrible decision to have to make, but finally decided to take it in baby steps.  So far, I'm happy with my decision, but I went through a LOT of stress several months ago to get there, especially when my margins were not clear and I had to get a re-excision.",

I saw some comments about not shaving, and no deodorant, etc.  The rad people didn't say anything to me about any of that.  All they told me was not to wear an underwire bra and that the doctors in my treatment centre recommend glaxal base for cream.  Nothing about not applying it for so many hours before treatment, etc.  They also told me I could start applying creams/lotions now and anything would do, as long as it is unscented. (??) They also told me the \"tattoo\" wouldn't show and you would have to look really hard for it - well the one they put smack in the centre of my chest between the breasts is quite noticeable and they said it would look like a mole.  I don't have any black moles - only brown ones.  So to me, it looks like a black spot that shouldn't be there.  Oh well, for the amount of time that I spend in a bathing suit, I guess it's no big deal.  I only got two - one on the side under my arm, and one in the centre of my chest. I would really like to hear from you who have already started and been there . . . what do you feel about creams, lotions, when to use them and when not, deodorant, & shaving etc.  I have sports bras, but they're awfully tight to get on over the head.  Maybe I should be looking for something easier to get on?? In the meantime, I'll start looking back thru some of the posts and see if any of these questions are already answered - - probably are!  Thanks anyways, you are all fantastic and I appreciate every one of your posts.  (((HUGS)))",

I finished rads on Feb. 2 (16 tx and no boosts), and did really well through the treatments.  What no one warned me about was the 10 days since finishing.  Got terrible, terrible pain and itch in 3 spots - - under the arm, just over the incision where tumour was at 12:00, and in the fold under the breast.  Had to go to minor emergency a couple of days ago and get a stronger prescription hydrocortizone cream.  I honestly thought I would go nuts with the itch and the burning.  Only today is it all starting to settle down, thank God.  There are no follow-up appts with the RO, only one in March with the MO, as I've been on Tamox since Dec. 23.  I really have no idea what is next.  No one has said a thing.  I don't know when or how often I'm supposed to get mammos, no mention of monitoring the uterus for SE's from Tamox, etc.  So I've scheduled an appt. with my GP tomorrow to ask a ton of questions.  She's supposed to be in the loop and has been sent all my records, supposedly.  I have a lot of concerns post tx and as I mentioned earlier, no one is being pro-active in dishing out information.  So, once again, I have to go after it myself. Do most of you feel it is the same for you?  Do these med professionals just get hardened or insulated after awhile from dealing with so much of this? ",

I think it takes that long to build up during the week.  But then the weekend comes and all is good again by Monday.  A little redness, some weird twinges now and then, but other than that, pretty darn good.  Using Miaderm every day and a little hydrocortisone when the nipple/aerola gets itchy.  Getting a little tired at different points during the day, but not extreme by any means. Thank you so much to all you ladies on here who helped me out.  Honestly, if I had had to rely on my medical people, I would have had ZERO information about this journey.  They just don't offer up much, and when you're new to the diganosis and the treatments, you just don't know what to ask.  This forum has made me much more proactive in my own treatment because of all the fantastic info I've learned on here.  It helped me ask good questions, and a lot of them were a little shocked that I was asking some of them and a few even asked, \"How did you know about that?\" or \"Why are you asking that?\" Thanks again, and love you all!!!!",

Localgirl & Beacher - What kind of reconstruction are you referring to?  Implants? I think I can understand why they want you to wait so long . . . the radiated area can take a long time to heal and be as normal as normal can be.  Please let me know what they say about implants and detection for recurrence.  I also am lopsided due to lumpectomy and re-excision, and have one nipple that got a a little lift and is looking quite perky, and the other one is down where it should be, given my age, LOL.  But they don't match, and one is bigger than the other so I am interested in what you are talking about. Localgirl - Thanks for your great explanation on boosts.  My rad onc never gave me any - - didn't think I needed any.  But I am a little nervous about that, because I had to have a re-excision, and there was a lot of concern at the time about my biopsy track.  I don't quite understand why they wouldn't boost me????  Better safe than sorry, I say.  But again, when I asked about it, my rad onc took the position that my tumor was small, early stage, and that I should breeze through this and be just fine afterwards - - no boosts necessary.  I sincerely hope so . . . Teklya - We are also having the severely cold weather.  We are practically neighbours!    Are you sending the cold to us or are we sending it to you? Victoria67 - I also have red spots like freckles.  That's a good description . . . I was going to say they looked like measles. Attached is a pic of \"Atlantis\", the machine I've been spending time with these last few weeks.  Also the Atlantis rad team . . . great bunch of girls.   ",

Our first ever winter holiday was two years ago to the DR at the Catalonia Bavarro resort in Punta Cana, and we absolutely loved it.  Had a great time, although the food left a little be to be desired.  But we didn't go hungry, and the weather and surroundings were so amazing, that we didn't really care. Wishing you an wonderful holiday and congratulations on finishing rads soon!!!  Happy dance . . .",

      "Content": "Nov 2, 2010 12:35AM Pennythoughts wrote: Wow - I didn't know about these issues being related to BC.  If that's the case, then I may be in big trouble.   I have only been diagnosed for about a month and a half and had lumpectomy and SLNB on Oct. 4.  Next week, I will have a re-excision as clear margins were not obtained. I am 48, premenopausal and have been having these same vaginal/painful intercourse problems for several years already,  I complained to my family doc about it, and at that time, he really didn't take me seriously.  At first, the symptoms felt similar to a yeast infection, but not quite.  I have had many yeast infections in my life so I thought I just had another one.  But the treatments didn't work.  Then I thought it might be bacterial vaginosis - I have also had two bouts with that.  Finally, I demanded a referral to a gyn.  She could not find anything abnormal, so she sent me to a dermatologist.  It was only then that I got the diagnosis of vulvodynia.  Vulvo what???? Vulvodynia is a generalized pain of the vulva.  For many years, docs thought that these types of complaints were \"all in the head\" of the women complaining about it.  The pain is very weird and very hard to describe . . . the pain that is there when you're not having sex, I mean.  During sex, it is agonizing and can be sharp shooting pains deep inside the vagina like a knife, or a burning sensation around the opening of the vagina.  But the pain can be there during the day just some times, or all of the time.  Sometimes the pain feels like it is inside, and sometimes the entire vulvar area on the outside is irritated and painful, and almost itchy, but not as itchy as yeast infection. Here are the suggestions of the dermatologist:  wash underwear only in non-fragrance laundry detergent, i.e. Tide Free, double rinse everything and add baking soda to the final rinse.  Avoid use of ALL soaps of any kind in the shower or bath.  He suggested Cetaphil but I use Aveeno body wash for sensitive skin - no fragrance.  I also use Replens about every 3 days. Yes it helps moisturize, but has done little to help the pain during intercourse.  When I told my gyn that I had no sexual desire whatsoever, she prescribed Androgel and assured me it would do the trick.  But I couldn't use it because it burned so badly when I applied it to the labia.  So that was out.  Then she said SSRI's can settle down the pain triggers of the nerve endings in the vulva, so I started taking Celexa, as much for the depression as for the pain problems.  But they forgot to tell me that a well-known side effect of Celexa is a markedly lower libido.  Like I needed any help with that - it was already terrible!  So I have recently switched anti-depressants to Wellbutrin, which is not supposed to affect the libido. I said all that to say this . . . I had enough problems before BC.  It sounds like not only will my situation not improve, but it might get worse.  That is a total downer.  My poor DH - he has already been through enough even without the BC.  Vulvodynia can be triggered by all kinds of things, trauma or injury to the vulva in younger years, chronic yeast or vaginosis infections, etc.  After reading all of your posts, it occurs to me that BC could be a pretty big trigger for vulvodynia (there are actually a few different kinds of it - lots of info online). What I found interesting was someone mentioning something about the muscles in the vaginal wall.  There is a doctor in Toronto (can't remember who at the moment) who runs one of the only vulvodynia clinics in the country (Canada) and he sells a machine with vaginal insert attachments (similar to a TENS machine, I think)  that women use to stimulate that area and get it \"working\" properly again.  It's a little pricey, but just may be worth the investment.  The troubles you ladies are describing are so very similar to what I've already had with vulvodynia, I do so appreciate all I've read on this thread, as it gives me more ideas of things to talk to my docs about to try to solve this issue, or at least make it better.  I find it very sad and depressing that I really, really do not want to have sex.  The anticipation of the pain is probably as bad or worse than the pain itself, which then makes arousal almost impossible.  I don't know if BC can make it any worse than it already is, but I hope not.",
