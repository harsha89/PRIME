I am waiting for the radiation therapist to complete my \"plan\", and expect to have my sim either Thursday or Friday this week.  Ready to get this party started!!  So many of my life plans have been put on hold that I'm having more stress with all the waiting than the actual cancer diagnosis/treatment.  Anxious for the day when breast cancer doesn't dominate every thought in my head. ",

Covering my eyes takes away the urge to see what the machine is doing and helps me relax.  2.  I have my own music playlist (http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/30-inspirational-songs-that-keep-you-motivated-for-life.html?ref=e) that the technicians play at high volume before, during, and after my treatment.  The play list is on a random shuffle, so I look forward to treatment everyday just to see what my song will be!!  Somedays it is extremely difficult not to tap my toes, so I make up for it by dancing in the dressing room.  3.  My RO nurse gave me a tube of Miaderm (http://amzn.com/B004TB9SFE ) that I started using one week prior to my first treatment.  Now I take it with me to treatment and use it while I'm dancing in the dressing room.  Then I use it everytime I go to the restroom and again before bed.  My treatments are at 11 a.m. so I don't use it in the morning.  My skin was a little red last week, but it didn't get any worse.  Wireless, cotton bra seems to be the most comfortable. 4.  I am listening to \"Let's Pretend This Never Happened\" by Jenny Lawson as recommended by someone earlier in this thread.  I turn it on at work and listen with another secretary.  We giggle and laugh out loud!  Love it!  Hoping that any of this makes someone else's treatments easier.  I have been helped immeasurably by reading what you all are experiencing!  ",
