Sometime ago she has lost bladder and bowel control and has now general weakness in the whole body. She doesn't even talk anymore. She just sleeps and stays there if you know what I mean. We finally found out today that she has got breast cancer and that it has spread quite a lot. Does anyone know if it is possible to recover from this? It really doesn't look good! Thanks in advance.
