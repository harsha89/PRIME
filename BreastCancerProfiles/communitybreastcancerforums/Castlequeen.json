    "Content": "Castlequeen wrote: I have to have surgery in my left hand not related to the breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy with lymph node removal back on November 2011. It is now November 2015 and I have to have surgery on my hand to remove bone fragments. I was in the surgery area, already on an IV drip when the doctor told me he would not do the surgery until he found out if there was a risk of lymphadema after wards. It seemed strange when I was already prepped for surgery, sat in the surgery center waiting to go into surgery for nearly 4 hours and then he comes and talks to me about the possibility of getting lymphadema. Does anyone know about anything like this. Opinions or information would be appreciated it anyone else has gone through this and if they had surgery done to another part of their arm after having a lumpectomy...
