So, if I have reached my limit on my current insurance and can't go on Medicare til June/July, what do I do with monthly bills that are $80,000.  Should I get on to DH's plan as a supplemental? (I have not had a lapse in coverage in 20 years)  Would they pay what my BC/BS won't? And then going forward, when I qualify for Medicare and I've passed the age of 50, I can have AARP Supplemental and Medicare.  Then I would just have to find a prescription plan.  None will match what I have now --$3 for generic; $10 for namebrands.  Do you have any recommendations for prescription plans?  Love, Caryn",

Tomorrow, she, and several members from various departments at the hospital, hopefully someone from Dr. Willis's office, and I will be the \"Go Caryn\" team.  We are fighting so that my insurance company will pay for 28 days worth of Sutent, which is, unfortunately, seems to be the only drug at this point that will prevent the cancer from coming back. We'll be speaking to an Horizon BC/BS appeals committee with only one physician - and not an oncologist at that. I literally have a total of 10 minutes to make a case and plead for my life tomorrow, like I did in front of the FORCE advocacy panel two years ago at the their Conference. I pray that G-d gives me the strength and the words to get through this. Please pray for me. I don't know what I'll do if I can't get this drug paid for. It's $4000 vs. my life. I just have to prove to them that I'm worth more than $4000. Isn't this crazy?! Caryn Dx 6/28/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

You asked how you get past the anger, betrayal and defeat.  All I can tell you is that you can take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  And when you feel angry, don't try to stuff it or worry that you are killing yourself because you are having a negative thought.  Just let it flow and before you know it, the next emotion will come, and then the next, and the next.  It's been two years of mets for me, with triple negative BC and four years before that of remission from the original early stage cancer after that treatment.  It's been a roller coaster ride.  Just when you think you are at the top, you can plunge down.  I just took it as it came, did what the doctors, the naturopaths, the reiki masters, acupuncturists said to do.  I prayed and meditated and opened myself up to the love, support, and powerful healing energy sent to me by my support system (lots of them online).  Just this last month, after spending most of the summer in and out of the hospital, I found out that I am in remission and that my floating cancer cell blood test shows no detectible cancer cells.  That means that there is a 90% that I have two years before a serious cancer flare up comes up.  An who knows what they will come up with by then? You will get over the shock, but probably will wistfully long for the 'old norma'.  Just know that we all do.  You are not alone.  G-d doesn't make mistakes, so there must be a purpose in all this.  I hope this helps.
