I too was absolutely terrified of the whole thing. I had a huge phobia about the entire medical field prior to cancer, so a port, chemo and radiation were mentally debilitating for me. I seriously thought about just calling it a day and skipping the whole thing. Now (6 months out) I am glad I went through it even though I am still struggling. Every person handles treatment differently, but I will share that I didn't get sick once during chemo, and I don't have any burns from radiation. They have come such a long way with the chemo drugs themselves, and there are so many options for anti-nausea now. I took a pepcid and steroid each morning and a different anti-nausea med at night that allowed me to sleep. I had 2 options for nausea as needed, only took one of them a couple of times, more as a precautionary measure than anything. I'm not saying any of this is easy, but share your fears with your oncologist, and don't be afraid to speak up if something doesn't work for you. Always remember that while you drew the short straw on BC, you still are in charge of decision-making for yourself, your body, and your mind. It also helped that I continued my hobbies and continued working (to the best of my ability). It really helped distract me from my darkest thoughts. Sometimes, not all the time lol. I allowed myself to cry and yell and enjoy my red wine when I needed to. Sending big hugs. You will get through this!!! ",

I came to the boards (again) today because I am also stage 3c, lost, confused, scared, terrified, worried, crying all the time, and feeling so alone. Add to that that my treatments have ended, my hair has grown back, and I look normal with clothes on, so everyone expects me to be \"fine\" when I am anything but. I was looking for something to reassure me before I posted an \"I need help\" post, and found this thread. I'm the same age as you and also at UWH. I had a horrible experience with a different MO, but have heard very good things about your doc. And like you I had a \"clean\" mammo & US 03/2017, knew that day that something was wrong, and lo and behold 10 months later found out I had stage 3c BC. If you want to talk, feel free to PM me. Sending hugs!! I don't feel quite so alone anymore ETA: We must be twins......we were diagnosed 2 weeks apart!!",
