The literature that I've read so far indicates that women under 50 benefit more by this regimen for the same diagnosis to ensure against developing cancer in the same area...for women older, I am 77 years, the chances of a reurrence is 28%. I need to weigh the risk/benefits for this and I've read older women who have arthritis are suffering severe arthritic pain from taking tamoxifen and are willing to go through the five years of this regimen because of their diagnosis of DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ, post surgery. I have severe spinal stenosis due to bone spurs etc. and other arthritic problems and have been able to keep the pain down most days. I would choose to increase my exercise regime and carefully watch my diet, I do not fall into any \"risk\" categories and would like to know if anyone would have any comment on this dilemma.

I'm 77 and have low risk factor according to Gail model and tamoxifen presents with some serious side effects I want to avoid if possible. I'm still gathering information so that I can ask the proper questions when I meet with my oncologist I can be more informed as to what treatment options are available. I know that this is still at a microscopic stage but need to know if the treatment can be specifically tailored to me, my person and not a random protocol that this condition seems to warrant. I would like to get my pathology reports and submit them to an oncologist in whom I have a great deal of respect and has agreed to look at them. From what I can gather, with this condition, women under the age of 50 had a reduced incidence of clinically detected benign breast disease. After looking at the data more carefully, there seems to be no info on my age group and risk/benefits for taking tamoxifen for this condition. Granted as one ages, the increase for breast cancer is increased, but then it drops off after a certain age, I think it's at 85, so I need to ask more questions of my oncologist but I would like to be more specific about my situation. ",
