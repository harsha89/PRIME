It behaves differently, however, having a lower rate of spread to other parts of the body but a higher rate of having a second breast cancer later. Most of these tumors are spiculated and have a great prognosis.",

My Ki67 was 3.3%. My concern with not doing radiation would be because of cells that can be displaced by the initial biopsies themselves. As I understand it, that is one of the reasons that they do radiation. If you had a surgical biopsy that might not be as much of an issue. My first of eight nodes taken had 2 separate micromets. Because of the month between my biopsy and lumpectomy I have wondered if the multiple biopsy samples taken via core and needle methods caused the micromet issue. The node may have just received debris from the biopsies. Nobody can say for sure that this happened but it is definitely possible and something to consider.",

My doctor did tell me that they think some of these cases of node isolated tumor cells and micromets may not be true mets but instead just the nodes doing their job picking up residue from the biopsies.

The others were clear. Maybe somebody will come along and explain this better than I but my understanding is that they use a gamma detector (sort of like a geiger counter) after the nuclear injection. They remove tissue within a certain range on the counter. They don't actually know how many they are removing until they are looked at in the lab because they remove a pad of tissue and the nodes are imbedded inside. The nodes are various sizes and everybody has a different number. I was told that some are as small as the head of a pin and others the size of a lima bean. If the first blue node is negative I don't think then even check the others.",

My doctors could not figure out why I had micromets in 1 node with my little lazy tumor. I have wondered if the node was cleaning up residue from the biopsies (I had stero and needle the same day) and they took several samples from each. I wonder if that could be the case with you. Since your tumor was in the inner quadrant maybe the node closest picked up the biopsy/surgery loose tissue. I assume your Estrogen and Prog. were high since you are grade 1 so the hormone blockers should work very well. Best wishes!",

I had 2 nodal areas radiated for extra protection although they were not in the IMLN area. This might be a better choice since your Oncotype score was so low and chemo might not be effective.",

That means the cells are dividing slowly and chemo is for rapidly dividing cells. What were her Estrogen and Progesterone percentages? Grade? 1 positive of how many nodes taken? FYI...My KI67 was also 3% and my Oncotype Dx indicated that chemo would actually lower my 10 year outlook. I had micromets in 1 node.",
