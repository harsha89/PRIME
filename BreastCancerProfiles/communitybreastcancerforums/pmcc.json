In most countries it isn't legal to sell and use drugs until they've been granted a licence by the country's regulatory authority.  To my knowledge, the only country so far to have licenced TDM-1 for sale is the USA. The company submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 1 October 2012, which covers regulation for all EU member states and the EMA are still assessing the application.  It's on priority review http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/14207/2012-11-06/fda-grants-genentechs-trastuzumab-emtans If the EMA pass the application and grant a licence then TDM-1 would theoretically be available in both France and Montenegro as EU member states. My guess it it would be available in France straight away. As to whether you can buy an unlicensed drug, the situation depends on the specific law in any one country - it may be that in some countries it's a grey area and not strictly illegal.  I don't know what the specific legal situtation is in France and Montenegro - your friend could perhaps find out. In addition, it's highly unlikely that Genetech would sell to an individual person who does not have the means to correctly handle and administer a drug.  They may sell directly to a clinician or hospital if the legal position could be clarified.  It may be that, as a company, they simply will not sell in a country which has not be licenced. You could ask them - if they don't have an FAQ on this, I'd suggest one would be useful. I'm really sorry that this all seems so negative.  I just wanted to get down the facts as I understand them before your friend spends lots of time and effort on this. I have fingers and toes crossed that the EMA will make a decision soon so that TDM-1 will be available for my sister, your friend and all the others who need it. Best wishes P",
