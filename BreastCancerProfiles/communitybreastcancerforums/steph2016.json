I am doing AC every 2 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 4 weekly taxol treatments, then radiation. My first treatment was on August 25th and so far I have been very lucky! Some nausea, a few days of extreme tiredness but that's it. I am a stay at home mom to two fabulous little boys. Michael is 6 and a half and Joseph is 3 and a half. I also homeschool, which might be a good idea with my immune system this year. During round one I was really tired on days 4 through 7, but then it lifted. I still managed to cook, clean, and even homeschool, through it all so it was not as bad as I had feared! Thursday I go in for my second round and am hoping that it will be about the same as the first. The only real complication so far is mouth sores, which are really annoying! I was happy to read that chewing on ice chips during the A would help, no one at my center has mentioned it. So Thursday I will go to my infusion center with a cup of ice chips and hope for the best! So far my hair has not left, but is strangely greasy even immediately after I wash it, but I'm expecting it to leave soon. I picked out my wig a few weeks ago with help from the boys. I'm trying to involve them as much as possible so that they feel part of the process and hopefully less scared. In July I had a unilateral mastectomy on the right side with spacer and am currently having fills in anticipation of reconstruction. This week I am 6 weeks out and just now starting to feel like myself! It's kind of like grade school again learning to pad a bra correctly. I think that's about all, I am very glad to have found this board; it's nice to meet people going through the same thing and to be able to talk to others with out the sad looks. ",

I tried sucking on ice cubes this time to help with mouth sores (not fun by the way). Really no nausea yet, we'll see tomorrow. My hair is still hanging in there, I almost just wish it would fall out so I could stop worrying about when it will happen. I've been trying to clean up my diet, cleaning products and personal care projects. It helps to feel in control about something and to have something to focus on. I hope everybody else is doing as well with their rounds! Just a comment to provide hope to others, on round 1 no bone pain at all with neulasta. I hear it is terrible, but it may not happen!!!  ",
