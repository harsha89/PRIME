I wasn't aware that I had a family history and I'm only 21 so the doctor told me to follow up again in 6 months. Since then I found out my mother and aunt has masses removed when they were my age and my mother Aunt passed from breast cancer. I also noticed that my nipple looks like it is pulling inward, what scares me the most is that it is pulling in right where they said the mass was. 1 o'clock on my left breast. This might to TMI but when my nipples are warm they look fine, when it's cold that's when I notice the indentation/retraction. I'm going to all and see if I can get a needle biopsy, but is there any other thing that could be causing these symptoms? Log in to post a reply",
