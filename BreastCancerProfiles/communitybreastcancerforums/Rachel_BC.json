Press is always a double edged sword. ",

I don't know if the Look Good Feel Better folks have this stuff down either, and I know a lot of gals here are in the hair industry, salon owners, stylists and maybe colorists too.  So I got with my colorist, who was teaching colorists at Bumble and Bumble, he's also the colorist for several makeover shows like She's Got the Look and Make Me A Supermodel.  He really, really knows his stuff.  But- this is a totally new territory.  He's been doing the research, reading message boards and learning about the issues. We think this is a super opportunity to do a lot of good for everyone.  Any idea how we could get a bunch of gals (and guys) who are growing in hair and have questions, and/or want to try some stuff out to see if it works, and/or are colorists who want to work on these issues? He was trying to explain to me for instance that when the hair is first growing in it has no melatonin from the chemo, so it has no color (?) .  If you put a brown color on the hair, it is missing some of the primary colors that are assumed in the dye, so the color ends up \"muddy\".  He theorized that first dying the hair some of the missing oranges and golds before the brown would make it look better, but its just a theory and he needs some volunteers to try it out.   Best if you were in NYC and could come to the salon, but if you're game to try this wherever you are, he will work with you to sort it out over the Internet.  Everyone learns, and he hopes to become an expert on the process so that he can help everyone in the future- and its good for business too!  (Could be awesome!)   I was going to try to start a new thread, but I saw this one and figured this was a good place to start.   I am so happy he is doing this (and he's also working with the Look Good Feel Better people) I am going to surprise him with a web site.  I just bought the name so its not up yet but give me a day and it will be: www.JosephMullenColor.com I will link it to his facebook page, you can find him there as Joseph Mullen Colorist If you wanna email him, PM me and I will give you his email- instead of posting it on the forum. I am not going to favorite this thread because I know NOTHING myself about hair color and so far nothing about chemo and hair loss from chemo, and I got my own breast cancer fish to fry so to speak. All the best to you folks- in fact, that's what i am trying to do- get you the BEST in the business, because really, Joseph is.   many hugs ",

And because they are not as liquid there is less chance of leakage. \u201cAfter the FDA re-approved silicone gel implants in 2006, [more] women are undergoing primary breast augmentation with silicone gel implants or exchanging saline implants for silicone,\u201d she says. Currently in clinical trials, gummies are ideal for women who have lost breast tissue after childbirth as well as those who want to enhance their décolletage. CHEST  Procedure: Microdermabrasion, laser and glycolic peel Cost: $600 Done by: Dr. David Colbert, 119 Fifth Ave., 212-533-8888 Colbert has devised a triad of treatments to restore skin that appears mottled and uneven after a summer of sun exposure. He gives patients micro-dermabrasion, 12 minutes of a Cutera laser \u2014 he swears \u201cit feels like warm raindrops on the skin\u201d \u2014 and a glycolic peel. The result is soft, smooth skin devoid of dark brown spots. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of celebrities come in to get their faces done, and they forget the chest,\u201c says Colbert. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep things uniform.\u201d  To treat tenacious cellulite, Scorz uses sound waves to improve dimpled skin. \u201cCellulite is fat which makes its way into the dermis instead of staying in the subcutaneous layer,\u201d explains Sadick. \u201cThe fat cells are also oriented in such a way to allow the fat to pouch out. Sonic waves produce heat, which softens them like silly putty and pushes them back where they belong.\u201d While there is still no miracle cure, patients report significant improvement.   FEET  Procedure: Acid peel; Cost: $100 Done by: Dr. Suzanne Levine, 885 Park Ave., 212-535-0229 Never mind vigorously scraping away at calluses. Levine uses a 70-percent medical grade acid peel to eviscerate them. \u201cYour feet will tingle, but you will have no pain and it gets rid of all those cracks you have from wearing mules,\u201c she swears. After the peel, she zaps unattractive spider veins with the EPAT ultrasound machine and injects fat-busting phosphatidylcholine around the ankles. NOSE  Procedure: Open rhinoplasty Cost: $4,000-$5,000 Done by: Dr. Bob Cattani, 159 E. 74th St., 212-772-0505 \u201cRhinoplasty is a surgery of millimeters, not centimeters,\u201c says Cattani. Traditionally, a small incision is made between the nostrils to allow access to cartilage and bone. Cattani\u2019s open rhinoplasty lifts the skin to offer the surgeon a full view. The scar is minimal and, to perfect details, he injects Juviderm and Restylane. THEETH  Procedure: Laminates and \u201cGumoflage\u201c Cost: $1,800 per tooth for thin veneers, $2,200 per tooth for super-strong veneers and $1,500-$2,500 for gumoflage Done by: Dr. Lana Rozenberg, 45 W. 54th St., 212-265-7724; Dr. Steven Butensky, 16 E. 52nd St., 212-486-6622 New thinner laminates not only create a more natural look than traditional porcelain veneers, they don\u2019t require shaving your teeth down to nubs. Previously, thin veneers didn't work for those with deep stains, but new color blockers can be painted on natural teeth. \u201cEven teeth severely stained by coffee and wine can now look white and pearly,\u201d says Rozenberg, who tends to the mouths of Scarlett Johansson and Kim Cattrall. Butensky, who brightens the smiles of Molly Sims and Tinsley Mortimer, uses a new stronger laminate. \u201cThe material holds up better, especially for people who are grinders,\u201c he explains. Rozenberg also now has a procedure she refers to as \u201cgumoflage,\u201c which corrects a smile that shows too much gum by lowering the lip slightly, without bone grafting as in the past. JOWLS  Procedure: Aculift Cost: $3,500 to $5,000 Done by: Dr. Jon Turk, 800-A Fifth Ave., 212-421-4845 Previously, droopy jowls were firmed with a classic facelift \u2014 cutting and tightening skin and muscles. Now, Aculift, a thin laser fiber, removes fat from the area and tightens skin. \u201cIt\u2019s less traumatic and safer than liposuction, with a much shorter downtime, \u201c says Turk. \u201cI suggest people consider this at the early signs of aging, in your 40s.\u201d ARMS  Procedure: Short-scar arm lift Cost: $10,000-$15,000 Done by: Dr. Larry Reed, 45 E. 85th St., 212-772-8300 The fix for loose, jiggly arms used to come with a huge scar from the chest to the elbow. Reed has introduced a short-scar arm lift with a smaller incision that\u2019s tucked under the armpit. It not only tightens the skin, it gets rid of the fat pocket on the side of the chest and fullness in back of the arm. Bonus: it eliminates hair and some sweat glands in the armpit! Drawback: recovery takes longer \u2014 you can\u2019t raise your elbows above the shoulders for three weeks.",

One month on Tamox and so far, it is not affecting my hair growth.  If anything, it seems to be growing faster.  Joseph said it seemed normal, but i was in for roots in a month and usually i can go 6 weeks.  (For newbies, i did not do chemo, this is just normal hair growth)  3 lessons so far I have learned from and for chemo patients regarding hair 1- Just being welcomed into a salon for hair care after chemo is incredibly important.  There are special concerns and hair coloring is trickier, but even if they screw up the color, just knowing that you belong there and deserve to be treated as a beautiful woman is critical on so many levels.  The staff at salons need to be educated, it helps them and their chemo clients. 2- Chemo patients are often made to feel that their reasonable concerns about their hair growing back is \"vanity\". This is perverse. 3- It's one thing to get over the first shock of the cancer DX.  And its one more thing to face chemo, the physical discomfort (to say the least) and the hair loss.  But the kicker is that after that's all over, it's like a year later, surgeries done, chemo done, cancer faced, time lost but now you suddenly look like Uncle Fester, and its going to take years to get \"back\".  Still. What I mean to do by stating this is to validate your concerns.  You are not vain or impatient, and what you see in the mirror is not what people see when they are looking at you.  Other people see you as looking MUCH better than you see  yourself, because what you see is not *your* you.  Everyone else gets to choose their hairstyle- and you will too.   Someone said there's a lot of posts here because you are \"whiners\" - if that's the criteria, then we on the Bottle o Tamoxifen must be super-whiners because we have nearly twice the posts for the same span of time.  Hair is really a big deal.  Today walking to the salon to  get my hair colored no one paid particular attention to me.  But after a really nice blowout and super color (added a LOT of dark dark on the bottom) men were falling all over me flirting.  I had a hard time buying socks because the salesmen were flirting so heavily.  Walking home people were nicer to me.  Come on, hair is a BFD man, everyone fusses over their hair.  And the eyelashes and eyebrows- that's a big deal.  Not everyone wants to be Guinan (Star Trek/Whoopie Goldberg reference). Look we all know hair is not more important than life itself, but losing it is a big big big pain in the ass and anyone who minimizes or dismisses your concerns is either ignorant or some other defect I can't define. But it aint YOU. Hugs beautiful ladies.  Thank you for putting your health and safety first, for surviving chemo, and for hanging in there all this while afterwards. ",

But let's say she did run to manufacture in after a January 2008 DX, realistically that couldn't be before April, and if \"Molly\" just happened to be one of the first people who tried this product at $50 a pop,  in April... and you started growing out when????  DETAILS.  Enough with the \"recently\" and \"long time\" evasions.  Your writing sounds remarkably like the writing of the author of the site, English is not your first language- or hers- is it.  So no, I don't believe you, not at all.  And I don't believe the web site either.  Where are your pictures?  Your \"Did you knows\" are complete nonsense- show your sources if you think you know something, that's a load of ca ca.  No it's not true. Really Molly, all you have done is come here and push a product and make confusing statements at best and then accuse the fine women here of things they did not do.  You are not helping, you are hurting, and I won't stand for it.  Oh I see at the end you make it sound like you are leaving and this is why- this from the same woman who said she'd been reading this board for a long time but not posting.  What a load of complete CRAP.  Molly just posted that last post to try and cover her tracks, maybe because she got a warning from the moderators.  Chelev, Mom of Boys- you have nothing to apologize for, this was a cold, cynical attack from a cancer profiteer.",

Then I was telling a young mommy friend about having to avoid sweating and getting my hair wet for 3 days, that's crazy, but I am doing it.  It's supposed to rain the next three days, so I am making plans to avoid going outside, just did the grocery shopping tonight.  She tells me she is going for her Japanese Straightening appt Thursday, and that's got to be also $400-$600.  Sally Hershberger who cut Clinton and Hillary's hair charges $600 for a cut.  Politicians fly their stylists in, and Jose Eber cut off Farrah's hair when she was going for chemo...  If you shave a dog they will become depressed and usually be cut from the pack.  It's even in the animal kingdom.  Even a young boy's first haircut is a rite of passage.  How about all those locks of hair being kept in lockets from the early centuries, the story of Delilah.  Don't even get me started on how MEN obsess about their hair... and its proven that there is all sorts of social discrimination against bald men in general (jobs, promotions, romance etc). The Enron movie had a whole section on how Skilling got hair.  I had a friend who made a fortune with men's hair weaves. It's one thing when one chooses to shave their head (sinnead) or wear their hair very short (susan powter, grace jones, annie lennox) but to be forcibly stripped of your hair to save your life is akin to being put into a concentration camp, its dehumanizing.  Obsessed? you? just for asking if it was really growing in because it's so light?  No.  Not.  Not a bit. Nonsense.  Blarney.  BS. Crapola. ",

I do have some \"clean\" pics too... so lbrewer, mom of boys and chelev... lemme know? I keep my word, I won't post without permission :) So you DID do the flat iron thing!  Did it work?  Joseph told me (Joseph correct me if I am wrong) that if you have enough hair to get in the flat iron, you can do the keratin treatment.  I insisted on the keratin treatment that does not have formaldehyde, and actually got the last batch of the brand (there's another brand without formaldehyde Joseph says) and I took before and after pics, I will post as soon as I can.   He warned me a lot that the kind I was using would NOT straighten my hair, only make it more manageable, and it has.  Its just better and softer - it was getting scratchy and impossible to manage.  So when he gets back on this thread maybe he can explain what kind of effects you can expect from the treatments keratin with and without formaldehyde, and also Japanese Straightening.  Although Japanese Straightening can't be used on processed hair, so that's another thing. I was thinking for you to get one of those inexpensive DIY circle extension things in a curly style and color you like, then use whatever - keratin and color and the flat iron (and I really don't see why you'd have to have the keratin done in the salon if you can blow dry, section and spritz your hair with the stuff, then flat iron it yourself) to color your hair to match the temporary extension thing, ending up with long, curly red hair for the honeymoon and some weeks as a temporary fix until you get some more length. How long was your hair when you flat ironed it straight?  I am imagining that in a couple months it should be getting close to your chin, and long enough for your own bangs. I texted Chelev yesterday in case she lost my number, maybe I should have been more clear, but I think and hope she's just out and about having the best time in the city.  It's been a crazy week in NYC, the UN meeting of all the heads of state of all the members turned the city upside down, the weather was perfect yesterday and today its raining.  So darling whereeer you are I hope you are having a BLAST and I want to hear all the details! :D",

I see you have added your diagnosis, but maybe you made a typo? Here's your diagnosis line: Diagnosis: IDC, <1cm, Stage IIb, Grade 3, 1/15 nodes, mets, ER-, HER2+    You say you have been reading this site since you were diagnosed, when was that?   More details please. ",
