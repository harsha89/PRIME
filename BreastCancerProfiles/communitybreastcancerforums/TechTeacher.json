      "Content": "TechTeacher wrote: Hi all, New to the forums and hoping there are some plus-size women here. It is very hard to find support and information specifically geared toward larger bodies. Or maybe I'm just not looking in the right places. Anyway, after my biopsy and being diagnosed with DCIS (centrally located on the right side), my breast surgeon ordered an MRI. In the film from that they found another area of question, also on the right, that didn't show up in the previous mammograms or ultrasounds. I've been told I have very dense breast tissue. The location of this second area is on the right, way back on the outside near where the breast hits the rest of my torso. So the BS ordered an MRI-guided biopsy to get a sample of the area in question. Because of the size of my body, the size of my breasts, and the location, they had to use the larger opening MRI machine and the software there was unable to guide them to a sample of the tissue in question. I've since switched breast surgeons (for unrelated reasons) and the new BS is showing the films and report to the radiologist at her Breast Center. Waiting to hear back if it is worth it to try again to get a sample, or if the radiologist feels like it is likely that we'll end up with the same problem. So here are my questions: 1) Is there anyone here who has had a similar problem with body/breast size and MRI-guided biopsies? 2) The original area of DCIS combined with the calcifications around it is fairly large (6.5 cm). The second area is about 4cm. I'm leaning toward plowing ahead with a skin sparing mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy. But I worry that I'm making a decision out of frustration and fear instead of science and best practices. Opinions? Thoughts? For what it's worth I'm 48, my breasts fed my child. I firmly believe that in a year I'd rather look back and feel like maybe we were a bit more aggressive than we needed to be rather that wish we had dome more. I have a 9-year-old son to raise. Wow. I really took the long way around on that, didn't I. Sorry for the long post.

At that appointment found calcifications. Biopsied the calcifications, found DCIS. Assumed we would do a lump with rads. Then in the MRI they found this second area, which never showed up anywhere else. It has been like a never-ending cancer scavenger hunt. The first location is grade three, er-/pr-. Also I was negative for all know genetic markers. Do you mind me asking what tipped the scales for you to decide to have a mx?",

I am lucky in that I've got great support and no small number of friend with medical skills, who seem to get it so well. debiann--you may be on to something. Not sure I want a second job. But maybe it is time to take up a mentally distracting hobby. Knitting or some thing of the like. Of course, if you saw my house you'd realize I should probably take up not being such a slob. But that's considerable less fun. Lily55 and littleblueflowers--Thank you. Validation is, I think, the thing I'm missing. Everyone is trying so hard to lift me up. And I so appreciate their good intentions. But sometimes you just need a solid \"This sucks!\". ",

      "Content": "TechTeacher wrote: So all of this started for me at the beginning of August when I went in for a 6 month follow-up to take a second look at some cysts in my right breast. Since then it's been two and half months of tests and doctors and bad news and waiting and having hard conversations with people I love. Making my mom cry. In the last week or two I got to the point where I was so tired and frustrated an angry with being in \"find out more\" mode that I felt like I was perpetually on the verge of a free roaming angry outburst in search of a target pretty much all the time. Yesterday, my BS and I set a tentative date (Nov. 15), assuming the PS can do my surgery then (R mx, delayed SIEA reconstruction). Welcome to \"let's do something\" mode. Now I just feel depressed and on the verge of tears. I'm a middle school teacher, so in some ways that helps. Never a dull minute and their energy lifts me up every day. But every time I stop moving, even for a few minutes, I feel like I'm going to burst into tears. All this just got so freakin' real. I'm so scared. And then I feel like some kind of a jerk for freaking out so hard. My journey is so, so much less harrowing than so many of the amazing, brave warriors I read about on this site. I just feel like I can barely move. I can't remember ever feeling so sad.
