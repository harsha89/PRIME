Getting fresh air , enough water and rest.   It is scary and I still think every ache could be something but working ourselves into panic doesn't help or change anything. Sending you big hugs Viv",

Go get the tests you need and if necessary change your doctor to someone who can help you.  Breast cancer is not necessarily at death sentence but believe me it is a very hard war. My daughter was 14 when I was diagnosed and we have weathered the storm and are now so much more closer than before.  She has grown up quickly but we are both okay. If you need support, look to the girls here or support groups in your local area.  You will be amazed that if you do enter the sisterhood how much support and love you receive from other BC Survivors.  Ask questions, get knowledge so that you are not in the dark and you know what is going on. I am here for you so if you need a hand please PM me. Again , big hugs for you and your daughter...Remember you are not alone Viv",

My journey started in January when I found a lump and was advised to wait until my next period because they were fairly certain that it was hormonal.   One month later lump not gone...in one week I had gp, mammo, ultrasound, fine needle biosopy, gp again, specialist that set me up to be operated on the next week. It is hard when you don't have definate answers and things are moving at an alarming rate. My advice look after yourself and at the moment just be prepared for the unexpected.  You have to learn to trust your specialist.  I found it really hard because when you are sick you can normally just rest and your body repairs itself...but bc doesn't work like that!  Had to accept I had to give it over to someone else to fix for the moment and give it back. Stay around on these forums all these women and so helpful and know exactly what you are going through so you don't feel so alone.   They have been my saviours Big hugs Viv  ",
