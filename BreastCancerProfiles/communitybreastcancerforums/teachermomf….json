That stinks that you were all ready to have it done, only to have to reschedule. I hope everything goes well!",

Thankfully, mine has healed up nicely. I hate starting the new year with a surgery, as our deductible resets. I'm thankful to have medical insurance, but I truly hate the insurance companies. I feel like in these situations, the insurance company should do what it can do to expedite things. We'll probably have to pay out of pocket Tuesday. Our HSA card expires the end of December. We called the company and inquired as to why we haven't received a replacement, and they mailed out new cards. I took my daughter to a doctor appointment yesterday and discovered that the HSA company cancelled our current card when the mailed out the new one. WTH?! We'll be able to submit invoices for reimbursement, but jeez...I'll be keeping track of you as well. Good luck!",

Went for annual in November. Was called back (as usual), but this time for calcifications. After magnification mammo,the radiologist took me in a room to talk (that's never happened). They were concerned, as the microcalcifications were in clusters and in a linear pattern. Stereotactic biopsy last week. Results yesterday of ADH. Doctor from hospital said they are very concerned about what may be behind the area they biopsied. I have an appointment with breast surgeon next week. Hospital doc said to plan on surgery to remove more tissue for testing. I know this is going to sound weird, but my biggest concern is taking time off work. I'm a teacher, and I hate missing.

As some of you know, I was diagnosed with ADH in my left breast in December after a stereotactic biopsy, and it was removed during an excisional biopsy. Started Tamoxifen in March, and next mammo and appointment with breast surgeon is in August. This morning in the shower, I felt a new palpable lump in my right breast. It's at about the 12 o'clock spot, a few inches above the nipple. I have very fibrocystic breasts, so I assume it's a cyst. Do you recommend calling my breast surgeon since it's new and palpable? I hate the thought of more appointments for something that may just be a cyst. What do y'all think?",
