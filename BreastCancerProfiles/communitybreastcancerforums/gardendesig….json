I just used it for a salpingo oophorectomy along w extensive endometriosis removal. I had trouble using pillows yrs ago for a partial hyster and not being able to get comfortable or adjust them myself. I usually sleep nearly flat in bed so being propped up rarely works for me but with this I was able to sleep perfectly and get myself out of bed w/o help. I am short and some orthopedic systems are connected to each other, this is completely adjustable and very versatile. I plan on using this for an upcoming BMX and just reading in bed.",

One thing I did see on the PRMA website was that they DO NOT balance bill, my experience w medical things in FL has taught me that never happens here. That could be a major financial advantage to go to TX. Good Luck!",
