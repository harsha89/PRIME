Feeling good today - making a cake for my cake decorating class on Monday.  This week I have to cover a cake  with fondant and decorate it with sugar flowers that we were taught in class.  Never thought this would be so much fun and rewarding to see the finished product. Off to the kitchen....... I smell cake fresh out of the oven.!",

Sagina -  so understand the no bra thing - I did the same thing you did-  partial mastectomy because I had size Z's.  LOL.   The hard part for me is the PS postponed the right side until after rads are done, and healing has  been completed.  So I am lopsided  badly.  Sports bras work ok - cami's can be a challenge  tho if the elastic is not good in the bra part.  I had my surgery last October so by the time healing is done from the rads (doc said 3- 6 months)   my right side can finally be done to match the left.  So somewhere around September or October this year.   A whole year later!!!!?!!?!?!?!?!?   The RO said I can expect 20% shrinkage in the left breast from  the rads and healing.   So I am starting to understand why my PS wanted to wait.

Had #14/27 today, so far so good.  My breast tissue feels harder and firmer than before.  Hope that heals.  I don't like it.  Other than that my skin is holding up well.  I stuck with Aveeno Baby so far and haven't  needed anything else.  Went to a neurologist yesterday for my neuropathy.   She said it's not too bad and put me on foot gel pads that numb your feet at night that helps with the shooting pains I am still getting.   She said the chemo brain just takes awhile to resolve itself.   She is starting me on PT for the weakness in my legs as I stagger alot and lose my balance still.   Next week is a brain MRI, muscle testing, PT, Rads everyday, and my hubby is being an angel thru it all.   She changed my Celexa to Cymbalta.   I have been able to get some sleep finally with the cough I still deal with - the R/O Rx'd some cough syrup called Hydromet.     He gave it a refill too ( I think he is anticipating the cough to either get worse or stick around for the remainder of rads and beyond) I am in the getting tired easily group here.   I get short of breath sometimes too.  So I feel for you gals that are having trouble! Ducky-  thinking about you - hope today went well. Letlet,  sorry to hear.   We all wish for each other not to have many SE's, and the redness and soreness doesn't sound fun. Lawleigh - grats on the last chemo!!!   You stay right here with us - we can all go through it together like we did with chemo  :) Okay, body is telling me to stop typing..... Hugs to all, Lisa.",

Temp at doc's office 101.7.  (and i felt like crap)  Oral antibiotics of Levaquin for now unless by wednesday it doesn't look better - then hospital trip for me for in hospital iv antibiotics.  Skin where the burns are have finally stopped stinging.   (the cellulitis is pain by itself.)",

Finished rads this past tuesday - but my skin didn't hold up well towards the end - the skin  in my underarm had turned grey (died) and sloughed off so now the underarm is all raw -   thankful that most of it is numb from the surgery still but now I have to slather on Aquaphor all the time which is ruining my shirts. As for the boosts - the doc told me that because my surgery was a lumpectomy and a breast reduction at the same time - the tumor field is no longer in the same area and with the skin and tissue moved around to new areas they have no idea where to do the boosts at. -- Hence no boosts - so if any of us did what i did - lumpectomy with reduction, that may explain why some of us have boosts and some don't.     How is everyone doing with their skin issues?   My RO said the rads take a week or so before the reaction to the skin peaks and then healing can start - so sometime next week the skin will stop getting redder and more burned before it turns the corner - kinda like it gets worse before it gets better. I need a nap!   Hugs to all -  have great weekends. Lisa",

As for the stickiness,  I am putting on so much cream and kenalog and aquaphor I can't tell!   My chest started peeling a little this morning, and itching - doc gave me an Rx for kenalog cream for the itch.   I get to finish next week but he said the itch may remain for a few weeks.",
