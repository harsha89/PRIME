Core needle biopsy with atypia followed with a surgical needle biopsy. Small area with small incision - Clear. Second one was last Wednesday, a surgical needle biopsy because these were linear calcifications close to a blood supply, the Dr. at the breast imaging center didn't want to risk me bleeding badly so she sent me to a surgeon. They have been watching this every six months for a year. These were multiplying in length so it warranted being biopsied. There is a 4 inch incision this time. They were actually present on my 2011 Mammo! The previous mammography center NEVER told me they were present like they did back in 2004! Waiting, waiting, waiting..... Thanks for reading my story!
