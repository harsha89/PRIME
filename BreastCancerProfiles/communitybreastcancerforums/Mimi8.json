After a mastectomy, chemo, reconstructive surgery, thyroid removal (cancer) and Femara for a year.My symptoms were like a stroke too but MRIs ruled them out. Clean spinal tap. I've had four IVIGs and can now walk, but I talk funny. I have what's called downbeat nystagmus so I can't see without special glasses with prisms built in. Before this I had good vision. Is any of this like what you have ? Mimi8",

My PS ordered a Mammaprint without giving me a choice or asking me if I was covered by insurance. We will prob find out the results this week. Two weeks ago I had a UMX with SNB which showed 4 nodes negative, but one node had micro cancer cells in it so I have to get an Axial excision next week to see if any more nodes are positive. The tumor board and two doctor friends plus my MO have agreed this surgery would be a good idea so I'm resigned to it.",
