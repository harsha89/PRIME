Markers went zooming upwards and scans showed some slight growth in the liver tumors. So here I come Halaven! I now it sounds so petty but I have done the hair loss thing before and I hated the wig. For the pat 2.5 years I have been working and living my life with none of my co workers knowing anything I would love to keep it that way but the SE of hair loss makes me think that the jig is up. Any ideas? My hair stylist has suggested getting the wig and then styling my hair around the wig so that it just flows together. I am optimistic for this treatment and I tolerated the SE's of Affinator very well. My workplace thrives on gossip and I am a private person so keeping this private is really important to me. Thanks for listening and I appreciate any advice. I know I am fortunate to be able to continue my life as \"normal\" and I am so grateful for that! Cisco711",

Thankfully they are, which increases med options; the biopsy itself was nerve wracking, I should have asked for a sedative straight away but I waited and then opted once they started; I was so nervous I think that it made me tense and in turn I was emotionally a basket case! Bottom line is that we are fortunate to have a option for our doctors to peek at our insides without major surgery, it's so important to have accurate information so you can get the best treatment match. No doubt this is scary stuff we all deal with every second of everyday but I hope you will have positive news and I will be thinking the best for you! I have a sixteen year old daughter and I just try to gauge how much info she's up for on a day to day plan. Good news is that I am so fortunate to have a great husband, a fantastic daughter, and I have been blessed to have lived the past year without too much change to daily life. Breathe deep, you are not alone, and keep us updated! Many positive thoughts coming your way, Cisco711",

My TMs though are still rising...onc says when tumors are attacked they get angry and cause markers to rise-anyone have this happen to them? She is all about the scans so I don't go back till September! Also, has anyone actually felt the liver doing something? I swear I can feel a pulling and tightening on my right side...onc gave me one of those looks...you know the look! Please celebrate in spirit with me today-I pray all of us get to have some awesome happy news! Cisco711",

I have a follow up appt with my onc next Tuesday to see what the next step will be. I too was devastated to find that the Falsadex was not working and honestly the thought of having to go to chemo really brings me down:even 14 yrs later those memories are fresh in my mind! My doctor ordered the biopsy because the hormonal therapy is not working even though the bone biopsy came back ER+ . The fact that I was able to get 13 years out of my last therapy gives me hope that once my doctor figures out the meds I will again respond to them... I can't think otherwise or I'll have to be on sedatives daily! Bottom line is I still feel good, don't have much pain, and I am blessed to work a job I love,travel with my family, and still live a fairly normal life but I'd be kidding myself that everyday there is a fear it will come crashing down. I'll be thinking positive thoughts that they will come up with the right meds for you, stay optimistic and please keep in touch! Cisco ",
