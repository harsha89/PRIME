The surgeon said the lump is too close to my nipple so nipple sparing isnt an option anyway, thats a big bummer but like several of yall said, it wouldnt be the same anyway. Surgeon also discussed how the tissue doesnt always \"take\" so that sound horrible. They still dont know if my cancer is DCIS or not. The additional staining that was done still didnt rule it out. Oncologist said that will be determined after surgery as djmammo had told me. So hoping its all DCIS and i will be done with this after surgery. Chemo scares the crap out of me.",

Why does it take a radiologist, my OB and a surgeon to all recommend a biopsy before I can schedule it?? Gosh im frustrated! So from the exam she told me that the mass I can feel, the nipple discharge and the calcifications are all unrelated! I find it so hard to believe that the lumps aren\u2019t related when the calcifications are in same spot! I said well when I push this lump, fluid comes out and she just said it\u2019s normal. This is not normal!! I\u2019m so confused. She said the mass feels like fibrocystic disease but she couldn\u2019t say for sure what it is.She is only concerned with the micro calcifications and the pattern of them.

I have an mri scheduled next week so maybe those results will have some impact on my decision. I also haven't met with my plastic surgeon yet so I don't know my options. I will have reconstruction. I'm 32 and have two kids also. They are age 2 and 3. The recovery will be very difficult with them around. My genetic testing results could impact it also. So I have a lot to sell understand. I just hate that I have to wait till after surgery to know if it's invasive or not. I am glad that I have had the opportunity to breastfeed both of my children and im done having more. I also might have to make the decision to have my ovaries removed.",

My report didn\u2019t say highly suspicious but it\u2019s so scary nonetheless. Odds are in our favor due to our age is what I keep telling myself. The report is a high indicator but nothing is certain until the biopsy. Another girl our age on here was pretty much told she had cancer and she just got results with it being benign. Good luck and let us know. Try not to over worry.",

Also depends on type of reconstruction, implants are faster healing and particularly implants over muscle. I\u2019ll be doing implants under which I think 3 weeks is sufficient. IMO. Sorry u have a new job and have to worry about that. Take care of yourself",
