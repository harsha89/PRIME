      "Content": "Nioz24 wrote: Hi, I am a concern 39 yr oldwith a huge hard mass (almost my whole left breast) that started with an acute pain less than two months ago. I had done a Mammogram and Ultrasound. The Needle biopsy says it is not cancer just inflammatory cells. The doctor put me on antibiotics but didn't work out. Yesterday I had a small surgery to drain any infection, there was no infection found, just scar tissue. I haven't had any trauma or surgery before so the scar tissue is unexplainable. I am puzzled the doctor told me. A sample of tissue was sent to the lab for a second biopsy and for bacteria detection. Any comments about what might be happening will be greatly appreciated.

The surgeon most likely will discuss your exams with you and tell you about the procedure he recommends based on your exams. You don\u2019t have to bring anything except yourself. Your surgeon should have all mammogram, ultrasound, biopsy, and other papers need it. Common questions might be ask by his staff like history of cancer, other diseases you have or have had but don\u2019t overwhelm. Those are routine questions, nothing deep. I would try to make the best out of it. Enjoy every moment for what you have and what you can do. \u201cAll things serve for good to those that love The Lord\u201d",

Eat healthy, try to sleep enough, exercise regularly, drink abundant water, inhale deep air, get sunshine and have faith in something bigger than yourself.",
