I'm so anxiety riden over finding that it's hard for me I enjoy anything. I'm so very sorry about your mom. Breast cancer is such a scary thing so many women are affected by it. I've even trying to all my breast specialist all morning and can't get an answer",

It may not be a lymph node but it feels like one. I don't know what it is but it's tender too. I'm trying very hard not to worry. I've looked at anatomy pictures and I don't even know what lymph node it would be if it were one. I have a cracked nipple from the breast pump so it could be a reactive lymph node from that.",

Then she did my entire breast and axillary. Nothing abnormal. The breast specialist said it is a vessel. I have lost a ton of weight and maybe just never noticed it before. I was sceptic all until she put her index finger over it and said she could feel it pulsate and it is elongated bc it is a vessel. I feel kinda silly",
