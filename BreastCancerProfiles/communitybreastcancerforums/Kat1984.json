During my 3rd taxol infusion in early April the cannula popped out of my vein, I experienced pain quickly as my hand was puffing up from the taxol flowing into it. The nurses then literally squeezed as much out as possible and carried on. For 5 months now I've had pain in that hand, the whole top of my hand is still slightly swollen, the skin is numb I've got pain in my knuckles and have issues gripping with that hand. I'm 31 and have never had any joint or knuckle pain previously. Has anyone experienced this? Did it resolve itself?

I was diagnosed at 30 with TNBC and underwent fertility preservation prior to chemo. I too wanted a family and hadn't quite gotten around to it when I was diagnosed. I had 6 weeks between diagnosis and chemo starting, due to the fertility treatment needing to start at the correct time in my cycle. Unfortunately my egg harvest only got 3 eggs which was disappointing but still worth while. My MO said whilst I had an aggressive cancer he thought the fertility treatment was important and 6 weeks wouldn't make a difference. He was right! I went onto have a complete response to the chemo, finishing up in June 2016. I'm now 18 months out of treatment and 15 weeks pregnant with our first baby! I fell pregnant naturally but am happy I did the fertility treatment anyway. I hope this gives you some hope for the future! Best of luck with your treatments. Xx Kat",

I think for me it came down to my oncologist and how he liked to treat the cancer as the other lady had the same MO as me. They hoped the AC would shrink it right down then they'd operate and then do the taxol as insurance. For me that worked, I had a complete response to the AC, so at surgery there was no cancer and the taxol was just in case and microscopic cells were leftover. Because of this I avoided radiation therapy also. I had hoped I wouldn't need the taxol but the MO said the treatment plan always remains the same even with a complete response. I hope that helps!",

I battled with this decision too. In my case my doctors recommended against radiation as I'd had a complete response and NO lymph nodes effected. If I had nodes involved initially they told me radiation was a no brainer. I'm not sure if they helps but I hope you find some people who are in a similar situation. My doctors told me whatever decision I made I had to make peace with it and move forward, I have finally done that now and opted against radiation. Best of luck x",

I noticed it felt softer after a couple of weeks but that was it until after the 2nd AC. After that it was definitely smaller and by the time for the 4th one I could no longer feel it. I know everyone is different though and a lot of people don't notice any chance, that doesn't mean the chemo isn't working though. Best wishes to you",
