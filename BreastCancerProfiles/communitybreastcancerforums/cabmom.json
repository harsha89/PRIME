I'm also still waiting to see what my 2nd MRI will show on my other breast that was written up as \"indeterminable\" in one state and now the doctors here have said that's not an acceptable answer when dealing with cancer....... Any suggestions.......  Dx 6/2/2009, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 0/16 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
