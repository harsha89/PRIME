I have IBC and no family history of cancer. Do you have any freckles or moles on your breast? My one freckle on the side of my breast turned fromn light brown to pink. That and a slight pink color were my only symptoms. As I said, give the Rx the doc gave you a chance. You'l most likely be just fine. If he sends you to a derm doc ask for a biopsy. The derm doc told me I wasn't being patient. Then when my rash (recurrent IBC) wouldn't go away after several weeks, my onco ordered a biopsy, and there it was. Chances aqre you'll be fine, but advocate for yourself if you're not seeing progress within three days to a week. Best of luck to you.",
