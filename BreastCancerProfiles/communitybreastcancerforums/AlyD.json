My Radiation Oncologist suggested Calendula lotion. I could only find Baby Cream. Thought it would be good, but very oily. Not bad. Weird smell. My Dr said my skin looked good. My Acupuncturist had mentioned burn cream and asked her if I could use it during radiation treatment. My left breast is getting a \"radiation tan.\" So far no blistering and my Dr said it looks great. So I use Jergens Ultra Healing every morning after showering and then the burn cream maybe an hour or 2 after treatment. It smelsl like burnt coffee or ??? It goes away after several hours, maybe. I'll give an update after treatment is over.",
