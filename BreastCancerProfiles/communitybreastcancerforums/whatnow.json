I paid for it in health problems.  I worry that the Internet is one reason so many of us suffer from these distracting \"what ifs.\" I too had three tiny nodules discovered in May.  I was referred to a pulmonologist and finally got an appointment in August.  And, while trying to research online so I could understand the appointment (for example, my nodules are not calcified and that is a good thing for breast findings but it's not the optimum for lungs), don't you know I found an image on that darn internet that looked, I swear, exactly like my images, and it turned out to be mets from cancer somewhere else. It actually had three nodules, in the exact same places as mine, two rounded near the pleura and a more triangular shaped larger one, and all similarly sized as mine (I had my films so I looked at them myself and found the spots based on the report that was included). It was quite a bizarre coincidence. I tried not to worry, and I didn't much, but it was still always in the back of my mind.  Honestly, the appointment was silly to have even paid for (other than to set my mind at ease, which was priceless).  He did say we should probably watch for growth (another CT) at some time in the future (6-12 months), but he did nothing else and had zero concerns.  I don't know if he even looked at the copy of the images, possibly just read the report (since he's not a radiologist, after all).  He said, if any random ten people were grabbed off the street and given a scan, five would have nodules and most of those would be nothing to worry about.  Despite my light to moderate cough and severe shortness of breath, he did no other tests (he said we could do function tests, but didn't think they were necessary). Bottom line - it's easy to say but difficult to do - try not to worry until there is actually something to worry about - that's a recipe for causing an illness just from worry. Me?  I'm hanging in until November for another scan with truly zero worries now. Best to ya. Stay true to your course until you're knocked off.",

It works (if they prescribe enough).  If you've had any other MRIs, they're all similar.  Two of my four had \"contrast\" material (one brain plus breast).  It was much like Janett described.  You will take the relaxing medicine before you even start.  Then you will get an IV line started before you lie down. My own machine was a bit \"upright\" (unlike my other MRIs).  I had an \"open\" brain MRI and \"open\" spine (I have a bit of claustrophobia).

But I WANTED to be here.  I CHOSE to do this and I want GOOD results.  One of my brain MRIs, my neurologist gave me GOOD relaxation meds and I couldn't have cared less about any of it. The technicians are not legally allowed to tell you what is on the images. They are radiographers not radiologists (MDs).  But the results CAN get to your doc by the next day, if that's why he/she made the appointment in the first place.  Yes, they will look at both breasts. My MRI found a 2nd tumor in the same breast the day before my surgery.  I'd already decided on a mastectomy, but that would have been very luck for me if I'd decided on only a lumpectomy. Piece of cake. Really.  And then you can treat yourself to a piece of cake afterward if you want!   ",

Easier said than done. When I was in an acting class, we were asked to not think of a pink elephant. As you would imagine, that is the first thing on all our minds.  The only way not to think about something, is to replace it with something else.  Our minds aren't blank. So keeping busy is your best tool. When I had my first \"questionable\" mammogram (which was my very first screening exam, at age 40-41) - I got a snail mail (it was long ago) which said nothing except that I should call to set another appointment to further address the finding.  So I sat all night at home, single mother of a young girl, wondering what it meant.  Then, I had to wait weeks to get in.  I went through another mammo, an ultrasound, etc - and was finally pronounced healthy.  I practically ran from the office, feeling like I'd had a reprieve, not knowing how many times this happens.  Several years later and a finding comes from out of the blue (as they often do), in the other breast instead.  I was asked to wait a few months before re-addressing because my radiologist just wasn't sure (looking back, I now realize my ultrasound tech seemed much more concerned).  But I'd learned my lesson about worrying - it does no help.  And this was still not quite the Internet age that it is now (things have changed so fast!), and I did not go online looking up every possibility.  I do wish I'd been a bit better informed about my treatments (like chemo) - but it's only recently that patients have had access to so much data.  We used to rely solely on our physicians.  So, yes, months later and more mammos, ultrasounds, biopsy, MRI - it can be a long drawn out experience to a firm diagnosis. So try to hang in there, get busy, know that a lot of women (and men) go through this waiting.  The good news is...it's the hardest part of the journey - no matter which path you end up taking.",

I told my 13 year old daughter of course, and coworkers.  I don't know how anyone would manage not to tell everyone, at least eventually, because sooner or later the majority of us will be hairless, going to doctors, having surgery and/or radiation, etc.  We might want to wait until all our options are in front of us before telling bosses, extended family, etc.  But we need support, and they can't help if we don't tell them we need help-that would feel a bit passive-aggressive to me.

One difference is that my doc did not think it was cancer, so it was quite a surprise. So there is probably not much anyone here can say to calm your fears.  It's normal to be afraid of the \"what ifs,\" as my daughter used to call them.  But try not to let them consume you until you have all the facts. Try to have a wonderful, activity-packed Sunday with your hubby. The most important thing right now might be that you not let your mind, as you say \"prepare for the worst.\"  Because, as you know, if you do get the dreaded diagnosis, you have already been given some really good news. It's probably small; it's probably not in the lymph nodes. And this forum is jam-packed with women who were diagnosed in that same situation and cancer ended up just being a bump in the road of our journey.  OK, a teeth-jarring bump, but manageable. So many of us expect the worst outcome when we hear the \"C\" word - but know that it's a very well-researched, treatable disease.  We live in a time when we're lucky that it's often discovered early, and that many types are, as my oncologist put it, for all intents and purposes - \"curable.\" I'm glad you came here.  When I recently poured out my soul to a sister about a problem I'm struggling with, she said that telling someone else cuts your own pain in half.  I don't know if that applies to this, but it's still good to \"get it off your chest\" as you said (see, you're still subconsciously making puns!). All the best to you as you wait out the results, and then a plethora of hugs if those results are not what you'd hoped for.",

That was when I was younger (though sill age 46 ish at diagnosis).  Making the story short-I no longer have dense breasts, just due to aging and the resultant hormonal changes. However, what I have noticed over these past 15 years of mammograms is that every doctor, technician, piece of equipment, medical practice - is different from the next.  I had one I loved. They did nothing besides diagnoses and biopsies.  I loved my doctor there, and my ultrasound tech.  I even had a woman there who did painless diagnostic mammograms-true story!  But, like so many health practices these days-they closed down.  I can't even blame Obamacare-it was before that started.  Over the years I've been pin-balled around to different places as one closed and then another and another as insurance practices changed.  My very first screening mammogram involved a suspicious finding, so I got ultrasounds with each consecutive visit, and I always got to see the doctor for her interpretation. Just when insurance no longer let me see the doctor unless there was a problem, sure enough, I got cancer so I saw her anyway.  After cancer, I always got ultrasounds because that is how my cancer was found (not through mammogram).  Then, because an MRI before surgery found a 2nd tumor, I was told o get MRIs every year (I only did one then stopped, it seemed excessive). My facility actually did mammograms of my mastectomy site, pulled the tiny bit of tissue left (no reconstruction) into the machine.  At some point, when I changed facilities, they no longer checked the mastectomy side at all. Then, with my newest facility, I was bum rushed through the appointment and sent on my merry way with no doctor, no ultrasound, no explanation (even though my prior appointment was borderline on whether we would biopsy a particular spot on my remaining breast, and I got to talk to that doctor about it to help me decide).  So, while my cancer was discovered by an ultrasound tech, and my doctor argued it with her before asking me to wait a few months and biopsy later--know that a radiologist is an MD, and an ultrasound tech is not.  For me, I'm going to be looking for a different facility next year because, although I'm not one to worry much when they tell me I'm fine--I still just didn't feel right about this last place I was sent to.  I'm dreading having my entire file transferred.  So find a place where you feel comfortable and know they're doing all that you want done, and try to feel good about their work.  It's not a perfect science, but we've come a long way (even in the past few years alone).  We're lucky that we live in a time with these diagnostic measures...but they can go too far.  Best to ya!!",

But I don't think it's unusual to refer someone to see a plastic surgeon to have a talk, before deciding on a double mastectomy.

But, ironically, my daughter had decided to captain a team of 24-hour walkers for an American Cancer Association before I was diagnosed, and it took place when I was about two weeks out from my mastectomy. I chose not to wear a \"survivor\" colored T-shirt, because I don't like attention, but I came, set up camp, donated, walked in the middle of the night when the kids were all sleeping, donated.  As I was walking the track (it was at her Jr. High School), I was reading the luminaries placed all along the path (when one donated, a candle was placed in a bag and one could write the name of a lost loved one or survivor.  I read my name, twice.  I didn't know until later that some parents of the other kids had put my name on it.  I didn't even know they knew I had cancer!  When I lost a co-worker and friend only a few years after she was diagnosed, but I was spared, I wondered why. I didn't know why she wasn't taking any \"pills\" after her surgery (she got a lumpectomy and radiation), when I was going to take them for 5 years.  Since then, after it went to her brain and killed her, I found out she probably had er-/pr- cancer, and the treatment options aren't often as successful as anti-hormonal treatments for us er+/pr+ gals.  My oncologist said - there is just not as much research on that type yet.  I don't like it when people put up Christmas lights at this time of year either, and when they don't take them down until March.  But, while Pink-Tober might seem like overkill--we have a long way to go in researching, preventing, and treating this beast (as well as many others). I think it's so huge because nearly everyone has been affected by it (themselves, a loved one, a relative).  So I embrace those who want to climb on board and help fund treatments and cures.  So I say bring it on.  I don't do much myself.  I donate every time I can.  I buy things that are pink if I happen to need them anyway, knowing I'm paying a bit extra so it can be donated.  Of course a large chunk goes to operating the organizations who run the program; that's always true in varying degrees. If one has worked in any non-profit capacity it's evident.  It's true when one buys a $1000 a plate fundraiser dinner for a candidate, it's true when we buy girl scout cookies. I know the Susan B Komen organization was hit with a bad leader and has been trying to come back from that.  There will always be good and bad charities within any fight. I even donated healthy breast tissue from my remaining breast for a large research tissue bank in my area.  And I wear a little pink ribbon lapel pin every October.  From the 1st to the 31st.  Every year without question. And I'm thankful for those who participated in the \"rah-rah\" of Pinktober because it probably saved my life. I see no reason to be angry about it.  ",

I had a collection of scarves that I tied different ways. Today, a woman could go bald and some would think it was just a fashion statement.  Not many do it, but I'd think about it if I ever had to face that challenge again.  I didn't think that being bald would bother me much. But, when I was at the \"pulling out handfuls\" of hair (and I had LONG hair), I went on my lunch hour and had it shaved (I'd developed two bald spots that morning anyway).  I had to turn away and not watch it happen.  I'd brought in a hat to be ready, asked them to turn my chair away from the mirror (afraid I'd peek, I guess), slipped on my hat and did not look until I was home alone that evening. I ended up writing a non-fiction report on how important our hair can be when I went back to school last year. Oddly, I moved my bandages and peeked just as soon as I woke up from my mastectomy, and didn't really feel as bad as I did about my hair. Those feelings certainly changed later, since the hair is temporary but the missing breast wasn't.  But, today, I have long thick locks again (at age 55!).  And, if encouraged a bit with \"curl\" products  - I still have some of the curl I had when it first grew back in (I had a bit of body or wave beforehand, but was never curly). I once saw a bald woman with a scarf on in the grocery store. She was in pretty rough looking shape as far as her health. So I said, quietly \"I used to have that hairstyle.\"  I'm also so glib about everything, but I forget not everyone is like me. At first she didn't understand and her eyes flashed in anger as she was about to say \"I have cancer!\"  But then I saw the understanding come over her and she seemed to nearly weep that someone (who had regrown a mane of long, thick, shiny hair) understood what she was going through. Best to you.  YOU are not your hair.",

You're obviously concerned, so you should definitely have it checked.  Because you're young, start with your GP/PGP perhaps? An urgent care doc is not really the best option for a condition that sticks with you (in my opinion).  We can't know if there is a \"cause for concern,\" but I think you've already answered your own question just by asking here.  You should go to your primary care doctor and explain the history.

We cannot change how others respond, we can only adjust ourselves.  I was once at a party, only a couple weeks after my mastectomy.  A woman who know I'd had the procedure came up to hug me.  I crossed my right arm across my chest (to protect it, kind of like how guys who are shaking hands sometimes hug, dunno if I'm explaining that well), and hugged her with the other arm and said \"oooh, just gentle, OK.\" She pulled me in HARD and said \"Oh my gosh, this doesn't hurt!\"   In other word, I was being a real baby, in her mind. I didn't bother me much, but did stick with me.

With surgery-I missed only one of my daughter's events (a band concert).  Chemo was harder because I have a VERY weak stomach. I could eat only a few things, and my daughter was no help (yes, I know, she SHOULD have been by that age but I hadn't taught her any cooking-I asked if she could just make me some rice once and it was inedible-not done-heehee). But now, it's 8 years later an my daughter just graduated college and, guess what, I did too!  (OK, I actually have about 2 assignments left this summer).  So I wish I could be there to give you a hug. I'm sure your Mom will do everything she can.  Hopefully social workers can help you answer any other concerns you might have. So you'll get through it as you have so far with that wonderful baby--one day at a time.   Hugs and best to you.",

Recently, I was not really very happy with the place I was sent to, so I requested my records so I could go to a place of my choosing next year.  They sent me EVERYTHING.  I was amazed.  I'd never seen anything like this. From my very first exam 15 years ago, where I was called back for something suspicious that turned out to be nothing, through my actual cancer diagnosis later (in the other breast, by the way), all the way up to my most recent report.  Of interest, this particular facility did not include my mammograms from this recent visit - hmmmm. ?  Anyway, as you can imagine, I poured over the reports and films, and learned a lot of things I hadn't known before.  Things no one ever told me. When I was diagnosed, I knew nothing like everyone on here seems to know.  I knew my tumor size, stage, grade, and that I was ER+, PR+.  But one of the things I heard everyone talking about online was BIRADS.  I'd never heard of it, and thought it was new. Turns out, it's all over my chart but has never been mentioned.  What I'm getting to is that, I seem to have something different and slightly suspicious every time I go in for an exam, but we keep an eye on it and it never amounts to anything terribly concerning. In 2011, we began to \"watch\" something.  My doc at the time blew it off, but said \"now, I don't know you very well yet.  If you're the type who wants to, we can go ahead and biopsy, but if not, then we'll just give it some time.\"  I am NOT the type who likes to worry where I don't have to, or be too invasive if my doc doesn't push it.  I figure they'll tell me when they think I've nudged over the border into a situation where I need a biopsy.  I looked back at that report and it was BIRADS 3.  So I looked that up and it says 'PROBABLY BENIGN FINDING.\" As a matter of fact, the report says she asked for a short interval exam the next time, but she didn't tell me (or I guess the schedulers) because I didn't go for another year. So I wish you all the best.  I'm glad you're taking care of your health. But MANY MANY biopsies are benign (I hate to quote so I won't, but I'm pretty certain it is the very large majority).  That is not to belittle your concern. I hate when people say things like \"Oh, I'm sure you're just fine,\" because we aren't all \"just fine.\"  But try not to let the worry overtake you.  Keep busy, and soon I hope you'll be looking in the rearview mirror at this situation.",

So, if there is a \"finding\" (still doesn't mean it's cancer), the radiologist might see you to explain what she wants to continue to watch, or what she thinks it is, or what she would want to do. Otherwise, you might be sent on your merry way, skipping off to treat yourself to lunch (here's hopin'!). While there are exceptions to every rule, please comfort yourself knowing that breast cancer at your age is less a very slim possibility.  I believe I've heard that it is less than 1%. I am thrilled that awareness campaigns mean we're all very vigilant in watching for signs of change in our breasts, but I do sometimes worry that we've been pushed toward the edge of a cliff just a bit, and we're \"over-worrying.\"  Saying that you want them to \"let [you] get a biopsy\" should not be the goal, necessarily.  Definitely stick up for your own medical needs, but they are professionals whose job it is to seek out cancer.  If they do not find any, I hope you can be comforted and believe them enough to at least wait a bit before jumping into an unnecessarily invasive procedure. That said, I'm glad you're seeking a diagnosis, no one should completely ignore symptoms like yours.  But try not to worry if you can help it, until there is a reason to worry.  Your symptoms could mean a variety of things.  I wish you all the best. ",

I don't know the answer to your question - but, since you're a lot more aware than I was - if you want it, surely they cannot refuse it. Oh, wait, they're \"MDs,\" so they can do anything they want. A discussion is in order, then perhaps a second opinion if your doc won't do it, or allow you to at least understand why s/he feels it isn't necessary. Can the RO order it??",

It was a different, annoying pain.  I was working, but \"self-medicating\" (cocktails every night so I could sleep) - NOT a good answer. I am also very slow to heal (I had a root canal 3 months ago and I'm still in some pain). I think, all we really want is to know that we WILL get better.  We can deal with the pain, as long as we know we're on the right track. If that's how you're feeling - then know that I realized I was MUCH better with a legitimate prosthesis than a soft one.  The soft one is not heavy, of course. But it moves and rubs and - blech!  But the real one sits tight and feels SO much more real.  I second the opinion of whoever said to massage it. I know it's counter-intuitive (\"don't touch it , it hurts!\").  Because I could not even allow myself to brush my fingers across it, but I noticed I could allow a doc to examine it without any problem. The first time I had to permit that I was petrified.  Afterward, I thought...hmmm...that wasn't bad a all. So I forced myself to touch it more, from the edges, softly over all of it, etc.  It took a long time, (more than months...I'd say years) and I will have the numbness forever, but the pain is gone.  But, then, we all experience different things.  No one can know what you feel, and if you need pain relief then you just do. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2014 02:38PM - edited Jul 12, 2014 09:46AM by whatnow \"If it was cancer you would know\" is indeed an unprofessional and highly questionable comment for an MD.  Many, many of us has zero symptoms and no clue when we were diagnosed with breast cancer (me included).  Yes, the waiting is hard--many say it is the hardest part (me included). I will never understand the reasoning behind not telling patients over the phone if they have a positive (malignant) biopsy. It's \"old school\" and does not change the outcome.  There will be many questions, of course, and perhaps they don't want the patient to be alone, or spiral. But we could hear it in a comfortable setting, and do research so we'd know what to ask, and not be in so much shock if they would all tell us as soon as they knew.  My own doctor did. She called me first thing Monday morning and didn't bother with that silly \"we need to make an appointment\" nonsense.  It's a power/control thing and I don't understand it. Instead, she said \"it's a cancer,\" AND told me what I needed to do next.  However, know that most of us did have our share of waiting as well.  It's a science, but nothing is exact.  They don't want to say \"yes or no\" until they feel they KNOW, either way. My very first mammogram had a questionable finding. Even though that was only 15 years ago--it was so different than things are today (of course, every diagnosis, doctor, office, lab - - all do things differently).  I left the screening mammogram and thought all was over.  I got a LETTER (snail mail) that gave vague info, and said to call back for additional tests.  So it was already weeks later.  Then I had to wait until office hours to call, weeks for an appt., I had a diagnostic mammo, then ultrasound, then another ultrasound.  Each time there were days/weeks between.  And when I did finally get a cancer diagnosis (in the other breast!), my doc asked me to come back in a few months, and even then only reluctantly scheduled a biopsy.  I waited a long time too. It's tough-we totally understand. But I think it's GOOD that it's a long wait.  That means it's not a cut and dried \"yes.\" Try to hang in there (though it's hard to hear that). I wish you the best.

This is probably because I always got an appointment with her during my mammogram/ultrasounds (that is not being offered by my current office, due to insurance, even if there is a finding!) - and because she did the biopsy.

You can ALWAYS vent here.  But it will also help you to realize there is no great rush for these processes. As I mentioned above, I was not sent to a surgeon until after my biopsy, but I think some people have a WLE type biopsy and I THINK that's done by a surgeon.  I really can't comment on all that because I was dx nearly 10 years ago and things have already changed. I was lucky to have a really good experience with my initial diagnosis and radiologist/biopsy, but I do not have that with most doctors. Everyone is losing money today and the patient seems to get squeezed more and more.  I've been treated with such disdain by the office staff of so many doctors I don't even want to go anymore.  They don't stop to realize that will make their financial situation even worse. But, back to your annoyance.  I was pretty ignorant when I was dx.  And ignorance CAN sometimes be bliss.  The Internet has provided a lot of info, but steered a lot of us without MDs in the wrong direction too (another reason doctors' offices all seem so touchy lately - we're questioning them and they don't like that). But it is certainly easier just to sit back and follow doctor's orders without realizing others have taken different paths.  While I don't counsel you to do that, I do hope you can find some peace by understanding that it's not an exact science, there are plenty of false positives, and you're getting there.  It may be slower than you want, but it's not completely necessary to understand everything on your reports. It's easy to make ourselves a bit crazy by looking too closely. I have some lung nodules we're watching to see if they grow.  I got online and immediately saw 40% of nodules are cancer. It took a bit before I realized that was a completely bogus number, and I have almost zero reason for worry.  If I'd just waited for my pulmonologist appointment (but 3 months is a long time to wait without any research), I'd have instead heard him say that about 50% of every person has nodules.  So hang in there, you'll get your answer.  I hate that your time has been wasted, and I know you're anxious.  Best to ya!",

Read about how different posters feel after having mastectomies, reconstruction, chemo.  Then listen to your docs' suggestions, and research more, and go with your own gut.  But, even with reconstruction, for example, there are different types. And, I had chemo even after a modified radical mastectomy.  I was able to avoid radiation by having a mastectomy, but not chemo. There is just so much to know.  FYI, I worked through my treatment and surgery with a few days off each time, and, at age 55, I'm finally completing my undergrad work (not postponed due to the cancer-I'm just saying that your education WILL continue).  I am an English major and I did write a paper that included how we identify with our hair more than we realize.  I was happy to have the cancer cut out, yet the mastectomy proved hard on me. But I wasn't worried about my hair (it will grow back, duh), but it was more traumatic than I thought. Depending on your treatment, you may not feel up to doing what you could do before.  Everyone reacts differently to each step in the process. After my mastectomy I didn't even take any pain killers and was at work three days after.  BUT, a double mastectomy is very different. We can get by without full use of one arm. Both at the same time?  Different.  As for chemo-fatigue can be an issue.  Nausea, confusion. My own problem was extreme nausea.  Even a few days later when I returned to work (I had no choice)...I sat with a wastebasket at the ready (but I never threw up after the first 3-4 days). That's extreme-most don't react that way. The anti-nausea meds didn't work.  I'm the type that throws up after EVERY surgery, with many meds (antibiotics, codeine, Demerol, any medicine that puts me out, etc. I even threw up when I had a doctor tell me I had to start eating meat again-blech!). I ended up quitting chemo, and found out that not all oncs would have made me do it anyway, and then had another onc who said the 5 years I spent on adjuvant therapy was much more important than the chemo.  So...? So, take the time you need to learn, digest, decide, change your mind, learn more. And never second guess whatever decision you make, because we cannot know the future.  You and your team will factor in SO many things (grade, stage, oncotype, size, age, health, hormone receptors, etc etc) before deciding.    For now, try to take someone with you to appointments (if you have one, I didn't) who can listen and write things down.  There is SO much to absorb. And don't be in a hurry (I was; I was worried because I felt there was no telling when that first little cell would want to go exploring all over my body with all its crazy friends like it was Spring Break). And come back here because no one \"out there\" understands like those who have been through it. Best to ya.",
