It certainly seems as though your family has had many unfortunate experiences with cancer. Obviously, there is a genetic pattern present relating to cancer in your family. You are incredibly brave to have had the mastectomy, it is a very powerful decision to make for yourself and your future mental and physical health. My mother had expanders in her chest after her mastectomy and I remember the discomfort she felt when having them filled. I hope that March 24th passes without incident for you, and you can continue healing. At the time of making your decision to have the mastectomy did you have an idea of timelines for healing? Did you consider any other options before mastectomy? How long have you been doing screening?",

Scholarly journal articles and discussion board responses from women who have been classified as high risk for breast cancer but have tested BRCA negative are my nightly reads. Living in Ontario, I am a patient of a high risk breast cancer clinic at a hospital in Toronto (and will have been for a year in July). Up until the death of my father three years ago from cancer, I never gave the cancer trend in my family a second thought. I still didn't until a year ago when I finally heeded my sister's advice and went to see a genetic counsellor. On their advice, I was enrolled as a patient in their high-risk breast cancer clinic. My sister and I sought out genetic testing at the MedCan clinic in Toronto this past August and both tested negative for BRCA 1 & 2, but positive for another mutation related to colon cancer, and had a VUS on another mutation. On my paternal side I have a father who is deceased from cancer at age 65, his mother (my grandmother) having a partial mastectomy and lymph node removal at age 53, and death from stomach cancer at age 70, an aunt (his sister) with breast cancer at age 68, his grandmother with breast cancer at age 43, along with his uncle and grandfather with colon cancer deaths at age 55, and 70. My mother has also had a full mastectomy at age 50. In the report or summary of results that I received from my genetic counsellor one of the topics discussed was the suspicion of a family cancer syndrome on my paternal side. Recommendations that were suggested as an option included a preventative prophylactic mastectomy. I am looking to see if anyone has taken this path and I am wondering about your experience in the Canadian medical system? I have a meeting with a plastic surgeon in March and from there hopefully a referral to a general surgeon. As well as a meeting with the oncology doc at my high-risk clinic in April (although I really don't get the impression that they want to talk to me about a preventative mastectomy at all). Any insight you could offer would very much be appreciated. Thanks for your time",
