It swells at times and breast has pain like a stabbing sharp pain, sometimes heavy, the nipple also had the same pain. I just had a mammogram and ultrasound and they could not see anything. The Dr said its there and we got to find it what it is so he is doing a biopsy next week. What could this be wouldn't a cyst or infection show up? Atte these signs of cancer I heard cancer does not hurt. Worried to death! Log in to post a reply",
