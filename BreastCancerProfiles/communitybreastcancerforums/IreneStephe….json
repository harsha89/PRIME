My breast is tender to the touch and my nipple hurts and is sensitive. I had an indometral eblation done about 3 to 4 months ago and so I don't have periods. My breast has been hurting for quite some time now but was extremely painful last night so I checked it and felt the lump and it felt like I was getting stabbed in the breast. Any suggestions?",
