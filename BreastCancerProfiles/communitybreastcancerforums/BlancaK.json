I have some concerns and was looking to see if anyone has had any similar results or circumstance. I went to my GYN on June 11 and she prescribed a mammogram. I went for the mammogram on June 18th and the results came back as a BI-RADS Category 0: Incomplete: need additional imaging evaluation. The findings were multiple round masses of varying size in the upper outer quadrant of both breasts at a middle to posterior depth. The report was done the same day as the mammogram and I received a call the following day. I am scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound in the morning and my doctor feels that I might need to have some of the masses biopsied but won't know until after the tests tomorrow. Has anyone had this come up? and if so, what are the chances I might have something suspicious in both breasts? I am 44 years old and was planning to have a baby this year so this is a real curveball on our lives. Thank you everyone! Blanca Log in to post a reply",
