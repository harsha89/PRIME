      "Content": "remgirl wrote: I am having a port problem and hope that someone here might be able to help me. My port was implanted in my upper right chest below the collar bone in August 2006 in anticipation of chemo.  A breast surgeon told me today that he thinks that the skin over my port, which is purple in color, is so thin that the metal of the port will poke through in less than a year.  Consequently, he believes that the port will have to be removed soon.   I have bilateral breast cancer and have had full axillary dissections in both arms; the breast surgeon removed and examined 21 lymph nodes in the left armpit and 28 lymph nodes in the right armpit.  I also had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction in 2007.  I also had radiation of the right breast, chest wall (which included the port), and right arm pit.  The port is still used:  it allows the oncology nurses to draw blood every 6 weeks for pro time tests (I am on coumadin due to a tendency to form blood clots) and to test my blood every three to four months for glucose levels (I am a diabetic).  The port is also used to inject dye into my veins for bone scans that are performed once a year and CT lung and abdominal scans that are performed every six months.  I do not want needle sticks or injections in either arm for fear of developing lymphedema.   Do you know of any other women who have had this dilemma?  Would you recommend that I have another port implanted on the other side of my chest ?  What type of doctor should I see for a second opinion?  Log in to post a reply",
