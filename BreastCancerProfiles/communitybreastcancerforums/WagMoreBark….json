My surgery was July 24. I was supposed to have LMX on my right side with DIEP flap reconstruction, but the day before, my surgeon changed it to latissimus flap due to high blood platelets (which I still need to investigate). Luckily, so far so good. My pain is controlled via Extra Strength Tylenol. My margins and nodes were clear (praise the Lord!), and I was staged as a 1A due to size (4.6 cm). I'm waiting on Oncotype results to determine next steps regarding treatment. I've had an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends, coworkers, even people I haven't seen in 20 years! My mom is here helping and my employer is paying me while I'm recuperating. I should be over the moon. But...I feel numb inside. I feel alone and lost. Not depressed, because thank god I take Lexapro (which is a miracle drug for me!). But i just feel...sad. Like i just want to hide upstairs in my room and get lost in books, movies, etc. I suppose this is normal, but I'd love to hear your experiences. What is your emotional state right now and how do you care for your sweet selves?",

I had a LMX on my right side on July 24, with latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction (very impressed so far with the results!). My question; What exercises am I supposed to be doing? I was told to do the crawl up the wall with my fingertips, but nothing else (I'll be referred to a breast cancer PT in another week or two). I still have my drain in but want to make sure I stay as limber as possible. What exercises do you all recommend? Also, thank you, all of you, for being out there to offer your support and wisdom. xoxo -Wendy",
