I was very glad to see this thread for 60 and over even though I get valuable info from all the other thread's that I read. I was diagnosed with primary breast cancer, primary lung cancer and primary kidney cancer all at the same time in Oct-Nov of 2010. Was quite a shock to say the least. I went thru months of testing, scans, xray's, lab work, biopsies, and doctor visits. From Oct- to the end of Nov, 2010 I averaged 3 to 4 visits per week with testing and Doctor visits. There were so many Doctors as there were 3 primaries. These discoveries were caught because I first had found a lump in my breast. I went thru lung surgery first, 3 weeks later breast and lymph nodes removed, 3 weeks later 4 cycles of chemo, one month break and then partial kidney removal surgery. Started on hormonal therapy in April, 2011. I felt a small lump on my sternum in Jan. 2013 and it was biopsied and it was the breast cancer recurrence. Pet scan showed one small spot behind the breast bone probably a lymph node, as the biopsied lump was concluded to be a lymph node like mass. Now considered stage 4. I was then given Faslodex starting in March, 2013. I have received CT scans every 2-3 months since. The last one I just had done in Feb. 2015 now show that the small spot ( lymph node) has shrunk and is calcified and my MO says I am now NED. I am so grateful for each and every day since my first diagnoses. I do have side effects with pain and lots of fatigue but find encouragement thru these threads. Do any of you have adult children who were there for you when you were first diagnosed and then as your treatment wore on they were not quite as supportive now? I do not want to appear ungrateful as I am so very lucky to be alive after everything I have been thru and I do wonder how the younger Mothers can cope and deal with all the issues with MBC, working full time and raising their young children.",
