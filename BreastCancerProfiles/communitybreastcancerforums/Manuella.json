      "Content": "Manuella wrote: Hey everyone, I have very mild swelling in my inner forearm and trunk (back and sides, no breast). I have a sleeve, glove, night sleeve, underarmour shirt and getting a LE bra for flying. I wear my sleeve/glove for traveling (which I do a lot), for exercising and whenever my arm feels funny. I had managed to keep swelling at bay for over a year this way, but have very light pitting now in inner forearm (it indents after 10-15 secs of pressing and stays that way for maybe 45 secs?). Anywho, I told my LE therapist (I see one at MSK) that I hate wearing both glove and sleeve in summerand she suggested I try with just the sleeve since I don\u2019t have hand swelling but that scares me! Wondering if some (a lot?) of you go around with just a sleeve on regular days and wear both sleeve and glove mostly when traveling/excercising? I\u2019m afraid my hand will swell and that the LE will \u201cspread\u201d there. Thoughts? Log in to post a reply",

It started falling after the fourth session and stopped a month after my last infusion. I never needed a wig but did use Toppik in the front which is where I experienced the biggest loss. That, constipation and weight gain (10 pounds!) were my biggest SEs. Hair is growing back nicely (I\u2019m 9 months PFC), I have a bit of a mullet situation going on at the moment lol",
