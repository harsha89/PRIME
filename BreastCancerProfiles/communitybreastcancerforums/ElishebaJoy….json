Not sure if chemo is in the picture yet since haven't heard results of Oncotype testing (guess I will find this out at appointments). Will have to have around 33 treatments of radiation, and I have a couple of questions for those of you who have gone through this. I wonder about the side effects mostly. I have heard about the tenderness at site and am not as concerned about this as I am about fatigue. Is the fatigue overwhelming, and if so, at what point did it hit? I have my own cleaning business and have had to rely on family for help while recovering from surgery, and am hoping I won't have to rely on them due to fatigue from rads. I am almost considering checking into proton therapy since there is a facility where I live, but not sure that would produce lesser side effects or not. Any info is appreciated! Thanks.",

Therefore I have to have more treatments, at least that is how I understood it. I was told to not use deodorants that contain aluminum because it could react to the treatments. Tom of Maines isn't supposed to contain aluminum. My doctor also said that people of European descent (thus possibly lighter hair and skin) usually have more problems with skin. Interestingly, he also said that when he sees patients that have no redness or irritation, he finds out that they usually have some Native American ancestry. My aunt had 33 rounds 4 years ago and she didn't have the least bit of redness or irritation (she is full Dutch). She said she used Dove soap to wash, and applied 100% aloe vera gel 3 times a day during treatments. I have an aloe vera plant that I plan to use with my radiologist's approval. I guess the mystery of who will have problems and who won't is as questionable as BC itself! Good luck!",

I had been having chest pains for two days prior and then woke up with the room spinning, nausea and hot/cold feeling. I tried to ignore it, but when it hit again a few minutes later, I was afraid I was having a heart attack and that panicked me even more! Convinced DH that I was dying so he drove me to ER. EKG and blood work were negative for heart issues, so they diagnosed vertigo and shot me up with Ativan and started me on meclizine (for vertigo). I still think it was a genuine panic attack, but who knows? The meclizine makes me tired and since I haven't had any more dizzy spells, I stopped taking it. I told my RO about the ER visit and he thought I might be getting a virus, so he recommended rest and liquids. It's hard to know what might be rads symptoms or just plain anxiety and the meds for it.

If I had known that that would have happened, I would have started applying aloe vera to that area on the first day. Maybe it would have helped, maybe not.

It was more psychologically stressful than physically. Techs had to tell me to not tense my body and to relax (ha) so I closed my eyes and imagined myself walking in a beautiful field at my relative's farm with the sun warming me (the room was cold so I added in the warm sun!). The imagery helped me relax a little bit. Day 2 of treatment, a water line had busted near the hospital which kept the machine from working, so I had to come back for treatment in the afternoon as well as retake 2 x-rays that didn't send the day before. Day 3 (today) was uneventful and went well. Probably the worse part is having to deal with the 8:00 a.m. rush hour traffic. Thanks for checking on me!",

My RO thought this was a good idea when I told him and my aunt did this when she was diagnosed 4 years ago and she never had any skin irritation after 33 treatments. I also take an aloe supplement once a day (again, my aunt did this). I had #14 of 33 today, and so far, no skin pinkness or irritation although I think today I detected the treated breast looking more tanned than the other. RO seems to think I will get some redness around Thanksgiving week (hoping to prove him wrong!). I figure it can't hurt to attempt prevention anyway! Good luck.",

She is in need of prayer and comfort that only God can provide, so I am hoping that some of you ladies would consider saying a prayer for her. She wants as many prayers as she can get! Thank you.",

My rads breast is not pink or red, but is kinda tan, but with the last couple of treatments, I noticed more and more small (not raised) dark spots. Today was #23 of 33 treatments. I am just curious if this is normal and if it might be permanent.",
