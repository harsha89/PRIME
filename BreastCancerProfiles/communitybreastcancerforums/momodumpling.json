Last night I found a very small indent on my right breast on the lower outside part near where my boob touches my arms when my arms are by my side. I've never seen it before and it suddenly showed up last night 8/5/15.. I'm very very scared and do not know what to do. I'm 25 and have had two breast cancer scares before. I had excess breast tissue removed from my armpits as a preventative measure since my grandmother is a breast cancer survivor. A couple years ago I found a lump in my left breast but the ultrasound came back normal. Last night I found this slight indent in my right breast. I had no idea what to think of it but then remembered that I once saw a chart that described different ways breast cancer can present itself. When I showed it to my husband he could barely see it but when I pointed it out it became obvious. I woke my mother up and showed her and she saw it quickly. I would have gone straight to the doctor today but I do not have insurance. If I enroll now I will not be able to see a healthcare provider for another 3 weeks. I'm very scared and everyone is telling me not to worry. My mother thinks that its my new workout regimen that is causing my breast fat to diminish leaving a small indent. She also says that breasts change shapes and may look a little funny if a woman gains or loses weight. I haven't lost anything and I only started working out 3 days ago but the regimen is rigorous and includes chest and arm weight reps. I am very over weight and medically considered morbidly obese. I've read about cellulite presenting itself in breasts but I'm just very concerned because I've never seen it before and my left breast doesn't look the same. Its not very notable but I can see it for sure and is about 1-1 1/2 inches long. It's more angular than circular. It looks like an indent not a dimple. I've never had a child and I do not have any scares on my breasts per say but I do have some on my armpits. Also, I think I should mention that the indent does not looks as drastic as it did last night. I do have some tenderness but nothing alarming.Can anyone help me understand what's going on and what I should do? I'm so scared. Log in to post a reply",
