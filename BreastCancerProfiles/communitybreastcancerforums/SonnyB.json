      "Content": "SonnyB wrote: I could use some advice.  I am 6 months into my journey with extensive bone mets in neck, spine, sacrum, hips, femur.....   My bone scan in June showed no progression and my last tumor markers were down to 22! :) I walk 3-4 miles a day for exercise and to keep my dog from driving me crazy.  A few weeks ago my legs (thigh and down) started tingling (feels like when your limb falls asleep then wakes up) after about 15 minutes of walking and lasts for many hours once I stop.  My onc suggested cutting back on the amount I walk.  Went down to 1-2 miles with no difference in the tingling.  This week I decided to try an aquatic class as there would be no impact on my bones in the water.  After class I had to wait 5 minutes before I could walk due to the extensive tingling. So my question is two-fold.  First, has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Second, should I ask for an MRI or another test.  I am confident it is not new mets due to the low markers but maybe an exixting one is pressing on something????  Just not sure. Some background:  when I was first diagnosed and started treatment I experienced a numbness over most of my body.  I could feel a touch to the skin but not a needle poked in (Or the temperature of the shower!).  My onc and radiologist freaked out, ordered lots of MRIs and had me see a neurologist for a whole series of tests. Everything was came back fine.  The numbness went away as I stopped the steroids I was taking for radiation treatment.  I assume the steroids caused the numbness but my onc thinks that it was an emotional reaction to the situation.  This is why I think she is not concerned about the tingling.  Sorry for the long post.  Any input would be helpful!  Extensive bone mets, neck to femur Dx 2/8/2012, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 1/5 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Even though we never were able to get a blood draw out of it I kept it in knowing eventually I would need it for chemo.   Mine was also up to my neck and I agree that there is a definite discomfort with that. I switched to Zometa at the beginning of the year and have actually been using the port for that.  Then a couple of weeks ago the port failed and the Zometa was not getting in the vein and was bulging in my neck.  I had the port out the next week.  I don't know for sure but I felt that btw the neck location and the fact that it was only flushed for so long made it 'break'. I am enjoying having it out and hope it's a long time before I need a new one.  I hope you find peace with whatever decision you make.",

I read it to say that just because the OS does not appear to have an improvement this is not necessarily true for scenarios in that the OS is a longer time period. That there are too many other factors over a longer period of time after the trial drug has failed to effectively understand the impact the trial drug had on it. Additionally Musa Mayer wrote this is particularly problematic for first line trials in hormone-sensitive MBC, because of the confounding effect of all the subsequent treatments. I take away that I am thrilled with the new drug options we are getting that increases the PFS and will not put too much emphasis on the murky OS numbers.",

(On tamoxifen, no chemo) My quilt and question.  I did not tell my new employer about the cancer as I am feeling good and the last PET scan showed regression.  I know telling would have probably reduced my chances of getting the job BUT I feel very quilty.  It is a very small workplace and if I need to miss work it will be tough on them.  Was I right not to tell them?   Extensive bone mets, neck to femur Dx 2/8/2012, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 1/5 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

SPAMgirl, I always tell my onc's office when I need my shots.  In fact I was in last week for my Xgeva and had told them when I scheduled that I also needed the Lupron.  Get tothe appointment and the nurse has a total blank look when I asked where my Lupron shot was.  No clue that it was needed.",

Once you are settled into your treatment and increase your knowledge it will be easier to deal with. When I started Tamoxifen my onc said it could take up to three months to start working and didn't consider scanning before that.  During those three months my markers went from th high 60s to the 20s.  A year later Tamoxifen is still working for me.  I would say with your tumor markers going down you have reason to think positively!",

      "Content": "Dec 9, 2012 08:35PM SonnyB wrote: Thanks for the questions Stormynyte!  They are going to make me think on a Sunday night! 1, If you could have a luncheon with any three people (real or fictitious/from any time period/dead or alive), which three people would you choose and why? I love to read so the first person would need to be an author.  I think I would choose Ken Follet as his books can contain suspense, history and/or relationship issues and he just writes well.  The next would be Benjamin Franklin.  He was such a integral part of the beginning of our nation as well as an inventor - it would be fascinating to talk to him.  Finally I would invite my grandfather (mom's dad).  I never met him but from the stories I heard growing up he had a very interesting life, living in India in the early 1900s, running his own quarry in Germany then being put in jail by the Nazis due to his religion. That would be a very interesting luncheon indeed. 2. If given complete freedom to start afresh, what profession would you choose and why? I have often thought I would like to be an architect.  I love seeing how homes are laid out and am always thinking of how the design could have been done better.  I used to go to open houses for fun just to see the floor plan.  However, way back (I'm 52) when I was figuring out what to study I only knew about more traditional paths.  I got a degree in economics and went to work for IBM until I had my kids. 3. What did you do growing up that got you into trouble? I was fortunate to have easy going parents and an older brother who did get into trouble.  That meant whatever I did wasn't anything toublesome comparatively.  However I was a nuisance to my three brothers which resulted in being black and blue for many years as I could not hold my own in a fight!   Looking back, I guess I was busy playing basketballl, riding horses and reading (the only one I still do) that I didn't have time to get into too much trouble. 4. If you could throw any kind of party, what would it be like and what would it be for? Well what I would really like is to throw a 75th birthday party for myself! :)  As that's not going to happen I would love to have a New Years party with all my friends from over the years.  I have moved alot (the longest I have stayed in a house is 6 yrs) and have friends all over the place.  As I am not good at writing (even emails) or calling I don't stay as in touch as I should.  However whenever I do see an old friend it's like no time has passed hence the need for a party that they could all come to. 5. If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do while there? My goal in life has always been to see as much of the world as possible.  I have been very fortunate to have lived in Paris for 4 years in my teens and having traveled to Europe several times since then (including an amazing summer doing the Eurorail/hostel travel).  We also lived in Mexico about 10 years ago which was a great opportunity for my kids.   The one place I really want to visit but haven't is New Zealand and while I'm there might as well go to Australia.  I love to see the natural beauty of spots I visit and get a feel for the local atmosphere.   My dh and I had been saving and planning to do a lot of traveling upon retirement.  It's frustrating because I know I probably won't make it to retirement age and in the meantime my dh can't take that much time off to do big trips. Bonus question!",

My onc feels that biopsies are only needed when there is progression, that since original mets presented as same time as breast tumor they will be the same.   ",

During the 6 weeks that we thought I was stage 2 with no lymph node involvement was radiation only.  When a node was positive the plan changed to chemo.  I guess that was fortunate because it was my onc on the first appt who felt I needed a PET scan.

I choose to start with hormonals - Tamoxifen (w/Lupron to shut down my ovaries). The tamoxifen gradually stopped all of the cancer in my bones and worked for 3 1/2 years. Just this fall a bone scan showed 2 new small spots so I have switched to Letrozole. I know that I will eventually go through the chemo options but for almost four years now the homonals have kept the cancer at bay with NO side effects.
