Since they offer it, I'm going to take it and then go for the SSD. Mainly b/c I will get a little more $ and get to stay on health insurance for a bit.  I know most companies are different in how to qualify, but want to hear your experiences in getting approved for the STD/LTD.  I was dx Stage IV in Jan 07. I was NED by Sept 07, with localized recurrence May 10. I think I am still Stage IV (? will check with doc) I know that SSD gives automatic acceptance for StageIV.  Do most  STD/LTD plans do the same?  I have been working since dx, but since this last recurrence and reconstruction process, I am mentally/psychologically starting to feel  beat down and ready to stop and concentrate on getting well.  Truthfully, I think the stress of the past year at work is what brought on the the recurrence. We returned to school this month (I am a teacher)  And the stress is knocking me off my feet daily., I looked at the form that goes to the doc.  One of the questions asks if the pt is able to perform the duties of her employment.  Technically, I guess that would be a yes.  I can walk and talk and write. Do you think that would be an issue? The only tx I'm on now is herceptin and tamoxifen. Thanks for your help.",

I jsut saw doc today and she agreed I should be on STD, at least.  I didn't realize I could do SSD and LTD.  That would be great since my SSD is much less than what I'm making now.  And I was also worried about what to do for the \"lead time' that SSA takes to start sending checks. Another concern of course, is the medical insurance. If I am on STD/LTD, I keep my employer insurance instead of having to wait 24 mos for medicare.  This is very concerning since I am in the middle of reconstruction and still in tx. Thanks again.  I think things are beginning to fall into place.",

Just had   scans in November and I am still NED.

The group had several more fundraisers, set up on line accounts to collect donations. Then she claimed she had a fire and lost everything. Then she claimed she had bone mets in her jaw and couldn't talk or eat, and medicare would not give her surgery to fix it. Soon after that she claimed her son had been killed in Iraq. This has been terrible, long nightmare with this woman. Who not only got monetary support every time she cried out, but emotional, as well. I have to say, I started to get suspicious when one thing after another happened to her. When she  was unable to take advantage of all the suggestions we tried to giver her. I found out so much helpful information from these boards, especially this one, and tried to pass  on the wonderful information I got here. But there was always some excuse why it wouldn't work for her. The group began to get really suspicious and someone started probing a little too deeply, and she disappeared. She was reported to the police, and lo and behold, a scammer appeared. I am proud to be member of the support group that worked so hard to help this woman, and hope that her behavior does not damage those of us with this truely wicked disease. We have all tried to move on and not be bitter, but I am still a little angry that someone could be so malicious. This (arrest warrant) has been in the works for quite some time and I really wanted to get it off my chest here,but was told to hold off in case she was a member of the discussion groups.  After all, if one is going to pretend to have cancer, what better place to come to for information.
