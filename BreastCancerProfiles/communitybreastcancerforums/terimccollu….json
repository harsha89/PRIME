My incision is green/yellow discharge and dr prescribed Bactroban ointment which stung, so gave me bacitracin samples, and Cipro750 mg twice daily til he says to stop, since i hadnt been on antibiotic since 2 weeks post op with no one telling me to go get refills of the keflex. Now after about five days, dr scheduled me for revision surgery ......incising the infected incision and putting ANOTHER jp drain in .....it will be 6 weeks post op this coming thursday.",
