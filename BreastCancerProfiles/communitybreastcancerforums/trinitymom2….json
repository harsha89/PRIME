Very sore and uncomfortable to sleep. Just waiting for my pathology results ( on Wednesday) hoping my margins are clear and nodes are good so I will not need a second surgery. Our plan is for only radiation. I was shocked and learned from routine mammogram. Then I learned both paternal grandparents had cancer, grandma had breast cancer. I will be doing genetic testing to see if I carry the gene as I have a 20 year old daughter. I wish you the best and this website is the best for support and Q &A.",

This week is Savi Scout, I\u2019m stressed ( only because I stress over needles) and surgery is Friday, lumpectomy right breast and then will only need radiation. This website is beyond a blessing and god bless all of you going through the same if not tougher treatments. I have been educating myself and talking to others and feel much more at ease.

I opted not to do chemo and cannot do hormonal therapy due to my grade 3 ( aggressive cancer). Radiation was pushed off for over 2 months, had allergic reaction after surgery then that cleared after weeks then got infection. I read a lot of stories about radiation and I\u2019m prepared ( I think) if I burn or not. I go during lunch break. I wish you the best!",
