    "Content": "heloisemary wrote: I'm posting on behalf of my mother, who is just finishing chemo for Stage 3 Grade 3 breast cancer.  Prior to chemo she had a single mastectomy (tumour was 4mm from chest wall) and 16 lymph nodes removed.  12 out of 16 nodes were affected.  She has been offered radiotherapy and given the option of having the axilla targeted in addition to the primary tumour site.  Apparently 12 out of 16 nodes makes her a borderline case for axillary radio.  She is very worried about the increased risk of lymphoedema and is considering not having radio to the axilla.  I/we can find no information about the impact on life expectancy that radio to the axilla can have - the programme UK doctors use to predict life expectancy (adjuvant online) does not take radio into account.  Can anyone offer any advice on this issue?  It would be hugely appreciated!
