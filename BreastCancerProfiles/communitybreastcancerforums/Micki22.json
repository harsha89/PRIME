The mammogram showed them and they were not concerned because they were very rounded and not star like, which could indicate cancer.",

And next time anyone has to have a mammogram or ultrasound performed you can request to have a female tech perform the procedure and they will try to accomodate. At least that was my experience. Congratulations!!!",

It is so strange that you say it may be MRSA, I just ten minutes ago saw a segment on that on the local news. Why don't they just give you the antibiotics intravenously anyway? That is what they said on the news that would help. Keep us posted and I pray they figure out what it is and something that helps. Micki",
