The one I'm on is made by Mylan and they are bright pink. I'm thinking maybe it's the fillers that are giving me loose bowels and not the drug itself since that's my only SE and it's not a very common one.",

I will talk to the pharmacist and see if it might be a possiblility to get it through them from a different manufacturer so I can find out if it's the fillers. Can't hurt to ask I guess. I really don't want to switch to arimadex. Roxy42, I hope that femara works well for you with few if any se's. Only 9 months left - you're in the homestretch now! Congrats!",
