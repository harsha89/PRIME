When I asked what the radiologist said in his report dr says the rad guy saw no disease in liver, lung or rib. I hope it lasts!! I had to shave my legs today so thats good, hair coming back.

It hits me like a brick wall and I hate it.  I quit my job last month and moved to Arizona something I have wanted to do for a long time. Of course now I have to find a new onc.  I have been having some back pain since Tues when I went swimming so I am worrying about that. Sometimes it seems surreal that this is happening to me, how I wish it never did, to me or any of us. When I feel good it seems like it's over and I won't die from this, maybe I won't, I hope not. I want to come back here at my 10 year mark and say \"Hey I made it\".  Many others have done that and I am grateful they come back to share their success, or is it luck? BC is a sneaky b*tch that's for sure.  I hope all of us will be able to come back in 10 years to post. ",
