I had my cancer while pregnant (only pregnancy) and was super lucky to have my daughter despite the advice against going through the pregnancy (I am ER+) - she is now almost two, and fine although I had chemo (Taxol and Taxotere) during pregnancy. Like you, all my life I have reached for the stars. I took STD, and just this week returned to work, but I have dismissed several opportunities that I'd have taken had there been no cancer. The reality is we do not know when we expire. Anybody who takes the job position could go at any time, that is a known risk. The likelihood is more with us, but it is still just a likelihood. So I'd say go for it IF you think you would still have enough time to take care of you - to research things, to join promising trials if there comes the opportunity, to rest, to live. If the job takes over your life, it is not worth it - take it if the job itself gives you joy but don't take it for future benefits. The baby issue is more difficult and I write this with pain. If I were in your shoes, I'd talk to the support (close family) how much they would be able and willing to be there for the child in the event you are not able to be there - financially, emotionally, basically being there for your child like a mother would. Is your husband okay to the possibility of being the only parent. If that is squared away and you feel confident, then go for it. Frankie, I pray every day for the miracle to allow us to live without fear while we are alive, for the miracle to take this disease away. Who knows, maybe it will happen.  Hugs, Martha",

If it is, since she has liver involvement, I'd be surprised if she goes on Faslodex - only because Faslodex takes a while to kick in and would think they would want to put her on a chemo for quicker action. After Xeloda, I was put on Cisplatin and now Carbo/Gemzar/Avastin and the latter has been easy to tolerate. If Xeloda is the only chemo she's had the options are MANY and her onc will choose what's best for her, which is likely to differ from mine or others here. Good luck!",

About insurance, everything has to be pre-approved before I get it or the insurance does not pay - so me getting Halaven means they have approved it and they pay. No reason why your insurance should not pay for it - $10k really??????? I know Neulasta is up there too and $5k sounds right ... I remember Neupogen being way much cheaper like $300 - but you'll need multiple shots.",

For me,  not much difference between first and second week - the same issue week 1 & 2 - occasional nausia and fatigue that would come and go, zero appetite, and constipation (probably due to bad eating) are so far the only side effects I have seen. This is my week off - improved appetite (and regular bathroom stops), much less nausia and less fatigue (although I have gotten fatigued and nausiated a little yesterday). Good Luck!",

This past weekend - it was in my off week of cycle 1 - I was completely wiped out for two days (Friday and Saturday). It also felt like I had nails stuck on my throat and nose - food would not settle (no appetite plus vomit), and lost my voice. In one week, I have lost 10 lbs - and I did not know that was possible (I have always been slim but now starting to look sickly). The exhaustion felt like I was anemic, not enough air, could barely get off bed. My RBC was normal on Monday - but possible I had a sudden drop? Sunday I felt better and today I'm back to normal. Anybody else experienced such things with Halaven?",

About platlet transfusion, it is quick and easy but they don't sustain you very long - you really have to produce your own to stay on treatments. Ever since I started taking Melatonin (supplement usually used as sleep aid) I have not had problems with platelets, and it is maybe something worth considering for you? From http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/melatonin/NS_patient-melatonin/DSECTION=evidence \"Increased platelet counts after melatonin use have been observed in patients with decreased platelets due to cancer therapies (several studies reported by the same author). Stimulation of platelet production (thrombopoeisis) has been suggested but not clearly demonstrated. Additional research is necessary in this area before a clear conclusion can be drawn.\"",

We're confused about the cause of pain - in the past when I discussed this pain he said it must be SE but this SE is not listed for Halaven (but something about it affecting the mucous membrane is, so this may be related).

A universal BC cure is unlikely in our lifetime, but a targeted treatment or vaccine likely to extend our lives for decades - that, is surely possible and I am holding on to that hope that I'll be around to see it. Getting into spirituality, and this is my belief that I am throwing in just because few things were said about that - with or without BC, death is is inevitable. At most, we got 100 years and in the infinite time, the lifespan of our physical body is essentially less than a blink, and for believers, the lifespan of our spiritual body is eternity. So maybe the significance of a BC cure may not be huge in the big picture - but it is surely huge for us now while we are in this brief physical world. Of course, I don't have answers to why, but I believe there is a reason for why it is this way. I can't stand the emptiness without hope.",

I don't know yet if this would work for me - the frequency of the tests may not match the standard care, so I'm sure the insurance will resist - in the insurance rejuction letter, if they don't state what the maximum scanning/testing they allow, then you may have a good chance for appealing, but this process is soooo frustrating - been there.

New Study in Clinical Cancer Research Demonstrates Potential for Cyclacel's Seliciclib in Treating Breast Cancer Resistant to Hormone Therapy GlobeNewswire - Feb. 17, 2010 BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., Feb. 17, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:CYCC) (Nasdaq:CYCCP) today announced that a newly published study demonstrates that the company's seliciclib(CYC202) or R-roscovitine), an orally available inhibitor of multiple cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), reversed resistance to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (FemaraÂ®) and killed hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells that had become insensitive to the effects of letrozole. The new study was published in the current edition of Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Seliciclib is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. \"Resistance to aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, is a major challenge for the long-term management of hormone receptor positive breast cancer,\" said Professor David Glover, Ph.D., Cyclacel's Chief Scientist. \"The data published in Clinical Cancer Research are encouraging as they show that seliciclib can kill resistant breast cancer cells by targeting a form of cyclin E that is a major cause of the resistance. This is further evidence that seliciclib's unique mechanism of action can be effective against certain cancer cells, such as breast and lung cancer, that fail to respond to standard cancer treatments.\" Approximately 3 out of 4 women suffering from breast cancer after menopause have cancers that express the hormonal receptors for estrogen and progesterone and are offered treatment with aromatase inhibitor drugs including letrozole. Letrozole treatment reduces the risk of early metastasis in women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Letrozole is believed to interact with a natural CDK inhibitor p27 which in turns regulates the activity of the CDK2/cyclin E complex. Over time, breast cancer cells develop resistance to letrozole and the therapy becomes ineffective. Researchers from The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center led by Khandan Keyomarsi, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology, found that a key cause of resistance to letrozole is overexpression of the low molecular weight form of cyclin E, which also predicted for lower overall survival and higher chance of cancer recurrence after aromatase inhibitor treatment. However, after they treated letrozole-resistant breast cancer cells with seliciclib, a CDK2/cyclin E inhibitor, the resistant cancer cells were killed. The researchers concluded that their data support clinical investigation of CDK inhibitors such as seliciclib as targeted therapy in a specific patient population of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, low molecular weight cyclin E expressing breast cancer.

Personally, I try not to offend those that have been generous to be there for me, but when I find myself overwhelmed and ask for them to let me approach them with the specifics I need when I need them. It is frustrating that we are not as capable, and are getting less and less capable, and to be \"troubling\" others. However, we are human, perishable, weak, and undeniably terminal - as all humans, but more so obvious on us - and how lucky we are to have those that care and are willing to help. My only advice is to ask for a rain check if it is too much now, and tell them how appreciated they are - you do need them, and they do need their daughter / friend - no one intends to cause any pain, but the frustration builds up and we sometimes direct our frustration on those that are there to help.

I was 29 with first BC battle ... anyhoo, I have newly developed lung mets and had breathing issues initially but now the treatment seems to be working as my breathing has returned to normal. What matters is finding the treatment that works - I've seen pple with extensive mets everywhere going NED cause they hit the right treatment - and some with one or two tiny spots then the disease going wild cause nothing worked. I pray you find the right treatment and your youthful energy will take you far. As far as controlling the mind, it is easier said but at least for me impossible to do - it always creeps in my mind, but I try hard to stay in the moment ....Hugs, Martha",

Since you mentioned shrinkage in some nodules down to 1 cm, it looks like you have had a recent scan - and if so, it would be awefully fast to be feeling pain caused by liver mets if nothing has showen up on your recent scan - possible but unlikely. Hopefully it is not liver mets, but if it is, there are other options - not very comforting but this is what we're dealing with now. It helps me to let myself be down sometimes, sleep a lot, watch movies a lot, and then pick myself up whenever I can ... hope your relieve comes soon, but hope you get some comfort by not concluding the worst.

If the PET lights up, chances are it is cancer and if not, maybe it is benign. As far as targeted liver treatment, I can't comment but there were past discussions that maybe you can search on.  Fatima - for us, the best case scenario is we are NED for as long as possible - and that requires massive amount of luck (<3%) and staying on some drug forever, thus not amounting to a cure. But I hope and pray we live long enough to see the cure.  Hugs, Martha",

After delivery of my baby, I switched to hormonal treatments, which worked much  better for me. Your case is different, in that you are ER/PR -. Your HER2+ status and your current treatment provides hope. I know of someone who has similar diagnosis as you and who is currently NED (or No Evidence of Disease, has been for 5 years and few months, before they came up with the new HER2+ treatments). Your case is your own - it all depends on how well you respond to currently available treatment, but you have a lot to be hopeful for with new and promising options for HER2+. I've heard of peoople from other groups who have been living with this disease, the most I've heard of is 30 years, and some less than a year, although they started out with bone mets only at diagnosis. So only God knows what's ahead, and I really don't think there is much you can do or gain by researching (maybe hope, and maybe if you run out of treatment options, then reasearch pays off in finding the clinical trial that may help, and if you have a lousy oncologyst, reasearch pays off, but let's hope your onc knows his/her stuff). I hope and pray to live to see my daughter grow - we celebrated her first birthday last weekend, and I am so thankful that breast cancer did not cross my mind that day, not once. It is difficult to live in the moment while in fear of what could be, but we do our best ... well, there really is no choice :=)",
