If when I told my doctor I would like to have a mammo due to breast pain, s/he would have done an assessment (verbal and physical) or if I had been sent to another doctor who could do a clinical exam; I am sure I would not still be waiting. My doctor did not ask; so s/he does not know that my breast is full of lumps and some are new (but I've been dealing with these cystic breasts all their life), also have a very full feeling in left breast, also can not tolerate the pressure a bra puts upon the breast and rib cage (and even got a gigantic one, but the rubbing hurts), also bras cause my left breast to feel like it is hot and going to spontaneously combust, also my left nipple hurts with orgasm, also neither one of my nipples gets as erect as they used to (wondering if that's from surgical hysterectomy and no HRT), also sometimes my left nipple doesn't get erect at all while my right one is erect, also feel lumps off to the side of breast that I've never felt before, also can't stand the slightest touch like a hug or an animals tail brushing across chest as they curl up on my lap, also have to prop my left arm up on hubby or pillow as the left inner arm, armpit, and rib cage are all too tender to touch one another, and have to prop the left boob up with a pillow when laying on my right, also have had just a couple of nights where the pain on the left side interferred with my sleep when I was on my left side. I've been waiting so long; I just can't keep my symptoms to myself anymore.  I really hope it is just an infected cyst.  But my doctor doesn't even know that.  Like I said below, s/he responded to me that breast cancer doesn't hurt.  Poo, I wasn't even thinking breast cancer; I was thinking a cyst could be drained and I could have some comfort.  It's been a long time since the mammographer bumped my appt two times before I even had the mammo on the 20th. I'll be interested in seeing how this doctor follows up from this point, but it will have to be stupendous for me to get over this issue.  Well, it would have to be pretty darned good and accurate and professional. I don't expect anyone to reply; I just needed to get my symptoms off my chest (ha, I wish I could literally.) Hello, I'm new. I filled in the biography section a bit, with family cancer history:  mother died at age 50 of respiratory failure due to bc w/ mets to lungs; father died of colon cancer; father's mother was a survivor of bc. I'm not too familiar with discussion boards, so be gentle with me when I need correction; please? My only breast diagnosis to date is fibrocystic breasts.  I have been for two mammograms thus far in life.  And am currently waiting for the final results from the second one - impatiently waiting. I have one basic question that I can't find a definite answer to by reading posts for the last four days.      \"\"\"Is there any chance that a radiologist would wait for previous mammogram to be mailed to him/her for comparison if there were a pretty good sign of cancer in the current mammogram?\"\"\" LLOONNGGGG story shortened:  I don't have the greatest of confidence in my physician as s/he rolled his/her eyes when I asked for mammogram to which I responded, \"It's been over 3 years.\"; to which s/he responded, \"New guidelines are ... (you all know that already)\" to which I bantered, \"but I have chronic pain, here (pointing)\"; to which s/he bantered, \"Cancer doesn't cause pain and breast cancer is typically found more towards the armpit.\"; by now I am humiliated and don't even feel up to getting beat down again with any further comment of proof that I need a mammogram so I just say, \"Well, something is causing chronic pain and there is family history.\"   With a big sigh s/he \"let\" me have my mammo. I was not told by the Doctor or the nurse to bring previous mammo. films and not to wear deodorant, powder, lotion, or perfume. So, I am waiting and have figured out through reading posts that if the mammo is clear, they certainly will hold off until they receive the first mammo for comparison.  Common sense tells me that if they saw a spiculated tumor, they would certainly have me in for diagnostic mammo at the least without having to wait for previous mammo.  But in reading all over the internet, I have found where there are plenty of women who really do receive the notification to come in for more tests through the mail ten and more days after the mammo. There is really so much more I could say about how horrible it has been having to wait - live and learn.  But some good has come from it, too.  I had never heard the word \"spiculated\" before this week etc... Also, I found out how to fight for myself, if I need to, by reading the posts on this and other discussion boards.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have the gumption to do so after the fight it took just to get the screening mammo. My previous mammo experience is a perfect example of how I just did not know enough.  It was a wonderful first experience!  The mammographer was considerate and compassionate and the squishing did not hurt, but s/he did show me the films immediately and said s/he had concern over some microcalcifications in my right breast (I was concerned with a pea sized lump on left breast) and would like me to go to another town for more testing.  When I met with my o.b.gyn. to discuss upcoming hysterectomy surgery, I asked him/her if s/he thought I should follow up as the mammographer had suggested.  S/He said, \"No.\"  I verified the answer was no and I asked when I should come for the next one and the answer was two years!!!!!!  So, now I've done all this learning and I've had probably ?seven hours sleep over the past four nights. I really have never seen myself react this way to anything.  Normally I can't be kept from my sleep and remain quite calm in the midst of true crises.   I think I could relax if I knew for certain that they would have contacted me for further testing, regardless of where my first mammo films were, if there were a high suspicion of cancer.  right??? I really didn't know that much about bc, the horrific fight, the life long threat.  My heart goes out to you in the midst of your fights and on the journey of the battle.  God bless you. Thank you for letting me vent.  I've never had to \"argue\" with a doctor like that before, and I am not a hypochondriac.  I really needed to vent. Log in to post a reply",

My age is mid forties with surgically induced mennopause so I feel that makes me (or at least my body) mid-fifties. Today, I called where previous mammo had been done and they said they went out in today's mail, with the radiologist's report. They send a postcard???  Seriously, I did not get a postcard or any other documentation! I have moved many states away from that gyn   Not sure I need to go to one anymore - with no plumbing. I will definitely be taking possession of films and radiologist's reports a.s.a.p. I will have to see how insurance will pay for US, but can see with my fibrocystic breasts that I should have had that done previously (as well as the microcalcifications).  I just didn't know enough then and the gyn didn't even look at my file to see what the mammographer had had to say when s/he just answered me with that, \"No.\"  I'll know much more now that I know the lingo and what we all are looking for when I get my hands on the reports. So, do you think if there were a blatent issue with current film they would actually wait for previous film to come from many states away?  Before sending me for more tests?",
