I'm hoping everything turns out ok. I'm 28 years old going through this has made me realize so much. I'm very thankful to have found this site because even though I have amazing support from my family and friends, only we know how it feels to go through this emotional roller coaster. I'm going to pray for all of us that unfortunately have to be here. Log in to post a reply",
