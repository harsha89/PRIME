Many of the women here have walked this road, some more than once. Here's the one tip a Survivor shared with me -- If you can, try to avoid self-diagnosing via the Internet... there's a lot of inaccurate info out there. Depending on where you are getting your treatment a nurse navigator may be available to help you walk through all of the treatment steps. Also there may be stress management classes or financial aid or other resources available. Perhaps ask your doctor's office? Sending hugs.",

It might be worth it to try to page him/her to get some kind of guidance as to the next steps. For me, the next step after the diagnosis was meeting with a surgical oncologist. Hopefully you'll soon be paired up with a nurse navigator at your nearest breast center (you can read more about them on this board -- mine has been so so supportive and compassionate and helpful regarding next steps (and also in helping me tell the kids without scaring them too much).

Had my post-op apt this past week and the incisions (3) look good... I developed hives after surgery, which I thought were from the surgical tape... electronically (we are linked online), the surgeon said I could take an antihistamine and if I really was in discomfort I could take the bandages off early. Did so (it was a week after sx). When I saw her for the post-op (day 8 after sx) she took a look at the hives and surmised they were actually from the antibiotic (Cefazolin) they gave me during surgery, since I am allergic to penicillins. I still have the rash and am taking 1 10 mg Zyrtec at night (bc it makes me sleepy). Last night I put some Cortizone cream on my arms bc they were so itchy. Anyway, she replaced the surgical strips (steristrips) at the post op and told me that leaving them on for a couple of more weeks would help minimize scar formation. I asked about neosporin and she sd studies have been shown comparing neosporin use vs surgical strips and the surgical strips are associated with less scarring. That was a surprise to me. I have 2 young daughters (I know, at age 53, when many of my peers are grandmas)... we built our family through adoption and these girls beat the odds to be here healthy and full of light. Ages almost 5 (actually bday party planning today) and almost 11. (Pls don't judge -- I've had online folks tell me I was selfish b/c of my late-life parenting and being judged by anon ppl online (on the Weight Watchers site of all places) hurts me, but this does not seem like that kind of community.) IMO God has a plan for all of us and these two sweeties were meant to be part of ours.) We have a lot of creativity in the house -- lots of writing and music and dance -- so together the three of us have started a creative project about the breast cancer experience (I'll share that down the road... it's gestating/in early development just now), which helps it be less scary for them, and for me! I have an initial consult with a med oncologist this coming Thursday. Don't have my OncoDX results yet --- did insurance cover that test for you? The surgeon just ordered that test for me the other day -- per the front desk folks, OncoDX is part of the usual workup, so I didn't think to ask the surgeon about it until post-op. Turns out she didn't order it. So now she has. I've been getting lots of support (meals and child care) from my network of friends/family. Feel blessed in that regard. Plus, my husband has a TON of leave time so he will likely be able to work just half-days on most of my radiation days (so he can be with the kids), so that's a relief. Thank you for all of the great coping tips. I appreciate your support so much. xo",

Have 2 littles. It's about 10 weeks since and I'm now considered cancer free; I've had surgery and completed a course of radiation and will start taking Femara soon. I feel like I missed a summer with my kids, as I was off doctoring so much. But, I feel like I did/am doing what was necessary to be there in the long run for them. It's a scary time for both of you right now, but as you know more, and garner more support here and around you, you will feel more in control. Here's to happier, less scary days!",

I have a v serious blood clotting disorder and had to go off my warfarin, take injections of a different blood thinner for 4 to 5 days before surgery, then take both after the surgery until the warfarin was back in the therapeutic range, so my fears centered around clotting or bleeding out. Neither happened I'm happy to report! Re pain meds... I didn't have significant pain....took Norco as directed but it made me feel fuzzy brained so on the second day I switched to Tylenol (can't take Nsaids due to clotting issue). Worst part for me was breaking out in hives from the antibiotic (I think it was ancef) used during surgery.... still itchy from that but most of the visible hives have cleared. Melissa lol on the mom thing... I can sooooo relate. I second/third the relief from icing. One thing I didn't expect, the seat belt in my car crossed over my incision. It's ok now but the first 2 times I drove I kept fiddling with it. Not sure what your doc will advise about driving after surgery but between the anesthesia and the norco I felt too loopy to drive until about day 6 after surgery.",
