I haven\u2019t found a treatment plan that has brought my bone Mets anywhere near stable. After a short run on Xeloda, my oncologist is having my cancer biopsies again and is suggesting a \u201ccirculating biomarkers\u201d test. I tried to research it tonight, but have found mostly information on using it on early stage with reference to determining future Mets. She said that there was some compelling research presented in San Antonio about its effectiveness. I\u2019ll call her tomorrow, but in the meantime am wondering if anyone knows about this or has had the test. Thanks in advance for your help! Sue T Log in to post a reply",
