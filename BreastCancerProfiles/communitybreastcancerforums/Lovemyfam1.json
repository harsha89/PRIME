My doctor is out of town, and I called three times today for some explanation and no it's evening and no one has called me back. I called the mammogram place, they said I need further imaging and so I'm going back later this week. I'm panicking, not good. Can someone please explain this to me, and offer some advice since I can't speak to my own doctor? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

I've tried to post the report but it says I'm not allowed to post on here. It's very short. I'll type it out: 3D mammogra Findings: The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. Right: There is asymmetry seen in the in your region of the right breast. There is asymmetry seen in the upper region of the right breast  Left: There are no suspicious masses, calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion. Impression and recommendation: Additional imaging is recommended.  My doctor is not communicating with me well. This has always been an issue but because I've never really had anything serious I just let it go. I had to wait 24 hours to even talk with her and she was clearly in a hurry and said callbacks happen all of the time, they need more pictures. That was basically it. She still did not explain the asymmetry to me. And the report does not say global, focal, or developing on my report- this confuses me because with everything I've read on here that is always included in the report.  Any and all feedback is helpful. I know so many people are dealing with so much more than I am at this point but I still can't help thinking about \"what if \". I am going back tomorrow.",
