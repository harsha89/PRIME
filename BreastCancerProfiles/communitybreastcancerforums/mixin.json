My results upon finishing rads last 7-27 were 11.9, then 3-30 were 13.3 and 8-03 were 17.9.  My onc said: \"Do not worry about them going up or down as long as they are within the normal range.\"   And I try not to; but it's always lurking in the back of my mind... wondering what the next test will bring. I don't understand what \"normal\" range is. Normal for a non-cancer person or normal for those of us who have been treated for cancer? ",

Other areas lit up in the right and one area lit up in the left. The biopsies determined the areas in the right were nothing to worry about; the spot in the left was DCIS. I hope your spots are all benign and wish you the best for your MRI results tomorrow. ",
