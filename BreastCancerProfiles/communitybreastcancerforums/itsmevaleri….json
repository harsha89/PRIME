I'm a real worrier by nature (like most women tend to be, I think) and the rational side of me says....slow down and don't bring on trouble till you know what's going on. But there's that other part saying ahhhhhh! I will post tomorrow after my appt. Again, thanks for your kind words.",

I think I'm so anxious to hear \"everything is fine\" that I'd do the same thing you did. So thanks again and I'm sorry for what you went thru...how are you doing today?  I will post whatever I find out tomorrow......Valerie ",

The guy went over it twice with the ultra-sound and couldn't find anything. They said alot of times tissue will overlap and cause a shadow. Don't get me wrong...that's GREAT news! But, it doesn't explain why I'm having some pain. I go back to the Dr. week after next and will be discussing it further. Here's part of my problems....I have several other issues going at the same time....mitral valve prolapse (that I have chest pain with), fibromyalgia (again, widespread pain), and arthritis. I noticed the arthritis bothered me alot more since around the holidays this year. I have complained of pain to at least 4 doctors and either no one seems to listen, or they say oh it's probably just the arthritis, etc. But when it involves the breast area, that worries me more than anything, naturally. It's really frustrating to get someone to listen to me....I get the feeling they chalk it up to a \"complaining woman\", if you know what I mean! Sorry to get off on a rant...I just don't know where to turn to anymore.  Valerie",
