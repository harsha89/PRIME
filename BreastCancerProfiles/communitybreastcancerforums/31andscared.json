I was diagnosed last August - same age as you.  I had double mastectomy followed with chemo.  I also have two little boys - 4 and 2yrs old.  The scariest of times is in the beginning.  Once you start your journey of surgery and chemotherapy, you'll realize that you truly are able to take every day as it comes.  You'll get through this...and will come out as a survivor.  Breast cancer truly makes us young girls have to grow up quickly, but you'll be amazed at how strong you are throughout it all. Lean on your support people to help get you through, and always be able to ask for help when you need it.  Cry when you need to, but also laugh as often as you can.  Relish in your kids' love.  My kids' love was very healing to me throughout treatment Stay strong dear...you will beat this beast!",
