In addition, my implants migrated into my armpits when I reclined causing discomfort and a pulling sensation. I switched to a different plastic surgeon and had a revision with smaller/different shaped implants along with lateral capsulorrhaphies (\"pocket work\") to keep the implants where they belonged 19 months after the first implants were placed. I have BlueCross/BlueShield and the revision surgery was covered. I was also encouraged to wait at least one year from the initial implant surgery before pursing a revision surgery. In that time, I saw a chiropractor and massage therapist, swam, did physical therapy exercises that were given to me post-mastectomy, and did lots of yoga. All of these things helped but in the end, nothing changed the fact that the implants migrated into my armpits when I reclined which made sleeping without pain non-existent. I pursued the revision and am much happier. I still suffer from discomfort on the side where lymph nodes were taken so I continue to practice yoga, swim, and see the chiropractor and massage therapist, however, my discomfort level has gone from a 8 to a 3 on most days. My first plastic surgeon insisted on giving me larger tissue expanders/implants than I wanted and expressly discussed prior to my mastectomy. Hence, the switch to the second plastic surgeon was in my best interest. If your original plastic surgeon does not understand your desires, get a second (or third and fourth) opinion if necessary to find a plastic surgeon who you feel comfortable with.",

I encourage you to seek a second opinion from a different plastic surgeon handling breast reconstruction. Be strong and remember that you are the \"manager\" of your own medical care.

Why not take one or two of these classes on a trial basis and if it is not for you, then find another instructor or another class. There are also lots of yoga DVD's and even yoga sessions online/YouTube that you can experiment with to find what you like and what works for you! Right now, I attend yoga classes 5 days per week with 4 different instructors--they are all different and I get something great out of every class--both physically and mentally.",

Your body is still healing and it is not unusual to be in the discomfort you are describing so soon after a mastectomy! You need to give yourself some time. Six months to one year is NOT an unreasonable amount of time to recover from this surgery, especially if you had lymph nodes removed. In addition, a DIEP flap surgery is a more invasive surgery than reconstruction with tissue expanders. Please talk to your doctor about a referral for physical therapy! This is an important step in your recovery. You will learn patience through this. Physical therapy, yoga, and massage therapy were extremely helpful to me during my recovery (I practiced yoga before BMX and continue to do so). Try not to be so hard on yourself and take it one day/step at a time.",

I am hoping this will resolve my tightness as I too have done all sorts of therapy (PT, chiro, breast massage including manual lymphatic drainage and myofascial release by a LMT, graston massage by my chiro, swiimming, and yoga) and although it is considerable less than immediately after the exchange, the tightness persists and is more noticeable when I am tired/stressed.",

Her pain doctor recently had his license suspended for a brief time for an investigation of possibly over-prescribing medication. My co-worker's pain was so intense that she was wondering whether she could continue working especially since she was without her medication due to the problems with her doctor so she took the opportunity to try the Quell. She said the Quell has changed her life! She if off the morphine and other pain meds completely and feels as though she has gotten her life back!",

I agree that most breast surgeons and plastic surgeons do not want to address this side effect because it is kind of like the \"necessary evil\" side effect of breast cancer surgery. The nurse practitioner at my breast surgeon's office seemed surprised when I mentioned that I still suffered from numbness and heaviness in my right arm almost three years after my BMX and ALND--she even said that most of her patients do not have this numbness this long after surgery. She was totally unaware that massage therapy, chiropractic treatment, and Graston massage could be helpful for these types of side effects (I utilize all of these treatments regularly and they are extremely helpful)! From being part of this discussion, however, I know that I am not alone suffering from PMPS so it does make me feel better to know that I am not an oddity or that even something was done wrong during my surgery. It was also never disclosed to me that 25-60% of women undergoing breast cancer surgery suffer from PMPS and if that had been disclosed, I think I would have done more research before deciding to proceed with the ALND; I may have opted for a sentinal node biopsy instead. Hindsight is 20/20. I am not a Facebook member nor do I wish to become one.",
