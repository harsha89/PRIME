    "Content": "bcook22 wrote: I am having a breast tumor, in the chest wall, removed surgically after receiving one year of herceptin and taxol, which reduced the size and activity, but did not eliminate the tumor in my breast & bones.  I was diagnosed a year ago (August 2007) with recurrent, metastic (bone) breast cancer.  My first diagnosis was May 2003, and I had a bilateral mastectomy, chemo and breast reconstruction with silicon implants.  Initially, the recurrence had hid below my implant (same site (left breast) as the original site) and moved on top of the implant in the skin.  Where a mammogram was able to diagnose the recurrence.  Now, my Oncologist wants to have the breast tumor and implant removed, and wait and see.  I want the tumor removed, but the implant replaced.  Any comments ?
