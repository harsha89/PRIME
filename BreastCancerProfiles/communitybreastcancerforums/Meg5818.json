I'm currently 22 years old and breastfeeding my three month old. No family history or breast cancer. I know that my chances of being diagnosed are already small because of my current situation, but it is still possible and I am concerned. About two months ago, I found a lump above (almost on the border) of my Areola. Knowing that lumpy breasts are common during breastfeeding, I decided to let it go on for a little bit and see if it goes away. About a month later, I called my OB about it and he told me over the phone that it's probably something breastfeeding related and not to worry. He's a pretty casual guy, so instead, I made an appointment with my primary physician who, after an exam, thought it was a cyst. He ordered me an ultrasound to be sure. At the ultrasound, the radiologist told me that it wasn't a cyst and tried looking for signs of it being a duct. She could not be sure and told me that it was reasonable to biopsy now only if it was keeping me up at night or wait three months and biopsy if it wasn't smaller. This is because while it could be a plugged duct, my symptoms didn't line up. NOTE: I haven't had mastitis (that I know of and I've been told I would've known) and I haven't had any tenderness or soreness. This is what puzzled the radiologist. The findings: FINDINGS: THE PALPABLE ABNORMALITY CORRESPONDS TO A HYPOECHOIC SLIGHTLY HETEROGENOUS MASS MEASURING 12 X 7 X 7 MM WITHOUT WELL-DEFINED BORDERS. THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF A HYPOECHOIC RIM. THERE IS A DUCT POSSIBLY LEADING INTO THIS MASS ALONG THE INFERIOR BORDER. THERE IS BLOOD FLOW SEEN ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THIS MASS. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE PATIENT'S HISTORY OF NURSING, THIS COULD REPRESENT A CLOGGED DUCT. THE DIFFERENTIAL WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A GALACTOCELE AND LACTATING ADENOMA. RECOMMENDATIONS: 3 MONTH FOLLOW-UP ULTRASOUND IS RECOMMENDED. IF THIS INCREASES IN SIZE, THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED TORETURN FOR ULTRASOUND-GUIDED BIOPSY. I'm debating calling the doctor to ask if I can get biopsy done sooner due to the fact that my nipple on the affected side appear slightly puffier on one side and there is a vein within the same area which is to the left of the mass. My nipple has obviously changed a lot in the last year due to pregnancy and bfing so it's hard to notice any abnormal changes. It might all be in my head. Any thoughts or similar experiences?
