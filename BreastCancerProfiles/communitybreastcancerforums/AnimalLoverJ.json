    "Content": "AnimalLoverJ wrote: Hello, Ive had a rapidly growing lump in my breast for a few months now. I am 17, I just received an ultrasound for it. The doctor concluded that it is either a Fibroadenoma, or another type of tumor which doesnt stop growing, they are too similiar to each other to tell (yikes).  Either way, it is 3.8cm large, so he referred me to a breast surgeon with the notion that it will need to be removed. I am seeing the surgeon this thursday and she will make the final decision. I am really scared. Surgery, no matter how minor, terrifies me. My heart reaches out to the strong women who can push through this. I'm not sure what to expect. Has anyone else had a Fibroadenoma or a tumor this size that didn't need removal? Based on your experience, is it likely I will need it removed? What should I expect from here on out?  Log in to post a reply",
