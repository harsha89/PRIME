Brenda: Not sure if I have to drink anything for the scans or not.  I can not have anything to eat or drink after midnight on Sunday other than clear fluids.  I will have to drink some apple juice so sugars stay stable.  Cathy",

All along the outer side of my left lung.  Both lungs are involved but the left one has the largest amount and was the first.  I have an appointment to see MO next Thursday but if it persists I may call the clinic and see if they want me to get an xray or anything before then.  I am booked for another cat scan Mar. 2 and so far there has not been any progression since I started this Palbo drug trial last June.  Any other reasons for the pain that anyone knows of?

THANK YOU!!  Leftfoot - I'm praying for you too.. may you have better days ahead. Spicey- I hope the cry helped.  You are not alone here.  Sorry your so young with this on your plate.  I'd just like to hold you and comfort you.  Hugs. Cathy",

Latest scans showed that the Taxol was shrinking both the lung and liver mets however my bone mets were still progressing the worst being in my spine. To target this I underwent bone radiation witch helped a lot. My break from treatment (gong moment when done Radiation) was very short lived however. I finished bone Rads on Wed. last week and Thursday I was taken from my home by EMS after having a fall and not being able to get up and a lot of side effects similar to a stroke. I was transferred to my cancer center where I found out that my mets had spread once again this time to my brain. Although we all know this shortens my life expectancy I do continue to fight all I can. Wish everyone the best in there battle. Cathy",

My Radiation oncologist didn't mention it yet he said they do keep each other updated and would be happy to be paged to join in at my next visit. I have such a wonderful family and friends, I feel so lucky. I was told that on average for my liver and and brain mets it may only be 6 months yet they can only estimate that by others who also had same mets as I and how they did. I have a beautiful daughter getting married in April and will do ANYTHING to be there for that and longer if possible. My son and I after the fall and brain radiation.",

I think my kids requested pic's with me as they now don't know how many more Mothers Days we have.  Living with mets to both lungs, liver, bones - both hips and spine changes things.  Every day has to be treasured truly.  Another scan in early June will tell if Faslodex is working or not.  If not then it is back to more chemo.  The way I look at it.. if I lose my hair again.. better my hair than my life!  Hugs to all.

I was not doing so well with the bowel movement issues and after getting my blood work they pulled me from having chemo as my neutrophils were too low. Then I had a severe skin reaction (very itchy then hives) to both arms and hands and chest area, and I hesitated to go to hospital. However I went to one 25 minutes away. I had a severe itchy redness then it turned to hives. I am starting to feel like does all the bad stuff have to happen to me???!!!!!! They gave me a shot of Benedryl in the hip only after blood work, xrays to pelvis, told me to take this stuff (purg-odan) to make my bowels move. It is the stuff that warms up in water and is not that bad. As it had been 8 days since I had a bowel movement and only like 3 in a month. I was so bloated and uncomfortable. I am not sure what my MO will due about the hives. He will get the report today. So far I am moving bowels, and I have to take Benedryl every 4 hours. Need to rest now .. hope you all are doing great. Cathy",
