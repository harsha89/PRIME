Second, I too had prolyphic AL&DH and chose a BMX after years of mammograms/magnified views/ultrasounds/MRIs/excisional biopsies/aspirations/biopsies with wire localizations/stereotactic biopsies - you name it, I think I had it all. At the end (pre BMX) I was having mammograms every 6 months - called back for mag view & ultrasounds, stereotactic and/or excisions biopsies (once they tried for 2 hour <OUCH> using sterotactic which failed and I ended up with yet another excisional biopsy). Then it was time for the 6 month mammogram again. What a circus! The last stereotactic turned up prolyphic AL&D with probable LCIS. My surgeon and the radiolgist agreed that it was not \"if,\" it was \"when\" and my insurance would cover a BMX. Enough said. That was Nov. 21, 2008. I am now going through TEs with implant hopefully in March. I can't tell you the burden that was lifted when I had the mastecomy! I really couldn't wait to have them gone.",

Not sure how old you are, but as you age this may progress to more hyperplastic cells and they may become atypical - hopefully not. You will just be \"watched\" - maybe have mamograms every year or every 6 months. Digital mammography, magnified views and ultrasound have certainly given the surgeons/radiologists more information than ever before. In comparison, my \"benign\" diagosis was prolyphic ductal and lobular atypical hyperplasia. When it became apparent that the cells were increasing the size/width of both the ducts and lobes, they suggested a bilateral mastecomy (age 58). The risk was very high for producing cancer cells that could travel. It wasn't \"if\" - it was \"when.\" I'm glad they have this 'baseline' for you - make sure you have that path report if you ever change doctors. So happy for you! (Isn't it agonizing waiting for results?)  Here is more hyperplasia information. http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/WomensHealth/Non-CancerousBreastConditions/non-cancerous-breast-conditions-hyperplasia",
