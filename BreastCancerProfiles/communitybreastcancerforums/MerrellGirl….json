We each respond so differently to the stages - surgery, chemo, radiation, post-treatment, etc. - and you can rest assured that if you search these boards long enough, you WILL find others who responded/felt the same way you do. That's what's great about bc.org! Don't worry about chemo - it will come with its own discomforts, but nothing you (+meds) can't handle. The TEs were a long term nuisance for me. I think I took Percs at night for months just to get relief. Make sure you are taking Miralax or some other softener while on the pain meds. Gotta keep all the balls in the air! Smile, you're doing just great! Merrell",
