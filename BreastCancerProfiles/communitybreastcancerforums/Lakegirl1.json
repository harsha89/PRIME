I was 38 DDD, cosmetically, I don't think I would have been happy with the outcome with a single mx. The PS said it would have been a challenge to reconstruct and reduce the good one and match.  The gen surgeon, didn't recommend re excision due to the size of the original mass, rads would have caused addl issues for any type of recon.   I would have the same number of surgeries. So, I decided they needed to go.    When they did the bmx, there was an addl area they weren't even watching that had IDC.   Gen surgeon and MO both agree, it was the right thing for me.  I also had scarring on both nips from nursing, half moons. I had mastitis 3 times in 6 wks with my first.  It was awful. For me, it was really a very easy decision.  I did have some issues with a TE, required addl surgery and IV abx via PICC line.    That being said, I would still do the same again. Yes, I am getting chemo with low onco score of 6, but no rads.   I want to know I have done everything I can to be sure it is gone!   Yes, they are fake.  The real ones were plotting against me! I know it is a hard decision to make and know I didn't take it lightly... Once you do make a choice, you will be surprised at the peace you will have. If you have questions, PM me. I'm happy to talk any time.  Best wishes as you travel this journey none of us has chosen!   Janice",

I was absolutely terrified of loosing my hair, but when it came down it when it was just disgusting and falling out all over, I had it buzzed.  It wasn't to the scalp, but pretty short.  Well, after that, I haven't completely lost my hair. In fact, it appears to be growing!!  How is this possible?  Will the rest of it fall out after the next 2?  Or, will it continue to grow and eventually fill in after I get done with chemo???  Also, my nails have never looked better!  Who knew???   I am glad I still have some hair, don't get me wrong, but it makes wearing the wig a little tricky!!!  The hair is slick and I sometimes feel like it will pop off the top of my head !!!  Any suggestions???  That is all I need, for it to pop off at work, which is pretty much the only place I wear it.  Otherwise, I am sporting an Adidas running hat!!!   Should I start using the nioxinshampoo ?  ",
