I just had my rad/sim yesterday and was given a choice to make regarding markers.  I can either leave the multitude of circles and lines with plastic for the whole duration, or I can opt with the tattoos.  There are pros and cons for either.  Does anyone here have an opinion one way or the other?  Enjoy your rad free week end.  It is soooooooooo hot here in Florida and I can use my pool until Monday....yay.",

I don't know if it is my imagination or actually happened, but my left breast felt heated when the beam hit  across my breast.  Oh well could be just   my imagination.  The treatment was so quick.  Holding still was a piece of cake, but of course that is when I get a tickle on my nose and can't budge. Well all my Survivor friends, have a great evening and chat with you again.",
