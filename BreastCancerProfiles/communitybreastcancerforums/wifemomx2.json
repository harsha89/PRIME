Since all of my family has shown overwhelming support I guess the least I can do is allow them to be there for me since it seems to mean so much to them. I 'm thinking that I probably won't be up to seeing them all after I come out from recovery though.",

I was frightened because they had been in longer than I expected and I've heard some women say that the drains began to fuse to the skin which makes them a bit difficult to remove. Well I went prepared. I took my pain meds; which I have been off of since Tuesday and I truly believed they helped out a alot. It was relatively painless, I felt a mild stinging sensation briefly and then it was over. I feel 10x better now that they are gone and I can shower tomorrow!!!!  :) Best to you all momwifex2",

As far as pain meds go I was prescribed 10mg Hydrocodone; no refill and I received this script in the hospital by my GS. Prior to surgery my PS mailed me a script days prior to surgery to have once I was released. They were 5mg Oxycodone; no refill and 5 mg Hydrocodone with 1 refill. I was taking the 10 mg hyro because that's what they were giving me after I was taken off the pain pump and I didn't know if 5mgs were going to be as effective. I haven't been in any pain per say just some mild pressure. If I had any pain I would definitely still take them as needed. My biggest problem right now is extreme fatigue and major loss of appetite. I think your pain should start to ease off very soon and I believe your drain removal will be a breeze just as mine were. My very best to you :) wifemomx2",

Although I think these products are terrific and would be a great benefit to women who have to have these surgeries, I find them to be awfully expensive. $50 and $60 for one cami, my goodness. I have also seen (not to offend anyone) surviors who have gone through these procedures and have since invented a product to make post surgery a bit easier but what they are charging for their items are a bit costly. I would think that someone who knows first hand what this is like would be somewhat \"lenient\" if you will, with what they are charging those that are going through the same ugly ordeal.
