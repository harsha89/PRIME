When I had my diagnosis confirmed I knew the surgeon I had chosen was going away for almost 3 weeks. I spoke to him RE: my concerns about the delay. He said in his professional opinion the wait would make absolutely no difference to my physical outcomes. He did go on to say, \"however mentally, waiting is very tough\" and gave me the option of seeing another surgeon. He is the best in the region and I chose to wait. I haven't regretted my decision. He did recommend that I see my GP and get something to help me sleep, which I did. It made such a difference. I found that I was so much more productive and far less emotional during the day when I could sleep at night. Wishing you well on your journey. Hugs Donna.",

My hubby attends every appointment and treatment session with me, helps more with practical things around the house like cooking and cleaning and he cuddles me a lot. Not much to offer on the issues with your arm sorry. My mastectomy was October the 9th and I was lucky to make a good recovery. I have a fantastic range of movement and very little numbness.

Vacuuming is too heavy a chore for you so soon after surgery sweet lady. I worry about my hubby too. He's exhausted working all day in the heat in a physically demanding job, he's a gardener; then looking after me or running to the hospital when I was in there, trying to do most of the household chores and look after our yard here. We have 2 acres. It's just too much. I was told not even to grocery shop alone for several months after surgery as pushing a heavy trolley and carrying bags of groceries is too much and puts my arm at risk. So depend on him to help with that too. Latest bloods are in and my neutrophils are now up to 2.2 so on track for chemo number 2 next Tues. Not looking forward to it but happy I'm able to stay on track. Can relate to everyone who is experiencing setbacks at the moment but know we can encourage and support each other through the hiccups. Keep smiling all. Hugs Donna.",

I had no real issues with pain as it was well attended to post op. I had 2 lots of Morphine in the recovery ward. I also had 2 Endone late Friday night which enabled me to get a couple of hours sleep. What a difference that made. I just couldn't imagine going home so soon after such a big surgery. My surgery was about lunchtime on a Friday and home the following Monday morning. So 3 nights. I did feel ready to go home by then. I was mobile very quickly. In recovery by 3.30pm. Back in my room by 4.30. By 5.30 I'd had a cup of tea, some soup and half a sandwich. I washed as well, though Hubby steadied me a little. By Saturday morning I could shower alone and was on a \"full\" diet. I did walk, move around a lot and saw a physiotherapist twice before I went home. The exercise routines were painful but I was diligent with them. My range of movement when I left hospital was 95%. I only had one drain and it was only in a week. Was so relieved when it came out. I slept sitting up the lounge the first 6 nights I was home. I just couldn't lay flat in bed. Oh and no bindings either. Is that for TE's? I'm going flat. Had my first chemo 2 days ago so now facing a whole new challenge. Why does every drink I try taste so salty? Know I have to drink, drink, drink. Did anyone else have this issue and could suggest a drink that may taste a little less bad? Love and light to all, Donna. ",

Lots of holding your arm up in awkward and uncomfortable positions. The scanning/mapping is done and they will mark your skin with a semi-permanent pen. Initially mine took close to an hour I think.

They wouldn't do it at the original appointment as she had taken anxiety meds before she had signed the consent forms. Overkill I know, but it can affect things. My biopsy immediately followed my diagnostic mammo and ultrasound so I had no time to anticipate and worry. I did find it to be a very easy and relatively pain free procedure. Just a small \"pinch\" when the needle went in. It goes numb very quickly. I did say in a jovial way, \"make sure you give me plenty of pain relief\" and they did. I also had a nurse holding my hand and I did look the other way. I didn't even have a bruise. Hope your biopsy goes smoothly and your results are all good news. Donna.",

My cancer was multi-focal (4 tumours) in my right breast so mastectomy was my only surgical option. I chose not to have reconstruction and I'm still happy with that decision. What type of reconstruction has your Mum decided on? My cancer was all Grade 1 and although low grade cancers don't respond as well to chemo I did have 4 rounds of Taxotere/Cytoxan. I didn't have an Oncotype DX test as it's not covered by Medicare here in Australia but make sure your Mum requests one. A low score will usually mean being able to skip chemo which was, for me, far worse than surgery. I had 1 positive node which also influenced my decision. I didn't have radiation. ILC is a sneaky cancer and tumours often turn out to be larger than they appear on imaging. Prior to surgery my largest tumour was thought to be 2cm but after surgery was measured at 4.2cm. Request copies of all pathology and test reports. You will gather information and learn more as you go. Once you have more info such as ER/PR and HER2 status and you have a plan in place it does get easier. Sending big hugs to your Mum. May I ask how old she is? Please feel free to private message me if you have any questions. Donna.",

Even after a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound the specialists at the breast clinic couldn't feel a palpable lump. Though they could see it on the imaging. Lobular cells form in \"sheets\" or spider web formations. They don't form a \"typical\" breast cancer lump meaning it is often remains undetected for a long time. Given that my cancer wasn't aggressive (Low Grade and HER2 Neg) and my Ki67 (cell proliferation rate) was low it's probably safe to say that my cancer had been growing for years. Of course my surgeon discussed my reconstruction options but for me, I wanted to come through the surgery as \"easily\" as possible. I wanted to be strong going into chemo and I didn't want multiple surgeries. My surgeon said, \"Remember it is not a breast. It will never be a breast with feeling and sensation\". He wasn't trying to dissuade me, just inform. As the nurse said it can be done later. It's a very personal decision and your Mum has to decide what is right for her. She has a tough time ahead but obviously she is blessed with an amazingly supportive family. She can do this. Thinking of you all. ",

Every person is different, every cancer is different. Some throw all they can at their cancer and still progress or recur. Others chose minimal treatment options and do very well. There are no definitive answers and statistics can be very general. Stay away from Google. HER2+ cancers are more aggressive and only you can decide what is right for you. There are so many other things to consider. Your age, your general health. Are you well otherwise? Yes chemo is horrible and I did feel like my body was a \"toxic waste dump\" for a time but many people tolerate chemo very well. I never feared that chemo was going to kill me and side effects can be very well managed. I was more frightened of not seeing my grandchildren grow up than I was of treatment but it is a very scary thing to go through. I live in Australia and I didn't have huge out of pocket expenses. We are fortunate to have universal health care here and most of my treatment was covered under Medicare. Cancer treatment is very expensive but no one should die because they can't afford it. There are funds, groups, grants and charities that can provide financial assistance. A Social Worker at your local hospital should be able to connect you with these resources. Have you discussed your concerns with your Dr or Breast Nurse? Wishing you peace with whatever decision you make but if it was me I would follow the Oncologist's advice. Hugs Donna.",
