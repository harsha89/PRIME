I think I'm going to struggle with that!

I felt totally rushed, I had already mentally psyched myself up for the 17th.  I slept on it and when that poor woman called me back the next day, after apologizing profusely, I agreed to the earlier date. Now I'm wishing I had done it last week, which is what they wanted, because I'd be a week along in the healing process lol. I don't know what your diagnosis is but I know how scary it is to be diagnosed with cancer having lost loved one.  I have watched both my grandfather's, a girlfriend, my best friends husband and my husband's friend all die of cancer, and never for a minute wondered if all this was worth it.  I believe it is and we are very fortunate to have the technology we do now and the treatments and knowledge that we do now to beat this.  I am Her2+ and if I am not mistaken this was at one point a very bad diagnosis to have, and from what my onc told me, this is now the type that responds fantastically to the treatments. Take one day at a time, I know it's hard because I have to reign myself in all the time, but just get yourself through the surgery and then put your mind to the next task and so on and so on. We are all wonderful that is true and that includes you!",

Hope everybody else is recovering easily.. and for those of you with surgeries coming up... The anticipation is worse than the actual event, I am so glad to get it over with and I exected to be way more uncomfortable than I am.  I have two drains and so far they are not a problem either.  So try to stay calm!!! Get the patch for nausea before surgery and if they offer you a block.. get it... I had not once ounce of pain in my first 24 hours and I didn't have to get myself groggy from pain meds. Nor did I need a breathing tube during surgery. Hugs to everybody.. we can do this!!!",

My place has  a comfy waiting room, there is always a puzzle going on or somebody to chat with.. I have met some wonderful people.  There is coffee you can brew and a fridge full of juices and water and a big basket of snacks. You'll see.. don't even waste one minute worrying about it.. but I'm sure you will anyways... best of luck to you tomorrow.. you'll be fine!!! Honest!",

I have no trouble at all in that area, only the slightest pink. Michele, laughing over the tossing in the air of the wig.   Lin, your hair must grow fast!! I'm 4 months out and it is still so short... it's getting thicker, but way too short :(  IamNancy, I won't go wigless either.. but as far as the slipping, I haven't had a problem when I wear a nylon cap over my hair. TMM60, hopefully the fatigue phase passes you by quickly... that to me was the worst SE of all. Melody that is awful what you overheard.. how dare they.. you would think people would have compassion, not make nasty comments.. I wish you had just whipped your wig onto their table. Heart, I am sorry you are having such issues, you seem to have had the worst time of this phase and I can only hope that you heal fast :( Iamnancy, just read about your extended treatment.. I am sick for you, to find out you had an additional week must have been devastating *hugs* I am so sad to hear about the pain and skin issues some of you have been dealing with, I can only hope that the healing is quick and this all becomes a bad memory. {{{{gentle hugs}}}}",

They gave me some medicated gauze like strips and I've just been using those under a form fitting camisole.

IamNancy, I asked my RO today if I could put deodorant on after treatment when I start on mornings next week and she hesitated and said no, that the area would be too sensitive.. I don't know what the heck I am going to do... I was sweating at work today and while I didn't smell anything.. I am still totally self concious about it and can't imagine 6 weeks of this... not to mention my clothes are going to stain I am sure.. sigh... I haven't tried the Crystal spray yet, I ordered it from Amazon, I also ordered EO organic spray.  Hubby uses the Crystal solid, but I don't like it at all.  Be careful with Tom's not all of them as natural as they suggest from the bit of reading I did on them. I read somewhere just plain baking soda made into a paste, but that sounds so unpleasant. Tinkerbellzcharm, welcome.. you'll get a lot of wonderful information here.  Congrats on finishing chemo!  I am not a candidate for recon at this time, so I don't have much input as I haven't thought about it much yet. Slv, thanks for the recommondation, Sephora usually had great products, but they are pricey.  2 hours is a long commute daily, I hope you can do an alternative treatment and make it easier on you. Heart, good news on the leg!!  Sounds like you're in good hands and I bet concentrating on the breathing will keep you occupied during the process.. it sounds interesting. Well ladies, enough for me today, I am going to get some rest... have a good evening :)",

I think the combination of months of treatment and the daily aspect of this helps fuel the fatigue to our poor battered bodies.  Good idea.. putting the shirts on will give you that little boost :) So glad you're feeling better Heart... 4 more days and we get 3 off :)  Clyday, that's why I have to have radiation even though I had a mastectomy.. because it was near the chest wall and I had the added bonus of lymph node involvement.  I can't comment on the reconstruction aspect, but you'll get lots of input here and in other boards. Sydneyluv, I don't know what I'd do without these forums.. they have been so helpful to me and it's so nice to chat with others that understand exactly what you are going through.  Thank you for explanation.. that is really fascinating, and how great that you'll be done so quickly. I hope it works out for you! I'm going to get my rest... glad everybody appears to be doing well so far!!",
