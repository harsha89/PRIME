I have been so fatigued, I found myself google searching for whether cancer itself can cause such exhaustion. I know that post-diagnosis the depression-like feelings caused some kind of tiredness, but it was definitely there before. I'm 32. I used to run 5 miles a day and weight train. Over the past year I've become all but useless. My diagnosis is almost the exact same as yours (IDC, ER/PR+, Her2-, grade 2) but my tumour is 5 cm. It makes sense to me that the body would be fatigued if it's trying to fight cancer, but I couldn't find any science backing this up. Thank you for posting this... you're definitely not the only one!",
