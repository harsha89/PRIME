      "Content": "PSinATL wrote: Hi all.  I'm happy that I found this site!  I'm a 44-year old mother of a 19-year old - and I've been going crazy with no one to talk to since an ultrasound-guided biopsy a couple of days ago.  I don't want to drive my husband crazy talking about all the what if's - but I just can't stop thinking about it. I also don't want to tell my parents until after the diagnosis (one way or the other), as they have already lost two children - one at birth to a heart defect and my older sister to ovarian cancer at age 30.  My first cousin is going through breast cancer treatments right now and I know they're worried about her - so I just can't bring myself to tell them yet. I've been searching for information in order to make me feel better - but it hasn't quite happened that way.  Some things make me feel worse (family history risk factors) but other things make me feel better (80% of biopsies are b9).  I am trying to stay busy, eat right, exercise etc. I may find out tomorrow (Friday) by phone, but I may have to wait until an appointment on Monday.  The waiting is agony - but waiting in silence is even worse!  I think this might help. I had no idea how difficult waiting could be.  So, one question for all of you out there - how long did it take to get the results back on a biopsy?  They've told me 72 hours +. Looking forward to hearing from all of you... Log in to post a reply",
