So I'm guessing this is common and is no big deal? Will I need to keep an eye out for more of these now? And/Or will or can these lead to bc? This thing came on pretty fast in my opinion. I'm talking probably about a month to a month 1/2.  How bizarre is that? One day you're going along and you've got an okay boob, the next day WHAMMO! A hard lump! This is all new to me. I really didn't think I'd have to worry about any of this until I get older; 40 seemed young-ish for this. But then again, I'd always heard to start getting the mammos about that time, so I guess there's a reason. Maybe Shirlann is right about the hormones...but my body is in SO much pain without them! It (my bod) does the weirdest things, to the point my PCP was going to send me to a rhuematologist. The estrogen made all those aches and pains and everything else go away. Think the lump was the trade-off?",

Not sure what it was called, but she used the ultrasound and sucked out some of the tissue. I felt pretty much zero pain - none from the needles or the vacuum thingy - but tonight i'm hurting a bit more than I thought I would. During the procedure she said that even though she pretty sure it's a sebacecious cyst, she's glad she's biposying because the \"shell(?)\" was really tough for the needle to get through (which apparently is odd for a cyst.)  She also said that the tissue she sucked out of there was more solid than liquid as a cyst would be. So all in all the cyst (if it is one) is pretty atypical. We did discuss the fact that I kept getting bazillions of cysts on my ovaries, to the point of hysterectomy. She thinks maybe this could be related in some weird way.  She was pretty up front and honest during the procedure saying something then saying \"I don't mean to scare you; I'm just giving you the information, and we won't really know anything until the results come back.\" I felt pretty calm during the whole thing. I was really just amazed to watch the entire thing on the ultrasound machine. I just wonder what the odds are of having anything. I started thinking about it the other day and realized that I forgot I had an aunt die of cancer (not bc) and I have a cousin with Hodgekin's. But I keep thinking - no bc in the family so I should be okay! That's a wrong assumption, huh?!",

I'm glad we did it. It was a long word called..\" and then she spouted off some word \"fibroadblahblahblah...\" She said it was a tumor but was benign. Basically like a skin growth nut under the skin - pretty much just growing breast tissue. So all is well. But now I wonder, is this it? Will I get more of these? How often? Will it raise my chances of getting bc? So many more questions! And by the way, I feel like crud today. I don't know why. I'm so nauseated. ugh!",

LOL anyone? anyone? bueller? Log in to post a reply",
