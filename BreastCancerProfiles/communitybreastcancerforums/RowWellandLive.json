    "Content": "RowWellandLive wrote: Well it's time for my annual mammogram and I am worried. In 2005 I had calcifications in my right breast. Had a biopsy and it was benign so all good. Then in 2010 I had more calcifications right in the same area. Again another biopsy and everything was fine. What concerns me is that one of the causes of calcifications is injury and isn't a biopsy causing injury? I am concerned that this is going to keep on happening every few years. Like a vicious cycle the test causes the symptoms. I brought this up to the radiologist and didn't get a straight answer. I don't think they know! Anyone else in the same boat?
