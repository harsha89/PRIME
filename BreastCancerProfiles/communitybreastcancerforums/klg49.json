Last night was a nightmare. I have been running fevers and I guess I got fever blisters on corners of mouth and within hours turned both lips into bleeding open sores. I got a tube of Herpecin L HL 30. Was intant relief.  Onc took me off of anything cold. He said to eat and drink everything warm. Dont like it but it did seem to help. Cant eat anything with rough texture at all. Lots of mac and cheese. Cant taste it but it feels good! I too was living on icecream, the only thing I can taste is chocolate! Guess I will move to brownies. I am still going to have my shakes thru a straw. Vitamin B6 will help with dry mouth. I take 2 per day, may have to take more this time around. When the dry mouth really kicks in my tongue gets sore and feels like im sucking on black pepper. I j'ust hope it does'nt get worse with each treatment. 2 more to go.",

I hear really good things about this stuf my stepmom has been taking it for the thinning and says it has been working wonderfully.  I just dont know how much to take. I will be having 35 rad treatments soon too. Is anyone taking the Biotin and having radiation?  My hair dresser wants me to start with the Nioxin treatments now that the chemo is finished. I used it before I lost my hair, I was thinning in the front a little and it seemed to help. I still have my eyebrows and the lashes got a little thin but still there. HeHe there is a little stubble on the legs. Cant wait to have to shave! Never thought I would EVER say that! lol",

My last treatment was June 30 2011. Muscle fatigue, bone pain in arms, legs, and almost all the joints. Neck and shoulders. They were going to put me Prozac for the pain. I finally yelled loud enough I was sent to a Rhumatologist. Low and behold I have a severe Vitamin D deffiency. Numbers should be around 50-100. I am at 12. I am taking 50,000mg once a week for a month. After the 2nd week I started to feel a big difference! I have been able to move my legs, get out of my desk at work without hanging on to things and feeling like I am 100 yrs old. Pain has really subsided. I have a cousin that has had Fibro for years and have watched her suffer from it. I was ready to accept the diagnosis but I was angry that the onco said it cant be from the chemo its been too long since the last treatment. Bull!!!! And why wasnt the Vit. levels the first thing they check especially when we complain about this kind of pain. I have been going to yoga 2 times a week thru the whole thing and I too kept thinking it will get better, exercise more, eat better, nothing was working. I take my 4th and last dose of the D tonight and the difference has been night and day!!! I am not back to normal yet but well on my way. I may have to go one more round and thats ok. Its working. I just wanted to let you ladies know in case you have not been checked. I wish you all the best and that you feel better!!!",
