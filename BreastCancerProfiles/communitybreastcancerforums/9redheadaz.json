Modified radical, meaning the pectoralis major muscle was spared though I can easily feel my ribs. I've had fibromyalgia for over 25 years, back when people said \"fibro what?\" so please do not be fearful that your pain will last as long as mine. I'm also a redhead and we are mutants when it comes to pain. I choose not to reconstruct at that time but I have this little pooch of skin next to my breastbone. My internist said it was probably in case I wished to reconstruct later. I have PMPS including nerve pain. When I bend over more then a few times it's very painful. I noticed a few days ago that when bending over, the skin now seems to pull away from my chest wall from gravity and from that little pouch of skin. I only wear a bra when out due to the PMPS but think I will wrap my left chest in an Ace bandage if I'm actively moving around, chores, grocery stuff. Sort of like a home version of a breast binder. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this? Oh forgot to mention that I take tramadol 100 mg a.m. and p.m as well as Roboxin 750.",

What I have here is about 4 inches wide, I need something wider and also that's not scratchy against my skin. I watched a video early today but dang it I was in incognito mode in Chrome and can't find it. It was a special wide wrap that was soft and non-irritating on one side. Anyone know the name or maker of such bandages? I don't want a mastectomy garment as I still have my right breast. I've googled forever. Marianne",

It gets in the way and the ace rolls up. However I did have a few hours of it working doing kitchen cleaning after lugging in groceries. Today I pay. The weirdest thing happened about 30 minutes ago. I mention how it feels like my skin is pulling away when bending. I bent over and felt that happen almost up to my collarbone, then the little guy with the grill brush started stabbing me where he usually does and way up to my collarbone. This was a first. I'm not sure what kind of physician to see about this.I had a terrible time breathing because of the pain. It's hard for me to post things like this, I feel like I'm complaining. But I know sharing such things is important. Like you I have a dislike of taking meds, I take tramadol and levoxin for pain, and a few other required meds. I have a hard time taking gabepentin because I had a bad experience with it when my at that time idiot oncologist prescribed it to offset the affects of the third oral estrogen blocking drug. But lets try, both of us to get past that resistance.",
