But she sent me down to a specialist at our Breast Cancer center in town just in case. There, they told me after an ultrasound that it wasn't a cyst, but that it's a fibroadenoma. So the radiologist told both my mother and I that I could either do the needle biopsy and just make sure that it is not cancerous, have surgery to get it completely removed, or to just leave it be. She told us it is extremely rare that any cancer will grow out of it.  So now I'm pretty sure we're going to do the surgery to have it removed. But, I guess since I've never had any sort of surgery before, I'm just nervous and a little scared. Has anyone else had a fibroadenoma removed? Were there any complications, like a lot of pain? I'm kind of worried because I'm so young, that I don't want it to grow any more and to get to be an even bigger discomfort and to just get it out of my mind. But I'm also not sure if it would cause problems down the road, like if it will make it so that it'll be hard or I can't lactate from that breast when I decide to have children. Or anything else, really. Really, I guess I'm just nervous because I've never had surgery and just wanted to see how maybe some other people's surgeries have gone. At least so I can get a little bit of a better feel of what's going to happen this summer. There really isn't a whole lot out there when I try to search about fibroadenoma removal surgery... Any type of input would be wonderful to help give my mind some ease. Thank you :)  Log in to post a reply",
