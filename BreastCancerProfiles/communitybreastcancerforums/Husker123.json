I bet they flushed it 10 times before it worked right. They said it's not uncommon. I drank about 60 ounces of ice tea & water while I was getting the infusion. I feel alot better right now. I'll take my Zofran in a bit & probably hit the sack.  My MO & nurse navigator decided I have a really nice shaped head. Hubby thought maybe I should just keep the bald look going.  I think that is NOT going to happen! Hoping for minimal SE's for all!",

I took him outside & used a sponge to lather him up & rinsed him off with the garden hose. It really got rid of the smell!   Had my visit with the MO today. All my blood levels were good. (knock on wood) Tired seems to be my major SE from the 2nd infusion. Nothing sounds good for food.  But compared to a lot of ladies here, I have nothing to complain about! Wishing everyone minimal SE's!",

I had it some from the first go around but it went away.  This seems to be hanging around.  My MO said it should go away after I'm all done.  #3 next Thursday for me too. Yay for Lynnbea for being done!!!!  Hope the hair grows soon Slak!",

They opened another room where I go. It's only 4 chairs but each one has it's own tv. It's much quieter there. I hope I get to go back down there for my last treatment on July 5. They even wrote on my appt. card LAST CHEMO! My friend & I went to lunch afterward. It must not have set well with me. I was feeling a little queasy when I got home. The nausea meds. got that stopped but then had to go for a short ride on the D-train. That seems to have quit so I'm really thinking it was lunch. Thanks for the advice on the fingers. I will keep moisturiser on them & my feet. I have my Dad & brother & their lady friends coming to visit today. Guess they will understand when I kick them out so I can go get my Neulasta shot! I guess since I'm up, I should go clean house & try to make it looks somewhat presentable. Good luck to all in the BGC today!",
