I just joined.   I am stage 1A.  51 years old.  No immedite family history of BC. only distant aunt and cousin. Had 2 sugeries in April ( 4thdand 18th), lumpectomy removed the tiny tumor, 0.7/  IT's a grade 2.  Nothing showed in the nodes on the Sentianl Node biop. mY surgeon did have to clean up a 'slight' margin on the 2nd surgery. It was DEEP in the left breast, against the chest wall. Surgeon felt good about getting it all out.  only 3-d mammogram found it.  My MO had a oncotype test done, the score came back 29, in the 19% chance of recurrance..  Frustrating to be in the middle range.  she is recommendign the TC Chemothrerapy for  6 cycles. I dont; know if i should.  A 2nd opinion from different MO showed me \"Learning information tools' on  the Oncotype and it showed that the size, grade , age and using Aromatasr inhib. would lower % to 9.   All of it is driving me crazy having to choose. anyone else in this position??",
