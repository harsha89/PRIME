I just finished my chemo yesterday (12/19) - 4 rounds of AC followed by 12 weeks of Taxol.  My sim is 12/30 and I start my rads 1/6 like many others here. I appreciate the opportunity to learn from others and share experiences, knowing that everybody is different. Friends who have gone thru this previously themselves tell me that it should be a \"walk in the park\" compared to chemo. Some folks say that the fatigue is minimal while my nurse coordinator said to expect even more fatigue. We'll see.  I won't know my schedule for rads until my sim appt., but I'm thinking that I may just work remotely to avoid the commute time for the 6.5 weeks, depending on the time selected. I wish each of you well as the journey continues and remember that each visit gets us one step closer to being done! As I tried to maintain a positive attitude (positude) during chemo, remember that there are good days and better days! Happy holidays!",

My RO mentioned using photon for the last 5 boosts. Anybody know anything about this? I will start researching as I thought I'd have my weekly meeting with him yesterday to discuss further, but he told the nurse that he'd already \"seen\" me so we didn't Need to meet. I can always ask to see him this week for details on it too...just wanted to check with you ladies in the meantime. Wishing you all well and minimal side effects. BethF7, my eyelashes and eyebrows are coming in now as well. I have one eyelash that I call \"the unicorn\" since it's in the middle and never fell out....it's sooo much longer than the new ones. I wish the hair on my head was growing faster tho...it just takes time, I know, but patience is not one of my virtues. Lol ",

What is being done to avoid the heart (since it's left side) and he said they have it blocked. Hmmmmm...not convinced. Everybody stay warm.",

They had originally told me on the Monday that I'd get my times then, but it moved to Friday...and I got something over the lunch hour, as requested. I will work thru treatments as I did with chemo...and because the commute is a pain I will just plan to work remotely for the duration. I'm very fortunate to have an understanding supervisor. Good luck to everyone and here's hoping minimal SEs for all!",

I think my MO wanted me to wait about 4 weeks before starting, but I had already met with my RO and had the sim appt scheduled for 12/30...trying to take the lead and get this over and done with.  My MO said to wait 3-6 mos. before having the port removed, so I will hit her up on my next appt in early March to get this scheduled with BS.  My hair is not growing any too quickly IMHO, so I'm taking biotin (2/day) as well as using Nioxin (system 2 products). It is growing, but I was hoping that I could go without the wig when I return to the office following rads (I plan to work from home in the meantime) but doesn't seem like this idea of no wig is realistic at this point. I worked straight thru chemo, so am hoping the fatigue is not bad...but I guess we'll see as things unfold. I'll report back after my sim appt on Monday. Wishing everyone a happy new year! Out with the old and in with the new...bring on 2014 and let's make it OUR year!",

From what I was told, system 1 was early stages of thinning whereas system 2 was noticeably thinning, which seems to be my obvious situation that I'm trying to reverse. It does seem to be working ...just not at my desired pace (along with the biotin...I take 5000mg/day as my MO said it was ok since she felt I should have had more hair growth once taxol was underway). Smrlvr, I think my MO waits 3-6 mos. before removing the port, just to be safe. I have to say tho...I am rather ticked off because she told me that since I am \"only\" stage 1 I cannot get any scans. From what I understand, since I did not experience any \"issues\" to warrant the need for any scans, none can be approved. Guess it comes down to what the fed. Gov. Deems is a worthy expense now. Anybody in a similar situation? After all of this, you would think that scans would be covered, so you would know that the chemo and rads worked instead of a wait and see attitude. Sure, now let's be reactive instead of proactive. Aaargh.  If anybody else is stage 1 and will be getting any scans after your treatment is done, please advise so I can research further. I was told by staff in my dr's office that things will only be getting worse with obamacare.",
