However, it would be nearly impossible for them to puncture your muscle becuase of the way the breast is structured. The compression used to hold you in place during the biopsy also \"pulls\" the breast tissue away from the muscle. The dimpling you describe though does need to be addressed. I always encourage our patients to contact us if they have any concerns. Give the center a call and let them know what you are seeing - they should bring you back in to examine you.",

If you have lymphatic or vascular invasion, it should be clearly stated in the impression or body of the pathology report. The letters you are seeing (without seeing your report) may actually be the initials of the pathologist and the person who transcribed the report, or who prepared the tissue for them to review. Looks like that format would make sense based on the reports I've seen come to our facility.",
