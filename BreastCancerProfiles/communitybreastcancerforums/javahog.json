JavaMom has IDC, not sure of the stage or grade, but she was treated for mastitis for months before anyone figured it out. Bone scan clean, no mets on scans, positive in nodes that were biopsied. She started chemo last Wednesday, ACT X8 every 2 weeks, and has been largely SE free...so far. but one thing is, she is having to go in to the hospital every day for Neupogen injections. I don't see that anyone else is doing this? Since she lives 40 miles from the hospital, the gas alone will destroy her budget, and soon she will likely not be feeling too good to do this nutty daily drive. Anyone know anything about this? do these shots go on forever? can she inject herself with these? tia. Good luck to you all! It is s helpful to hear your stories and especially the hair updates! Every time something has come up, I have been able to scroll and find some reassurance for her... Lisa ",

I guess since she is on dose-dense, every 2 weeks, they automatically started the shots, and will draw blood next week to check WBC. I am hoping the drive will stop then, she is very tired.  She will also ask about self-administering tomorrow. There's probably a link to this elsewhere, but I did learn that the ACS has a volunteer  transportation program. Here's the link if anyone needs it (its Florida, but it takes you to your local office:  http://www.cancer.org/docroot/COM/content/div_FL/COM_5_1x_Lifeline_Transportation_Program.asp",

The Neupogen pain has been pretty bad, but the nurse says, good, that means its working for sure. Mouth sores on day 10. Other than that, no SE's other than a surface thrombosis (blood clot) They made her come into the ER for an U/S, but are now not concerned since it was surface. Treatment #2 is tomorrow. She can already tell there is an effect from treatment #1: no more swelling on lymph nodes and her breast is down to \"normal\".  Good luck and all the best to you all. It will all be worth it! I'm sure sorry so many have had to go to the hospital, and certainly being mistreated (Day!). That's so frustrating! Javahog ",
