Waiting for results from tests is so very difficult for it is only natural to think the results may not be good. Time seems to go so slowly when we are \"waiting\" and it seems the phone is never going to ring. Men - even loving husbands - have a difficult time understanding how we feel and as a result of not understanding, have an even more difficult time of providing the comfort we need. Sometimes, I have found it a good idea to say specifically what it is I need my husband to do to make me feel comforted and safe.  I am thinking about you and hope to hear very soon that you have received a great report with nothing wrong!",

It is indeed a far better test to determine much about the health or lack thereof of our breasts. Getting my MRI was not easy. My husband accomplished this for me. He simply said to the BS, \"If you order this MRI for my wife, we will do you a very great favor - my wife will never bother you again with any request of any type for she will be seeing a BS who is her advocate, not her enemy.\"  This particular BS is no longer my doc, but he DID order the MRI. Perhaps he ordered it \"get rid of me\" for I did ask a lot of questions, wanted explainations, felt I had a right to actually have a written copy of my reports (all of them) since I can also read, and most likely took more of his time than he cared to spend with a patient, I have a wonderful BS now who had difficulty understanding exactly why MRI's had not been ordered a long time ago because of my very high risk factor and my family history and personal breast history. You have to fight for this, but it is worth the fight! I agree with others who have responded - Mammy, US, MRI, and CBE are essential if you are at all considered high risk. I personally think they are all needed regardless of your risk level for each one detects things the others do not detect. This should be the standard of care for all women and we should all fight for this for our sisters.",

While you most likely have nothing of great significance at this point in time, this is the best time to become a new patient for the doc can get to know what is \"normal\" for you. This is critical for she/he would then be able to recognize if something abnormal appears and would also know your personal history and would make sure you have all the necessary screenings in a timely fashion.",

Walking helps and drinking a lot of water is also helpful! Hope you feel better soon. Great news on the outcome!",
