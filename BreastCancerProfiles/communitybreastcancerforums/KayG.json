      "Content": "KayG wrote: Hi all - I've been lurking for a few days, but it is time to chime in because I am making myself a little crazy. Background: My mom and her mom both had BC in their 40s. In fact, i am 46, the exact same age my mom was when she was diagnosed. The doctors watch me carefully - mammos yearly, w. ultrasound and there are always a couple of big cysts they asipirate (but Â that always grow back). I went for an MRI two weeks ago because it is time to watch me even more carefully, and the MRI came back with BIRADS 4 spots in both breasts, an 11mm growth in the right and a 6mm one in the left, so I am scheduled for an MRI biopsy tomorrow. Has anyone ever had an MRI biopsy? What should I expect? Also, assuming this comes back B9, both my OB GYN and my surgeon say its a good idea to think about a preventative mastectomy. I am seriously considering it. My mother has been tested and does not have the BRACA gene, but there is clearly a genetic link. Does that seem extreme or smart? Log in to post a reply",
