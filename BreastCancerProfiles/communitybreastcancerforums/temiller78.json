      "Content": "temiller78 wrote: Hi there, I am going tomorrow to get the biopsy done and I am nervous. I found a lump 2 weeks ago and went to the doctor last week and had a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound done on Monday. They did the mammo and then brought me into ultrasound and then the radiologist came in and imaged me for awhile and told me I needed a biopsy. I have two masses that are right on top of each other. They are only doing a biopsy of the top one and said that they both look similar. I'm a little freaked out and think they should biopsy both because what if the bottom one is an issue? She mentioned if the biopsy was ok, I would have to come back in 3 and 6 months to check on bottom mass to see if it has changed. I'm not sure what to think. I'm 38 and have a 9 year old boy (single mom) and I am really terrified. Log in to post a reply",

It was not too terrible and I have had no bleeding issues w incision site. The radiologist was learning towards fibroadenoma. The masses were not there 2 yrs ago and I'm in my late 30's. I know thise types of masses are prone to younger women so that makes me nervous. I should hear something by Tuesday.",
