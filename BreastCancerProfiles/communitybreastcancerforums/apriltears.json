Is it normal for a lymph node in the breast to be swollen for 2 1/2 months? 2. Can a radiologist say for certain from a screening mammo and (questionable) us pictures that a density is just a swollen lymph node and that it is benign?  3. Should a biopsy of the lymph node be demanded? There is no breast surgeon involved just a gp.  In Ontario, Canada you need a referral.",
