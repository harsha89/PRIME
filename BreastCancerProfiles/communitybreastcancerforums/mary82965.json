I had stage three with four nodes. I went through chemo first and had prominent chemo changes in my pathology report. the four nodes were left with just traces of cancer and I am estrogen and progesterone positive her2- .... I had bilateral mastectomies and radiation that finished St. Patty's day - but the doc noticed a little bit of change (a few weeks ago - about a month out of rads) on my scar line - and told me it was most likely fat neucrosis - but I am freaking out. I am going in for another measurement 28 days from the first because I receive my zoladex shot that day. Has anybody experienced this? The thing I keep telling myself is \"it is way too soon after being lambasted with chemo/surgery and rads for it to be anything too serious. However, I can't help but be in panic mode... :( ",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2015 07:39PM - edited Jan 17, 2015 08:09PM by mary82965 Hi Everyone - I am new here. I have been reading the posts on and off for the past several months. I was diagnosed back in late June and had 6 rounds of chemo (Taxotere and cytoxan) before my surgery. I opted for the bilateral mastectomies and was diagnosed with estrogen and progesterone postive her2 negative from my initial biopsy and then again during the mammoprint. I had surgery on Jan 7th and got my path report back yesterday and my her2 was inconclusive on the report. I am absolutely freaking out at this point. Has anybody ever heard of that test giving false or inconclusive results? They are redoing the test now and my oncologist said that I had a 70 percent chance that it was just a false reading but if it is positive now I will have to have herceptin for a year. I am just so heartsick right now because I thought the only thing I had to go was the radiation and the tamoxifin. I also found out that I had not one but four nodes involved but that the chemo pretty much wiped out three of the four. I feel like I have been kicked in the stomach and I don't even know the results yet. Has anybody had herceptin? And how did they do with it? I hate cancer - I hate what it has done to all of us- and I will never let anybody take this journey on their own.",
