      "Content": "KristenSp wrote: hello, I am in shock that I am in this situation. 8 found a lump on my left breast on Sunday. It hurt a lot on Sunday and Monday. It is in the upper right quadrant of my left breast. Had an ultrasound and a mammogram on Tuesday. Both were abnormal and I was given a BIRAD score of 5. I am waiting right now to get a repeat ultrasound because she wants better pics of my lymph nodes. They were slightly enlarged but she said that enlarged lymph nodes don't necessarily mean it has spread. She said she needs better pics to see if the outer ridge of the lymph nodes have thickened. If it is thickened, that can be a good indicator that it is also effecting the lymph nodes. If not, good chance it has not. I am terrified and freaking out. When did you find your lump and where was it.? Did you get a B-RAD score? Did your lump hurt at all? Mine really hurt on Sunday and Monday but now it is just tender. I have a biopsy scheduled for Tuesday morning and should have the results back no later than Friday. I'm so scared Log in to post a reply",

Treatment will most likely be a lumpectomy with radiation and maybe chemo or a mastectomy with chemo. The chemo portion depends on tumor marker tests which are not back yet and if it has or has not moved to my lymph nodes. My lymph nodes looked good on ultrasound but they will biopsy them during surgery to make sure. I have 4 kids, 11,8,5 and 3 and have not told them yet. I plan to wait until I have all the info and a better idea of what type of treatment I will have. Log in to post a reply",
