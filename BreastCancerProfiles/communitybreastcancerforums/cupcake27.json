I am thinking just a cyst as well because there really is not any pain nor any change in the appearance of my breast. My doctor said that after I had the mammo and US that they would let me know then if they see anything suspicious and also send her the results as well. I read on here that the chances of this being anything other than benign is very slim, and I like those chances! :)Â ",

Friday the 18th, right before turkey day, I found a lump in my right breast on the far side near my arm pit. I called my dr. on Monday and they got me right in and am scheduled for a mammo and US on the Thursday the first. Of course my doctor told me not to worry, which I am doing my best not to because I know no matter the outcome God has my back! But...still in the back of my mind...I think about it. I have a wonderful supportive husband and two kids, daughter is 10 and son is 15. The lump is slightly tender and does not move and my dr added to the paper for the mammo that I have thickening as well, though I am not sure what that is. A cupcake a day wont keep the doctor away...but...makes me...smile! Log in to post a reply",
