Onc. -- Radioplex (I think that's the name).  Anyone else using a prescription lotion?  I plan to buy some 100% aloe vera just in case I need it later in the process.  I have been using plain cornstarch for deodorant and it seems to be working OK.  What is everyone else using? Good night!  I'm going to bed now (9:40pm central time).",

My doctor told me since my breasts are small, I shouldn't have as many problems as women with larger breasts.  I have also read that if you have more \"folds and creases\" (as in underneath larger breasts), you have more issues too. ",
