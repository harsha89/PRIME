My family kids and Dad and brothers all live in Michigan and I live in ga so we can just talk on phone but believe me it helps that they know. My doctor imsaid she is pretty positive I have breast cancer but I am lucky it\u2019s early stages but still very scary , so if I could give you any advice it would be to talk to your family their support makes all the difference in the world, I am much more calm and much more positive, but I know after my biopsy I will probably be eating my words since I have to wait a week to get results, but I do not regret telling my family they truly keep me sain through this. I will say a prayer for you and keep us posted on how things are going this is a great place for advice and to vent god knows this sight has helped me so much I can\u2019t say, hugs to yo",

Well I am going in Monday 27th for the biopsy and Dec 4th for results, doctor said we won\u2019t know course of treatment until we know type we\u2019re dealing with, so back to the waiting , but on the good side dr said it hasn\u2019t progressed that my lymph nodes are good so this is totally treatable. I finally told my dad and it was a little hard but it went good and he went and seen my girls to give them the news so far and my oldest did great had lots of questions but was amazing and my youngest went right to the dying thing and I knew she would after all she has lost 3 grandmas to cancer and all 3 by the time they knew it was stage 4 so it took my dad a little longer to help her understand, but it\u2019s all good and man I feel such a relief that secret was extremely tough on me , now I can prepare for Monday and the waiting for December 4th for final results. Well I\u2019m off to get ready for work but I just want to thank everyone for your support and I am sending a prayer out to each and everyone for some good news and a happy Thanks",

I have been doing so much research as if I have cancer for sure I want to jump on it with both barrels loaded so I would like to know as much as possible so if the diagnosis is what my dr thinks I would like to know what I want to do at that moment so I have been reading and reading peoples comments on lumpectomy and reviews of people who chose mastectomy and I am actually torn in the middle. I am small chested so I will probably be deformed on my left after a lumpectomy and I\u2019m not too keen on 5 days a week for weeks of radiation and the horror stories and then the mastectomy the months and months of reconstruction, I have no problem with a mastectomy but can\u2019t you just have complete restruction the same day? I know some people will think I\u2019m crazy cause I don\u2019t know yet but I want to have my research done so I can tell my doctor what I want as soon as she tells me I have it so I\u2019m able to jump on this ASAP, and if it turns out B9 I will surly do a huge happy dance but no matter what I want to be ready for Monday if anyone has advice of what you did and if you like your choice if not why? I know this I see my choice and it\u2019s personal just curious on what some went through and if you could go back would you make the same choice? Thank you to those in avanc",

I knew she was worried about me I could tell but her knowing my mammogram and ultrasound didn't get good results she wanted to check on me and I'm great full she is so concerned with her patients but then again it makes this waiting and wondering even harder for me. I try so hard to be strong and I do really good when ever I'm around anyone but when I'm alone my mind races and the tears roll this is just pure torture. I am a fighter and I can and will fight no matter what the results are but can't fight what I don't know so just hope Monday they set up the biopsy really soon so I know what I'm fighting or not fighting .i have been praying so much . Well need to try and get some sleep 3:30 am comes early, good night ladies",
