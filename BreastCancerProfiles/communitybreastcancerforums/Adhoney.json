The Herceptin & Perjeta block estrogen & progesterone so it\u2019s extra intense for a few days post- chemo. Before I was diagnosed with breast cancer I had already gone through early menopause at age 41 & FINALLY had control over the hot flashes with an estrogen patch & topical progesterone/testosterone cream. Now at age 46, I\u2019m back trying to manage menopause symptoms & get some sleep. My GYN started me on Lexapro 10mg, which may be helping some, but I think it\u2019s time to try 20mg.

I do 6 rounds of TCHP, then a full year of just the HP. plan for surgery 2-3 weeks after TCHP is done, which will probably be a mastectomy, then radiation. I have no idea about how many radiation treatments, i\u2019m just trying to tackle the chemo for now. I\u2019m also very glad to find this forum where we can share our experiences with each other, which I find very helpful. Good luck to y\u2019all",

Fatigue is my biggest problem and also waking up all throughout the night. I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019ll start sleeping better soon, at least after round 1 the sleepless nights improved in a few days. I hope everyone is getting along alright this weekend. I\u2019ve had my 16 year old driving me around some today, gives me a break and I\u2019m just so tired. Prayers for everyone to kick cancer in the butt. We can do this ",

I haven\u2019t noticed any neuropathy symptoms, but for good measure I heard that vitamin b6 50mg twice a day & vitamin b12 500 mcg a day would decrease the risk of the neuropathy.....we\u2019ll see. My biggest side effects from all these meds is severe fatigue, lots of hot flashes (I was postmenopausal before & LOVED my hormones, but had to stop them), insomnia, taste changes (from carboplatin), constipation for about a week then diarrhea for about 7-10 days. I\u2019ll try mixing juice in my water, that sounds really good. Best wishes to you Kamboka, keep us posted on what you decide about taxol vs Taxotere ",

I have an appointment with my Breast surgeon in a week, I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll do an ultrasound to check out my lump. Im also doing neoadjuvant chemo & i can tell that it\u2019s smaller & softer after 3rounds of TCHP. I go see the plastic surgeon on Thursday to discuss reconstruction. This is such unfamiliar territory.....I work in healthcare but this world is foreign! I\u2019m taking a coworker that had breast cancer & reconstruction herself with me so I\u2019ll know what questions to ask. Side effects from last weeks chemo are still hanging around: funky taste buds, diarrhea, sore nose\u2014but not raw & scabby thanks to Aquaphor! Fatigue is getting a little better each day, thank you Jesus. Hoping next week is a lot better. I hope everyone enjoys their weekend with as few side effects as possible. ~Angi",

GratefulGrandma: excellent news that your tumor has shrank so much! It's good to know that going through chemo is really helping, although that doesn't make the whole process any easier, maybe a little more tolerable though. I couldn't agree more about getting back to normal. I just wanna get through this shitshow & get back to feeling good, have some energy, taste food normally!!! Sheila77: I hope your numbers cooperated and you're able to get that last infusion today. And ring that bell!!! Thinking of you today. Well, I've had multiple appointments since I last posted here. I saw the PS last week to talk about reconstruction options. I've decided to go with the DIEP free flap. Looks like surgery will be sometime around the end of July hopefully. The surgery involves 3 surgeons- plastics, ortho hand surgeon assists with the micro vascular parts of surgery & the breast surgeon, so I know getting all of their schedules coordinated will be like herding cats! Also have to get a CT scan of the abdomen first to make sure the vessels involved in the abdominal surgery part are in the appropriate places. Happy to get a tummy tuck in the process of reconstructing my boob too\u2014winning! Also saw my breast surgeon on Monday & she did an ultrasound of my tumor. It's gone from 2.3 cm down to less than 1 cm...yay! Glad to know that the chemo is doing something, because it's sure tough going through it. My hardest symptoms are severe fatigue, sore nose\u2014Aquaphor rubbed inside the nose twice a day is a lifesaver! Thank you to whoever shared that tip with me! My taste buds get all screwed up for a while, but unfortunately, that doesn't stop me from eating. Upset stomach\u2014thanks to Herceptin & Perjeta. Ugh.... Did I mention the fatigue? That one is really tough & so hard for me. I'm apainfully independent, move quickly at work, get 'er done kinda person & not being able to do those things just kills me. I had my 4th out of 6 TCHP treatments yesterday, so today I'm just trying to chill, gonna read more of this cool book I heard about & that's probably it. I'm so glad my kids are still in school so I have the house to myself. Wishing everyone a peaceful remainder of the week with few SE's. Celebrate the small victories. We got this & I know God is on my side. I put my faith in Him because I sure can't do this alone. Angie ",
