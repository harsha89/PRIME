Did your doctor say anything how to get rid of the lumps and vein hardening after? Does massaging the arm help? Sherbab: I'm ok with the scars as long as I can get away from having the port. A woman I met during my PT last Friday told me that hers is very uncomfortable specially along her neck when she sleeps and positions her head either right or left. And I am scared of needles and I was told the needle for the port is thicker and curved. As it is, I am having a hard time facing my fear of the needle every time I go in for blood drawing and chemo. Guess in what state I'm in right now for tomorrow's appointment and worrying too about this vein.",

      "Content": "MyraVH wrote: The NP at my oncologist said it's Chemo vein when I texted her a picture of my right arm (where I get infusion) and was told to apply Neosporin / Hydrocortisone cream 1:1 ratio 3x/day and see if that helps and if not, then she will prescribe me with something else. It started just getting itchy 2 weeks ago and I tried my best not tot scratch the itch and applied Aveeno anti-itch lotion. By Saturday 11/30, the skin started getting red along the vein from needle site up to mid-arm. My last infusion was 11/18/13 and I felt the painful jab of the IV needle and it felt like nurse had a hard time inserting the needle in. The vein didn't hurt at all during, after and even now. Now it looks dark red dry skin along the vein since I've been applying the ointments since 12/4. Tomorrow is my 3rd chemo ( only 1 left after tomorrow) and I'm scared it's going to be painful again even if they use a different vein. I'm praying that they will not recommend a port. Anyone experiencing / had the same thing?
