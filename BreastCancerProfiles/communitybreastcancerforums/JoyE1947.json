I have had no surgeries. None were mentioned for my liver I think because of the amount of lesions and how sick I was.  It might be considered later, I don't know.",

It is very expensive, you would have to check if her insurance covers it.  It worked wonders for me - I was on it for several weeks.  Finally when I could take in enough calories on my own it was discontinued.  I feel just great now!  If you need more info let me know or send me a provate message.
