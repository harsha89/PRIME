I am 31 years old.  I was found to have precancerous cells on my cervix in 2004 and after repeated abnormal paps, I underwent a LEEP procedure in 2005.  After the LEEP i had one slightly abnormal pap, but Dr said it wasn't anything to worry about.  I had my first child in 2007 and have had normal paps ever since. (Second and final child in 2010, and IUD Mirena put in).   In January 2012 my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma. It was diagnosed in the skin, but they said it started in the lungs.  She passed away in April of that same year.  She was 54 years old. Ever since then I have been worried that a similar scenario will happen to me, but i am terrified to go to a Dr and have any kinds of tests done.  My husband assures me that it is my grief causing my fears and that I am just worrying for nothing. However, a little over a year ago, I started getting a lump under my left armpit every couple months.  I called it a swollen gland, but really i have no idea.  The first few times i had it, it was just the lump, no pain with it.  Now, the last 3 or 4 times it has appeared, it is very painful and stays for a longer period of time.  A week or longer, compared to a few days when it first started.  I haven't had a regular period since I had the IUD put in, so i can't say for sure if the lump correlates with my period or not. On the same side, just under the edge of my breast, where the end of the underwire in my bra would sit, I also have a sore spot, but it too is not always there.  I'm not sure how long ago this started but at times it is painful and I can't wear a bra at all.  There is also a spot that looks like a bruise, about the size of a eraser on the end of a pencil, on my skin right where the pain is, and this bruise-like spot is indented in the center. About 6 months ago, I went to a walk-in urgent care center for the lump under my armpit and the Dr there told me to switch deodorants to an aluminum free brand and that it was just hormonal.  I switched, the lump stayed for about 2 weeks, was very painful, so much at times that it kept me awake at night.  It came again 3 1/2 months later.  I never seem to have either lump, only the little bruise, when i go for my annual. I'm just wondering if these are cause for concern, reason to push for Dr appts, etc.   Thank you for any advice or help you can give me Log in to post a reply",
