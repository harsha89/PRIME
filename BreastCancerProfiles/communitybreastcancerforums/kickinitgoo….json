JeriGrace, i found lots of info by trolling old TC threads, too... but i'm still thinking of starting a new thread (\"TC Starting July 2013\") for those of us going thru same type of chemo at the same time so we can share our experiences... stay tuned. i'm staying up late nearly every night these days... reading everything i can so i know what to expect (and how to prepare!). good luck, friends!",

Here's my blog address if interested (anyone): kickinitgood.blogspot.com. My husband set it up for me... Need to create a gmail email address and you're ready to go. Though I know it's true that everyone is different, so much of what I've read here combined with dr's info has proved spot on to my experience thus far. On tc? Hair starts to fall out on day 14 ( starts with the pubic hair, next day the head). Getting neulasta booster? Take Claritin day of chemo, then for next 5 days... I had some bone/joint pain in several areas around day 5-6, but it left as quickly as it arrived. Yes, dex will make you sleepless... Take the pm dose pill before 5:00. i forgot and took it at 7:00 tonight... That's why I'm still up! The worst of the nausea is over after day 5. moderate constipation lasted a couple days longer no matter how much water and fiber I took in and colace I swallowed. the fuzzy mouth bit responded well to baking soda salt water mix. The fatigue starts to creep in at end of day 2, then wham... Days 3,4,5 were kinda tough... I napped a lot during the day and then couldn't sleep at night (even lorazapam didn't help... Like its not helping tonight either!) I walked, even if just for 15-20 mins each day. i developed too high temps days 5-6 and ended up in ER 2nd night when it got to 101.3.... My WBC was down to 60 so it was acceptable so they sent me home. Next day I was nearly normal in all respects... So weird. The past two weeks I've felt great (except for the fact I lost my hair and suddenly have gained 5 lbs thanks to the dex, I think). Now tomorrow I get back on the ride for round 2. Write down everything you're experiencing... what meds and otc stuff youre taking, what food and drink you're consuming, how you feel physically and emotionally... Keeping a journal is a wee symbol of control... Even so, keep in mind anything can happen, expected or unexpected, good or bad... just keep your head down and plow your way through it. Today I re-read my entries so ill be prepared for my pre infusion chat with the onc/ nurse practice in the morning. And your chemo nurse... talk to her, ask any question... they're gold. Keep a positive attitude and you'll kick this right along with me, I'm sure of it. Go get 'em tomorrow at round one!",

      "Content": "Jun 26, 2013 11:02PM - edited Jun 27, 2013 05:03PM by kickinitgood I am a lot like you, JeriGrace. I start 4 cycles of TC chemo next week. Then 6 weeks radiation. Then hormone treatment (which one is TBD). I was in the \"grey\" area, too, with an oncotype score of 17 and my tumor was grade 3. My gut told me I was destined for chemo all along, but I was holding out for a low oncotype score to blow that gut feeling away... and I could see how much my MO didn't want to give me the recommendation he did. But I trust his judgement and my BS concurred with his recommendation, as did a family member who's a physician... so I'm going with it and moving forward. I am brand new to posting on these boards and would like to find a thread for TC chemo folks... do you know if there is one? If not, I think I will start one. Good luck to us all starting in July... regardless of the type... strength and determination will carry us through this!",

I am going in for round two tomorrow. Hair started falling out as predicted on day 14... Got it buzzed on day 18... This has been the most emotional bit for me. The mild-moderate assortment of side effects on days 3, 4 and 5 after round one - then 2 days of high temps landing me in the ER late on a Saturday night - were really easy compared to the hair loss. Wonder if I'll experience anything worse. Is it true that what you experience in your first round is good indicator of what you'll experience each round? I've been doing a blog which is really therapeutic and it gives me something fun to look forward to doing. Tonight I tried to take the dex steroid earlier in the evening than last time around but here I am wide awake as the midnight hour moves on. Ah we'll, it's good to be here with you all and I wish lots of light to you all as we travel through this hellish tunnel together. I am convinced that the positive thoughts and support of people - those we know and those don't, doesn't matter - is amongst the strongest medicines around. Let's harness that positive stuff and kick this highjacker's behind! Peace.",

Expecting things to pretty much go as last time, but without the July 4th week heat wave this time around thank goodness! I think about all you ladies a lot... You all are an inspiration and it's so good to know we're in this together and we're going to kick this together... I really appreciate all the sharing of experiences and support. There are so many of us here now, in various places in our regimens, I'm starting to lose track... Wherever YOU are right now, good luck and keep on keepin' on... We WILL get through this. Sweet dreams, all.",
