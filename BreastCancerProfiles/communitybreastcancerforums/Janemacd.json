Thank you for all the support, Jane ",

I viewed the digital scans when they did them a couple of weeks ago (I always ask to see my scans, watch the ultrasound exams) and the technician was describing to me why the scan was a good one.... the tissues etc.   I wonder why they don't just go to an ultrasound.  Either way, it sounds less ominous.  Ironically it is my right breast that has the retracting nipple.  I have made an appointment with my GP to have that checked out. I'll keep you updated. Jane",

I do appreciate the doctors being careful.  I feel well taken care of.  I will let you know how Thursday goes.  At this point I don't know if I will be having additional mammograms done, ultrasound, both?  The staff at the hospital who do these things are very kind and professional.  So no anxiety there.  Being able to voice my concerns is a big thing.  I do not want to worry family with this.  All the best to you.

      "Content": "Janemacd wrote: Hi, Two weeks ago I had my regular mammogram.  I have been called backed for additional views.  That threw me a bit.  Six years ago I had a core biopsy (negative) but no concerns since.  I was telling my sister about the call back and mentioned that in the last couple of months my left areole and nipple have \"sunken\".  She told me that wasn't normal.  So I google and find that changes in the nipple area may be a sign of cancer.  So now, I am concerned.  I do not like uncertainty.  I guess I am wondering what are the cahnces of cancer if, independently, (1) I am called back for additional views, and (2) I discover I have a sign of possible cancer which I have never seen a doctor about.  One conclusion: good thing I am on the annual screening list. I'd appeciate others' perspectives on whether the two situations combined make me more likely to have something seriously wrong. My call-back is this Thursday so I am happy about that! Thank you!
