I'm doing great and you will too. The key for me was finding the right mix of meds to combat those chemo side effects. I would get up and take my anti reflux, anti nausea, anti diarrhea, ect.. And then was able to go to work and take care of my kids and live life. I hope you do as well.. stay positive",

I'm scheduled now for a steriotactic biopsy on July 1st after my mammogram and ultrasound came back with these results....architectural distortion with numerous malignant appearing micro calcifications in the palpable area. The remainder of the mammogram shows heterogeneously dense breast tissue. The right axilla shows a normal lymph node. BIRAD-4B and PARENCH-moderate. The radiologist telling me these results the day of the mam and US had serious concern on her face as this was my first mammogram experience and was by myself for this apt and results. She advised me of the need for steriotactic. After getting a copy of my reports in hand days later, my nervousness jumped 10 fold. I'm a nurse and am great with google, so I'm curious if you might think this fits the category of a ductal carcinoma? The only visual things I have seen on my breast are over the past several months some bluish/purple breast at times...I just thought I was cold or having some circulation issues. The color changes would come and go. Also I've noticed what might be mild orange peel looking right breast, inside and under by breast. But it has been unchanged since I found the lump may 30. How fast would that orange peel change if I have a cancer? My breast have been swollen, heavy and burning at times, which is new, for the past few months too. I just assumed that was hormonal old boobs:) I'm a 36D.  So I wait until maybe July 7th for my steriotactic results. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I only felt a small amt while taking samples from the smaller of the 2 lumps.  Maybe a 2 on the 1-10 scale for pain. The dr said he took about 30 samples between the 2 areas. The total time was 1 1/2 hrs.  I was sore enough to take some Tylenol for 2 days but that's it. Monday can't come soon enough! The radiologist wouldn't guess the outcome...said he's been wrong both ways too many times and that you really can't tell by just looking at a sample. Hope you all are doing well! ",
