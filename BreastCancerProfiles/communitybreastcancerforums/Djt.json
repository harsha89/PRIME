I'm on The large side, and so use to underwires, no clue what to look for! Also shopping for skin creams to help, anyone else yet?",

It was x ray day, they check positioning every 5 days to be sure any breast swelling or shape changes are accounted for, so they have moved the markers a bit over time. I would want to know, if tatts, how do they move to accommodate any breast shape changes? Mine do not come off in shower, but I don't scrub them either. Best to you with whatever you choose.",

Who has transformed into the patient they all know about. I had it OUT with my radiation oncologist. And several others. There were several issues I came across that I was very unhappy with, and it took me really SPEAKING UP to be \"heard, Are you sure you know the patients rights where you are treated? possibly speak to the social worker there, or the staff leader. Express your concerns about choices. You should have input on your treatment. Tell them you are not a number on a list but a real unhappy human patient who needs them to listen. Best hopes for you on the tattoos . They were about to do that with me, when I said emphatically NO, THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY. Funny there was! I know each facility had different structured procedures, and rules, but make a point to read their patient bill of rights and make your feelings known. In no uncertain terms. Chin up girl, it's moving along. I had my 10th radiation today, but they called me at 7 am, the machine was down ,they sent me to a nearby hospital for it, and my usual rad tec went there to meet me for the treatment!!! Wow, impressed!!! Machine needed a fuse, tomorrow I go in to the alternative place again. So glad I'm not skipping a day. I have to wonder if the tec would have gone to this off site if I had not had a mega meaningful chat with her . So ...today I walked my mile. Went home. Felt e xtra wiped out. Just sat for hours, felt odd. Had to pee several times in a row, sudden and acute agonizing pelvic pain, couldn't empty bladder, or so it felt. Then I see (sorry if tmi) I'm peeing pink and blood clots. Off to urgent care, could barerly walk. Turns out severe UTI and. Dehydrated. Off to drug stpre, its letting up a bit after a mega antibiotics pill a nd 3 ibuprofen. I know it seems to go on and on, but we will get through it.",

She did not know how to do the iv connection to the tubing, and as she ran to get someone, and figure it out, my vein just bled out all over the place. She said \" don't look over here.\" That was after she really hurt me good with the the needle going in. She was the only time I had bruises from the chemo IV.

In fact the skin is so fragile, where the nurses peeled off the stickers left scabs and sores. I couldn't figure out why I had increased pain over the last few days, then looked very closely at nipple area, well. It looks like iv been nursing a five year old with a full set of teeth. Rough .no skin left on nipple. I will say iv tried all the different potions and lotions and found the most serious and beneficial one is First Aid brand, intensive moisture cream. On another note as the beat up breast started to calm, my underarm area and lymph node scar are turning a very deep ugly red and pain was extraordinary. I got up yesterday and could not touch it with the cream, multiplex, or anything. Through the day I had chills and felt very sick. Called and explained to nurse at mo office. She said will call me back, after she explained to my dr. So, the call back is to come in and be seen which I did a few hours ago. Lymph node scar and surrounding tissue is infected. Picked up my 10 day supply of antibiotic...hopefully will kick in soon, cause this is SOME painful pain.",

Also, when I met with my radiation oncologist, i ran by her a thread i read on here regarding a woman who posted about se ere blisters, black peeling skin, blood oozing, and so on. A very a larming post on a different thread from a few years back. My dr. Actually toldc me, that some cancers close to tbe skin surface require this kind of INTENTIONAL burning to rid the Cancer. So, for what its worth, or if you read that as well, I'm thankful its was deeper tissue located. And hope none of us need this type.",

So today was my7th radiation treatment, and I finish on August 30th. I believe I read that the body size has something to do with how many days, and how they divide up the strength of the prescribed individual dose of radiation. I'm fortunate to be a 12 minute drive from my treatment center, so it already has become kind of routine, ( after last week's panics I had) they set me up with an ID card that I scan when I come into the waiting room, they call me in within 3 minutes and I leave 10 minutes later, i get coffee, and this week have picked up my walks again. My center has the onco Dr seeing me once a week, and after every 5 treatments, they take an x ray to be sure the original markings are still accurate as any swelling, etc, can alter the angles and precision of the treatment. So far, still using the ice packs for an hour immediate after treatment, then aloe, cornstarch powder to stay dry. I can now just start to detect a bit of achyness, and swelling, but its not bad.",

I'm using the burn gel they gave me, and cornstarch to absorb moisture. I have to see Dr. Tomorrow, for skin check, hope I can continue my treatment plan. I see many are having stomach issues. I learned that radiation really depletes your fluids, hydrating is huge. Also during radiation, we burn more calories. I was amazed that I have been losing about 2 pounds a week. I still rely on Imodium a lot as I did during chemo.

I know it will continue to 'cook' for about 2 weeks, but I really rely on ice aloe and cornstarch. Ingerp, hope it's going fast and easy. Funny convo of daquaris and margaritas, because after my last treatment I'm going to have one or the other at a nice lunch with my honey who has gotten me to each appointment! The boosts have been A bit different, today was 3, with the machine moving to a different spot for each, and a different noise than regular zaps. The first boost they put wires with some kind of meter on my skin. Little by little the big blue x marks are coming off. After last zap tomorrow, i see the Dr. And hope no more to come. You know the weird thing....When I'm done, where does the mind go? Do I just forget it all and live my life, and if so, how? After daily appoints, zaps, pills, infusion s and multiple surgeries for the past 8 months, what gear do I put myself IN? Huge changes, transition period. Blessings all.",

They had assured me at that time, I would be, 28 days of treatment was from 7.24 to 8.31, so I guess they are going to alter up the actual rad prescription to fit it all in, depending on how my skin tolerates it as the plan progresses.

I was never informed of anything about it, but have right breast involved only. And the Mepitel Film, i have never heard of this either, was it suggested by your radiation team? What exactly is it? My radiation team gave me a tube of Skintegrity. It's a hydrogel, and the tube says for up to 3 days use with 1 application, and for full thickness wounds, 1st and 2nd degree burns. I have not used it yet, as I have no burns. I have finished 9 treatments so far. Just using ice, aloe and cornstarch. I'm sure hoping that the after affects don't go into 3 weeks, i expected a few days or a week of continued skin issues after the last treatment, but not weeks. Oh boy. Hoping for the best!!",

I went a week ago for the CAT scan, tattooing, etc. Where they tak measurements and get you prescribed for dosages. Mine is 28 days, so my last day is Aug. 30, barring any issues. I'm very fortunate I'm about a 10 minute drive from the clinic. I've been on the phone for days trying to find out my share of the cost, with little results. I can't seem to get an answer, it has to do with codes, and co pays. I'm thinking it looks like 20.00 each time, but hope that is the most I'm looking at. I hope we can all power through this part, as we have done with the chemo.... Without very much in the way of issues. My sister had it 10 years ago...Her main complaint was fatigue. Re the tattooing. When that part came up, all I heard was the word needle, and I put my foot down. Don't get me wrong, I have tattoos, plenty. I just feel the invasive thing and asked why? I don't want black dot tatts on me, like a concentration camp survivor. They DO have an alternative method. I got marker with waterproof stickers over them. It's holding up fine.

I want one more i believe, a mid length. Iv been using the grip bands from Godiva that are made of crushed velvet, and velcro at nape, they work nice.ive had no itchy or problems at all, I was mainly worried about heat, but even on warm days I wear about 12 hours with no issue",

I have been using a hair band to kind of flatten some of the volume prob, I like the sturdy ones at www.sqhairbands.com. wigs can be trained a bit to what you want.",

Wigs are my every day go to. As it's been so hot I wear my shortest lightest one, which I have really come to love. It's part of every days get ready routine. This one is called Freedom, i got it through Godiva secret wigs. I'm starting to also realize what a quick alternative to hair worry a wig will be for travel , of course after I'm completely done with radiation. Yeah, wish I had a great head of hair, but also with taking anastrazole I'm not so sure that will ever happen. Anyone get a new wig, and want to share? Have a favorite, or a not so good experience? I'm very obsessed with watching wig YouTube videos ....the reviews especially by Taz. She has one out showcasing a wig called Peagan by Sepia, its a Vogue wig. I love it and want to try it. What i cant believe is the price, its like 60.00!! But Taz give good straight forward reviews, and she says this one is not bad for the price point. I think I may go for it. Please share here if you wishüëçüëçüòäüòä",

I got mine at godivasecretwigs.com. I think thay are 18.00 but worth it. They are like a crushed velvet, and worn as instructed, the wig is against the nap of the fabric and creates a bit of resistance. It is worn like a headband and Velcro in back. As far as product. I did buy a wig hair spray from them too. I want to try some gel, or wig styling cream, that kind of product may smooth your fizzles. I also just use water in a spray bottle to scrunch with, and tame flyaways. Keep working with it, moth, it definitely takes some time, experience and playing around to make it your own, but still, WOW. LOVE IT ON YOU.",

DEBAL, I'm actually not sure if I got new hair or just old hair that stuck around through all the chemo, but I have baby fine thin strands, not anything that covers the bald look, and nothing to get me excited yet. I had my \"dry run\" for radiation today, and start the hormone pill and first round of radiation tomorrow. For some reason, (What the Hell is wrong with me) i felt in a huge depression going in there this morning, and all but ran out the door. I cant bring myself to do the small talk chat, or be friendly. I cant stand them positioning me, touching me. I feel like a freak, an oddball. I cried my eyes out today, and im not a cryer. Was i fooling myself into think i was done after tne last chemo? This next stretch ...that of radiation feels like an assualt on my mind, body, and my mood. Engine, with Imodium, 2 usually works wonders, and doesn't make you go the other way to be constipated, but Janice may notice she is thirsty more after taking it. The reason it works is that it dries up the excess fluids in the intestinal tract. Hope she contines moving forward without further setbacks. Frog, ...good thoughts, hug and best wishes to you.

I lost my tolerance to be a \"good patient\" at a young age after years and years of heart issues, surgeries, and related hospital stays.from childhood on it became a big issue for me to even go to the Dr. For anything. I remember being in cardiac ICU one time, and with no warning, the entire group of approx 22 interns and a couple Dr.s come strolling to my bed discussing my STATS like I was a non existing piece of warped furniture. Never addressed me as a human being. That twisted me up. I could related 10 more stories, but suffice it to say, I hate Dr, visits, exams and anyone even touching me. I got to the point that one time in ICU, I removed my own IV, and called a cab and left, as I could get no one to get me a (allowed ) drink of water. Wow, that got big attention. At a stress test on the treadmill, I told them when I had to stop, (I was told to let them know!) And they kept go in and sped the thing up. I pushed the Dr. Out of the way to jump off. I was told I had a panic attack. Uh, no. I'm the patient here, and you did not listen to me, THE PATIENT! So the cancer thing, well, I'm older and wiser, and I have a good team, but damn. I want to be left alone. No, thanks I don't want the shadowing new face of each intern to grop my mutilated tit every time im in for a visit. I have told no one but my sisters, and 2 children of my dx, I just don't want the fallout, because I won't be nice.",

My breast surgeon who is head of her her teaching department, had a week long conference right after my first surgery on Feb 14, this year. When we met afterwards, she told me there is so much new information, and changes in how it's being treated that there was like 5 new discoveries a month. One she reviewed at her Florida conference, I believe was this new Tailor X. She was very thrilled at the new advancements in the breast cancer field. As she alluded to the study would decrease the number of woman receiving chemo. Duffysmom, glad #3 is over for you!

So the last couple of days i was dissapointed in my mascara, thinking i need a new tube. Then it hit me. Yep, not the mascara, it's my lack of lashes. Wow, a bit slow you say?? I have just got a small amount of brow, but color them in nicely, hoped and prayed my lashes were going to stay. But I'm thrilled a have a few at least. I hear they are very slow to grow in. What a twisted world! I just finished my last radiation treatment, this morning and got paperwork for insurance...reading the diagnosis of...inflitrative carcinoma.... brings me to a. Very scary place mentally, even though IV heard the words,\" you HAD cancer, now you dont\". And I'm worried about eyelashes!!! The doctor s have all said it takes a year before you stop thinking every twinge and ache and pain is cancer related. This is so scary. GAW, Dr checked cyst and lymph nodes, said all was fine, irritation and burn from radiation and prob hair follicles, use antibiotic cream. Best to all here, we share a commonality only understood by those who walk this road.",

Engine, so glad Janice is on a 3 month break and you can plan on seeing family for thanksgiving..you guys sure deserve it. LIFE, you're awesome, hair is for sure coming in. I think that 4 wheeling and mountain air did wonders for you by that smile. Yes, a reassment of job, lifestyle, everything is a positive step to take. I'm making different choices as well. Love your doggies, so fun to enjoy their company outside. The rads went pretty good. (I post in the radiation August. thead in more detail) but I have an infection in armpit o n The lymph node scar I'm dealing with now. Innab hahaha love it. That's me too, except that cutie has more on sides than I do. Ingerp ....YEAH THE HAIR issue is so unfair. I have always had thin hair, and had no hope on it coming back at all, especially with the anastrazole hormone therapy. ALL these drugs cause or can cause thinning. But, i got a little (very little) brush cut going on!!! It's weird, because I also have some long stray hairs here and there too, maybe they were with the pre chemo me, and never left, idk!!! And yes, the hot weather makes it difficult for sure. Have faith, it will happen. I really rely on my wigs, and like to switch them out. But, we all want our hair back, darn It!! Batata, hope things are improving for you, and your Taxol gets done very soon. I hope you can continue to take walks, i try that also, it's empowering, and helps keep energy up, mood up, and weight down. Don't beat yourself up over a little gain. Urdrago, i think every part of us heals slower than \"normal\" people as our bodies have to cope with so very much. Thinking good thoughts for you on your tests. GAW, i hope your powering through that last chemo, and on your way to feeling much better. Frog, hope your healing up, and feeling better each day. Libby..i had leg issues as you described and figured it was that i needed exercise or rest. One or the other...so i resumed walking and legs were much better. That was as just me tho, i hope you feel better soon. I also, have trouble remembering each name here, and related state of conditions, but I think of you all as friends, and part of my life now. Also happy Jewish New Year to those who observe it, L'Shana Tova.and best to all. üë®üë©üëßüë¶üë®üë©üëßüëßüë®üë¶üë¶üë®üëßüëßüë¨üë™üíë",

It's a matter of much online shopping and watching you tube reviews for sure, that being said, I have found the shorter ones are so comfortable, and care free I go with that. Also, bangs cover a multitude of sins! I have cut bangs into 2 of mine, and it makes the look more 'me'. What about a whole head cover scarf for your clinical? I hope you find something you like.

Pro and pre biotics, yes! I will try it again, but the odd deal for me is, the very items I enjoyed and tolerated well on round one, I can't even think about for round 2. Its been meats, ice cream, and maybe eggs this time, but still, I can't complain, I'm no where near as ill feeling. Of course today is day 7, so it's getting much better. Hope this for you ALL as well. Thanks to all for the well wishes for the Maine trip. It's not till Oct, but I love having some goal ahead, especially with my Harley parked and covered right now. That's a hard pill to swallow. Keep on moving forward ladies!!!",

I have been given nystatin liquid and also a same type of lozenge, to kill the yeast infection.

GA warrior, the thrush battle is best fought as quick as you think you have it, I have had it after each infusion treatment. The lozenges do work quickly. Weedie, hope you are still on the upward swing of feeling better. Dee, my eyebrows are also thinning, andc I'm worried . But I have found several kits ..inexpensive, to darken and etch, before they are totally gone. I figure it helps to give me a feel for how to draw on when they are completely gone. There are stencils available to assist in drawing on brows. Wow this is work!! ya know! Frog, taking ibuprofen for the bone pain actually helped me more than claritin, or both together completely eliminated it . Hope it improves. Duffysmom, hope all is well as we move towards the 3rd round on Tuesday. This week has been better tummy wise, but I've been quite tired. Dee, I did go back to the activia, but it doesn't appeal to me now! Good thing they are small portions. Linda , Astyan, and engine.....hope the weekend is a good one. hang in there, and everyone else. Best to all, I've been so moody, just feel like hibernation with my books, and trying to get in some of the grandkids end of school year events.",

You can only do what you can do, not wise to push beyond your energy or travel limits. The Sturgis thing resonates with me, in a big way. Went last year. We rented a bike, as living in N.Y., and my S.O. has one leg, riding with a prosthesis that far is not an option. This year we were going to trailer his ( which he has been building for months) and mine . So we could both ride our own. It's a major undertaking, wd really wanted to go. Not do-able. We stopped talking about it on April 12, when I found out chemo and radiation were coming after 3 surgeries. So, yeah. If you have gone in the past, you have an idea of what you would be involved in. Big differences lie in factoring in where you camp or stay. Also the walking. The noise, and the available food. If you stay in one of the calmer camp grounds, and didn't venture far, it may be okay for you. But riding while fighting diahrrea or bone pain, is not fun. Just think it through. I have not gone very far this year, sometimes Wal-Mart is barely a something I want to manage. You and he need to have a realistic heart to heart. Depending on the location proximity maybe a day or two for just him? Trust me, i get it. It stinks. It hurts. My Harley is getting cobwebs and I hate it, but safety first. Last year we rode Needles Highway, and all the crazy curved mountainous switchbacks snd rode past buffalo I could touch. You must be at the top of your game, and then some to ride or even passenger in almost half a million motorcycles of every type, skill level, and descriptions. Saw accidents almost daily there and on the way there. It was thrilling, yes, but risk factors exist and you dont want to start the trip with built in ones against you. Iv had a cloud over my head with the date rapidly approaching, but other smaller jaunts seem more wise. Just my 2 cents. I hope for next year for Sturgis. I hope the same for you. Safety and health first. Planning for a fun time also helps keep your spirits up.",

Big difference. I prefer my headband type liner, makes the whole wig thing manageable. But try a few different types, it does away with itchy. Have you tried a low half ponytail while leaving side tendrils out? Taz does that in a lot of her longer styles. It does take a lot of practice to get the wig tailored to exactly your personality and best comfort level. IV been wearing a lace front mid length which always falls in forward in my face, i took to using small side clips and I kind of liked it. Then I got brave and cut bangs in it. Now I love It! Totally different and seems natural with the lace front. As far as I know, a lot of lace fronts come over wide, and have to be cut. It should be ok to trim, lots of you tube videos on this subject. I have been going to order the glue stuff, but have not yet, this band keeps the lace front in place pretty good.",

Trade out brush weekly, try Biotene toothpaste too. Great stuff. GO gently, and rinse with baking soda and salt with very warm water as often as possible. Of course, your dentist is your go to professional, but these are what helps me. I rinse with a small mouthful of Biotine every time I visit the bathroom. Best, Deborah",

I lost my tolerance to be a \"good patient\" at a young age after years and years of heart issues, surgeries, and related hospital stays.from childhood on it became a big issue for me to even go to the Dr. For anything. I remember being in cardiac ICU one time, and with no warning, the entire group of approx 22 interns and a couple Dr.s come strolling to my bed discussing my STATS like I was a non existing piece of warped furniture. Never addressed me as a human being. That twisted me up. I could related 10 more stories, but suffice it to say, I hate Dr, visits, exams and anyone even touching me. I got to the point that one time in ICU, I removed my own IV, and called a cab and left, as I could get no one to get me a (allowed ) drink of water. Wow, that got big attention. At a stress test on the treadmill, I told them when I had to stop, (I was told to let them know!) And they kept go in and sped the thing up. I pushed the Dr. Out of the way to jump off. I was told I had a panic attack. Uh, no. I'm the patient here, and you did not listen to me, THE PATIENT! So the cancer thing, well, I'm older and wiser, and I have a good team, but damn. I want to be left alone. No, thanks I don't want the shadowing new face of each intern to grop my mutilated tit every time im in for a visit.

So does this change with this new study? I find it alarming and confusing that with this just out my clinic is not bringing it up, or offering new stats. And related information. So hope all went well for others in treatment today....Duffysmom? Frog, I still haved one to go on June 26, today was fine, blood labs good, glucose good, the IV was problematic, hurt like a mother, first time that happened. The nurse seemed displeased that I was quiet and reserved. I had been up most of the night before and I'm not one to put a pretty face on a sows ear if you get my drift. I just cant pretend im sitting at the state fair eating cotton candy watching a circus. I'm polite, but withdrawn. Maybe she just rammed it in . We ate a sandwich lunch, and i had No reactions to meds, , got a refill on my Xanax, so I can. Sleep. Neulasta pump boarded and loaded for tomorrow.

Wow, what a sunny moment that gave me. It's the little things......  So my last chemo is tomorrow morning. I pray my blood counts are okay to go through it. My other Dr. In my team, called already to set me up for my radiation itinerarie on this Thurstay, talk about not missing a beat! Pushing ahead, but I think they said a month off before first radiation. Still have to find out about the hormone blocking pill for 5 or 10 years, it has yet to be discussed.

It would be simple enough to have just the nasty mouth, but it always dripped into throat, then caused gastritis, then diahrrea. Taking the 2 different forms of nystatin works after a week but one of nystatin's SE is also diahrrea.

All, I wanted to say I looked waaay back, at us all, Remember? April group. We have all come so far. I like engines motto about looking at all the way we have traveled, and its a long way indeed. We came through bouts of diahrrea, not being able to sip water, and what pill does what, calling in our problems to our mo's, and fighting our way from one day to the next....our weaknesses have started to turn around! To you ladies still facing surgery, i can't imaging how scary it must seem. That's what has consistently scared me the most...all the \"firsts\". I know you can and WILL do it, and do it famously. A good friend of. Mine found she had cancer in both breasts, she found out, as she had spotted blood, as she breast fed her newborn daughter. She was 28. Having a new born and a 5 year old, also as a single mom who just got her own business off the ground! She had a double mastectomy, intense chemo 2xs and radiation. She never lost her smile, or her push forward. I remember bringing her family a meal when she was released after her mastectomy, and she was puttering around the kitchen! Drains, and newborn and all on her own. This girl is now 5 years past that eventful day, cancer free and loving every day of her life. I think of her daily, as I don't think I had half her strength through my lesser battle, at twice her age. anyway, we all somehow, someway, get through the daily challenges of this bump in our road. Just sharing. Have a good rest of this week. ",

I read a lot on hair growth online, but i think other than biotin and Rogaine, not much else can really work. But each day new stuff surfaces, so we can hope. Hi to all !! This hair deal is just crazy stuff. I remember a movie from a million years ago, it was a war movie, with Sophia Loren. For some unremembered reason she and other women had their heads shaved as a mark of dissapproval of some kimd. I must have been a small kid, but remember the horror i felt. We as women are just born with a love of our locks!! Im glad for my little brush cut, rather have that than cancer, but its hard on us!! The whole world expects all women to have hair, beautiful hair. But we here are ALIVE. SO IT IS WHAT IS, AT least for today amd tomorrow. And it's ok. It's ok.",

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2018 02:44PM - edited Apr 14, 2018 07:18PM by Djt hi and thank you all for your incite, bravery, and sharing. So I had a spot on my mammo screening on 1.25.18...and so it went. Biopsy,, lumpectomy, on 2.14.18 and then a second re excision for clear margins on 3.12.18, surgeon said yes, clear margins, and she removed all cancer. I expected radiation and the hormonal pill , but got the wind knocked out of me yesterday. My ONCOl score is 28, so CHEMO was recommended. I'm 64. Scared to heaven and back. Dr. Said it's low dose, short term. Does anything make it sound better? So I'm having a nine week course of TC 4 infusions one every 3 weeks. I have made an appointment for a wig consultation, don't want to scare my grandsons. Not sure of first appointment date. You know what I AM very concerned about out t, is my teeth. If spent a fortune through the years on them. Does anyone know if I run the risk of losing teeth or if these are affected? I am still in shock at the CHEMO, surgeon did not think I would need it. But I guess I have to do this....thank you all for embracing me into our journey and I. Hope the best for all.",

Another note....I found a couple of items I wanted to share, for the dryness CHEMO creates in the skin, I'm using - Neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleaner. CreaVe skin renewing Cream Serum Simple hydrating gel cream and Korres lip butter. All very affordable, and I got thru Amazon. Also, if interested, I ordered E. I. f. Eyebrow kit and pencil.

They are so annoyimg. My Neulasta pump will be going off in a few hours, and I'm going to take claritin at that time. Yes, I agree with you ALL, keeping ahead of it is key. Took my walk today, and downing the water as day after infusion. I'm even kind of use to the wig. Carpe Diem all, and best. DEBORAH",

I just booked us a little fall vaca in a cottage on the water in mid coast Maine, in October when the waves will be wild, the air clean, the trees scarlet, and the crowds gone. It has a fireplace, a screened in porch, and the tide comes into the very steps. Can't wait. I don't drink too much coffee, but, yes, the acid can affect bady functions, I agree. The mouth thing isn't sores, I've been blessed with no sores, but a film, of coating that can creep down the throat making it sore, and even progressing to stomicitis. It a form of yeast infection. I think it's under control I hope. I have not called my triage nurse line once this time! Time is moving on, and this too, shall pass",

My Dr. Appointment revealed a lot of scar tissue growing in breast, toward the lymph nodes, and dr. said no nothing to worry about. There is still some fluid build up in breast, but she wants to wait to see if it reabsorbs into the body by the time I do radiation.

My oncologist told me the TC was not going to affect or exacerbate heart issues or cause any. I just finished my 4th TC, with no heart issues. Would going to another onco for a 2nd opinion help you? I agree that some cardio helps immensely. Best to you. Deborah",

Ingerp, and GAW hope your weekend had been positive and reviving, it's beautiful weather here in N.Y. right now. I had a major (to me on a personal level) accomplishment this weekend. After it being parked and unused all this year ,I got out on my Harley yesterday. I was nervous about my level of strength, but I rode an amazing 17 miles, my s.o. rode his behind me for a back up, but it went so well, felt like I was me again, just for a while I could forget all the other stuff. I know most all here may not like, believe in, or care about motorcycle riding, and that's OKAY, but it was a big day for me and I wanted to share with my group. Happy Sunday and a good Sunday to you all. Deborah",

So I know the perfect wig hair is not my real look, also, but I am seeing a lot of Bob cuts, med length wigs with a beach wave, those I love. FROG, a beret sounds fun, and that's why I love the Sqhair bands for a hair band, the arms fold and the shape is just like the sunglasses look. Cocoon, I do the hoodie thing often.....lol. as to our love of lipstick, there are so many shades of red, by experiments we can find the perfect shade. Mine is a deep red with brown, and I love lip liners too! Hoped everyone's Sunday is as peaceful and pleasant as possible.üêíü¶Ñ‚òÄÔ∏èü¶Ñüê∂",
