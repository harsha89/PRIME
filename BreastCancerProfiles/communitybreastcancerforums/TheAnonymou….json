I have school, soccer/indoor soccer, stage crew, and taking out of school classes, so i get a little busy. My mom is doing pretty well, her first chemo was 2 mondays ago. She said she was okay and that it only felt like a really bad cold. But i guess this will worsen with time. I am trying to get more info pathology/Diagnosis (i think that is what it is called). But its hard for me too ask those sort of things. I hope everyone stays well!",
