I know that most of you have already done it, but I was in the hospital for the one last month, so couldn't go. It turned out to be good. I was definitely the youngest one there...everyone else was over 60, I'm guessing. Got a TON of makeup, and I'm very picky about my makeup, but most of it actually worked and looked good.  Also, I got to pick out another scarf, and I even got a wig. I was very skeptical, since most of you have said that the wigs from the ACS look like some sort of furry animals laying on top of your head, but I got a long, sexy one, that actually looks good!  I was very pleasantly surprised!  They didn't feed us though, which would have been nice. :-( Gotta go for TC #3 tomorrow, so I'm trying to drink a lot of water today. BTW, which tropical locale am I going to tomorrow? Did we ever decide? Other info-I'm maintaining weight; still have arm hair, eyebrows and eyelashes; pubic hair thinned a LOT, but has stopped; underarm hair and leg hair stopped growing about 3 weeks after tx #1 (YEAH!!); not much head hair left; and nails all still look okay. All in all, can't complain! I also made a strawberry rhubarb pie with a crumble topping for my dh for Father's Day. It's his favorite. Turned out good! Personally, I'm partial to chocolate... Rock-Glad you had a good trip to DC! Otter-So glad you're feeling better. Angels-Keep us posted on your lump...I'm praying it's nothing.

I have to go pick my son up from soccer camp, and will try to catch up later.  I had the stomach flu over the weekend, so I didn't do much of anything!  Sharon",

Any thoughts (or knowledge) as to whether it makes a difference getting it the day of tx or the day after? On another positive SE note (very few and far between, I know), I shaved my legs and underarms on Wednesday, and there is VERY LITTLE stubble on my legs and NO stubble under my arms (3 days later), so I'm happy about that!   I have an appt this afternoon to get my wigs trimmed, 'cuz I'll be needing them soon. Angelsaboveus-Your ANC went lower than mine! You're very lucky that they didn't automatically put you in the hospital! Maybe it was because you didn't have a high fever at the time (mine was 101.9 in the ER). My stint in the hospital ended up being 5 days in isolation (very boring). ~Sharon~",

It has sent (and will continue to) send me into more crying jags than my original diagnosis did. I know that sounds very superficial, but as Otter so aptly put it, it's part of who we are, and no matter what else is going on, we can't hide the hair/eyebrow/eyelash loss. I know I AM sick, but I don't really want to LOOK sick. I know that in time, I will get used to it, but I really wish I didn't HAVE to. So for now, we're here for each other to whine to at times and comfort each other at other times. I'm there holding your hand and giving you a cyber hug as we all go through this together. Sharon",

Maybe next time I'll take a cute little umbrella to at least make it look more palatable???  Also got the Neulasta shot this time, so hopefully no 5 day \"side excursion\" to the hospital this time!  I took my Claritin...do I need to take it again tomorrow? Roxi and Janice-Hope your swims went well, too! Can't wait to hear from you! Rock-Great post! I think about it all the time with my boys (12 and 14).  They really SEEM to be doing well, but I never know for sure. A friend of mine told me that when she was diagnosed in October (5 years ago), she went out the next day and went overboard shopping for Christmas, not knowing how things were going to turn out. I get teary everytime I think about that story! Kristy-I, too, missed my May Look Good class because I was in the hospital!  I guess I'll try for the June class, but by then I guess I'll have been bald, eyebrow-less and eyelash-less for awhile. RanD-Welcome to the group! These boards really are turning out to be invaluable! Lenny, Beckie and Gracie713-Best of luck tomorrow! ~Sharon~",

It's cheaper if you buy the powdered version of it in a box (Walmart) and add it to water. The only problem is that it only has 5 grams of protein. Have you tried Myoplex Lite? I get it at Walmart, and it has 170 calories and 20 grams of protein. Comes in chocolate and vanilla, at least at Walmart. Susan-Way to go on finishing your AC! Major session over with! Also, so glad that it's been a fairly easy ride for you. I hope the rest goes well, too. Well, I got tired of my hair falling out everywhere, so this morning, my hubby cut it REALLY short, and he actually did a good job! It's as short as Jamie Lee Curtis in her Activia yogurt commercial!  I'm guessing that in a couple of days, we'll have to buzz it off, but this is fine for now. ~Sharon~",
