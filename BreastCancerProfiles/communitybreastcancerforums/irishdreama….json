NO WAY did I want to take that chance. I did have reconstruction, expanders, then silicone implants, but went with only 304cc (approx. B cup) so I( don't have to wear a bra if I don't want to, yet I have enough \"Foob\" that I can wear cute tank tops etc. The bottom line is, you have to do what feels right to you. Good Luck!",

I have a young daughter, and I had two tumors in my left breast. I could also feel the lymph nodes under my left arm, and on the ultrasound, they found 16 lymph nodes-9 were definately cancerous. My best friend's mom had had ER+ breast cancer, a mastectomy, tamoxifen for 5 years, and then 2 years later, she ended up with a completely different breast cancer in the opposite breast-ER-. I took all of these factors, as well as my age at time of Dx (45) into consideration when I made my decisions regarding my treatment. I don't regret any of the choices I made. I wanted to treat this very aggressively. But as Shirlann said, there's no such thing as a cure for cancer, and there are no guarentee's. I felt the double mastectomy gave me a better chance to avoid getting it again. Good luck to you!",

The neurologist gave me a prednisone taper for the last treatment, so no headaches then. I was very lucky-the Emend worked great-I never had the nausea or vomiting, and never had to take the Zofran, or compazine that was prescribed.
