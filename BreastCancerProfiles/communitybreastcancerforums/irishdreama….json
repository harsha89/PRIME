NO WAY did I want to take that chance. I did have reconstruction, expanders, then silicone implants, but went with only 304cc (approx. B cup) so I( don't have to wear a bra if I don't want to, yet I have enough \"Foob\" that I can wear cute tank tops etc. The bottom line is, you have to do what feels right to you. Good Luck!",

I have a young daughter, and I had two tumors in my left breast. I could also feel the lymph nodes under my left arm, and on the ultrasound, they found 16 lymph nodes-9 were definately cancerous. My best friend's mom had had ER+ breast cancer, a mastectomy, tamoxifen for 5 years, and then 2 years later, she ended up with a completely different breast cancer in the opposite breast-ER-. I took all of these factors, as well as my age at time of Dx (45) into consideration when I made my decisions regarding my treatment. I don't regret any of the choices I made. I wanted to treat this very aggressively. But as Shirlann said, there's no such thing as a cure for cancer, and there are no guarentee's. I felt the double mastectomy gave me a better chance to avoid getting it again. Good luck to you!",

The neurologist gave me a prednisone taper for the last treatment, so no headaches then. I was very lucky-the Emend worked great-I never had the nausea or vomiting, and never had to take the Zofran, or compazine that was prescribed. Chemo reacts differently with everybody, but Libragirl is right, drink lots and lots of water, as cytoxan i9s very bad for your kidneys. Good luck!",
