This is partially due to the fact that I am lucky to fill an A cup on a good day!   Also, did anyone discuss the issue around the PASH blocking the view of other tumors or the potential for it actually being angiosarcoma? Both of these considerations came up in conversation with the my first surgical consult who wanted to remove it.  Thanks!",

Between the holidays and wanting to stay buried in work to keep my mind busy I haven't been back here in a while. The BS was in agreement that the PASH tumor should be removed. The surgery (which they are refering to sometimes as a lumpectomy and other times as an excisional biopsy) is schedule for 1/17/2013. The breast surgeon was able to give much more specific information as to why she would reccommend the removal. Her main reasons were the fact that it clearly had grown in the last few months, the fact that if it grew much bigger the lumpectomy becomes more complex and finally she just wasn't comfortable with the margin of error. She stated that given the size there was just simply a greater chance that the core needle biopsy had missed something. The removal of the lump will address all of those issues giving greater piece of mind and address the situation before it becomes more complex than necessary.  I'll post an update when things are done so that if others come along looking for info in the future hopefully they can find it.     Best of luck and thanks to all that posted. Hoping for happy outcomes for everyone.",
