Shot was on Wednesday, Thursday late afternoon my skin would start to hurt, well really the layer right under my skin. By Friday I was in excruciating bone pain which would come in waves from my feet all the way up my body about every five minutes, which lasted until Saturday afternoon. I would be wiped out on Sunday, sometimes into Monday. The last two cycles of DD Taxol my onc put me on a steroid on Thursday and Friday, which cut the pain in half. It was horrid and pain killers barely touched the pain, only hurt my tummy so I gave up on those. The point is, ask for help! I wish I'd had the steroid earlier, it was tough to psych up for my chemo weeks knowing what was coming. At least I didn't get nausea - silver lining!",

I am suffering from terrible fatigue, had DD ACT chemo May-August 26 and started rads on September 16 and finish today. Same thing, foggy head and weird speech pattern most afternoons and absolutely feeling like a lead blanket is resting on my soul. I have had some success with acupuncture which is available through my tumor institute and took afternoons off from work the last couple of weeks which helped. I fell asleep sitting up at my desk on/about week 3, but my boss said I was in good company as he may have nodded off once or twice himself :)  My acupuncturist suggests that this will continue for at least two weeks after radiation is complete, so I am going to continue with her for a couple more sessions. I already feel a bit better this week as I am on my final 5, which are the boosts to my surgical sight & suppose it's not as tough on my body. Will look forward to seeing what type of information others can post on this thread!",

I think I hate it more than chemo! Fear that they are going to screw up and zap me in the wrong place...irrational, but I am sure not unusual. I will be done October 30th barring anything unusual, fortunately my center is about 5 minutes from my office so the everyday thing won't be a huge inconvenience. Off to read your posts! Bow",

I did not ask about that, but the clavicle rash explanation from my oncologist made sense. The beam for the nodes is actually coming from behind on me - when I raise my arms up the radiation comes between my arm and neck from below, and the collar bone reflects the beam and gets \"burned\" so to speak. Does this make sense? Maybe that's why we get rash on the back. I did ask about my lung and heart - and yes, my onc said they are brushing my lung with radiation, but not my heart. The nodes my onc wants to treat are not just under the armpit, but all up into the neck & arm. I checked out the lymph system pretty extensively with my lymphedema prevention therapist who I worked with after my surgery. It's really quite fascinating. ",

MomMom, I hope they get me going quickly like you - ready to be done! Taxol is not too bad as far as SEs for me (unlike Neulasta, which has been horrid) so I am hoping it's a sign I can keep moving.
