The PS drained it 3 times with a needle and then she would do an expansion at the same time to try and get the space filled with expander so it would not reappear. When I was done with the fills I still had the seroma and she decided not to drain it anymore and to just leave it .She told me that if it got really big to give her a call. It stayed the same and then I waited from Feb 11-June 6/08 for my exchange surgery and everything went well. I did not have rads so I don't know what effect that will have on the seroma.

Well, my exchange surgery is changed to June 6/08 because my hemoglobulin is only 84 as of yesterday due to a prolonged period that will not stop. I am sooooooooooooooooo bummed out. I want to get rid of these hard things in my chest. Going to see the GP on this Friday to see how much Iron I need to take to increase the Hg. Have tried different meds to get it to stop, but now none are working so may have to go and have a uterine ablation done to burn the lining off, but it does last for 2-5 years.

I had an excisional biopsy done last fall when my Mom was in california and I told her that I did not want to tell Grandma about it just yet. She came over to me and rubbed my back and said \"That's O.K. Mom, we will tell Grandma when you are ready\" What a kid, WOW!! Then when I had to go for bilat mast with tissue expanders I was trying to tell her how I would look after, because she is always in the bathroom with me, and sees me coming out of the shower all the time. Her response to me was \" that tissue in your boobs is rotten and you have to get it removed before it makes your whole body rotten\" Then I told her that I would be flat chested just like a boy and she told me \"that is O.K. You will look just like me\". I cannot believe her sometimes, she is just so right on.

I also had DCIS in the right breast (which was the \"good\" one) and was being followed since 1999 with yearly mammograms. Was recommended to have mast on the right side and also told to think about mast on the left. After a lot of research and thinking and talking to my husband I decided to have bilat mast done with tissue expanders and implants. I also considered DIEP, but thought at the time that I would try expanders first and if that did not work then could always have DIEP done later. PS said that this was possible, if expanders had any complications. It was a tough decision, but I knew that if I was going to have one mast, that I would not want to do it again in a few years and I also wanted the symettry (sp?) of both breasts. I do miss my nipples though as they were very sensitive. After the final path report came back there was area in the left breast that was atypical lobular hyperplasia, so in the end I was soooooooooo relieved that I had done the bilat mast. You will do what is right for you. It is a journey just to make this decsion and the type of reconstruction that you want. Talk to the PS in detail. My PS drew pictures for me and explained everything to me. Hope that Helps. Kerry",

I am in Ontario in the southwest,close to Lake Erie. Kathy,  It was difficult to wait the 3 months for the surgery. I had my diagnosis by the end of Oct and then had to see the PS which was Nov 20, so there was some lag time to think about things.Then when I had decided to have immediate reconstruction with the BS and PS it was Christmas and New Years time and a hospital slow down time where they only do Emergence case O.R.'s. Once Christmas was over for me I just wanted to get the surgery done but had to wait until Jan25/08. I did not have too much trouble sleeping after the surgery. I could lie in my bed with 2 pillows and if I curled in my shoulders it seemed to help. I also had a sleeping pill that I took. It was Zoplicone and I used it a few times. I was expanded fairly fast and I think that is why I had a lot of my pain. My PS can be fairly aggressive with her thinking. I also had a seroma (fluid pocket) on the right side after she took my drain out early. I had to have the seroma drained 3 times and then after that she wanted to do a fill to fill in the pocket with the expander and not give the seroma any more space to develop. In the end she stopped draining the seroma and it stopped forming and the expander on the right fell down into the space. I have had them in now since Jan 25th and they are livable. I take tylenol ES and Flexeril 5mg during the day. I could go back to work and I may have to now before the exchange surgery. I was actually up to 360cc of expansion on each side at about 2 weeks and 3 days post op which is incredibly fast, but I did not know that at the time , until I started reading the thread \"continued tissue expander pain\". Also my PS was telling me that the pain from a fill should go away in 48hrs (NOT!!!).The other thread was good to show me that my pain was not unnormal. Once the fills are done they do loosen up and drop. Your skin and muscle loosen up. There are a lot of different hints on the other thread about tissue expanders. Some of them worked for me and others did not. A lot of women slept in a recliner chair. You will find what works best for you as you go along. Also the PS can take out some saline if the expander is too painful. I had 25cc taken off at my last fill which brought me down to 335cc of expansion. Hope that helps. Take Care, Kerry",

One of those ones that you cannot put down. KES",

      "Content": "Apr 9, 2008 01:41PM - edited Apr 10, 2008 12:21AM by kes Hi Trumum, I also had DCIS in the right breast and it was multifocal, could not get clear margins on an excisional biopsy of the right side. This was the \"good\" side. It was found on my yearly mammogram which was to watch the left side due to atypia. After talking at great length with my Surgeon, his recommendation was a total mastectomy to the right side and to consider doing the left also and to try and not save any nipples, which I asked about. At first I was only going to do the right side and there was NO WAY that I was going to do the left side. After talking to some mastectomy survivors, then I was going to do both sides and try to save one nipple. After talking to the Plastic Surgeon, who said that the one remaining nipple would probably not have much sensation to it, and after talking to my Breast Surgeon again and asking him what his bottom line recommendation to me would be, which was bilat mast and both nipples should be removed, was I able to come to the same decision as the Surgeon. It was a stressful time and a VERY hard decision to make. I was even holding on to some faint hope right up to the day before surgery that maybe I could keep one breast or just one nipple, but I knew what I needed to do for myself to stay healthy. I had a mother in law (loved her dearly) who had a 30 year history with this dreaded disease and I saw the last 20 years of her fighting this THING and I made my mind up then that if this ever happened to me that I would go for a bilat mast and have implant reconstruction. That is what I did. I didn't want to but I knew that I had to. Definetly the toughest decision I have ever had to make in my life. You will do what is right for you and your family. Best of luck. P.S. My tissue expanders are in place and I have my exchange surgery on Apr.25/08 Also my final pathology report on the left side came back showing an area of Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia. I was sooooo glad that I did both sides.Also now I know that I did not want to go through this surgery again, and from the path report it looks like I would of had to of, down the road. Kerry",

Staymom, On my final path report there were areas of DCIS on the right side that could not be felt and also could not be seen on the mammogram. I had mammogram, then mammogram with magnification views, then an ultrasound, then a needle biopsy (which came back clear, but an excisional biopsy was recommended) and then an excisional biopsy, which picked up the multifocal DCIS. This happened in summer/fall of 2007. DCIS can be very tricky. So my advice would be that if the Doctors are chasing you around (and I don't mean around his office) to do more testing, then it is a good idea to follow up on this. Take Care, Kerry",

Renee, I found that they do not tell you a thing if they know that you are a nurse. \"She's a nurse, she knows it all\"  You miss the simple basic post op teaching. I think that I scared my homecare nurse post bilat mast and TE. I basically did the dressing changes, and she didn't even have any supplies in her car truck. I had to go to my car and get supplies out of my trunk. I also do homecare visits. And this was my second day post op. Please don't come to do a dressing if you don't have any supplies.

I do not want to be large. The waiting is the hardest part because you just want some form of breasts back, and to be able to buy nice bras again. Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I think \"What the h*ll happened to you\". I am definetly going through the mourning period now. But I know that my breasts were not worth the cost of my life. But it is a hard pill to swallow. The loss of nipple sensation is what gets to me. Anne,   Your story and mine are very similar. I will let you know how my exchange surgery goes. I am usually on \"continues tissue expander pain\" or \"anyone having surgery in April\" threads. Take Care, P.S.

This is a very emotional time just with having to have a possible mastectomy. The news is very shocking for sure. I remember driving home one day after work and a lot of stuff was going on for me and then I had to cope with my diagnosis and I just remember the OVERWHELMING feeling of not wanting to go home at all and just wanting to go and be someone else and take over their life. It was just the weirdest feeling that I ever had. Talk with your family and tell them how your feel. This is a very difficult time in your life and having to deal with the grief of your MUM, and now this diagnosis. I remember feeling the same way also, I just wanted to wake up and have it all go away, it was like a bad dream. It is tough. Hang in there. Take Care, Kerry",
