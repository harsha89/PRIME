And it most assuredly exists!  So if I sounded stupid, then thank my surgeon. Also, the area that's most swollen from fluid starts right under where my breast was, down towards my stomach/abdomen. Doing tummy crunches and other exercises does not help that area. I have read tons about lymphedema. I hate the compression arm garments, but I do perform lymphatic massage on myself. So-so results.       ",

LE in the abdomen is even less understood or even identified as such by many providers, including LE certified PTs. We sufferers are in new territory here with little guidance. Like you, my (right side in my case) abdomen is distended and hard as a rock, although it softens with about 30-45 minutes of MLD focused mostly on my lower LEFT groin area. I have gallstones, but don't need surgery yet (not that I know when I would need it). I also was a massage therapist many years ago, so I do know a bit about the body. Another thing we have in common: I gained over 30 pounds in record time once I started Aromatase Inhibitors, those evil drugs from hell that I was on for over 5 years. I gained another 30 pounds in record time back in 2015-2016 when my LE was improperly treated with poorly done CDT bandaging which led to repeated episodes of cellulitis (about 11) which increased the size of my arm and trunk each time. My upper arm ballooned to 27.5\" in 2016!!!!  Before my cancer diagnosis and treatment I had a waist, but I have NO WAIST at all now. I am a big butter ball. My life is hell. Finding real treatment has been a nightmare. Regular MLD and CDT do not help much at all and has often made it far worse. I tend to read a lot of medical journal articles for fun. LE can lead to the deposit of adipose tissue that won't go away on its own. However, certain surgeries have been highly successful in reducing LE -- so much so that some woman can forego compression garments following surgery!  Something to think about.  Your spotting is a concern, of course, and I hope your doctors are more interested in finding the reason than mine have been. You do know tamoxifen has been linked to vaginal bleeding, yes? AIs seem to show less linkage to vaginal bleeding than tamoxifen, but some women on AIs do get it nonetheless. Perhaps I am in that rare group that is affected with (post-menopausal in my case) vaginal bleeding while taking AIs. Shouldn't happen, but it can. And again, not much is known about this subject. None of my health providers have ever questioned whether or not my rampant LE (especially in my trunk and abdomen) and 5+ years on AIs could be part of the problem. The tendency of doctors is to blame one's weight for all health problems, but that is a cop out. For example, I don't have any cardiovascular problems, nor high cholesterol or diabetes. Those health conditions are often linked to being fat. So maybe my extra weight is the reason I don't have those issues? Just sayin', lol.   Right now I am gearing up to request a referral to Dr. Stanley Rockson at Stanford in CA. He is known for his expertise in all things LE, including Lymph Node Transfer and SAPL. If anyone can figure out how best to treat my arm/abdominal LE, it's him. ",

OBVIOUSLY, my dear surgeon was most likely referring to draining a seroma -- BUT THAT'S NOT HOW HE STATED IT as he looked at and prodded my swollen-with-lymph-fluid trunk. The fact is, he did nothing about it either way. All I was ever told about was ARM lymphedema. Went to several lackluster PT appts back in 2009. First PT had some...emotional/anger issues...hard to connect with. Later I found out this PT was known for her harsh, surly attitude (so why inflict her on patients that are already dealing with major issues?). Second PT was much more helpful. Showed me how to gently massage my own arm. Hooked me up with an arm cruncher from hell and was done with me. If the quality of my life was poor before the compression sleeve, it sure as heck tanked even further using that Dark Ages contraption. What I really needed was manual lymphatic massage from a professional. On a regular basis until it improved. And with something done for my one-sided blooming stomach! At 64, I look decidedly pregnant ON ONE SIDE. I must buy clothing up 2 sizes larger to accommodate that ONE SIDED BULGE. I cannot fly on a plane because even if I can squeeze my bottom into those ever smaller seats, I can't put the seat belt over my ONE SIDED BULGE  and buckle it without a lot of embarrassment -- and pain. Only NOW have I begun to understand that that lymphedema tummy bulge could have/should have been appropriately detected and treated beginning back in 2009.  A few weeks ago, suddenly out of nowhere my right LE arm became more swollen, very painful, dull & achy, etc. My right hand and baby finger became numb and tingly. I could not use my hand! My pain came in cycles, lasting about 3 hours at a time 3-4 times a day. My pain level was 8-9-10 on a 1-10 scale. NOTHING HELPED IT.  I knew it was the LE! BUT -- Because I now have a history of blood clots from the Aromasin, I was sent to ER for an ultrasound. It was hell. Long story short, after probing deeply in my right armpit for 2.5 hours, 2 techs and the Vascular Guru decided that it wasn't a blood clot, though it could be a lymph node. Holy Cow! Lymph node!   But that was not their concern. Only the possibility that it might be a blood clot caught their initial attention. So they sent me home. All that prodding sent my armpit,  arm, and hand into wretched agony for 3-4 days. My Primary doc was supposed to refer me to PT, but did not. I had to remind her several times to do so.  I now have an appt next week and I intend to push for THEM doing regular LE massage: arm and trunk. Wish me luck.",

It really increased my understanding. Here's what I found so that was interesting to me based on your comments as well as another health problem that just may be related. Here goes: In my situation, my LE extends from my face to my groin ON THE RIGHT SIDE ONLY. Yes, I am fat, but there is a clear difference in the size on my right side vs my left. MLD and CDT have not improved my significant abdominal LE beyond a temporary softening under my mastectomy incision (with minor reduction in size temporarily). Flexi-touch pump makes it worse. Truncal Compression garments are a joke for me.  Add to that lovely scenario: I was on Aromatase Inhibitors for over 5 years. Ended in fall 2014. In the past 2 years, I have also experienced 4 episodes of post-menopausal vaginal bleeding with no known cause. Recent blood tests revealed high CEA, high CRP, ESR doubled in 6 months and is now a high normal, high neutrophils, rising WBC, low lymphocytes, and a new test for me LDH which is either high normal or high depending on whose chart you look at. CT scan didn't show anything, but then I can't take the contrast dye.  Beyond ordering the tests, my Onc and Primary Care providers did NOTHING -- despite the abnormal test results (which a home health visit doc said was disturbing0. Didn't suggest I see an OB-GYN. Nothing. I had to get my own OB-GYN and make an appt. In the interim, I bled a 4th time a few weeks ago. Two bleeding episodes in one month! To add to my delightful life, I also have an open wound at the mastectomy site which oozes YELLOW fluid. My Wound Care team says its lymph fluid. I have had this open wound for over 2 years which is due to suboptimal CDT treatment by a certified LE-PT. I now wonder if my truncal/abdominal LE is part of the bleeding problem. I have also researched the use of AIs and post-menopausal bleeding and the research is limited although it tends to suggest that AIs are less likely to cause the bleeding, but it still happens for a few women on AIs. No provider has even asked about the AI usage and its possible connection to the bleeding. No provider has wondered if my rampant abdominal LE is somehow involved. If anyone has a similar story, please share. I am at my wits' end.  So much is still unknown about secondary LE. Without sharing our experiences I suspect many of us would be far worse off then we are now. Thank you all for your strength in the face of this chilling disease and its aftermath.  Cheers to all. ",

Not healing too well either as one can expect. NOTE:  Look, Ladies, I am well aware that at my age and weight, a flat stomach is a fond memory. But what I have is what I described:  My right stomach-abdominal area is way bigger than my left. I tried several LE camis and OMG!  Awful results. I did find that an \"open\" spanx-like cami works wonders, however.  Well, I feel & look better, that is.",

I have had healthcare providers ( including my BC surgeon) look at me and ask me \"truncal LE, whats that?\" Including 3 out of 4 LE PTs. The first 2 PTs never recognized it at all. I guess they have female family members that regularly got pregnant in their late 50s on only one side and the 3rd PT ignored it. PT #4 saw and recognized it for what it was: an LE butterball turkey under where my right breast used to be.  I had to literally show PTs 1-3 how much bigger I was on my right side compared to my left. They apparently knew little, and couldnt have kicked their way out of a paper bag titled HEREIN LIES TRUNCAL LE in big bold print on it. Thus! My truncal LE has yet to get truly treated in the 7+ years since I was diagnosed. Aint that a drag. But lucky me submitted a Complaint to my health plan. Not that that unit knew squat either so far. Educating one's health care providers and health plan reps on what it is seems pretty diabolical on their end to me, but its my task right now.  But that lovely issue aside, I was gladdened to read in the nih.gov article above that sitting in a hot tub for a freakin' 15 minutes wasnt going to explode my LE arm. Which is what LE PT #3 (with a Ph.D in Phys Therapy, no less!) told me in 2015. What fries me no end is the soothing, feel-good \"Your LE PT is your go-to care provider for all things LE\" rhetoric. Fellow Travelers, there is never a free pass on not doing your own research into what is and what isnt, especially with secondary LE.  For me, I cant take opiates for pain. OTC drugs can upset my stomach. For me, sitting in a hot tub (and if you must know, I keep my LE arm elevated and out of the water) IS my primary if not only source for pain relief. But, because my nimcompoop LE-PT-with-the-Ph.D said I must stay out of my beloved hot tub, I did. For 7 very looooong pain-filled months, I stayed out.   But then, I met with a vascular doctor in last November --  that ON HIS OWN  became an LE only doctor. Let me repeat: \"On His Own.\"  Because it interested him.  I was sent to him for a consulation because (shock & awe moment here) CDT bandaging was a disaster. Worsened my LE!  My upper arm ballooned to 27\" on 12/30/15.  Thats what my waist measurement was when I was 37 years old ..... and now its my upper arm circumference????? !!!!!! Anyway, HE said there was no real proof that sitting in a hot tub was off limits. Show him the beef!  And now there is this nih.gov article. Another Old Men's Tale of Glory gone to rest. Thank you Erina1986 for sharing it! Made my day. ",
