I had a dx mammo and ultrasound this morning, and they didn't find anything but normal breast tissue in that area. (3 o'clock on the right breast) I had expected to feel totally relieved by the clean bill of health, but now I'm a bit confused. Should I just accept it at face value? I can't insist on a biopsy if they have nothing to biopsy, can I? Oh my, this experience is complex... I hope you get some peace about this, too. Please let us know what happens. ",
