I'm having a hell of a time finding a surgical team willing to perform it here in Oklahoma. Where did you have your surgery done at and who was your surgeon? I had a mastopexy (lift) with augmentation back in 2007 and love love love the results from that surgery. I have consulted with a few PS in the OKC area and only a handfull do \"breast reconstruction\" work. Any suggestions for a team willing to do this procedure for me would be greatly appreciated.",
