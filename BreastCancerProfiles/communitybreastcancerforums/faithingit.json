Ironically, the lump I had found, that caused me to go to the doctor, turned out to be nothing but a \"fat globule\", but the mammogram showed \"calcifications\", leading to the recommended biopsy. I have had yearly mammograms for years and the one a year ago did not show anything.The doctor said the 0 means the cancer was enclosed inside the duct so far. I am awaiting a breast MRI \"to see if there is other cancer there that the mammogram didn't pick up.\" This is very scary, I feel as if I am being cast into a foreign land with a foreign language... I am now doing a lot of research into what promotes breast cancer and what has preventive and/or suppressive effects. Even though I am a nurse, I do not work in the area of cancer. I had harbored NO fears of getting breast cancer! I have long-lived genes in my family, and the only person with breast cancer in my family was a great-aunt who lived 10+ years after her 1970's treatment. She died of other causes. I have been health-conscious for many years, keeping my weight normal, nonsmoking, eating in health-conscious ways, etc.. I don't exercise like I should, though, and this past year I spent many, many more hours sitting in front of a computer than usual because of increased work and school demands. I even put on 7 unwanted pounds this year because of it. But apparently the worst thing I have done - I think - is take postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy for 8-10 years. My GYN started me on it for bone density reasons, and never advised me to stop it, though he was aware every year during my Pap smear visits that I was still taking it. I feel like it is my own fault I got this, that I should have stopped the HRT on my own. I have to work hard at not beating myself up over it. The HRT was the ONLY scheduled medicine I was taking, I am a healthy person overall. This is a scary time. I pray I make the right decisions. Already I am having problems with the healing of the biopsy site because of a hematoma that formed and is persisting. The nurse had to put pressure on the site for a half hour to make the bleeding stop. Has anybody else dealt with that? Please welcome me... ",
