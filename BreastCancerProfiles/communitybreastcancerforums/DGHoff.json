Especially as it gets a little colder, I need to have something on my head. Mostly, I've just been rocking the bald look, even at work. I have five different wigs, but after two hours or so, I can't stand the headache I get from the band around my head, and I end up taking them off, anyway. Plus, they are HOT. Everybody at work is used to it now, and I don't even get any funny looks around town. OK, maybe from little kids, but they are pretty funny sometimes. Several little kids have asked me how come I don't have any hair. Children are SO honest! DeAnn ",

Go figure!  If you go 5 weeks out from when I finished the AC combo, I don't think I had any hair at all by that point. My 5 weeks of growth picture is actually 13 weeks after finishing AC.  So don't worry!  Once you reach a certain point, it will seem like it is growing like gangbusters! Oh, and Jo Anne, you're never too old for the punk look. By the way, a flat iron is just a curling iron that is flat, I think! But I have not used a curling iron for two years, so I'm the wrong person to ask! Good luck with finding a way to tame the sticking up hair. But isn't it nice to have enough hair to have that problem? That's what I keep telling myself whenever I am annoyed with my hair. DeAnn",

The AC was definitely hard on my GI tract and by #4 I ended up with some anal fissures that still haven't completely gone away, and my onc has not wanted me to use anything to treat them because of the whole infection risk. I'm finishing up 12 weeks of Taxol/Herceptin, and I still get a bit constipated on treatment days. I think it is partly chemo drugs, but also the premeds I get. Here's what I've found to be the best solution to keep things grooving. The two days before chemo I make sure to eat lots of fiber. At least 25 grams a day along with at least 10 glasses of water.  The night before chemo, I take one Dulcosat stool softener. Morning of chemo I drink a fresh veggie juice (kale, broccoli, carrot and apple) with a shot of flax oil thrown in, and one more Dulcosat. I drink lots more water that day. I also take an acidopholus pearl every day. The fissures are finally almost gone, but I wish I would have been doing all of this from the beginning to help prevent it from happening in the first place.  Good luck!! ",

I still haven't forgotten about putting a yoga sequence together, but I just haven't had much extra time, and I want to do it right. I will get to it this weekend, I hope.

It's a local organization that pairs up somebody newly diagnosed with breast cancer with a mentor who has been through it themselves.

Judith Lasseter has really been a proponent of restorative yoga over the last few years. For me, yoga isn't so much about the exercise as it is about opening up the flow of energy in my body and allowing myself to be in this space, in this moment. The physical postures were always originally designed to prepare the body to be comfortable in meditation by helping to release tension, remove gas from the body, and build stamina for sitting for long periods. The more vigorous poses like the Ashtanga yoga sequence were really designed for 13 year old boys. That's why so many people get injured. It is because those sequences aren't really meant for grown adults. One of the main benefits of yoga is helping us to reconnect to our bodies. To sit with them in silence and appreciate what it can do versus what it can't do. So, I would say you should never have to give up your yoga practice. After all, if you are breathing mindfully, you are practicing yoga. Your physical practice can definitely be modified to be kind and gentle to bones. There might be yoga for cancer care classes in your area too. I completed a training for cancer care yoga that was really focused on those who might have more physical limitations, so If you would like a sequence suggestion, I'd be happy to put some together for you or anyone else that is interested. -DeAnn",

Sun salutations, for example, can be hard as the constant forward and backward can cause dizziness and messes a bit with blood pressure. Especially when rising up to standing from a forward fold. You could try doing some moon salutations instead which can be a little less intense. See sequence below. I like these for evening or for when I just don't feel like I have the full energy for the sun salutations. ",

She was so tough and was handling most of this by herself. She worked as a bartender while still undergoing treatment, so she didn't have an easy job. And she still got out there and started moving. In her honor, I'm going to go for a walk and dedicate every step to her. In fact, I'm going to dedicate every step to each of you too. Because we all lift each other up, and we are in this together.

My husband I were able to take a trip to Arizona while my 15-year-old son went to stay with his grandparents over his spring break. We knew we were going to do a lot of hiking and hoped to do some backpacking. On one of our first hikes I started out slowly and was having some difficulty with uphills. I was a bit worried that my scarred lungs would not be up to the task of all that we had planned, but I hit my stride on day two! I put in about around 20,000 steps every day for 5 days and had some amazing experiences visiting two national parks, four national monuments, 2 national recreation areas, and one state park. Highlights included: Hiking down the South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon almost to Skeleton Point - 5 miles round trip with 2,000 vertical feet in elevation gain from the turnaround point to the rim. Cold and blustery, but totally worth it! Hiking the Baldwin/Templeton trail in Sedona to Cathedral Rock and climbing up its steep rock face to the top of the saddle. Backpacking into Sabino Canyon outside of Tucson - about 8 total miles with a fully loaded pack (about 23 lbs). I had been to Arizona just briefly before but I was astounded at just how beautiful and fascinating it is. So much ancient history and native culture coupled with jaw-dropping scenery. I can't wait to go back and explore more! A huge discovery I made is my new trail shoes. I have some neuropathy in my feet from all the chemo drugs I've had over the years, and I was worried it would flare up big time with all the hiking we had planned, but I purchased some Altra Lone Peak trail running shoes that were amazingly comfortable and kept my feet completely happy over the entire trip. I didn't even bother bringing a pair of \"camp\" shoes on my backpack overnight because my feet were totally comfortable wearing them the whole day from morning to night. Just a little tip for anybody else out there with difficult feet! It was fabulous, and I'm grateful to you all for keeping me motivated and moving so that I could experience the joys of being out in the wilds!   ",

I don't have any skis of my own, so I have to be content with snowshoeing. We haven't had any snow around Minneapolis this season, but we are headed up north to the cabin for the New Year and they just got a foot of snow, so I know I'll get in some good exercise there. I've been super bad about exercising with only occasional walks and some yoga. Hard to get motivated to get out and do stuff when it is dark and cold all the time. So tonight I kicked my behind into gear and did the 7 minute workout and about 25 minutes of dancing around my living room. Felt good to move! ",

I think those little wheels are sort of like the wheels on a grocery cart and never quite work the way they are supposed to. Not to mention all the cords and tubes that you have to worry about. I wish it were easier to walk around with them as that would be a good way to use the time! Z- so sorry that you are having the leg pain, but glad that the supplements are helping again. I take Turmeric and a product called Breast Defend that includes Curcumin among other things. What AI are you on? I take Femara (Letrazole) and haven't experienced any of the joint issues, although I do have some knee pain where I haven't before. Mostly it's mild so I can live with it. Saw you got your Fitbit charged up and are ready to roll! Yay! Apg - I think Zumba should be fine. I have bone mets too, but I suppose it depends on your own personal situation and if you can tolerate the bouncing. It's Sooo cold and icy here in Minnesota that I haven't been able to get out for my regular walk/run so I've been doing my own version of dance/zumba/aerobics in my living room. We do what works and whatever keeps us moving, right? MSL - Wow! 5 miles is awesome. I have never in my life run that far. I might try to shoot for a 5K but that even seems like a lot to me. I have started up again on the weights too and working on my push-ups. I'm trying to get to five in a row without sacrificing my form, but golly those buggers are hard. I'm at four and can't quite get past it. Just have to keep working on it, I guess. lwrite and zills - sorry you are dealing with the winter colds and viruses. Hope you feel better soon!

But this morning, I had my infusion and turned out my blood pressure was on the low side. I get extra fluids with my Herceptin and Perjeta, and it perked me right back up. It seems I must have been a bit dehydrated. Probably explains the foot cramps I was having last night too. I forget sometimes how much more water I need now that I exercise so much more and with the effects of the medications. Tonight I did 20 minutes running/walking on the treadmill and led a 1 hour core focused yoga practice, then came home and did 10 more minutes of cardio dancing and a few gob squats.

I know that I should be doing more interval stuff, but I just felt like I needed to hit that benchmark just to prove that I could do it. And then I led a 60 minute yoga practice.

I was sorry to see it go, but glad to be done with the Taxol. Kathryn, your diving vacation sounds fabulous! I agree that the sun and the sea have medicinal effects on the body. Hey, that should be a part of every treatment plan, don't you think? It's cheaper than one round of Herceptin/Perjeta and probably has greater effects on the body! For all you smoothie lovers, I use Amazing Grass Green Superfood (chocolate flavor!) and Garden of Life Organic Plant Protein. (I've tried the combined greens and protein Garden of Life stuff as well and I liked it.) Photo below for those of you who are visually oriented like me! This protein powder is the best I've found that doesn't have sugar, whey or soy and that doesn't taste really chalky. A typical smoothie will vary but an example is what I had today: 1 banana, 1 scoop of each of the powders, 1/4 cup frozen Wyman wild blueberries (I buy at Costco), 1 heaping tablespoon of almond butter. About a cup and a half of mixed greens (chard, spinach and kale), sufficient water to blend, and a couple of ice cubes. Sometimes I throw in some broccoli or broccoli sprouts instead of all the mixed greens. When I'm feeling really decadent, I add the coconut milk and some pineapple and use the regular greens powder instead of chocolate flavor. I can pretend I'm having a pina colada.;-)  ",

My 14 year old son actually asked me if I wanted to go for a walk, which was cool. Then my husband and I went to Costco and then walked through the suburban mall parking lots to go to the shoe store and to REI and then did some grocery shopping. I still hadn't gotten in any cardio though so I decided to go for a quick run. I actually had a huge breakthrough during my run today.  I really am not an avid runner. I've never liked running, and the only time I have ever run two miles straight was on a treadmill, which is way easier than running outside. Every time I try to run outside, I seem to get maybe half a mile at most before I have to stop, and I feel like I'm pushing myself the whole time.  Today was different. It started out exactly the  same as usual, but instead of stopping, I willed myself to keep going. About 2/3 mile into it, I thought, oh I should just stop now because this is hard, but then I had a totally different thought.  This morning, I led a yoga and meditation class, and during the meditation, I asked all my students to visualize a ball of golden energy in front of them and to breathe in the energy and send it throughout their body wherever it was needed.  I reminded them at the end of the practice that this energy was always available to them. They only needed to be aware and draw it in.  So I took a tip from myself (we always teach what we most need to learn ourselves, yes?) and I breathed in the energy. And, by golly, it turns out it really did work. Everything got easier.  I was able to run two full miles, and I felt like I could have done more. I was so elated. I'm pretty tired now though, and I'm just going to appreciate this beautiful spring evening sitting outside by the fire table, sipping my dandelion tea and appreciating all of you beautiful people for keeping me motivated, moving, and grateful for what each day brings.  ",

Well, after a super duper active weekend, with biking, and about 9 miles overall of running or walking plus yoga both days, I hit the wall and took it easy yesterday. Got back into the swing of things today with a gentle yoga practice and then a bunch of hard core dancing around the room for about 35 minutes. Feeling sooo much better after taking that one day break and then hopping back in. I think all yoga is helpful, and it is proven to reduce stress response, especially a practice that holds poses for about five breaths or so. We train our brains to stay calm by holding poses and breathing through them. I led a couple of yoga and meditation workshops this last week, and I had several people ask me if I would do some recordings of some easy beginner practices and some of my guided meditations. If anyone has any interest, I would be glad to post that here when I'm done!",

Thinking of you and the lousy no choices, and hoping that tomorrow will be a better day. Z- I'm sorry you had a difficult yoga class. Don't forget, you are dealing with an injury so give yourself time. I know from my own experience how tempting it is to fall into the yoga comparison mind game, especially when taking a class. You feel like you have to keep up with everybody and do all the poses as fast and as well as everybody else. But one of the first precepts of yoga is the concept of \"ahimsa\" which means \"do no harm.\" It means taking the path that your body is ready for today and honoring your body where it is at in that moment. It's also telling the little tyrant in the mind to be kind as well. Any time I start to see my mind wander over into \"I should be able to do better than this\" mode, I try to remember ahimsa. Shetland - I just put the \"move it\" song on my dance party playlist. Thanks for the future motivation! Heidihill - Welcome back from vacation! Mara - Thanks for the reminder on the Leslie Sansone videos. I always forget about those on those days when weather doesn't permit me to get out.",

Finally, yesterday, I couldn't take it anymore and forced myself to get out for a walk in the cold even though I still felt kind of weak. And you know what, I felt sooo much better afterwards. It was plenty cold still, but this is what I dressed like, so I survived just fine! Keep moving! ",

If you put a bar of fragranced soap underneath your bed sheets, it is supposed to stop your leg cramps. Some people swear by it even though there is no explanation for why it works. Some studies are showing that it does, though! Worth trying. I tried it last night and didn't have any major leg cramps. Seems like they were staring up but never got into full-blown cramp mode. I also use Hyland's Leg Cramps pills which seem to work, and I'm told quinine water works too. I'll try anything as those cramps are downright painful!",

Shetland - I think the change of scenery was definitely helpful. I felt so much more energetic in both Cozumel and New Orleans than I do at home. Partly I think its because I so much prefer to be outside in nature, and, until recently, it has been too cold to do that here. Hercpetin makes my eyes and nose all watery in the cold, and it's not as pleasant. I didn't have any of those issues in the warmth. I also get to sleep longer on vacation and there's no work stress!

He fell and broke his right arm ten days ago (he is paralyzed on the right side due to a stroke 14 years ago), and it's been very hard on him and my mom who is his caregiver. Just a few days ago, he couldn't get out of bed and we have discovered he has a sepsis infection so will be in the hospital and rehab for some time. We aren't sure if this is the point where he needs to go to a nursing home full time or if he will be able to be back at home. It's so hard to see our parents suffer. My thoughts go out to you both. Way to go, everyone, with the activity. I was quite a sloth yesterday what with driving 2.5 hours to see my parents and spending a few hours at the hospital.

Z- I can relate a little bit to your story about not wanting to share your MBC diagnosis due to everyone thinking you have a foot in the grave. A local nonprofit group here in Minnesota pairs women newly diagnosed with breast cancer with a mentor who has already been through it. They do learning sessions every quarter and I was asked to lead a yoga/mindfulness session for them. At the end, I was chatting with a lovely woman who was in the midst of chemotherapy. She was terribly weak and was wearing a surgical mask ,but when she found out that I had MBC It was like all of a sudden she felt like she needed to take care of me. Felt like our roles were awkwardly reversed. At any rate, I hope the thyroid issue is OK, and I'm very glad to hear that you are feeling better about things mentally and physically.

Then I tackled one of my raised garden beds and spent about 45 minutes working the soil so that it isn't root bound anymore and going back and forth to the garage for this and that which netted me another 3500 steps.  Those weeds and roots are definitely a pain, Ronnie!   It was a gorgeous spring day here, so my son and I went for a walk around the University campus here in town and another walk at home, and I'm now close to 15,000 steps for the day. I made the mistake of trying to do the monkey bars at the local playground. I only did three rungs as my core muscles were not impressed!  I'm planning to wind down with some yoga and meditation then off to bed for a well-deserved sleep! Thanks for the reminder on Frankinscense oil.  Will be a nice addition to the meditation. ",

Nice work everybody! I am taking another little vacation to New Orleans Saturday through Wednesday, so I've been working extra hours to make sure I get everything at the office done in time. Makes it hard to exercise, and all the computer work is hard on the eyes. Had a headache all day yesterday and was looking forward to getting home only to discover that my husband invited people over for dinner! They are all super dear friends so I love seeing them, but I had to rally to stay alert. I managed to get a 10 minute walk in before they arrived and then did another 20 minutes of stepping, yoga and a few pushups before bed. I was sooo tired though. Honestly, if it weren't for the Fitbit and knowing I would be reporting in to you all, I probably wouldn't have done much. I did feel better after doing the exercise, but was still wiped out. Today was better and I did over 9,000 steps, but just couldn't keep up the gumption to run. Did a few little jogs but mostly walked. It's really cold here again, and Hercpetin makes my nose run, so I just dripped my way down the path. Looking forward to the heat in New Orleans if only to be able to walk without the waterworks!  ",

My naturopath has me taking Coenzyme Q10, grapeseed extract, and Hawthorne tea for heart protection. I'm hoping that keeps the LVEF in the green zone. Hopefully your cardiologist will be able to give you some good insight. I have certainly heard of people taking a break from Herceptin and then going back to it later after LVEF got back to normal. In more than 85% of cases, the heart problems are reversible once you discontinue. BellaTassie - even though Tai Chi and Yoga don't count for steps, I think they have some of the biggest benefits for people. I know I always feel better after yoga or Tai Chi. I led a yoga class tonight so I got most of an hour in and then I got about 10 minutes of running and 20 minutes of walking. Got my 8,000 steps in and might get to 9,000 before the night is out. I could cheat and put my fitbit on my right hand while I play guitar! That would rack up a few extra steps, ha ha! But, alas, it would be a hollow victory knowing I didn't really do the work! ",

We brought our folding bicycles and biked all around town and walked all over too. So much so that I might actually win one of these Fitbit challenges for once, although now that I'm back at work tomorrow, I probably won't be able to rack up 15,000 steps in a day anymore. I'm in two challenges this week. In one of them somebody already has 70,000 steps in and it's only Wednesday! How do people do that? It took me walking all over New Orleans all day in addition to a morning run to get to 20,000 in one day. I was super happy to discover that I had enough energy every day and felt really good.

I may, at some point, cut back, but I've worked full time non-stop through all of this. It's funny, but I think work both contributed to my situation and also saved me this last year. I am the director of a very small, but very significant in terms of revenue, department of my company. I was diagnosed in December 2015. The previous October, one of my long-term employees left to stay at home with her third baby. Then one of my part time people decided she was going to retire. A big blow for a department that only had four people. We hired one person to start that November, but training somebody to do what I do is a minimum year long process. So we were limping along and getting by though I was very stressed, and then I got hit with this cancer thing. I started treatment, hanging in there, working still full time because I couldn't afford to take time off due to lack of staff. Then in February of 2016 my other employee quit, leaving two people to do the work of four. So, in the midst of weekly chemotherapy, working full time, and teaching two yoga classes a week,I had to hire and train in an entirely new department. Honestly, I had no time to be sick . So I just wasn't. I really think that the situation turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I could not spend any energy on worrying about cancer so my mental state was actually really good throughout those first few months because the only alternative was to collapse into a puddle of tears crying uncle. It also opened my and my company's eyes to how much I do and now I'm hiring another person! I learned I really do love my job, but I don't blink an eye about taking extra vacation days. And I get up every hour to run up and down the stairs a few times and if I want to leave early, I just do! Of course, now as I read this I think \"How in the world did I do all of that?\"",

As I read all your struggles with sleep issues I commiserate and remember back to the hardest time I ever had. It was in my first go-round with cancer and I was neutropenic and had to be hospitalized for some unknown infection. I felt miserable, couldn't sleep, and was at the lowest point I think I have ever been in my life. It was so awful and I shudder to think of anyone else having to feel that way. They gave me Ambien and it was horrible! I had night terrors from it too. I climbed out of that dark hole once I started to feel better, but it took time. I feel very fortunate that I almost never have trouble sleeping anymore but when I do, it's usually related to what I've been eating. Cutting out dairy completely was the best thing I did for my health along with the daily exercise. Can't believe what a difference those two things have made. I don't eat chocolate after 5:00 PM. I take 9-12 mg of melatonin each night and try to be in bed by ten. My naturopath is cool with me taking even 21 mg of melatonin if needed. I have wave/rain noises in the background, and I wear a light sleep mask and have total darkness. Try also listening to solfeggio healing frequency music. That tends to knock me out too. Been a slow week for exercise as I onl hit my step goal three times. I've done a little something each day though, and that's what matters. We just keep doing it. Even a little. DeAnn",

I've had a really busy week, and I hadn't had enough water to drink all day, and my dinner was unusually heavy so I just didn't feel great.

By the time I was finishing my walk, I had gone two miles, and I was feeling so content and so grateful and amazed at the difference one little walk can make.

It made me look downward a bit more on my walk, and that's when I saw these pretty little pink flowers along the path. A reminder to me to look everywhere for beauty.

Don't like those uncertain reports so this is a relief! I have taken up some new exercise. My husband has finally decided to agree with me that maybe backpacking isn't the worst idea ever, so we are planning a backpacking trip end of March in Arizona. We've been tromping down the sidewalks with our fully loaded bags to get our bodies used to this idea. It's been a few years since my last trip, and I haven't done more than about 3 miles with a big pack since my diagnosis, so I am pretty excited to get back out into the wilds!

With bone mets in one vertebrae and one hip, I know I have to be a little careful, but I also will not give up my sweet camp chair or air mattress regardless of how much they weigh. I am amazed at how much easier it is for me now than just a year and a half ago. I did a three mile backpack trip at that time and was just a few months out from chemo and had not been spurred into consistent movement by you wonderful people. I am a lot stronger now!

I had another bone scan just last year after my mets diagnosis and it no longer showed Osteopenia, so I think the yoga I was doing had some effect. Of course, I have bone mets, so it didn't prevent that, but I'm lucky that I've had no pain or issues from the bone mets so maybe the yoga helped keep the bones strong despite that.",

That's a good idea. I use hand weights and kettle bells (gonna try those gob squats lwrite mentioned), but I like the idea of resistance bands. It really sounds like your strength is returning. So, I teach a yoga class on Thursday nights and I usually do a little treadmill work at the gym before the class. Yesterday I did about 25 minutes running on the treadmill and then thought, hey, I'm going to mix it up a bit and use the elliptical for the last 10 minutes. I only did 5! It turns out that things you don't usually do are way harder than you think! It was a good reminder that we have to keep mixing it up and not always do the same thing in order to have the best fitness. Did a 35 minute walk tonight and now I'm going to do a few push-ups and then off to bed. I have to get up early tomorrow. My son is headed off to high school next year and we are looking at multiple schools. He has a placement test tomorrow for one of them, so we have to be there bright and early! -D",

I'm sitting at my infusion right now and am going to use the last half hour to mediate. Tonight I WILL do some running and I teach a yoga class, so I know that will help me get back on track.

Sure makes it hard to get out and exercise! I have, however, still managed to keep my 8,000 steps per day goal plus a little extra most days. Being in Mexico was great for exercise! I walked or ran almost every day and snorkeled and swam most every day as well. There was one day we did a day trip to the mainland and explored the ruins of Tulum and did a special tour that included zip lines, snorkeling through underground rivers, and rappeling down into a cenote! It was great to be feeling good and active and able to forget about things for awhile. I was worried that having a herceptin/perjeta treatment right before might not be so wise, but I didn't really have any ill effects aside from a little headache on my travel day. Lwrite - I hope your vacation is great as well! Way to go Lulu! So glad that you are seeing improvement! When I was first diagnosed, I was really having trouble breathing and could barely do a circuit around the hospital wing. The weird thing was I was getting enough oxygen, but the tumors in my lungs made it feel like I couldn't get enough air. It's the worst feeling, I know. The good thing is that, once I started treatment and got the tumors knocked down, I felt so much better and improved pretty rapidly. It's amazing how just focusing on doing a little bit every day, it does get easier, and you eventually surprise yourself with what you can do. I went from struggling to breathe, to doing canoe trips in the Boundary Water wilderness just six months later. And I have to say, I don't know how all you amazing FitBit people manage to get so many darned steps in! Even when I was on vacation and had loads of extra time, I still didn't come out on top of the various challenges. And this week, well, I'm struggling to fit it in with work, but I'm grateful that you all keep me motivated!",

I struggle to eat enough to maintain my weight, especially now that I exercise so much more. I really avoid grains as my naturopath doesn't really recommend them except maybe two to three times a week. Every morning, I start with a smoothie with banana, almond butter, a good plant based protein powder, some kind of greens, and a some kind of powdered greens. That gives me a good 300 or so calorie boost for the day, and if I really want to up things, I add some canned coconut milk (not the watery stuff in the refrigerator case, but the real stuff in the cans). Making sure I do that each day really does help. I will say, however, that when I expressed concern to my naturopath that maybe I wasn't getting enough calories, she said there is a fair bit of evidence that, as long as I'm not hungry, it's not such a bad thing. Mostly you just need to make sure you are getting sufficient protein. Since I started adding the almond butter and protein powder to my smoothies, I always feel like I have enough energy. Of course, we are all different with our food needs, but it works pretty well for me. Good luck! DeAnn ",

I'm not noticing any changes yet after just two, no change in energy or soreness or anything. I hope it continues like that.  Oh, I had mentioned Curcumin earlier - it's the stuff in Turmeric that gives it color, and it has been shown in some studies to have lots of anti-cancer properties and can help the skin. I  bought it at my local natural foods store. I don't think there is a \"recommended\" dose, so I'm just taking two capsules a day. It's really just food, so I figure it can't hurt, and it if helps, all the better. We'll see. Dragongal, I think the number of treatments depends on how large your tumor was, etc. I'm getting 28, but I had a mastectomy, so I don't how it would compare.

I've been working full time except for having to leave early to go to treatment, and I go to an intense yoga practice three times a week and continue to do brisk walking 2 miles a day/5 days a week. If you are used to a high level of activity now, and if you keep up with solid nutrition, and make sure you get plenty of sleep, etc. you'll probably be fine. I think most of the studies show that staying active does help keep fatigue at bay. I only have 3 rads to go, and my skin is still in great shape, so that makes it a lot easier too. I would think that if your skin really burns, it would be a lot harder to be really active.  I hope it all goes easily for you, but don't feel bad about taking it a little easy if you need to. It's a lot for a body to go through! DeAnn",

The purple matchbox car is a great description.  I have to admit that I hated my port too, although I was semi-grateful for it on infusion day. I had a year of Herceptin, after chemo, but I just couldn't bear to keep the port. It was OK during the winter when I had lots of sweaters to cushion it, but once spring came, I had it removed by my plastic surgeon the same time he did the implant exchange.  I still had to face about 4 more months of pokes in my arm, but it was so worth it to get it out early! The one thing that worked for me was I cushioned the seat belt with a little pillow.   DeAnn ",

My PS has found in his practice, and the studies are backing him up, that there is less risk of infection, etc if done before rads starts. There is definitely greater risk of capsular contraction when you do rads with an implant, but the radiation shouldn't hurt the implant at all. It just depends on how much scar tissue builds up around the implant. He said that massaging it should help a lot to decrease the buildup. Also, I'm getting one that has some surface texture and that is supposed to help keep the scar tissue from building. What kind of implant did you get?  Angie, I hear you on the tattoos. I figure if I'm gonna have a tattoo I should at least show it off to folks. Oh, and I have one of those crystal deoderant sticks, and they work AMAZINGLY well. Even my husband has switched over to using one because they really do keep you from stinking!  DeAnn ",

I'll start rads about two weeks later. He said that the studies are all showing less problems with infections, etc, by doing the exchange beforehand.  It does make a certain amount of sense since the radiation really does affect your tissue a lot.  DeAnn  ",
