I am one such guy that had the privilege of dating a lady with Metastatic Breast Cancer with bone mets and I can assure you it didn't deter me in any way. We didn't work out for other reasons that had nothing to do with her illness but she was awesome and we shared a wonderful 5 months together. If whomever you chose to date is of the same mind set as me, then they will be honoured to be with you, not because of the cancer, but because they like you for you. Illness should never be a deciding factor when it comes to love and, for me, it wasn't. She had a single mastectomy and it wasn't an issue at all for me because it was her personality I fell for (not to mention she had the most amazing cute smile too). I guess what I am trying to say is that you should keep your standards regardless of your situation and look for those that deserve you and you will find them. They are out there.. Belenus",
