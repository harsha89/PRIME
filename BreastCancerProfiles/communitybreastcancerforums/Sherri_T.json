Dara thanks for the baking soda rinse tip. I survived the first infusion and felt good until a couple hours after words then felt 'off' Had terrible acid reflux and didn't get much sleep so hope I can nap today. They had some trouble accessing my veins for the infusion so I am going to have a PICC line installed. I asked about a port but my MO didn't feel it is necessary. Oh I will be doing AC-T. Enjoy your day ladies",

I'm a 51 yr old (ugg!) single mom with a son at home and daughter away at school, but nearby. Trying to keep a positive attitude and find the upside in situations if I can. Glad to 'meet' you all and look forward to having people to go through this journey with that truly understand! Still working on my signature ",
