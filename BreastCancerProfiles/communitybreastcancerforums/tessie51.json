I have a weird shaped lump with pain and bruising in my left breast now that has been there for over a month so I went to my Oncologist for her to check it out. I have many cysts in my breast anyway so normally they'll feel around and say, \"Feels like a cyst so nothing to worry about' so that is what I was hoping for this time. Instead she said I needed to get it tested right away. I have a mammo, US and biospy ( if needed) planned for Monday 09/09. Just wondering what's the chance of it being cancer again and would it be considered a reoccurance or a new cancer? what determines that? Thanks. It's good to have a site to come to to get your fears out in the open. Hope I can be of help sometimes. Tessie  Log in to post a reply",

The reason I had to wait so long is because I am on a blood thinner because of having mechanical valve in my heart and I had to be off of it for 5 days. The radiologist said it looks suspicious but can't be sure until after biopsy-then, of course, 3-4 days after that. Oh well, at least I'll know by the end of the week. I will let ya'll know my results. Thanks",
