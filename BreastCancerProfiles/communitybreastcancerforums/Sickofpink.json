My mother is also not helpful, my chemo is all about her that's why I enlisted girlfriends so she wouldnt feel she needed to come 'help' My daughters helped hugely with the dinner but my one had a meltdown about my 'cancer germs' after i touched a slice of turkey - i am cancer free now, this is preventative- so that was odd but it passed and ended well. They liked my wig and thought my buzzed head was artistic, ha. It is cold though and my nightcap feels silly looking. Locks of love is too picky for my dyed hair so im sending it to a children with hair needs group. Good night all, thankyou for making this holiday complete. Xo",

But I dont want my almost grown girls to freak out any more than they already are by cutting back with them too much --and since the doc said to rest as much as possible and only exercise to half the old extent - i hope i will get better faster and not delay any chemo rounds, so may save money in the long run. That said, i worked 8 hours yesterday including prepping to teach a 3 hour class with a 90 min commute (i got a ride) but i have to think on the spot so wanted to have notes in case of chemo brain. Today i am in bed paying for it, exhausted and getting a cold but have cancelled further teaching and consultation projects so i can prioritize other projects at home - my mothers finances and promo stuff for my novel coming out in may) during the rash of good hours each day or so, building up toward the third week before the next chemo. But no new creative work, that part of my brain is dormant. I lay here thinking of you gals....",

Can't get credit card out of wallet, maybe that's a good thing. Still bleeding from everywhere, too. And I look like my dad, too! But I love your pic. I am fine to be bald around home and wear scarves out, it's just bad enough looking in mirror to put picture out there. Lazy, but wimpy, too. You are far beyond that. Oh, turns out 5/7 is release date, something about tracking lists for sales. (Presale helps the inital print run and at 50 cents per book or whatever I need to sell a lot to pay these medical bills, sigh.) How are we all managing?! Eleni, good luck with Bart info.

And Luvbugs - my day is EXACTLY the same as yours! My doc woudln't admit when she called my cell on that Friday as I was headed to meet a friend for a hike and wanted me to drive through LA traffic on a holiday Friday to hear it in person. Woudl have taken 3 hours for bad news! So yes, she finally admitted it and I saw her on Monday - she was working the holiday. I still didn't believe it and figured it would be an easy surgery and all done. HA! My frist mammo came back clean, so I should be happier, but just frustrated. Trying to rest but have high expectations. Amazing so much can happen/change in one year. Soteria, sorry that table hurts so much, what a drag. Sneaky, I think of you when I exercise, will take some time to be back where I used to be. Michelle wish I coudl hold your hand like I know you are holding your mum's. Keet, my daughter was in town and dyed my hair last weekend - took 2 boxes to make the brown stick. Still looks weird, but oh well. I hate looking in the mirror unless I have a ton of eye makeup on. I wear a wig about once a week to go out. I don't get how people shave their heads to be supportive. Milkyway, I hope the bone pain isn't still from the chemo. Mine, like bugs is from hormone blockers - I switched to Aromasin, but still feel arthritic and stiff jointed. Can barely reach back to hook bra. Someone told me the aches go away after 3-4 months, so my stiff, swollen fingers are crossed. I start visiting book clubs at knitting stores this week and not only has it been a while since I've knit - I wonder if it woud be impossible - or actually good therapy to move my fingers like that. This week is the Herceptin infusion in my port  -the chemo-lite but I find myself more irritable and angry at each one now, especially the night before. Not so sick of pink anymore, but definitly sick of it all. Once I'm there it's okay, like being on an airplane for a few hours, but oh, I hate knowing I have to get up a dawn to numb my port and waste the day, etc.  Wednesday I have to shoot a Youtube video for Purposeful Women series - should I take the wig off a la whatsername in Sex in The City?  I think of you gals all the time, hope you are feeling like the worst is over. But when people ask how you are, and you say better (but exhausted or achy or in between dark moments), don't you want to run after them and say..but still not how I want to be? I feel like before it was obvious I needed help, but now...I still do They say chemo lasts in your body for 2 years. The hair thing might be a good reminder for us all to be gentle with ourselves. And pray for those of us who are still in harms way. xo",

I'm hoping they get better now and heal along with my taste buds....and my brain fog (I'm with you, Paula!)",

My surgeon was reluctant to even give me all those diagnostic codes (thry were on the printout but like a different language) since he got all of it out. And the scans to chek for any other areas are not as bad as you think - take zanax on the way. An they call quickly with results so no need to woryy, just figure each appt is just another thing on you to-do list. I don't know much about zoloft but doesn't it take a few weeks to get in your system as a regular help?

Doesn't seem like loose hair to warrant tape or wrap though, a few strands look longer - Mostly bald though, and getting used to it. Eleni, I'm on day 6 now, did errands today, felt good to be normal, and have easy company here but active company on day 8 (not by choice) so maybe we'll order in... Keetmom - so hard to live in clutter when you need peace! We were ready to look to move before dx so put it off, then the electrical all went out on this old house day after round 1 so workmen were here fixing and landlord felt so bad he finally said he'd fix leaky roof right away ! I said no thansk, ratehr deal woth toxic house than dust and construction work, ugh. Do you have an OCD friend to come and help organize? Or splurge on a maid service for a day? Yikes. Hope everyone else is doing okay - if I scroll back to anther page, I'll lose this post again, so... So...xoxo",

Nails black and fingers numb, but brain was clicking, raring to go. By the time I got up and looked in the mirror and saw my eyelashes were gone, the window was sliding shut. Changed avatar because I'm sick of being Sick of Pink! I want this to be a blip in the screen, to be back to normal. New normal, wtvr.  Then I wondered if I brought this on by tempting fate with a character in What a Mother Knows who has breast cancer. She's very minor and only actually appears on a few pages towards the end, but her appearance causes a huge revelation. I put her in initially, based on experience with my mom's lymphoma a few years back, but  ths gal had lost her beautiful hair and...if she wasnt there, would this have happened?  Does anyone believe destiny (beyond genetics) or just random coincidence?",

Wonderful news. And good luck with the walking Mafe. Anybody else stiff and achy these days? Whenever I feel good enough for regular exercise -Bam - exhaustion is a reminder. Hope you are hanging in there Junebug - and phooey on Angelina. Of course she's pretty, that's her job. Yours is to get better.  As much as I think it's great she did that, so have many other women who did not need to publicize it (she's not doing anyone any favors), and doing it after you have been diagnosed, especially when you ALSO have chemo, rads, etc is much more challenging. I recall asking my doc if I could do that instead of chemo, but he said no. I was told she is I'm up now with my usual acid indigestion, thinking I need to change my diet completly since chemo sensitivity seems to be baack. Books events tied in with end of rads and now things are settling down in time to start the generic arramidex (sp) hormone blocker tomorrow - just before I go to SF to DD's graduation. Hoping no side effects ruin the trip. Have to stop in bookstores to make nice and sign stock as well - if anyone wants a signed bookplate to put inside cover, let me know. How is everyone's hair coming along? I finally mastered fake eyelashes, but real ones are starting to grow back. Am using Latisse, too.  My doc said more than 2-3 drinks PER WEEK raises EVERY woman's chance of breast cancer 8% above baseline. Just when I was wanting to drink MORE! Oh well, time for bone density tests, and MRI and back to dentist and all that. Okay, take care everyone! G'night. xo",

She keeps her hair short but not this short. And I wear a TON of eyeliner but forgot to take off my glasses for the pic. Keetmom, mine is not long enought to gel yet. Yours looks great! And I can't beleive Maryah had to wax, I had to shave my legs, but that's it. Anyone tried to dye it yet? Anyone wearing more tribal jewelry? Apart from covering the port? Classic clothes don't seem to work as well either, as much as more unstructured flowy things with camis to covver port...Latisse is working. But I'm still getting those needles put down my tearducts every few weeks to open them from scarring from the taxotere. Better, though. And almost half fingernails now, but ugly  --and covering black and missing toenails with boring summer shoes. Maryah, I didn't get an option for Femara, but I did switch from Arridex to Aromasin this week, we'll see if the little old lady joint and arthritic stiffness lessens...was hurting after getting up from any sitting, but also to walk on feet in the morning. No panic attacks though, at least not from the meds as far as I can tell. Yesterday I went to a weddign that was today...so chemo brain is still in effect. And fatigue! My tests were fine but now bone density issues, I guess that's normal but the hormone blockers will make it worse..it's always something, right? I still have Herceptin infusions until November - does anyone know how soon we can get the port out after ther last use? Keetmom, you are gorgeous! I still am with Michelle (hope your mom is ok) not knowing what vitamin K is. And whats the deal with grapefruits? Lovebugs, you can come and not clean my floor anytime! And I'm glad you liked my NYT Modern Love piece on the 23rd..(it was that impossible thing I spend the winter trying to write with bloody nails and chemo brain) so so lucky it got published - and it got responses from all over the world. I mainly wrote it to help sell my book and pay some medical bills, not sure if it helped, but people were so warm not just about the romance part but about the cancer journey. Remember that we are not alone. Unfortunately at least each week another person reaches out to me in confidence with a new dx so I spend a lot of time on the phone as I'm sure you all do - it's weird to be on this end of it (hoping that this is the home stretch aside from maintenance), but it's nice to share this information we learned the hard way and through the good grace of finding eachother and being able to pass it forward. xo",

I had my first real date out with hubby last night in what seems like forever and all i could think of was you gals and the countdown to Thursday and organizing help while he leaves town for work again and and doing my own work and trying to help with the usual family drama without getting caught up in it too much. i have my biggest hike today, started walking after a few days longer and longer then finally braved a yoga class on Saturday and another yesterday. It helps my digestion and mood and im not as strong as i used to be but feel more like myself -- and more energetic for a few hours after. I find i can do one big thing a day tho and tomorrow it will be teaching my 3 hour night class in my wig counting fown the hours until thursday am chemo. I found scarves to be the most comfy and will order another from headcovers.com. But now that my head is buzzed my hair is still there, not bald yet . Is it because it isnt heavy enough? Or will it? Also the Bullet is great for smoothies but i heard juicing later helps hsir growth. Also anyone notice their hot flashes lessen? Ok time to get out of bed and face the mirror....

Keetmom, I can't imagine staying awake on all that benedryl, so good luck with the hives. TxJunebugs, my neuropathy seems to be lessening, but may return  - Loafer, it started on tips of fingers then toes, knuckles are stiff, but who knows? Tastebuds coming back too - I'm eating everything in sight now, carbs especially. Thanls for the reminder about Claritin. And yes, exercise does help...but after a few hours, bam, pooped.  You Buckeye gals, I can picture those drives since I'm from Columbus and fingers are crossed that the roads are not icy.

She got it because of whatever whacked out version of universal causality made it happen. And you saved her life by giving her the opportunity to to learn what could have awaited if she had no idea. Maybe the bright side for your daughter might be that she can get great fake boobs and never need an excuse - for saving her own life. How strong you all are. 5Lovebugs has helped keep me posted - I've been swamped with writing blogs and essays with my book coming out next week and I'm SOOOOO tired. Sometimes, my topic dives right into Cancer, and I worry that it sounds like an excuse or an invitation for extra help or pity ...and yet it's not, but I do need help. And I need to say no more often. I did an essay about my daugher growing up --then I got cancer. About my newish marriage - and then I got cancer. Interviewers ask what I am working on now..and I write: answering these questions! This is hard enough! We are all here, and not hiding this, but it shouldn't define us either. Not any longer than it has too, and of course it has to, to get through it much of the time...A long tunnel. Mostly I feel like a puppet whose strings are usually not tight enough, A marionette. I trip a lot, too, Anyone else? One more week of rads but still stiff etc from chemo. A gal before me at rads is using Rogaine! Anyone else? I'm trying Latisse now for eyelashes, but nothing yet. Has anyone had luck with fake eyelashes? I just put on eyeliner and thick framed glasses so far. My eyes still tear too much for anything to stick. Getting better, though. Have finally mastered scarves enogh to show others when I do my chemo lite infusion. Has anyone started hormone blockers? I want to put it off for a few weeks until after my main book events. Willnot be traveling, just too tired. Now I have to find a dress that covers my port, gloves to cover my nails that are mostly gone, shoes to cover my black toes, a wig, eyelashes ---I feel like an imposter of myself. Then maybe I'll wait until after my birhtday, Then wait until...I don't want to take hormone blockers at all. Anyone else Her + on them yet?

Bad news for a writer! i worked a lot on day 7 then couldn't move day 8 ---found i could do one activity well each day, shop, work, or exercise. I started eating ok yesterday and worked all day today and will have to rest more tomorrow but feel myself getting sharper and stronger and am planning accordingly to advantage of my good third week. So it seems like the chemo brain works in cycles but i hope it's not cumulative. Last week i wouldn't have been able to spell that! Eleni, i have zero interest in sex but managed to muddle through during week 3. Can't imagine how hard that would be with your treatment history. I had no sensitivity but DH was happy, so I anticipate the same over the weekend lol. Wifely duty. If only i was allowed to drink then i'd put on my blonde wig and dance around - and it would be over even more quickly, ha! As for hair, even my buzzed short hairs are coming out now, rubbing sgainst the soft hats i wear in the house. I got some fake bangs so fashion hats look tres french outside the house. Wigs are ok but just feel like a big deal to put on - involves makeup! I finally got a short one that seems easier. And i don't like people thinking i have cancer cuz i dont - i only knew i did for 2 months til the surgeries were over, this is preventative for me! But fighting cancer still sucks. I dont want pity, just patience! Txjunebugs your boss seems clueless, but then i guess thats normal til we learn the hard way. 5 livebugs why did u delete your post? Hope ur okay. Xo",

I told him I was worried about the cumulative effects of the Taxotere and Carboplatin he had mentioned and he actually paused before turning around to say, \"You are exactly right: this next month will be the hardest.\"  No dancing nurses or purple hearts, but at least fair warning. Txjunebugs, hope you are doing okay after your last round! 5LUVBUGS, I was still bleeding 2 weeks post Valentines day, so onc sent me to new gyno..turns out it wasn't the Fuller Brush man, but my own hard, purple, lifting off nails - I cut myself inside taking out the Today Sponge. And chemo keeps us from healing, have you noticed? Anyway, I am in menopause, these hot flashes are not all steroid caused, so no more of that. Gyno also said there is a new genetic test required as of 1/1/13 - we all missed it - called the BART - more detailed than the Bracha. But not covered by insurance. As if we need more bad news. Eleni I hope you are feeling better. And KEETMOM, a vacation sounds perfect. And I hope the silicones take the sting out of the ovary surgery.  I already have implants, but radiologist says they will likely have to be replaced after teh effect of rads. MEGAN2 how much biotin do you take? I am so over trying to look cute, with makeup or hair or clothes, not in the mood for fashion mags or shopping..seems hopeless so why bother? I'm with you SNEAKY and MACYHEN and MARIANNE --It's about the hair. I still can't have salad or fruit or sushi (as if I could taste it) but in a month when the TC stars clearing, want to go full speed with biotin if you think that helps.  My eyes are watering again so I keep doing the needle in the tear duct thing - and eye doc said Latisse is great, but only for lashes we already have. Oh well. Novel went to press so had to be working to check final edits, omg, can only hope I didn't mess it up. I thought this would be an ideal activity, promoting the biggest book of my life from bed... but I'm so afraid it will just be a missed opportunity and bad timing and I'll never have a creative thought in my head again..Waiting to hear if Target will pick it, then at least you can all point out where the chemo brain kicked in... Took over a week to be able to walk the neighborhood and yesterday I did walk near the beach.. today the weather is gorgeous but I can barely move, so am trying to stay in bed, of course I'll try to work, always end up just wasting time not resting not working well. ugh The sky is blue, but have to avoid sun, so will imagine months to come, when we are all better. xo",

I'm a bit overwhemed with all the blogging I have to do with limited brain power and am EXHAUSTED. But thinking of you...Thanks for the arr. tip, Soteria. Lovebugs, I have my port due to continued infusions every three weeks til November, but then I'm getting rid of it immediately! Finally bought tops to cover it for summer (banana republic 40% sale when I bought high neck dress for book events). Still have needles put down my tear ducts every three weeks, this never ends. Only 3 more days of rads, though. Time for aloe on the boob now..and sleep around the no sheet drenching hot flashes.  Strength to you, Eleni. Keet, I'm glad it's easier, sounds scary. Mafe, smart to get a home nurse! Oh, so What A Mother Knows ebook is May 1, paper is May 7. Not sure about Target, but soon. Next printing (fingers crossed for it) I will add you all to the acknowledgments, thank you all for sharing and helping us all get through this and not giving up. What an amazing group here in cyberspace.   Wish it was in person.... xo",

I have an infusion next week - and at least it distracts from my Aromosin aches. Tonight she wants her pain meds early (doc said no) but wonlt take the meds to relax, wants to call a cab and go home - to the apt she fell down the stairs n. I could call her sister to visit, but her sister woudl give in and take her out where she could get bumped and hurt her arm before the plates have healed, or tirp since she's on meds. I'm cancelling book things righ and left - was slowing down anyway now to take the moth to rest, ha! but doing Skype book clubs and a knittingchannel.com thing and hired part tiem caregiver, but different ones and my daughter is polite to them but yells at the waste when they leave, I just need a break....ugh she is yelling at me again......",
