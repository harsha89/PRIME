I had remission in Sept. 2011 but it only lasted for one month. I've been in treatment ever since and changing chemo drugs this week. Please ease my mind, and tell me it's still possible to get to remission.

I am just beginning to discover all the stuff going on with my lungs. Mainly I have pleural effusions but one lung has a lot of fibrosis and doesn't work well. Right now, I am on a treatment holiday. Waiting to find out next step in treatment. I hope to have scans soon to find out where everything stands.",

NED after 1st cancer diagnosis before I received news of Stage IV with Mets.  I know how incredible that 5 yr. mark feels.  I can't wait to feel it with Mets.  Congratulations and keep it up!!!  I'm in your corner!",

I try to keep everything as normal as I can for them. I also talk to them about who they can talk to if they need support. I make sure they have friends who know I have cancer and they feel comfortable talking to them. I also make sure they have adults to talk to if they don't want to talk to me about it. Most importantly, I just shower them with love everyday. Hope this helps.",
