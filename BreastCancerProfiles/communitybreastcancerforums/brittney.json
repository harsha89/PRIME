I hate going to sleep when it is daylight but I can't seem to sleep and when I lay down the thoughts just spin in my head worse.I need to find a way to sleep before I am just falling over tired.I know it is not good to do this.If I did not have the other symptoms I might not worry as much.I am looking at the worst outcome and I will be surprised(pleasantly)if I don't have it.I just feel in my heart with the facts I have that I do.I am just wondering how bad it is really and all that comes next and if the place is good.My last viewing was eight years ago but neg.so how bad it could get.I really rather be prepared than blindsided with it.I do know I am going to make some life changes like quiting smoking and lose some weight and make better food choices as I am about 50 pounds overweight so some good will come out of this regardless! Thank you to every person that takes the time out of their life to answer mine and the many other peoples questions! It helps so much!",

I dont have insurance and am currently not working and I don't know how that works.I had to get a referal from the health department to get these additional views as I don't even have a doctor.I googled the hospital and could not even find anyones reviews of the place! It is hard to believe there is nothing really written bad about them! I wonder if that is the best place to go for treatment around here?I live right outside Knoxville.I have tried to stay positive but I am a wreck!My appointment is the 8th.I made the mistake of google imaging breast cancer.I don't know what to expect or what is coming next.I much rather know even the bad and details if possible.I have always had fibrodal(whatever)breast tissue but the lumps I feel are more defined.My breasts are about a cup different anyway since I had my children about eighteen years ago but I am really worried because the one that itches so bad is the smaller one.I also have some discharge of a very light tan color but the look has not changed or my nipples flattened.Oh and my grandmother had BC and her sister and both had a breast removed and another died of cancer in her forties.If anyone could answer any questions I have I would be really greatful.I just feel lost.
