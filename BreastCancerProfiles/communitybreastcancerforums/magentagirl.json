I am wondering if anyone can tell me some good docs in the Hartford/Storrs area of CT? If you don't want to post them please send me a private email. I am interested in an oncologist and a plastic surgeon-especially one that is good with implants. I had to deal with an HMO for the first part of my treatment and my surgeon recommended a NON skin-sparing mastectomy. SHe said that then my chest would be nice and flat to facilitate wearing a prosthesis. Brother, now that I am trying to get expanded I know what terrible advise that was. Anyway, I want better for my sister, who was such a tremendous help and support to me so I would appreciate any help from you New England gals.  Dx 3/13/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 1/1 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Doctors have developed strategies to minimize the risk of damaging the heart muscle with Adriamycin. These strategies include: avoiding the drug altogether in patients who already have heart disease; keeping the total dosage given to each patient below a certain \u201cthreshold\u201d value; and monitoring the patient\u2019s cardiac function by means of the MUGA scan. The MUGA scan (MUltiple Gated Acquisition scan) is a noninvasive test that produces a moving image of the heart. From this image, the health of the heart\u2019s major pumping chamber (the left ventricle) can be assessed. A MUGA scan is performed by attaching a radioactive substance, Technetium 99, to red blood cells, then injecting the red blood cells into the patient\u2019s bloodstream. (The level of radiation to which a patient is exposed during this test is considered minimal.) The patient is then placed under a special camera (a gamma camera), and with some fancy computer manipulation, a \u201cmovie\u201d of the beating heart is made. From this moving image, the MUGA scan gives an accurate and reproducible way to measure the ejection fraction of the left ventricle. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an excellent measure of overall cardiac function.The ejection fraction is simply the proportion of blood that is expelled from the ventricle with each heart beat. So, for instance, if the left ventricle ejects 60% of its blood volume with each beat, the LVEF is 0.6. (A normal LVEF is 0.5 or greater.) While there are other ways to measure the LVEF (such as the echocardiogram), the MUGA scan measures it more accurately than any other method. In situations where it is important to detect minor changes in a patient\u2019s LVEF \u2013 such as in following patients receiving Adriamycin \u2013 most experts believe the MUGA scan is the best test available. Before a patient receives their first dose of Adriamycin, a MUGA scan is usually performed, both to establish a baseline LVEF, and to rule out pre-existing cardiac disease. The MUGA scan is then repeated after a certain amount of Adriamycin is administered (400 milligrams of Adriamycin per square meter of surface area \u2013 a number determined by the patient\u2019s height and weight). More MUGA scans are repeated periodically, as more Adriamycin is given. If the patient\u2019s LVEF begins to decrease, then the doctor and patient must reconsider the risks and benefits of continuing with Adriamycin in view of this apparent early cardiac toxicity. Thus, the MUGA scan plays an important role in allowing Adriamycin to be used in the treatment of cancer, while minimizing the risk of cardiac toxicity. I had MUGA's throughout my treatment  because I was on Herceptin which can damage the heart. Best to you.",
