    "Content": "Dec 31, 2015 10:41AM - edited Dec 31, 2015 10:42AM by carolj316 I just comleted my RADS and will have a follow up w/BS -Oncologist and will start an AI soon. My concerns are not the slightly red breast I have...it is doing okay. Some slight itchyness...but that is all. My question or concerns are-this is a second breast cancer and different from 2007 on rb. This on lb is a new cancer DCIS as before, but estrogen, prog. (-). My reasearch online has indicated that for woman=post menopausal and for (+) breast cancer tamoxophen is good. I took that for 5 yrs. in '07 w/first DCIS. Now--I do not understand why I would take an AI--since it doesn't seem it would be okay w/ (-) condition...on my lb w/this new- second DCIS. Any comments or clarification would be appreciated. Happy New Year..caroljean316",
