I do wear it, but wear little turbans with scarves much of the time. I ended up buying those at the  Faith & Hope boutique at U of Penn when I went for a second opinion. I heard about Buffs from another woman & will take a look at that now!!!!  Good luck. I am usually on the Cytoxan Taxotere discussion but feel free to PM me if you have more questions. With strength, momat",

I cut my hair very short a week before starting.  My friend came with me and I cried but then actually liked it!  Clumps started coming out about day 13 or 14 after my first chemo. I went to my hairdresser and she shaved me so I wouldn't have to deal with clumps. At first I was devastated, but now I don't care. All part of trying to fight cancer.  I wear scarves most of the time & the wig for special outings.  I actually get compliments on my scarf which I think is a riot. Hang in there Susan.  We can continue talking.  It can be scary, but somehow doable. Are you going to any local  supports  like  Gildas Club?  I am considering something but hard to get myself anywhere lately.  I went to a free Look Good Feel Better makeup session.  It was fun. There were women there were women there ranging from 27 to 70 's.   We were given free makeup- some decent.   Talk soon, Amy",

Initially, my Abington Onc recommended dose dense ACT. The Penn dr. recommended TC 4 to avoid possible heart issues. My Abington dr agreed with that option. So I have settled on chemo before radiation. This was not an easy decision. Your wisdom helped me beyond words. Thank you. I think now I will join discussions about TC and begin to prepare for this next lap. Hugs to all- I mean it. Amy",
