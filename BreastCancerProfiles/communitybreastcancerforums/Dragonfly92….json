Will they do IMRT for your left sided treatment?  My Dr finally had to show me the computer diagrams of the treatment and radiation counts affecting the areas. It did help and all I had to do was ask. I am having 79 beams of IMRT + regular rads on the superclav.  it takes anywhere from 30 min to 45 min depending on x-ray days. Good luck to both of you!!",

I have to keep thinking that any SE is better than cancer. He really is a caring person...in the office, before I went into treatment, he prayed with me to have strength and healing.",

When we were done he made sure I understood and had no other questions. He did say I asked some good questions that he had never been asked and said no one ever asked to see the computer layout of the treatment plan. Do to some early confusion as to my treatment plan we never had the inital planning meeting.  No wonder I was freaked out!! Knowledge is power!!!!!",
