      "Content": "worriedteacher wrote: Hello everyone - I'm 44 years old, enjoying summer \"off\" from school (I teach high school math), going to what should be routine doctor's appointments and WHAM. I get a call back from my mammogram saying that they think they found a cyst. They scheduled diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, had those yesterday 7/31/15. During the ultrasound, a second potential \"cyst\"was discovered by the radiology tech. Both \"cysts\" are somewhat close together and are very small (less than 8 mm). I cannot detect them in a regular breast exam, they are not palpable. In fact, they had trouble even finding them via ultrasound. The original cyst is a cyst, for sure. The radiologist came in and looked and was very comfortable with that diagnosis. The 2nd one? Looks like a cyst - but one portion of the perimeter isn't as clearly defined and it worried the radiologist. The radiologist said that she didn't want to take any chances with it, so I'm having a core needle biopsy with ultrasound on Tuesday 8/4/15. Obviously, I don't want to take any chances, either. But - I'm beyond stressed. To say that I'm worried is a complete understatement. I cry at the drop of a hat. I am envisioning the worst possible outcome. Not really sure what I'm looking for - just vently, mainly. I have 3 friends who have all been through this in varying degrees and they are very helpful. Thanks for reading/listening.

So, they went back with ultrasound again to look deeper, and sure enough, found a 3rd lesion. Same size and shape as the other 2. Radiologist said that usually these are \"low-suspicion\" and that the pathology from one is indicative of the others. The radiology tech said that it is unusual to have cancerous lesions like this spread around, and that more is actually a \"better\" indication. She seemed to suspect that they are likely complex cysts, but of course there are no guarantees and they obviously are sending everything to pathology. I honestly was not sure if they were going to biopsy another area or what, but they didn't feel the need based on the looks of them being so similar. So...we wait for results at my next appointment on Thursday at 1pm. Log in to post a reply",
