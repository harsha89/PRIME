I have been on Abraxane and avastin since June.  I am able to take care of my kids and cook and take care of the house.  I could even goto work but I am a stay at home Mom.  There is life after this dx.  Give yourself as much time as you need to be depressed. It is perfectly natural. Get a second opinion from another dr. I am not sure where you are located but there are people from all over the world on this board.  I am sure somebody can give you a good reference for a dr near you.  Good luck to you. Stephanie",

I have found it very helpful.  I also wanted to let you know about a trial going on right now called the parp inhibitor trial.  It is showing alot of progress in BRAC + cancers.  I know that it is going on in the US but I am not sure about Canada.  IF there is a way for you to get to the States I think that this trial could really help you.  I know that I am a stranger but I am close to University of Pa hospital where I know that they are offering this trial.  You would be welcome in my home.  I also have a time share that I never use that I would be more than happy to let you use.  I know that I sound crazy but this could really be an option for you.  I don't want you to miss the oppurtunity because you can't afford to travel to the states.  I am also stage IV and I am only 35.  Us stage IV's have to stick together and look out for each other.  I wish you only the best of luck.
