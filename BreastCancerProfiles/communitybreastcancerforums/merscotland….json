I immediately requested referral for risk reducing surgeries and have already got appointments for February (BS) and March (Gynae). Last weekend I found a lump in my 'unaffected ' breast. I have been given an urgent appointment for next Tuesday. The docs want to identify if this new growth is metastatic spread or independent primary. I'm currently trying to find out as much as I can about the different implications for each. Can anyone tell me if having a new lumpp automatically changes cancer staging? Maggie",

Sorry for not acknowledging your replies but I'm not very good with this form of communication and I'm still finding my way around! I've only just found out how to check my own postings- hence I've realised I hadn't checked since. Anyway - thanks again! Let me ken if you find yourself in Perth when you visit Scotland !",
