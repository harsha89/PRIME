I will be checked every 3 months so the next visit is comming up in Nov.    After a comment from maxgirl I will be calling my Dr. tomorrow about feeling so tired and seeing about it being amemia.   This has been my first post after only reading everyones since last Feb. when I was first dx. Guess I needed everyone now more than ever!   Thanks for being here!   Kathy ",
