Hope that helps, Michelle ",

Your calm description helps me realize that I should just take a deep breath! I have a consult appointment Wednesday for a BiRads3 w/microcalcifications.  Family history of Mom (45) and Grandmother (53).  I'm 41.  I'm expecting at least an MRI with a possible biopsy.  I hope your results come back well. Hugs, Michelle ",

I just received the good news of a B9 MRI- the wait for the results were excrutiating- I am resolved to get genetic testing- I want to be in the drivers seat on this one.  Don't know if I can go through the wait again, it was unbelievably difficult. Thanks again, Michelle ",
