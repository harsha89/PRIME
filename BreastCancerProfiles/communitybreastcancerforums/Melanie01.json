No family history and I've never had any lumps or dimpling, pain, etc. It came back abnormal and it says oval shaped mass noted in upper right breast at the 12 o'clock position and questionable adjacent focal area of architectural distortion noted just inferiority on MLO view only. I have to go back tomorrow and I'm completely freaking out! Christmas was terrible, I'm a nervous wreck. Insight please?! I already have anxiety and panic disorder so this is horrific!!!

I really began to panic when they came back to do more ultrasound pics. The doctor finally came in and told me to breathe! It was a fibroadenoma. Also had some fibrocystic tissue. He told me I'm fine! I'm so relieved. He will follow me up in 6 months to see if that grows or is stable but no cancer. Thank y'all so much!!",
