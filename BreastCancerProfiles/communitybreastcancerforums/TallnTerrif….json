That is truly my biggest fear. I see the PS tomorrow and get the PET on Wednesday so will know more then. It just seems so difficult to have to make the decision now when I am most concerned about defeating this disease. I really appreciate this site. It seems like the only place I can go for honest information from people who are going through this. My mother has had BC TWICE but it is hard to talk about the more personal issues even though she can do that with others with BC . Anyone else experienced this issue with with a parent?",

One IDC tumor of .6 cm showed nowhere. One of the DCIS tumors was actually an IDC tumor even though it was biopsied. My surgeon called tonight with more information. What I saw on Monday was the \"initial\" path report Now they will finish the path report, (no one said it came in two parts), but luckily I do not need to have more surgery to remove additional nodes! That was decided at the tumor committee. My surgeon did not do immediate pathology during surgery as she said it was less rereliable than a \"permanent pathology\" which apparently is done in two parts. My largest tumor now is grade 2, but there is a lot of activity in that breast, so they believe they will find I am luminal b from the MmamoPrint requiring chemo. To respond to your other question about how we'd so reed my cancer, I noticed a small change in the shape of my breast and then a dimpling that was only noticeable from my vantage point. My PCP didn't really see it but she humored me and ordered the diagnostic mammo. She later told me that I saved my own life. That made me look at this more positively.",

      "Content": "Nov 27, 2015 07:08AM - edited Nov 27, 2015 07:11AM by TallnTerrific The devotion for today is beautiful and may helps some. I will paraphrase a little for us: Let thankfulness rule in your heart(remember to relax your shoulders and take deep breaths from from diaphragm to bring thankfulness to your heart). As you thank Me for blessings in your life (significant others, a beautiful flower, calls from friends, having a good BM, getting a good nights sleep etc), a marvelous thing happens. It is as if scales fall off your eyes, ( cancerous tissue is gone, itching stops, tubes are removed) enabling you to see more and more of My glorious riches. With your eyes thus opened, you can help yourself to whatever you need from My treasure house (see the love of friends on the discussion board, the love of friends from long ago, the ability to stretch your arms farther than you could yesterday). Each time you receive one of My golden gifts (loving kiss from your significant other, words of pride from grown children who see your strength through all of this, kindly neighbors bringing meals for you family) let your thankfulness sing out praises to My Name. (Sing or listen to songs that make you feel joyous and let them fill your heart-any kind of music works). Hallelujahs are the language of heaven and they can become the language of your heart!!! A life of praise and thankfulness becomes a life filled with miracles. instead of trying to be in control (this is a big one for me, giving up all worries about what is wrong, what it means, how they should treat it, are they doing enough--control is one of things that makes it very hard to relax and causes me more pain and less happiness --don't forget to relax your shoulders when you stand straight and tall) focus on Me and what I am doing. This is the power of praise: centering your entire being in Me. This is how I created you to live, for I made you in My own image. Enjoy abundant life by overflowing with praise and thankfulness.\" I don't know if this will touch everyone, but use meditation to think of what is right in your body and if you still feel tense and are allowed to shower, go stand there with warm water pouring over your shoulders and soft music playing in your bathroom until you feel more relaxed. Don't rush anything, just do things one at a time as you feel ready. Love you all, TNT",

Mine never produced more than 35 ml so I don't know if it is normal. And my PS took them out after one week even though there was still some reddish color to the output. I think every surgeon has different practices. My sister who is a nurse did do something she called milking the tube when she saw clots coming out. We could see that the clots were blocking the tube from draining fluid. So She held very firmly to the base of the tube attached to my body and pinched it. She then took a pencil or other straight round tool and started at the top with her thumb on one side and the tool on the other to force the liquids And clots into the bulb. This cleared the tube of clots, and when we emptied the bulb the clots mostly came out. but it did seem like one bulb remained blocked by a clot. We squeezed all of the liquid out of that bulb and squeezed bulb tightly shut so it would pull the clot through. Eventually that happened and all was good. My sister said this was a procedure that is to be performed under doctors orders, so if you have any concerns dont try it.  My main message is that the color and out put sound good to me. I wouldn't worry too much.",

      "Content": "Nov 5, 2015 07:38AM - edited Nov 5, 2015 07:40AM by TallnTerrific Live4them I know how you feel about not wanting to stress out your family. We have two in college one a senior and in finals and one who has struggled with school and is away from home. We also have two done with college with families and new jobs, one is pregnant. At the first it was just a lumpectomy so I told them all it was no big deal. Then it became a much bigger deal when they identified multiple tumors (more than 15) spanning a 6cm area. Then the PET scan came back with possible metastasis in my abdomen (false positive) and then a torn retina out of the blue. Through it all my husband and I cried and laughed as needed, but only my youngest son called two or three times a week to see how I was and talk about his life and mine. Yesterday I cried for awhile just thinking that none of them knew enough about it to decide to be there the day of the surgery. If something were to happen there would be no opportunity to tell them how much I love them and how proud I was of them. We decided to call the two that are in college 60 miles away to see if they could come home for dinner the weekend before just to all be together. Don't get me wrong, I have so much love and people offering to help and pray and care for me that I am amazed and touched. My sister is flying in from Florida to stay over a week to be there for me and my husband. There is something different about our children though. I feel a little selfish about it. Even though they don't know all we are going through with a bilateral MX, TEs. Chemo. Radiation and recon, I wish they would be there that day. It is difficult putting our own needs in front of those of our children.",

Since my tumors were highly hormone receptive they believe the aromatase inhibitors will provide adequate systemic treatment but the radiation is aimed at all the nodes nearby(neck clavical axillary) chest well, and any remaining tissue under the arms. It can't hurt to ask them why they won't radiate the nodes. Everyone is different but you should see what they say so you understand.",

That is the worst of it, so don't worry too much. I do not have much itching either. Mary, I also used a steroid cream prescribed by my doc(Momentasone), and so I doubt a steroid injection would be problematic. I will say some evenings I would be pink or red and wake up with nothing the next day. It just happens. Also you do get \"exit wounds\" in the back. They aren't as bad as the front, but the radiation goes through us. Scary isn't it. 2. I love all of you on this board!!!!!

The laparoscopic surgeon who removed biopsies from the Mesenteric lymph node said it did not look like metastatic tissue, but of course only the path reports can say for sure. He is still concerned about a separate lymphoma cancer unrelated to the the breast cancer. Fun huh! I am wondering what that will mean for my prognosis. Stage IV, terminal or what? They seem reluctant to to treat the breast cancer till they figure it out.",

I have three reasons to doubt. First my own PET scan done before my Masectomy and before any treatments strongly indicated cancer in three of four lymph systems. I went through one abdominal biopsy and a laproscopic procedure that showed no cancer, but they were so sure about it being metastatic. They couldn't really explain why it was showing a false positive -scary. Second and saddest, my sister in law was diagnosed and treated with cervical cancer after chemo and rads declared cancer free! Less than 3 month later the cancer was everywhere. She started back on an aggressive chemo regimen for the last six months of her life and died less than a month ago. Finally there is my mother who had breast cancer at 50 MX and 1 yr of chemo that nearly killed her, tomaxifen for 10 years and they declared her cancer free,but no. After 23 years it came back in the other breast - more chemo morerads. That is why I believe they do not know what test will be accurate, or what treatment successful. I think we just have to be our own monitors. Cubbie2015, I wanted to let you know that I asked about the darkening of the freckles/moles on the radiation side. My RO told me that they sometimes fall off after the treatments. It seems to fry them up. But he said that it was not a worry for me. Mine were all very light moles before, some of which you couldn't see. Now they are more visible and disgusting, but if they fall off I will be happy. 4 more treatment of rads and now four weeks of PT to fix the shoulder. Hopefully I will be done by end of March!, The real good news is we have just planned an Alaskan cruise for September!!!! That is a nice goal to have.",

This worries me on one level and on another level, no mammogram, except the 3D ever detected anything wrong with me. Perhaps they should just realize that we each are different and need different kinds of testing. Providers should be expected to evaluate each woman to ID her breast density and to determine what will really work. They have known for years that I had dense breast tissue. They even state it on every pathology report, but they never told me until this year that neither the traditional nor the digital mammograms would show them anything about the cancer in my breast. So on some level I agree that the mammos can be worthless for some of us, but critical for others. I just wish they would recommend appropriate testing for all.",
