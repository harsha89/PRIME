I have been taking the antibiotics for three weeks, temperature has gone down but no improvement with sob and i find it hard to cope. Woner how long will it take to improve. Ahhh Taking xeloda from the nurse today and start the course tomorrow. I really hope it will be kind to me and work for a long time. I know there is a thread about xeloda but would apprciate to know those who took only x how long it worked for you. Thank you everyone for contributing to the forum. Much love Karina ",

I was diagnosed four weeks ago as I had been having lower back pain and shortness of breath for couple of months. Because of being on a long holiday could not go to doctors earlier. The chest xray showed pleural effusion and further CT and MRI showed mets to spine, several places, possible liver mets and metastatic PE after they tested the liquid. I had 3 litters of water drained and had pleurodesis with talc. I am still short of breath and on top of all I have chest infection. Taking antibiotics . I am seeing my oncology nurse tomorrow and starting Xeloda, two weeks in one week off and Xgeva for bone strengthening. As you can imagine I am scared, lost, depressed, angry, etc. However my biggest concern is will I ever feel physically well. The only place I feel comfortable is my bed and I struggle to walk from the pain in mt leg joint and sob. I get tired so quickly and cant manage simple things without help. I am so scared I wont ''stand up'' again. I read on the forum, that many of you wonderful ladies have pretty much normal life. Do you think I will feel better again and when or this is the end??

It took couple of neoadjuvant ( chemo before surgery) chemos and a shrinking tumor, plus my oncs optimism, that gave me the hope I would beat this. I remember her saing the word \" treatment\", which was like a soothing balm to my aching heart. It was then the surgery and instead of expected 1-2 nodes, there were 6 six of them. Then again six more rounds of chemo and radiation. It was last year this time I finished active treatment and been doing quite well since. With every follow up and good results it gets easier.

When I was sent for a chest xray because of shortness of breath, my left lung was not actually seen on the xray, it was all white as it was filled with fluid which was later diagnosed as malignant. I was hospitalised immediately and they put a tube to drain the liquid. It stayed for 4 days and they drained about 4 litres of fluid. Afterwards they did pleuradesis (sp ?) which is talc gluing the pleura and lung to stop fluid accumulating again. The pulmonologist said it works 50/50. I did not have instant relief from sob and it took more than a month to feel some improvement. Oh forgot to say I had chest infection too, which made matters worse. That took to clear up with a long course of IV and oral antibiotic. I am on the 3 cycle of xeloda and have to say feel a lot better. I haven't had chest x ray since the improvement, but I am hoping the talc worked, as my sob is better, but I am sure there is still some fluid lingering in my lung. Hopefully will clear up with xeloda in time. What I learnt is, while we are expecting a quick positive result, it's not the case. It's a very slow process and we need to be patient. With each cycle of xeloda, I feel better. From being bedridden, I am up and about now. Can do things about the house, go shopping, do dome cooking. I don't have to but doing these things make me feel a little normal. Still get tired though, but at east I can breath better now. Hang in there my friend, take care of yourself. I hope your treatment works. Come here often as it;s a great place with a lot of knowledge and support. I wish you well. Love, Karina x",

Yes, It goes with fatigue, hair  loss, nausea, but quite doable. The first week after each round is the worst for most of us.I never really dwelled on how it made me ill or tired. If I was sick , I would stay in bed, sleep, eat what I fancied at that moment. If I was well, I would go to work and lead a usual lifestyle. You just need to take care of yourself and concentrate on your treatment with one step at a time. Once you start it , you will know how to manage.

In fact, the recovery from mastectomy and hysterectomy at the same surgery was a lot easier for me than chemo. It normally took me about 10-15 days after each round to feel normal and strong. So give yourself some more time. Shrinking tumor and no lymph nodes is great. Will you be having adjuvant as well?  Here is to wish you all the best. You will get there. Just hang on please. ",

Since then I tried to figure out how to \"heal\" it naturally, since I don't want to take painkillers, not to burden my liver. I took Diclofenac couple of times though, but it only helped for a day, so it wasn't the solution for me. After a lot of research I have come up with the following, and so glad it has helped with my knee/ joint pain a lot. About 90% of the pain is gone. I know, some ladies suffer from the same and thought to share it.  In the morning - fresh cabbage/ beetroot/ apple/ carrot / pumpkin juice . During the afternoon I just chew two tea spoons of flax and sesame seeds. With dinner- cal D3. My supper is 4 cloves of  freshly grated garlic with olive oil on a rye bread, followed by couple of glasses of tea with fresh ginger, lemon, cardamom, star anise, cinnamon and cloves. And finally, before bedtime I gulp down 2 teaspoons of ground turmeric mixed with black pepper and olive oil. I am not sure which of these contributed more, but they work fine for me and I am going to stick to it for a long while. I have more energy and better mood. Hope this helps.

While we are on chemo, rads and even months out of it, it's quite common ( at least my experience) to have aches and pains here and there almost all the time. I remember my shoulder pain, leg pain, neck pain, rib pain and knee pain which is still there, though a lot milder. It really takes time even with waight, complexion, hair texture to come back. But the hardest, I presume for everyone, is the mental state out of all we have been through. That probably takes longer. Give yourself THE time. Detoxing food and juices and walking helped me lots. Now when I have ache somewhere in my body, I take light teaspoon of Epsom salt in a bottle of water for a few days and it really helps. Only a few months ago I couldn't do without my afternoon nap, but I can go with none now, still very energetic by the end of the day. Of course I know the other shoe may drop any time, but it may never, so I choose to think about it when it happens and choose to enjoy life meanwhile!!! KSteve, so happy for the clear MRI results.

When I was going to have my total hysterectomy/ ooph at the same time with mastectomy, I had fibrosis in uterus, doctors knew that from the US. But still they took a sample before the surgery, then another thorough check after. So, it's our docs being extra cautious, considering our BC history. Ahhh, extra cautiousness for them, and extra stress for us. Hang in there sister, everything will be fine. I wish you didn't have to go through this. Take care and keep me posted.

I am not sure, if that's the drug, just guessing because of the timing. My left knee is worse , than the right. Some days it hurts/locks more, makes walking hard / limb, than others, but the pain is there all the time. I am fine at night time and when I am sat with my legs up. But walking is a struggle. Then after I am on my feet for a while, it starts radiating up my thigh, one day it can be in the inner side, another day outer and sometimes slightly in hips. Sometimes it hits like sciatica pain. Had an x-ray couple of weeks ago. They said it is mild arthritis and osteochondritis in spine and just advised me to lose some weight. I am not overweight, but have put some on after the treatments. My concerns are, that if they were bone mets, wouldn't the pain have got worse since October by now??  Or wouldn't it hurt constantly, no matter what position I am?? In certain positions I am almost pain free.  Normally, I am a lot better after 400mg Ibuprofen, but don't want to take it every day, mostly to see what is the pain like each day. There is nothing else I can think of doing at the moment. Blood work was ok two weeks ago and other than this issue I am fine. Lots of energy, good sleep and appetite. Thanks for reading and any input is appreciated.  Chrissy, I always read your posts, wherever you post and admire you so much.  And many thanks for this thread. Hugs. Karina ",

If you get sick from the turmeric, try it with honey or yogurt. Why can't you have flaxseed?? Is it because you are ER+ ?

The past five years were full of events, accomplishments and achievements! I remarried the love of my life (long story) and moved to the UK. I saw my daughter graduating from two Universities since and my son will graduate this year. I started a new career in the UK and bought our dream house! There is life after cancer, I am sure of that now. I take Tamoxifen every night faithfully and so grateful to the small pill. I am trying to eat as healthy as possible, but don't restrict myself in small pleasures of few glasses of wine on weekends.My hair has since grown and I am again having bad hair days like every other woman. Of course I have put on some weight and my body is not the same as before cancer, and I am having odd aches and pain here and there, but nothing serious and are quite manageable, as long as cancers keeps its ugly hands away from me! To all the long timers- I am so happy for you all and wish you to keep healthy forever and inspire us behind you. To the newly diagnosed- please dont despair! Look after yourself, focus on the treatment, take it step by step and hang in there. You will overcome the dark days and you will get there.. Remember you are precious to your loved once! So fight with all your strength and stay positive. Dream big, make short and LONG term plans, things that will keep you motivated and positive!

My C was on the left side too, and neither Adriamicin, nor radiation affected my heart. Hopefully it will not cause you any trouble either. Yes, it's quite a choice to make, so let's see what other ladies will come up with. Wishing you good luck and lots of strength to go through the chemo.

Sometimes I feel heaviness as well. I don't like the feeling, but I am sure it's normal, since I have checked on ultrasound lots of time and it's been clean. Don't worry too much.

I took a break while on treatment, but ended up leaving it altogether. When the new academic year started in September last year, I was still wearing my wig and could not face entering the auditorium with all the changes in my appearance. I was doing the job more for pleasure, but 9 am start did not seem too much of a pleasure after the active treatment fatigue. Thankfully, my main job is at my own pace. I can even work from home, so it was a blessing through the cancer journey and the long winter. I am trying to attend every day now, just to feel normal.  I know what you mean with the quiet coffee. But once you break the habit for couple of days, you will get used to the new schedule. I find myself more organized generally, when I go to work every day and it helps greatly with depression. Even if your hair is still very short, give some shape with hair gel, complete the looks with a nice make up and pretty outfits and you will look beautiful and feel confident. I ditched my wig, when my hair was only 1cm long, trimmed for a better shape and looked good and got lots of compliments.  Wish you good luck. Have a pleasant week-end and enjoy your work. You will overcome!!!!   Hugs, Karina ",
