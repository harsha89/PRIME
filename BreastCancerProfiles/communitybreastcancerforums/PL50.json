I had mine removed surgically because when they did the stereotactic biopsy first they only removed part of it. I was also told by the surgeon that often cancer can be hidden behind or around the radial scar so they sometimes recommend a surgical biopsy to remove the entire thing and also to make sure there is nothing hidden. I was also told that mine was very large which is why I had to have the surgery.The breast surgeon told me that having a radial scar does \"slightly\" increase your risks of developing breast cancer, however he never mentioned that it doubles your risk....it does seem like there is a lot of conflicting thought on that. He is making me follow up closely however....I am scheduled this Thursday for a f/u mammo on that breast and it is only 4.5 months after the biospy....so am hoping all is clear. I had a lot of sclerosing adenosis around the  radial scar and fibrocystic changes as well. I also have a higher risk as my mom had breast cancer in the same breast (but is fine!)..so he said now my risk is up a little higher.I think that there are times that the radial scar is very small and that surgery is not needed, but I guess it depends on each individual case and your risk factors.",

I was also worried about the wire...and I should not have been....That whole part of the procedure took less than 10 mins....maybe even less than 5...I didn't feel a thing and walked right down to the OR immed after for the biopsy. I had to lay face down on the table to have the wire inserted, just as if I was having a stereotactic biopsy done. I didn't even feel the needle with the Lidocaine.It was really nothing at all to fear.Good luck!",
