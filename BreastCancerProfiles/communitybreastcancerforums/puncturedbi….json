My mom's house was damaged in Sandy in 2012 and at the moment, she is about to make her fifth move (she's buying a small retirement home to live in while her house is rebuilt). So: buying. building, moving and cancer. It's a lot to do. I keep telling her when she finally gets home she will sleep for a month. I'm here for months at a time but I'm going home for five weeks after she moves and has her first infusion, so she is worried about travelling by herself. Do you drive yourself to chemo? My mom can take the bus or train to Manhattan if she has a friend come along but I'd hate for her to go alone. It's hard to plan for if you don't know how it will affect you. The whole thing is so fraught with worry, the line between planning and overthinking can get blurred. :-)",

Yes, we are told that it is very manageable and I think it's just the anticipation that's getting to us. Also my mom has a lot of other life-changing stuff going on so we're just overwhelmed in general and trying to stay on top of things. Is there anything in particular that you use to help with the mouth soreness or aches and pains? And is there anything you like to bring with you when you go to get your infusions to stay on top of it all? I'm sorry to hear you have the nausea despite getting all the anti-nausea stuff. I think nausea and constipation are my mother's biggest worries.",
