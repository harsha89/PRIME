A week later, I ended up with increased pain in my calf and sudden chest pain.  I happened to have another check-up with my breast surgeon that same day, and I told him about my current symptoms.  (I never told him about the first episode of swelling in my calf/ankle, because he always seems too busy)  He completely freaked out on me, and sent me directly to the hospital for a stat CT pulmonary angiogram and stat bilateral lower extremity ultrasound.  I guess he was seriously concerned that I did, in fact have a DVT and possible a pulmonary embolism.  Thankfully, all the tests were negative and the pain in my leg went away again, but the heaviness/pain in my chest persists.  The CT revealed a hematoma in the location of my surgery, but didn't say how large it is. My regular doctor called to tell me abot the hematoma, (I haven't heard from the BS since the tests) and she told me that it could be causing radiating pain across my chest.  Has anyone experienced this?  Any advice?  I had almost no pain in the first week followng the surgery and as the days pass by, it seems the pain is increasing.  Odd, right?",

Lammommy: I don't have any if those stockings, but it's getting better now, and I haven't told my surgeon yet... I'm sitting here waiting for him to call regarding the pathology report. I'm really nervous, because when I had the needle biopsy done, they called with the results first thing in the morning. The waiting is the worst, and I'm on vacation but can't really enjoy it until I know for sure that it is benign. Again, thanks to everyone for caring so much!!!",
