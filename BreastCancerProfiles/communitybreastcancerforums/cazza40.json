With all of this spread so quickly from triple negative cancer can we expect a decent prognosis. I am very worried for her and the family. Log in to post a reply",

The breast cancer wasn't responding to treatment and thenn she got pneumonia with blood clots on the lungs and fluid around the heart. I knew the cancer would get her but the pneumonia just made her passing so quick. I'm off work today trying to deal with all of the emotions. I have also had breast cancer twice that adds it's own set of emotions. Just so sad. she was only 45 and a wonderful person. Thanks for reading of those who do. I guess I just need to pick myself up and I have to go back to work tomorrow.... love to all caroline Log in to post a reply",
