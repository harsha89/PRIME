My BMX was a week ago. My right armpit is numb/weird/painful and that is my most at risk side. I had read not to shave with a regular razor due to the risk of nicks/cuts. I tried using my electric razor on Monday. 1) I'm not allowed to lift my arm above shoulder height yet so I couldn't see, and 2) I sure couldn't FEEL what was happening. That led to FAR less than stellar results. Yuck. So, I'm really grateful I have fall and winter to figure this out, but how do you all handle this? Obviously electrolysis and waxing would be out. What about laser hair removal? Is that risky or safe? \"I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls.

But those sites pretty much bashed ALL hair removal techniques to some degree. That's why I posted here. I was hoping those with access to LE specialists would have info regarding the safest way to go. My doctor said my risk was so low she wouldn't be referring me to one. What I've learned from reading posts here is that there is a big difference between \"low\" and \"no.\" Funny, because she told me no needles or BP ever on that side, but I don't have enough risk to go talk to the specialist. I may pursue it anyway. Thanks for all of the tips! Oh! Years ago I did some laser hair removal. The first visit is never that impressive. It takes a few times, but I had great results from that. If that's safe I would definitely start saving my pennies for it.",

This site is such a great place for support and info! I would encourage you that once you have your surgery date you should join the group for surgeries in that month. You'll also want to join the reconstruction threads for whichever procedure you end up going with. I can't answer all of your questions. I can just share my own experience. When I met my surgeon to discuss my options she immediately told me that I would only be a candidate for implant reconstruction as I was too thin to have enough tissue to make two breasts. Be prepared for that. Also know that your particular surgeon may have a preference. Not all surgeons do all types of recon. you may have to shop around for a surgeon who can do the type you want, but be very sure he/she has a lot of experience performing that type of recon. I had my BMX and tissue expanders were placed at the same time. I do not think I drove for 4-5 weeks. It took a couple of weeks before I could get out of bed or out of the recliner without help or loads of pain. I gradually got stronger and also gradually got the anesthesia out of my system. It took about 6 weeks to really feel like myself again. Meanwhile my tissue expanders were being filled. I didn't have much trouble with that process, but I did have to sleep sitting upright in our recliner for 3-4 months. I had my exchange to implants in February. My silicone round mplants look quite natural. I'm pleased with the shape and feel of them. Two weeks ago I had a revision to smaller, different styled implants. I feel much better with these and am ready to move on. In a few months I will get reconstructed nipples and then a few months after that I will have areola tattoos. If things go as planned I will be done about 1.5 years after I started. Candidates for nipple sparing will not take as long I'm guessing. I chose not to keep mine. I think what you need to know is that it can be a lengthy process even if all goes smoothly. I do not know how differently a completely prophylactic experience will be. Hopefully some ladies can chime in on that one! Keep asking questions and keep reading here! Explore the different recon threads, but do keep in mind that there is a greater percentage of \"problems\" posted. Many women that have positive experiences don't hang out on the boards. So please don't assume that everyone has a negative experience! But it is good to know the risks. I wish you all the best! It's not an easy thing, but there are LOTS of women walking around us every day that have been here, done that, got the t-shirt and are still smiling!!!! Hugs to you!",

My first exchange ended up being too big. I rode through the summer with those in. Totally doable! I realize what you do is more strenuous. I just had a revision to smaller implants and LOVE them. The only issues I had with biking is that if I gripped extra hard or only had one hand on the bars my pec contracted and felt kind of weird. Still doable!! But that issue has gotten better too with the smaller size. I know with mtn biking you have more more weight on the bars, so the pec thing might be a bit more of an issue. But it never has hurt, just feels a bit odd. And you may want to try to stay close to your current size just so stuff doesn't get in your way. ;-) Of course all of my experience only applies to my type of recon. I did bmx to TE's to implants. I did not ride during my TE phase as it happened to be over the winter.",

That surgery was done by a general surgeon. Mom did not have reconstruction. Went through my mom's second diagnosis and mastectomy about 8 years ago. Again, no recon. The cosmetic difference between those two surgeries was quite vast. And then my own BMX this past fall, performed by a good breast surgeon and closed by my PS after he placed TE's.... My scars, though the line goes from near my armpit, across each breast probably 3/4's of the way ARE tiny in comparison to my mom's first surgery. Angelina's nipple sparing scars would be even smaller/less noticeable. I do not know when her mother had her mastectomies, but the comparison to what she saw on HER mom quite possibly matches my experience. When I chose to go with a double mastectomy following a very early IDC catch, I chose so with the image of my mom's first surgery results. I have been pleasantly surprised by my results. Not perfect, not the real thing, not something I would wish on anyone.....but vastly better than what I had anticipated.",

I asked my PS about it and he said,\"Absolutely.\" There is a scientific name for it, which I can't remember, but basically, and I quote, \"the muscles don't like what we've done to them.\" NOOOOOO!! REALLY???? Lol. I'm also having lots of sensitivity in my skin. Almost painful, but more annoying. At first I thought my skin was really dry or raw, but it must be creepy crawlies from all of the cut nerve endings. I really hate my armpit most. But I suppose I will eventually adjust and get used to these feelings. Or lack of feelings. Like I said earlier...that area only accounted for slightly less than 1% of the total me, and I've got things to do!!! :-) If any of you hear of ways to help with healing or minimizing the different nerve issues please post them. I can easily learn to live with it as the price of getting the cancer out, but if there are ways to help it I'd love to try.",

The recliner IS a very comfy position, but I can't get up by myself. Can't reach or pull the lever and don't have the strength yet to push the footrest down with my legs, cuz it uses abs too much. Before surgery one of my fears was emptying the drains. It really isn't hard at all. And like someone above said, when I got brave and looked in the mirror I actually smiled. I don't really know what I was expecting, but they do look better than I feared. I'm no competition to Jessica Alba, but I get extra credit for courage and positive attitude, right? It was such a relief to have it just be done and now I can focus on the next thing....which (I've been ordered) is to learn to ask for help and accept it. Ugh!!! I really stink at that.

I realized today that I find myself almost telling strangers. Like the grocery store cashier....like I need her to know these aren't just NORMAL groceries!! These are the things I'm stocking up on for my surgery. Because I have cancer. How weird is that? It's like I need the rest of the world to stop just for a minute with me. But life moves on and I can't wait to heal up from this and get back in there!!!! I don't know what the future holds, but I know Who holds the future!!! Sleep well, ladies!

Reminds me of a verse in a song I like. \"There may be pain in the night, but joy comes in the morning!\" My doctor had the radioactive tracer done about an hour and a half prior to my BMX. First the radiologist injected some numbing thing. Then the tracer. Neither one went directly into the nipple. It was near and angled that way. Then my doctor did the blue dye after i was already asleep in the surgery room. It's interesting how there are so many ways to do the same thing.

I'm improving, but there is one really annoying thing that doesn't seem to be changing and it was extra bad during the very long road trip we just took. All across my breast area the skin just feels raw. It ISN'T!!! (I keep checking.) it's worst on the top half. Riding in the car seemed to make it feel worse due to the friction of my VERY soft shirt rubbing on my skin more than it does if I'm just sitting in the recliner. (But I got to see my son graduate!! Yay!!) Is this from the nerve damage from surgery? Any guesses if it will ever stop or get better? Any tips/tricks to minimize the burning feeling that sometimes makes it hard to sleep? At first I really thought it was my super sensitive skin reacting to tape, etc, but now I'm realizing it is not on the surface. It feels uncomfortable to touch the skin, too, but there is no redness, rash, dryness, etc. so I believe it's nerves underneath. I guess I'm hoping somebody has a recommendation for some lovely smelling lotion or cream that would make it stop!!!!! Lol. If not that, I'd just love to hear a \"yep. Me too!\" so I'll know I'm not alone. No wait. That wasn't nice!! I'd rather nobody else was feeling this! Sooooo....how about just a good 'ole \"I had it for a week then it went away.\" ;-) Funny, too, because my husband accidentally elbowed my left one the other day and I didn't feel that.

If you are feeling like you must search I would read the information parts of the site before you get stuck in message board land. I know how overwhelmingly supportive the message board has been for both of us, BUT we each have our own story and our own diagnosis, so panicking because of what someone else has faced/is facing doesn't make sense, right???? I don't know the scientific answers to help you. I know my BS said my ER+/PR+, HER2- is the best case scenario, so it's the HER2+ that is the difference between ours. If you're needing to start researching I would start there. But I would also ONLY do it to give you good questions for the oncologist. He/she will be able to tell you what it all means based on YOUR special story. Praying for your PEACE right now as you wait for your appointment and I'm so sorry you're going through this today!

There are natural, healthy things to do alongside the medical treatments that can help the healing, fighting, energy, etc. (That's one thing I like about mine. They never once said anything negative about my choosing to do the standard medical treatments. They just said whatever choices I made they could come alongside and support me. Great people.)

I was a bit foggy at the time. DH doesn't remember it. I tried a few different deodorants and finally settled on a grapefruit one by LaVanilla. For the first couple of weeks I used nothing and couldn't stand the smell. The LaVanilla helped with the smell, but I had to stop wearing some of the shirts I normally wore to work because I would get big sweat spots. 3 months went by and I went for my pre-exchange visit with my PS. I asked him if the \"no antiperspirant\" thing was forever or just while healing. I really thought he was the one who told me to stop using it! He said he would NEVER say such a thing and that as much as we go through he would never take away something like hygiene that would make us feel worse. So, I have NO idea WHO told me that or if I dreamed the whole thing up while medicated. What were you all told? My BS was able to do my SNB through my mastectomy incision so I did not have an extra incision to heal in my armpit...though it was very sore. She said one ended up being further in than it had appeared so she had to \"do some digging\" to get it. Shudder. Thanks!! For now I'm sticking with my natural LaVanilla just because it feels good. But I'm reserving my anti-p for special occasions.",

NO IDEA what the official name for it is, but it seems to cradle me nicely and also act as the foundation of a wall to keep DH from an accidental snuggle. Yikes. I've also got comfy button up pj's for home, stool softener, a battery powered toothbrush, a pack of headbands because I'm sure the curling iron is out for a while, some baby wipes for freshening up if the shower seems like too much for a while, and rubber gloves/alcohol wipes for the drains. Tomorrow I'm going to our hospital med equipment place to be fitted for a recovery cami my doctor prescribed. Yesterday I stopped and got a couple of loose button down shirts and a couple of hoodies for whenever I venture out of the house again. And had a meltdown in the dressing room while trying them on. I've accepted this and am ready to move forward, but there are moments when it's all just very overwhelming!!! Connie, I'll try to notice anything I'd wished I had and write here before you go!
