I've since lost all the weight plus about 5 pounds - due to forgetting to eat and being busy, plus a weird fast heart thing. My normal was always 110.  I'm 5'3\".  I'm now about 104.  It was in the past month or so that I lost the last 6 pounds and I started noticing the port pushing out of my skin.  I guess if I put on some pounds maybe it will no longer protrude. Thanks for your wisdom!! Oh!  I almost forgot to ask....how does it come out?  It was put in when I had my mastectomy surgery.  Do you need to have to be 'put out'?  I would seem to me you would have to be...",

Heavy necklaces bang on it and it hurts.  When I try and sleep on my stomach, if I am leaning on it, it hurts. The Oncology nurses in the treatment room haven't mentioned anything so I guess it's normal but what about neclaces and stomach sleeping.  Is that just a no? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

Oh my goodness!  Good thing I like Yogurt!!",

I live in Canada and my Medical Oncologist believes Herceptin is too new of a drug to say definitively that 1 year is where the maximum benefit of Herception to the patient lies.  For me he said 2 years but every three months I need a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan and a Muga scan otherwise the government won't dole out the drug.  When you say 52 weeks, do you mean once a week?  My two years is once every three weeks like my chemo always was.",

I am Her2+, Er-/Pr- I got a picc line in and did 6 rounds of FEC, 9 rounds of Taxotere and Herceptin then one round of Herceptin only in preparation for surgery.  The chemo shrunk the tumour down to the point neither my Medical Oncologist, Surgeon or Surgical Resident could really feel it. November 20 (last month), I had a simple left breast mastectomy with no reconstruction plus I had a port a catheter implanted and the picc line removed.  Immediately after surgery my surgeon said it was mostly scar tissue in there and what else she saw wasn't anything she hadn't seen a million times.  I asked that my Pathology go to my Medical Oncologist.  It came back and I didn't want to know the detail.  I find I am the type of patient that works best with minimal information.  My Medical Oncologist says he was happy with my Pathology report.  I've had bone scans, MRI's, CT scans and Muga scans every three months all year long and it looks like that will go on for years.  I thought something was going to show up on my bones as well because my right hip bone had been sore on and off for years.  My bone scans have all been fine.  I am set for two years of Herceptin treatment.  My 'first one' of those was December 22nd. A mantra that works for me: 'I Can Do This',.  I didn't tell my kids (16 and 14) at the time until all my test results were back and I knew exactly what I was dealing with.  I ultimately told them about two weeks before Christmas last year.  There is no answer to 'why me'?  I have searched for that.  Take it one day at a time.   ",

I didn't see the TC thread but I don't know what the 'C' is.  I don't think I've taken 'C' unless its something called Cytomyacin (sp?) but I'm pretty sure it's Taxotere that does this. Maybe I'll be more earnest with the stairs.  I went back to my belly dance class but can only move half time to the music. I'm 46 and was 110 pounds before chemo, then I was 146 when chemo ended.  I took furosemide to get rid of the water weight but the weight fell off and now I'm 103-105 trying desperately to gain weight.  I realize now though that I don't look emaciated and was 103-105 before my kids so maybe I shouldn't panic about weight.  At 110 I had 'muffin tops' and now I don't so again, maybe I shouldn't whine! I am having a terrible time with shoes.   I used to be a 3\" heel 'shoeaholic'.  Since around spring '09 I've only been able to wear these super cheap and flexible flats from Target - ONE pair only!!  My toenails got thick and ridgey and half of my left big toenail popped off about 2 months ago.  The top of my toes feel weird when I try shoes on. I'm hoping I can maybe handle a wedge for spring/summer but it's weird with numb feet and 'weak' feeling ankles, leg muscles etc..  anything other than those flats seems to tire the feet. Thanks for your experience.  Sometimes I feel like I am the only one with this!!",
