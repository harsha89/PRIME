And a low mitotic score of 1. When I decided against chemo my onc agreed but added \"it's a crapshoot\". Not a very comforting response but true. We all face the same awful situation. Regardless of grade or stage there is just no way to be sure about a breast cancer treatment or prognosis. Like many others I made my decision, continue to worry a bit about whether it was the right one, and moved on. Hope you are able to take all the information you have and make a decision that works for you. Sue",

I asked about the potential change from ER+ to TN with the new tumor.  He said that as the initial tumor was ER+  a new TN tumor was not the same as one that started out TN.  In other words the new TN was actually the surviving ER-  cancer cells from the original tumor and thus less aggressive than a tumor that started TN in the breast.   You may want to verify this with your onc, but I thought this an important distinction.  ",

Of course you are right, the patient cannot \"beat\" the \"foe\".  But if you up front do not expect \"victory\" you certainly relieve your doctors of a lot of responsibility.  No matter how brave a warrior my daughter may turn out to be, her survival will depend on the medical profession, advances in cancer research, good care, intelligence and the resources to take advantage of what is available. That might not be enough, but the \"defeat\" will be on the shoulders of all the doctors, researchers etc. who have failed to cure her disease.   I will not let them off the hook by saying that she is somehow responsible to \"fight\" for her life.   ",

      "Content": "Jul 12, 2010 07:55PM - edited Jul 12, 2010 08:00PM by riverhorse Thank you so much for your observations.  Since my daughter's diagnosis I have been troubled by the \"fighting cancer\" metaphor.  The implication is if you fight you can win -- and if you lose it is because you didn't \"fight\" hard enough.  Why isn't the \"fight\" between the medical profession and the disease?   From reading this board I have come to think that appropriate treatment, monitoring, adequate resources, proximity to good care etc. are more likely to contribute to a better outcome than \"fighting\" spirit.  I think that when outcomes are not optimal the fault lies in the failure of the medical profession to find a cure.   It is also astounding that it is almost a given on this board that the patient must take responsibility for finding the best most effective treatment for her own iteration of the disease rather than relying on a medical professional. With all the money poured into research and the political clout of organized groups such as the Susan B. Komen organization it is strange that more progress has not been made towards a cure or at least a more proactive approach for stage IV patients. But I am new to all this so perhaps my observations are way off base.  ",
