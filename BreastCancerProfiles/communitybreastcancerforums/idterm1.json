    "Content": "idterm1 wrote: Hi all, first time poster here. We found out about my mom's stage 2 breast cancer about a month ago. She is having surgery tomorrow and we are very nervous and anxious. The information on breast cancer gets very overwhelming to be honest, and I'm not even sure where to look half the time, so I'm glad I found this discussion board where I can talk to real people that are going through this terrible thing as well. The doctor told my mom that after her surgery, she will be meeting with an oncologist. I know what an oncologist does but I'd still like to know exactly what goes on in those meetings? Do they talk about what they found in your mastectomy? Treatment options? You see, my mom doesn't speak English so this has been even more difficult for us since she can't ask all the questions she wants if an interpreter isn't present. She also doesn't have insurance so we've only been able to stay in the hospital that helps out uninsured patients. I'm just afraid we're not doing everything we can even though the hospital has been very helpful. I'm sorry if my post doesn't make much sense, my thoughts and words have become very jumbled. I've just been feeling really helpless, knowing we're leaving all of this to fate and in the hands of this hospital since we can't go anywhere else where they would do the surgery at very little cost. I know they're professionals, but it still doesn't shake the feeling that we should be looking into other places as well. Being rich would really be handy in this moment more than others.
