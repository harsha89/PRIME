I\u2019m finally scheduled for surgery on 2/4. I\u2019m trying to keep the worry down with mindfulness training. I have my second class the night after surgery. Hope to hear from other February surgery pals soon.",

Otherwise I'll start the next Wednesday, 3/27. My echo is scheduled for 3/19. I have my first PT consultation for cording on 3/18. I'm hoping to get some relief before the chemo SEs begin. I came home and scheduled a hair appointment for today. I'm hoping I don't lose it in the stylist's chair. Reminder to self: bring a box of tissues. I have a couple hours to scour Pinterest for pixie cut ideas. I was planning on a shorter cut before I found out that chemo was a certainty anyway. So glad I have this forum. Even if I don\u2019t post much, I\u2019m always lurking and cheering everyone on. ~Lis",
