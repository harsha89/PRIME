It's been going on for a couple months now (on and off) as far as I have noticed. I've gone in for an ultrasound, which found a small lump and then I had it biopsied, which came back benign. I've been scheduled for an MRI. Im curious if anyone has gone through this and if anyone had some information on what it could possibly be. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Should I do more tests? even though I\u2019ve done them all besides ductogram. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated because doctors don\u2019t tell me much and I\u2019m not sure exactly what to ask for. Thank you so much",
