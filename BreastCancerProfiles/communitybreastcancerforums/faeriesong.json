It's such a personal decision that I don't feel I can offer an opinion one way or another.  You really must do what is right for you. It's so difficult.  The Doctor is right, he can't tell the future.  One thing that you said did jump out at me \"My doctor would like me to go back on Taxol, because we stopped this treatment while it was still working...\" So, hard though the Taxol was on you, it was working.  That's something to hold on to. I really don't envy you this decision and can completely understand why you don't feel ready to go back onto it.  If you put your hand in the fire and it burns, you don't put your hand in the fire again, right? That's one of the most cruel things about cancer.  You can feel better with it than you do when you're having the treatment! Sorry, I'm rambling.  I will pray for strength for you in making your choice. gentle hugs Mary xxx",

Then about six weeks ago I started having trouble breathing.  I get puffed out really quickly.  Stupid things bring it on, like drinking too fast, talking too fast, bending over and getting too hot or too cold.  If I take it easy, it's still there but not so noticeable. I've seen several doctors, just finished my fourth round of antibiotics, been given a ventolin inhaler which did nothing and have just been given a steroid inhaler which doesn't seem to be doing much either. I had a chest X-ray a couple of weeks ago and three different doctors have given me three different results on the same X-ray.  \"It's fine.\", \"It shows resolving infection.\" and yesterday I was told that it \"...showed a partial collapse of my lower lobe.\" !?*  I wish they'd make their minds up! I don't have much confidence in the medical service here in the Outer Hebrides.  When I was in England, I had a Consultant Breast Surgeon, an Oncologist and a Breast Care Nurse.  Now I have a General Surgeon who I hardly ever see and a succession of GP's who don't seem to know what to do with me. The GP I saw yesterday is referring me to the Chest Specialist who comes over to our Island every so often so that could take ages.  The GP that I saw prior to that said she was going to refer me back to the Orthopaedic team but I've heard nothing. From your experience, does it sound like I need to push a lot harder or am I making something out of nothing?  I don't want to be a hypochondriac but I feel that I have to be my own advocate as no-one here seems to take my medical history seriously.

You need to position it where your feet will be when you lie down to sleep, or if you're sitting up to read, start with it higher and then lower it for sleeping.  I hope that helps - if you don't get the description, let me know and I'll try and explain it better. big hugs Mary xxx ",

We all love you here and if prayer can make a miracle then there is one flying your way. Gentle hugs to you dearest Stephanie, Mary xxx",
