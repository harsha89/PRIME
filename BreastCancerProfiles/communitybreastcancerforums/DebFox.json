Once that was numb they numbed the inside. A small incision is made and the \"needle\" is inserted. Tissue is vacuumed out through the needle. Pressure is applied to stop bleeding a band aide to cover incision. The \"needle\" is actually a pretty large kinda tube and the machine makes a bit of noise. I was expecting a needle like they use for a shot! lol The other surprise was how much they probed and pushed with the needle to get the tissue sample. None of it was painful. I only felt pressure. The site is still a little tender, but no bruising! My doctor also put a chip into the tumor so that if I needed additional procedures it would be easy for them to locate. I drove myself there and back. Piece of cake! Hope all of this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to email me!",
