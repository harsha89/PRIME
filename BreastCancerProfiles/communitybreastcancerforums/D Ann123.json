(this Friday)  God help me.  I am on whats called dose dense which is every other week.  The day after the kemo my husband gives me a shot of nuelasta.  I am very anxious over the whole hair falling out.  I have my wig picked out.  I also get anxious prior to the kemo treatment.  Thank you so very much for all your help",
