From all the research, we now have a greater understanding of these garments and how they can affect change overtime.",

I am from LSC and as a survivor dealing with lymphedema, I thought I would say hello and offer my services. I found Solidea and believe in my heart they offer a very different approach to helping us deal with this condition. I am here to help answer any questions you may have.   ",
