My pain came when the incision started to heal and the skin nerves waking up and starting firing, like little electrical impulses. The pulling drains were the most annoying. Please don't have those removed too soon. As big of pain as they are, you don't want to develop a seroma at the surgical site. The suction from the aspiration of the seroma hurt worse than the MX. I did get a surgical camisole to wear after SX. It has little pockets to hold the drains.  Good luck....",

My fingers have had noticable improvement. Only the tips are numb now. My feet are still numb from the balls to my toe tips. I was on neurotin for a time. It didnt improve with the drug and made my hands and feet swell and my head loopy. I have noticed that the more I walk it seems to get a little better. I still trip alot so I have to be careful. They no longer burn so I take that as improvement.",

You can ask to watch the US if your facilty lets you. If its a fluid filled cyst you can watch it disappear on the screen.",

If the mammo tech didn't smooth your breast before the mammo some breast tissue may not have flattened like it should.",
