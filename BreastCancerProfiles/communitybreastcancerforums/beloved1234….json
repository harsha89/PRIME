I would really love some personal experience and or statistics about this because I do not know how to look. I am sorry if the facts are slightly hazy: My friend, \"Sally,\" at age 28 was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and had a bilat masectomy with reconstruction. I believe that 4 or 9 LNs were found to have cancerous cells. I am not sure if she had them removed or not, she does have scars near her armpit. She researched chemo/radiation and decided to opt out of both and go \"natural.\" She modifed her diet, underwent some natural treatments, and psychotherapy. To my knowledge she never went in for follow-ups, as she had followed the natural route and basically revolted against western medicine (after researching effects of chemo/rad). After the reconstruction and alternative therapies she claimed that she had healed from the disease and basically refuses to talk about cancer, as she believes talking about it gives it power. About a year ago she moved out of the USA and recently visited me and although she appeared to be in glowing health she was *very* thin (eating disorder and dieting are not part of the picture, I know that for sure).  My question is, with a double masectomy, what are her odds of metastisis or reccurance. I REALLY want to believe that she healed herself the natural way, but I am also, of course, quite concerned for her.  From your personal experience what insight can you offer me?
