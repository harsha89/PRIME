My Recurrence Score is 19 and rate of Distant Recurrence at 10 years is 10% I don't remember the grade of the tumor but it was stage 1  Thanks for your help. Ruth",

Good luck, Ruth",

I had a lumpectomy followed by mammosite radiation.  Tumor size was 1.9mm with clear margins and clear lymph nodes (2) Er positive and her2 negative. My oncologists (talked to 2) suggest that I take Arimidex and that I don't need chemo, since the odds will be 91% that I will not have a recurrence.  Adding the chemo therapy will increase my odds from 93%-96%. I am struggling with this decision.  I am not a doctor how can I decide?? Any comments are welcomed. Thank, Ruth Log in to post a reply",
