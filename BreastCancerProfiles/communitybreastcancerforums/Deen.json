So glad that this thread is still going.  I've search through other boards and none provide the minutae of hair regrowth in quite the same way as this one :-) I love that we're talking about a hair here, an eyebrow there!  Loren and Artsee, thanks for the welcome back.  I had surgery (boob exchange - now have 2 new ones) and that knocked me out for a while.  BUT ... while I was in hospital, the hair really started to come in.  I started to get the look of a 5 o'clock shadow beneath the grey/white fuzz.  Now I have dark duck down that is filling in pretty quickly (though never quicke enough).  I'm 7 weeks out now and can't imagine getting to where Leah's was by week 9. Leah - you looked great! If someone could walk me through picture posting, I'll put mine up asap. D.",

Thanks so much for posting your pics.  I know how difficult losing it was for you.  So, more power to you for putting these up.  I think with the big earring look that you've got going that you look great. I have the same non-color thing.  I'm guessing that's pretty normal from what others have said.  I'm inspired by you going topless.  Next week I'm at week 10 - maybe I'll pluck up the same courage.  Will post another pic before I do and see if I can get a concensus. Happy growing everyone. D.",

I actually had a \"cut\" the other day.  It was a pathetic excuse of a cut - just a shimmy really, to get rid of those weird longer strands that made me look like a frantic chicken.  I have a very short \"do\" now. I've been going out a bit with no cap ... though it still feels strange.  This is me now, at 11 weeks.  What d'ya think?  Should I be ok running around like this?  I'm about to start teaching at a very conservative north eastern university (known for being straight-laced).

The hair is taking longer.  I'm 6 weeks out from chemo now and still have the sparse grey fuzz. Can anybody tell me how to post a picture so that I can share?  I am going NUTS waiting for this to grow.",

I have a question: my hair is definitely curled.  I tried to ignore it for awhile, but I can't anymore.  It's curly - long waves that go across my head (damn, damn, damn - not happy about it).  For those that have already gone through this, does the curl go away?????? (I'm, about 4 months out now). Stay well, all  D. ",

Problem is, I expected \"real growth\" to begin with a 5 o'clock shadow and come in like regular hair.  Am I wrong? Artsee - I'm with you there on the eyelashes.  I have about 3 left and if I lose them now, I'm gonna scream! Otter - yes. my lashes and brows only started to thin (and now are barely there) after my final tx (bitter, bitter irony) Beegirl - 7 1/2 weeks!!!! Noooooo.  I was hoping for quicker than that.  It's so confusing, because others have it come in faster.  Lauren - email Timtam and ask for access to the picture site that she moderates / runs.

I started having mammos at 30 and was diagnosed the second time I had one.  Only got them at my insistence.  I caught it early and it was only stage one.  But, I had a bi-lat with immediate recon, just because I never want to go through this again.  I personally think that if you have bc in your family, waiting til 40 is a gamble.  But,  you need to do what feels right to you. best, D.",

      "Content": "Sep 5, 2008 11:50AM - edited Sep 5, 2008 11:51AM by Deen After my 1st infusion of A/C I was in bed with the wieght of a truck on me (felt drunk and unable to move) about 3 hours later.  I didn't get out of bed for nearly 3 days because I felt so physically exhausted and woosey (sp?).  I ached in every muscle aswell. I don't want to scare you, but I think my anxiety made the experience much, much worse.  If I had to do that first time over, I would drink water like crazy, before, during, and after the treatment (for days!!!), eat a banana for the potasium (to get rid of the aches) and try and even out my anxiety as much as possible.  It will be ok.  It's much scarier in our heads than in reality.",
