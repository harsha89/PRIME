If you want to use a service to communicate with friends and family use something like facebook it is free and they make their money in an obvious way through adds not trickery.   And if you want to donate $ to a person write them a check or ask them to open a paypal acct it is at least honest. Shame on you caringbridge for not stating very clearly that donations do not go to any of the people on the sites! ",
