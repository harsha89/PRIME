I then went onto the Femara and since then have had numbness terrible and pain(like bad pins and needles) in the thumb and three middle finger , not the pinkie. The right hand more than the left.It got so bad that I couldnt tie my buttons or zips or even make makeup my bed.The minute I touch anything the pain would be excruciating .  I took to wearing gloves which eased the pain a bit . When I spoke to my Onc about it she said it was normal and that it will last a couple of months before the pain eased a bit!!! Well it is now 6 months later and as of 1 week ago I noticed the tingling , numbness and Pain is starting to ease.Its still there but seems to be getting better everyday , I can now tie my own buttons!!!!!! Hang in there......(This to shall Pass).  Hugs to all",
