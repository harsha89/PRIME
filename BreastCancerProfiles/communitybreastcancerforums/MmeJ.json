I had a total of one Lupron shot after active treatment, as I was diagnosed when pre-meno but chemo took care of that.  I declined further shots once I found out that I had about a 4% chance of my period coming back.  Overkill. I'm not so much talking about me as telling you the framework of my experience - I remember that there were two options:  A once-a-month and once-every-three-months.  We live in different parts of the world, but the way things were set up where I am, I could get either shot at the cancer center, but if I wanted the once-a-month I could also get it at my OB/GYN.  Seems to me that if your gyn is in the same network as your cancer center, that should be administratively simple for you.  Maybe a cheaper co-pay, too, should you have one. Bug the cancer center to tell you if and to whom they've referred other BC patients in the same situation as you. Also, maybe if you're not yet \"really\" in menopause, perhaps you skip the Lupron and switch to Tamoxifen rather than an AI.  It's plenty evil, as are all the anti-hormonals, but it's cheap.",

No, please don't shave your head in solidarity - come and talk to me when your hair begins falling out in clumps after you start chemo, and you have to wait a few months instead of a few days for it to grow back. I can't imagine how lonely it can feel to be a man with BC, traveltext. I'm a few years out now, but grapple every day with chronic complications from the treatments. The pinking doesn't disgust me to the degree it did a few years ago, but the constant television commercials in my part of the world for Cancer Treatment Centers of America creates a little sprinkle of aaack! every time I see them. Face it, folks - we are potential revenue units. Everyone is an advertising target, no matter what the industry. I loathe the war and sports metaphors associated with this, so I don't really call myself anything.",

I entered it, however, very fit and otherwise healthy at age 50. Lots of exercise, excellent diet, etc. I have tremendous empathy for people who have to try to jump those hurdles during and after treatment. I do envy the people who make full recoveries and get their lives back. Well, maybe more am grateful in a general way that some are that fortunate and it's important to know those stories, too. However, we're still here. :-) I'll take it.",

I'm still every six months and he tells me that will be the case for the rest of my life. I am high risk. He's very conservative, which means he sticks to the NCCN guidelines (no imaging unless symptomatic, no blood work, no tumor markers - go figure). But I do make him do blood work once a year for my own peace of mind. A co-worker who had a similar dx and tx on the ILC side and whose onc trained under my onc is about two years behind me. Hers has already released her to once a year visits. I do not mind seeing mine every six months because he's the only remaining doc I have who has been there from the beginning (I have chronic health issues due to the treatments). The continuity is important. P.S. Congrats, ck55, on being 10 years out! Perhaps you could ask if you could drop to once a year, and see what your onc says? Did you do the extended anti-hormonal tx?",
