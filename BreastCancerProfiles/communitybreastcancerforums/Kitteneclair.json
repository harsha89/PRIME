    "Content": "Kitteneclair wrote: I'm a total newbie here so apologies if I overlook some info in my question. I am 40 years old and my baseline mammo uncovered IDC, a 6mm tumor in my left breast. My lumpectomy uncovered cancer in my sentinel node but none in the other 27 nodes removed as part of the resultant AND. I am Stage 2, Grade 3, ER/PR+, HER2-, no BRCA or BART mutation. My oncology consultations all recommend chemo, but are split between 4xTC and 8xAC-T. The former is obviously considerably shorter in duration; the latter increases my long term survival by about 4% but comes with a 1% likelihood of future heart disease. The oncologist with whom I feel best about working in terms of philosophy and demeanor recommends AC-T, but has said she will treat me with TC if I am insistent that it is what I want - she feels that the AC-T is just the slightest marginally better choice, but can see an argument for TC. Her point is that I am relatively young, and I only have one shot at this, so let's use the big guns. An attractive argument, but the counterpoint ones say, why over treat and risk heart disease, when based on all evidence, the tamoxifen is going to do most of the work? Has anyone else faced this kind of decision? How did you resolve the conflict? Log in to post a reply",
