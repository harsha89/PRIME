The thing to do is to be very active in voicing your thoughts and concerns with the surgeon and letting him know if you are not comfortable with waiting until Aug 8.  You can tell him you want the biopsy now and don't want to wait if that will make you feel more comfortable.  I totally get the fear of waiting.  I waited 2 months to get into surgery because my surgeon went on vacation.  A biospy does not take the place of surgery, it just allows the surgeon to know if it is malignant prior to performing the surgery.  Once my tumor was removed and found malignant, I was not able to have a sentinel biopsy of the lymph nodes because the tumor was gone.  Instead, they did an axillary lymph node disection which is more aggressive.  If I had a biopsy previously, then I could have been spared removing 17 lymph nodes which came back negative for cancer.  You can read more about lymph nodes at this link:  www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/fa... I had my cancer 2 years ago and I am doing fine.  I did not have to do chemo, just a lumpectomy and radiation.  Stay positive and read as much as you can to education yourself about your options and do not hesitate to ask questions. ",
