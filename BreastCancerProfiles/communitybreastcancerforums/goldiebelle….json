Because it was near the holidays and every doctor and surgeon was on vacation it was a very long wait. I started chemo the end of January and had my surgery in June. It has been a long year but like someone else said there will be a time when minutes then hours go by without you thinking about your cancer. It will. Or be an easy road but it is doable. If you need anyone to talk to we are mere for you. Pm me anytime you want to vent or have questions that I may cease to help you with.",
