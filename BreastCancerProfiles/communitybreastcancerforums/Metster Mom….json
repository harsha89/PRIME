I did everything I was supposed to do - even tried to do it with a smile. Now three years later, and I was just diagnosed with mets to my lower sacrum. I will have my ovaries out this week and will then start Ibrance and Letrezole 2 weeks later. I, of course, am a mix of emotions. I have a 9 year old son who I want to watch grow up so I don't plan on going anywhere! The weird part is that other than a little lower back pain, I don't feel sick at all. My blood counts are normal and I feel great. Has anyone else felt like this at the time of diagnosis? I'm on here hoping to find stories of positivity, strength and HOPE! Cancer really sucks.

I agree moderation and I also think having a little more on the weekend is fine. We have to live, right? I am not really drinking during the week, unless I have a social event. On the weekends I like to hang out with my husband and kick back with a few glasses of wine. I'm newly diagnosed and very overwhelmed and full of emotion.I need some normalcy! ❤️",
