I only wear wigs to church on Sun. a.m. and I have also wore one for a wedding but thats about it. I didn't lose any fingernails but I did lose one toe nail.  And I agree polish helps them all look a lot better.  I have tried to keep my finger nails filed short to keep from breaking them.  And I also keep them polished for the extra strength it gives them.  I was diagnosed at 51 but I am now 52.  But the ones that tore me up at treatment were some young women.  With children to go home and put happy faces on for as they would say.  And when I had my treatment I had no one to take care of.  My husband can do for himself if I feel bad.  But the young women that have children to take care of that is a different story. One woman I know was still nursing her baby when she found the lump.  How devastating having this young baby and also having to deal with cancer.  I do feel blessed that I didn't have it at a young age.  Well now I am a rambling take care Linda as your health returns.  Isn't it a good feeling the word done!  Now lets just pray for continued good health.  Byeeeeeeeeeeee Dana",

As for hair I have no eyelashes and only a few eyebrow hairs I have to fill in for a real eyebrow.  I am 52 and my hair was mostly dark also.  But what is coming in looks a lot more salt than pepper oh well.  It is mainly just fuzz covering my head a bit.  But I will take it gray or not that can always eventually once longer be colored. The main thing I look forward to is my hair getting long enough to not have to wear any hats on my head!!!  That will be a day to celebrate. As for the drugs my DR. is putting me on Femora which I am also told causes the joint problems.  I must admit I am not looking forward to it!  Because I already prior to the BC have some joint problems.  I am scared that they will get much worse but only time will tell.  I think he said he was waiting until 4 weeks post my last treatment to start the Femora. The things to look forward to UGH.  What I mainly look forward to is the return of a somewhat normal life.  I haven't worked since April when this all started.  I didn't have that as an option.  I am a flight attendant and we aren't allowed to fly unless we are pretty much 100% the FAA won't allow it.  I look forward to returning to work but I also dread it as I am scared will I be able to keep up or will I have a hard time.  The DR. is keeping me off until Jan.1st because the Taxotere was pretty hard on me.  And also because my days aren't 8 hr. days we have a lot of days that are 12 to 14 hr. days.  So he thinks I need this time to get some strength back and I agree. The Taxotere is just so physically draining I am so glad to be off it.                                                    Take Care All Dana    ",

As for the hair hopefully you will get more real soon.  Some women I meant during treatment started growing it back the last couple of months.  This was on the Taxatere which I was on and not growing it back.  So I was quite jealous when they showed off their hair length.  Oh well I will just learn to be patient.                                    Happy and Great Health to all Dana ",

I so look forward to the blessing of good health again. I will say though the nurses that I have dealt with during treatment have been great.  And I wouldn't want to do the job they do it would get to me watching people suffer.  At first today they said I wouldn't have to have the Neulasta shot tomorrow and that thrilled me.  Because it also makes me feel bad.  Because if my count dropped just a little low that would be ok because I have no more treatments.  But then came disappointment  :(   they called and said my count was already pretty low.  They hadn't looked at it before I had left.  So they feel I need to come in and get the shot so I don't end up sick and in the hospital  UGH  I'm disappointed but I will go and get the nasty shot. Again at least it is the last time.  How long have you been done Linda?                                                  Take Care Dana   ",

As some of my days flying are 13 to 14 hrs. long.  And I usually work a 3 or 4 day trip at a time.  I am not flying at this time as I said I am in chemo and the FAA doesn't allow that.  You have to be considered 100% which I am a ways from that right now. Anyway she told me her Dr. even told her when she does fly to wear a sleeve.  So ladies let me know what you have heard.  Log in to post a reply",

So after this last one how long until the joint and muscle aches leave and my energy returns? I will not be having radiation just the chemo.  But I am concerned about going back to work.  In fact real concerned I like my job but I have to keep up.  And I don't want to endanger losing it.  Also my days are long 12 and 14 hr. days are common.  I am a flight attendant and we are busy.  And of course I always love it when we come in at gate 20 and then have an air craft swap at gate 60 for example and they want us there quickly.  I don't think they would like my pace right now.  So I would just like ideas of what to expect.  If you had Taxotere and had some of the problems I have been having.  Oh and one of my favorite problems haa ha is that my eyes run \"all\" the time it drives me nuts.  And they have been since treatment #2 on Taxotere.  Well thats about it I await the feedback.  Thanks all and hang in there and lets get healthy!!                               Dana      Log in to post a reply",
