Good luck my dear!  I'll pray this goes in your favor.",

Mom had BC at the age of 39.. so I know the BRCA mutation is from my maternal side.  She received a unilateral radical mastectomy and radiation.  I remember it so well.  Back then they didn't take all the precautions with rads that they do now.  But, my point is, she went on to develop a highly incurable leukemia and died.  Does this happen often?  Probably very rare.   Although it was devastating.. much more so than her breast cancer. As it stands, I'm not having rads... although I had a bilateral mastectomy, stage IIa, no positive nodes and no lymphovascular invasion.  My post surgery path showed 'no carcinoma detected'.. or basically a pCR. I'm ultra sensitive to the throes of leukemia as my only sibling, my brother (50 years old at diagnoses) also developed a different form of leukemia and he's no longer with us.   I already had high dose neoadjuvant chemotherapy which carries a slight risk of leukemia.  ** ugh**   After speaking with an MD Anderson RO I got a resounding NO to rads. I could only receive a 3% benefit and that def didn't outweigh the risks in my case.  This was her TN savvy opinion, the opinion of 2 subsequent aggressive BC savvy ROs and my MDA MO.  I could have stopped at one consult.. but I'm of the mindset you throw everything at this beast upfront.  On the other-hand, you DO have to weigh the very real risks.  Radiation is SO VERY individual, controversial between one doctor to the next... with various aspects of pathology, age, menopausal status, etc. playing into the equation.  However, after gaining much perspective, you the patient, will dictate your treatment.   Just be certain to educate yourself thoroughly beforehand.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and 3rd opinions.. even if they muddy the waters. Best to all.",
