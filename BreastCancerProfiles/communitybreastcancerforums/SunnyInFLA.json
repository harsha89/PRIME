I am scared and worried of course and the last time I did this was 4 year ago when they discovered I had \"fatty breast tissue\" after I found a hard flat lump which felt attached to my right upper breast. I wish I knew then what I know now, I might of been more deligent in asking for a biopsy.. or went to a breast Dr. for further analysis.  Keep your fingers crossed for me that tomorrow is not the day they tell me this dimple in my breast looks like something serious and they need to biopsy it.  Anyhow. . thank you all for holding my hand and being support for me. I don't have many people in my life to talk to and I am so scared.   Log in to post a reply",

A small cyst around 12' oclock and I was told I have lots of gladular tissue (apparently they do not biopsy cysts for some reason at the breast center). The lighting inside the office made it so where I could not duplicate the dimpling on the understide of my breast for the tech.. Doctor said if dimpling was caused by a mass she would see it on the U/S. I feel 80% better that nothing was detected on mammo and U/S, but still paranoid about the dimpling. Still no answer for the dimplling which honestly scares me more then the lump/cyst I felt. Any ideas what I should do? They won't do an MRI because of no family BC history. Should I just let it go and be happy that it showed nothing of signifigance on the tests today, or should I seek further info because I have read several stories on here where Mamo and US found nothing but they pressed for a biopsy and something was found. UNGH.. HELP.. Suggestions please.",
