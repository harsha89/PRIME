Likely because it's tied to so many more things about being  a woman, then overall health. I hope that makes sense. ",

I haven't post this, well, just because, I suppose. But, I found my sex drive was REALLY high after surgery and even now. Not as high as directly after surgery. What is THAT about?? It must be something to do with hormones that are in the tissue that's removed. Maybe our bodies just kick it up good to make up for what was taken away?   6 weeks out and still in the recliner. Oh my you poor thing!!! I really feel terrible for complaining now.  I am in my bed and WILL sleep on my side. It's painful, but I do it anyhow because the pain my neck is worse if I don't.  Ijm33, it's sounds like you are doing well for being 3 weeks out! Good for you!  My PS didn't want me to start PT until about 3 weeks out. I am 4 weeks out now and will be calling for PT Monday. My BS just told me to reach up, out, down and practice picking small items up from the ground. She is very helpful. Sorry to say.  SPDGirl: Thank you for sharing your story. Hearing how you are dealing with your recovery helps me to feel \"normal.\" I am driving, though I shouldn't be!! I drive on my muscle relaxers. I don't feel it affects my ability to drive. But, if were pulled over, it would be not so good I am sure. I have gone back to work, as I feel able. I own my own business, so I can set my own hours and job duties. However, my job is very physical. So, I do what a can, as I am able. I do spend days on the couch or in bed, working on paper work, and sleeping a lot. Glad to know I am not the only one. :D Kandyhut, it sounds like you are taking it all in stride and recovery nicely. I am glad to hear that!! Keep it up!! I am sorry about the positive node. I think you will find many stories on this site of women who chose NOT to do chemo, even with positive nodes found. Keep us updating. I hope your oncotype appt goes well and they say you DON'T need chemo.  ReadyAbout: Thinking of you. I hope things start turning around for you.  DTR808: That sounds great to have such a special contact!! Please keep up up to date on how it goes and what she advises.  Thank you, EVERYONE for sharing your stories and daily routines. It has helped me immensely!! I feel really terrible for complaining now. I am able to drive. I went on another hike today, with my friend, \"DJ\" I'll call him. ;D I was in gobs of pain, but had enough pain relief to enjoy being outdoors in the wilderness and the feeling of participating in life again. Undecided if I will go into work tomorrow. But, happy I am feeling well enough to have the choice. Healing and strength to all of you!! ",

I read your posts daily and keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. I had to step back for a while. Frankly, because I was embarrassed about the chaos my life was in, and the chaos I felt I brought to this forum, beyond that of my breast cancer. Things are settling in my life and with my foobs! Lol. I am up to 640 cc's. My previous fill, not the one I had this week, but the one I had several weeks ago was wonderful!! Seriously, something about that particular fill and cc number actually released a good deal of the vice grip pressure we all are feeling. It felt like my chest was saying a collective \u201cawwwwee!\" I even took a week long vacation! I did not need any muscle relaxers or pain killers the entire week. Then comes this weeks fill. Back to the vice grip!! The good news is, is that you too can look forward to that magic number fill that will release the pressure you are feeling. I hope it comes sooner, rather than later for those in this stage! Those of you that are on hormone therapy. Have you had your exchange surgery yet? My onco called last week to start my Tamoxifen, but realized I haven't had my exchange surgery yet. He says Tamoxifen interferes with blood clotting and that I can't start until after my final surgery. How are your drs dealing with this issue? As always, thank you for being here and for allowing me to rant about so many non breast cancer related things without judging me😊. For those of you in the teaching field,my hat is off to you and I admire your fortitude!! Teaching is NOT easy!! I miss it like crazy. I miss the kids!!

The oncologist just phoned and my oncotype score is 14 which means NO CHEMO!!!!!!!!!!!!! That was a HUGE relief!! He is writing me a prescription for Tamoxifen.

The WORST part is the pain. I am having so much PAIN!! Still needing muscle relaxers several times a day and oxycodone s couple times a day. The pain is greatly influencing my ability to function normally everyday. Anyone else still having high degree of pain? I had a fill of 60cc, giving me a total of 300 cc fill thus far. The pressure seems slightly better. But throbbing pain still. Also still LOTS of bruising due to the hematoma. I started IV therapy today and Anderson Medical Therapies in Seattle.

Since I was told no chemo from my oncologist, I have heard nothing. Not when the hormone meds start. Not how much, or when or what to take. I haven\u2019t heard from P.T., and I am frustrated as well. I feel your pain! In more ways than one! ReadyAbout; I\u2019m glad you got muscle relaxers finally! They don\u2019t take the pain away, but for me, they do take the edge off. As4me: I go from good day to bad day, pain wise. I realized I went to work too soon. I tried lifting an 80lb dog when I was having good day. Let\u2019s just say, the good day ended there and now I am back to barely lifting my toothbrush!! I am having phantom nipple pain! Or just lots of pain in my incision area, which is in the nipple region. Good news is that I am getting more feeling back in my arm! I am also having hot flashes and oddly, an increased sex drive. Anyone else experiencing this? Is it hormonal shifts? ",

I wish I had known that \"recovery\" doesn't necessarily mean \"normal.\" It's a new normal for sure!! I am not doing anything for my scars. I know many more surgeries are on the horizon, well at least one or two more. I also plan on getting a tatoo to cover up any scaring. So,I am not doing much about that for now. I too sleep more than I like to admit and find I am feeling useless and worthless a good deal of the time. Then I'll have some good days, where i am strong, productive and feel great. So, it's definitely a two step forward, one step back, or more like two steps back, one step forward kinda thing. I went in for my last fill and asked the doctor NOT to do a fill and that I wasn't wanting to do any more fills. Just tired of the pressure and pain. Having large breasts, or breasts that are \"attractive\" is no longer important for me, as it related to comfort and health. I am choosing comfort over vanity. I was a D cup before, now I'll be a C. That's fine with me.",

How long did it take for  you to finally get  your \"staging?\"  I am one week out today from my surgery and I would say the first week, I've done surprising well!! I've kept up with the meds and am getting tired of every 2 hours the alarm going off to take something and the disrupted sleep due to med schedule and general discomfort. Even so, overall, I am feeling well. Some days I am VERY tired and sleep most of the day, well between the 2 hour alarms anyway. :D Your story is inspiring and makes me look forward to the coming weeks.  I had one drain removed and will have the second one removed this coming Tuesday.  My cancer is of course, an anomaly. Because I'm multifocal and EACH tumor has it's own cancer type, this is making my staging process and treatment tricky. I was diagnosed March 30 and still do NOT know the stage of my cancer. I'm starting to let the notion of even caring about the stage go for now, because with each visit, I come back with more questions and still unanswered questions. Just going to take it one day at a time. As I said, the first week I did pretty well.  This being the first day, going on week 2, I am getting tired of the med schedule, tired of trying to be active but realizing after just a few minutes of anything, I am in pain and tired and needing to rest and take pain meds. Tired of the affects of the pain meds. Tired of dealing with the bowel issues associated with pain meds, tired of having to pee every other hour, or change a drain, or take a med, or try to slip in a bit of sleep. So, that's my story for the start of week two. Tired of it all. Week one, optimistic. Week two. Tired. That's all. :D",

So, he is going to talk with my surgeon about getting my physical therapy started.  I felt I had been doing too much physical activity at work, and one day, actually felt like my expanders, or my muscle shifted, when I attempted to lift an 80 lb dog in the wash tub. I have been having a great deal of pain and am still taking muscle relaxers and oxycodone daily. Sometimes the pain is so bad, it takes my breath away. Well, at my appt with my ps yesterday, he said, my muscle, and/or expanders have shifted and they are riding unusually high. He will be able to fix that at my next surgery. But, it's the oddest feeling. I feel them up into my upper shoulder/collar bone area now. Very constricting in terms of movement and of course painful. I had been able to sleep on my side fairly comfortably. No longer. I can't sleep on my surgery side at all. Sleeping on the other side is uncomfortable too.

Guess this is one time, I am grateful for my fat!  I think this would be so much easier for me if I didn't have so many other extenuating things going on in my life at the same time. DJ, my friend, who I've mentioned before, was living with me, AND working for me. We became very close, and he has become resentful of the fact that he has depended on me, and needed me and the consequent emotional ties that bound us because of all these overlapping relationship issues. He moved out today. He says into a motel. Though I sense he is seeing someone and may be moving in with her, idk. I don't get a lot of information from him anymore. I don't even ask anymore. The fact that I am his employer complicates things even more. We HAVE to work together, I have no choice. Unless I let him go. Which I won't do. He does a GREAT job at my business and would be very difficult to replace. Nonetheless, the emotional roller coaster he keeps me on, makes my life difficult.  Dealing with cancer, love, heartbreak, dating(lack thereof), trying to feel attractive and like \"dating material\" while being 53, with a msx, and recovering from breast cancer, and keeping my relationship with DJ going smoothly, is more than I care to take on most days. That and contemplating moving out and getting my own place. (I live with my mother, sister and her two children) to help share expenses. Breast cancer has made me rethink if I want to continue living in this situation. I feel like I have one last chance to get the life I want, or settle for the life I  have. Or, maybe not settle, but accept, for better or worse, this is my life.  Thank you for sharing this journey with me. I am sorry to vent too much. This is one place, I can kinda get these thoughts out that relate to how cancer is affecting my entire life. ",

He sounds incompetent to me. We are here for you. Vent, vent away!!! I don't know what I'd do without my muscle relaxers. I am so freakin' tired of the pain, I can't stand it. I too am planning on edibles, or oils. I can't get through the day without my muscle relaxers every 4 hours. When it's super bad, I'll take the oxycodone too, but I don't like the woozy feeling I get with it. I am still going braless, I occasionally wear a bra, or the camisole from the hospital stay wit the drain pockets. I am not sure which is worse, the breast pain, or the itching if I wear a bra. So, I choose the chest pain.  I have another complicated issue that I live with, and dealing with breast cancer on top of it, has me very very depressed. Sadly. I am living with(platonically) and have this person working for me. We are very close and yes, we have slept together, just prior to my MSX. Which, of course we both had our reasons, but it complicates things. So, I am feeling sad about the relationship that isn't. Frustrated that my body is holding me back from doing anything about it. It's not like I can go out and start dating at this point when I'm either in pain, or on pain meds and sleeping, or lacking energy or whatever. Then my \"friend\" healthy as a horse is out and about enjoying his life. I feel left behind. Yet, he shouldn't stop living because of what I'm going through. Anyhow, a  lot of emotions tied up into one complicated scenario.  Okay on the bright side: MAY surgeries are over!! We've all had our surgery and are at different stages of recovery. We are mostly all dealing with this pain and pressure at differing degrees. There is camaraderie in that at least, that we all understand what one another is going through physically. There is comfort in that.  I should be celebrating, dancing to the light of the moon, that I am not having to do chemo, or radiation, and choosing not to do hormone treatments. So, no side effects for me! I am choosing  to not worry about the cancer, or recurrence. Rather to live one day at a time, and not worry about what I can't control.  Sll101984, blessedinth, from what I've heard from some women, side effects are minimal. Mostly sexual dysfunction, if that can be considered minimal. :( And then there's that.....:O) Please tell me how all of you are handling getting back into the routine of life? I am still in so much pain, that I lay around the house like a slug. I hate it. But, the meds make me tired, so I don't want to move about, without the meds, the pain makes me crabby and not want to move about. How is everyone doing with daily routines?  ",

I can set  my own hours and for the most part pick and choose which duties I partake in. Mostly I do the desk work. That being said, my job is physical, and I do think I've overdone it with lifting things and working with dogs that are heavy leash pullers. (I do dog boarding/training/daycare).  I am in constant pain and today was just suffering all through the morning. So, yes, technically I am back to work, but it is not a pleasant experience. The pleasant part is that it gets me out of the house for a bit of time and makes me feel semi productive.  As4me: The pain is just unbearable. Today for example, I feel like I have bra constricting my arm area, binding around my arm pit and shoulder and breast area. Except that I am braless. So, it's internal pain. I have swelling just outside my armpit area. Pain everywhere around the surgical area. Rib pain. The same type of pain most of you are describing. I am not getting nerve pain though. I have significant numbness still. Even so, I have gained some feeling back in my underarm. I was surprised to read a while ago who many of you are shaving your armpits since mine are completely numb. I was afraid of cutting myself. Though I did it, because I needed it! Well, overnight, the other day, I woke to a patch of feeling back in my underarm. Just an area, one particular area. The rest around it is still  numb. But, I have that one spot with feeling again!  I have a lot of itching, in spots in areas that are numb. So, I kinda search for where is the actual itch?  I still have significant bruising and ring around the top of my surgical area where my  hematoma was. I am guessing that could be the cause of the pain.  I stupidly lifted a heavy 5 gallon water jug at work the other day which gave me more pain. I've decided to call my PS Monday and request a check in, just so he can just take a look to be sure all is well. I don't know that I should be having this much pain this far out of surgery. Still  need the narcotics. I keep NOT taking them just because I don't want to ALWAYS be stoned on pain meds. But, then I suffer all day, until I finally choose to take them. I am seriously getting some marijuana this weekend. I think it may work as well as the oxycodone with less side effects.  All THAT being said, I think I am getting better. :D The pain, yes, constant and debilitating. BUT I am gaining FEELING back in many areas, so that is a good sign.  As always, thank you to each and every one of you who are sharing your experiences, it helps so much to learn how similar our experiences really are. Those of you with kids, KUDOS and I bow to you!! I can't even imagine. I have 7 dogs. Yes SEVEN in my household. They are enough work, I can't imagine little ones! My hat is off to you.  ReadyAbout, thank you again. I love hearing your surgeons take on our pain. It truly does add validity to our suffering! Have a GREAT Friday everyone. Try to be good to yourselves! ",

Some of my difficulty and pain during this experience has been with my friend \"DJ\" who lives with me, and he and have a very close relationship. I have been there for him in so many ways, so many times. The reason he lives with me is because he became homeless after a divorce, and went into a recovery program for alcohol. I had higher expectations for how he would be there for me during this cancer diagnosis similar to how I've been there for him during his divorce and recovery. Yet, he has been more MIA during this time than ever before. I think you all hit it right on the nail when you say, men are fixers. Since they can't fix this, they feel their hands are tied and they feel helpless. He expressed to me that he is afraid of losing me, more than anything else, so he avoids me as a way not to have to think about me and my illness. But, it is very hurtful, because more than anything I just want his company through all this. I am tied at home in pain, he's out having the time of his life. It's very hurtful. I am sorry your dh isn't there for you in a way that you need them to be. We ARE the stronger sex, no doubt about it!!  I tried the marijuana/cbd chocolate squares today for the pain. It DOES work. Though I am still very nervous about using it, how much to use, how often to use it, can I use my muscle relaxers with it?  The pain and tightness that you are all describing is what we are ALL dealing with it seems like.  Hikinglady: Like you, I think the combo of the muscle relaxers with the oxycodone is what works best for me.  SPDgirl: I am with you. It's all getting to me too. The tightness is just so overwhelmingly exhausting! Kudos on getting your pits shaved! That's a feat, I know! I am sorry you are having a tough time. I am sorry about the passing of your cat as well. ((hugs)).  I have 7 dogs in my household. 3 belong to me. 4 belong to my sister. I live with my sister, her son and daughter (my niece and nephew), my mother and my friend DJ, who I've mentioned a few times. And our collective 7 dogs!! Yes, it's a busy household! I have a doggy daycare so many of them spend their days at the doggy daycare. All 7 are there today because we are celebrating my nieces birthday and don't want the dogs in the way. :D  ",

There are the group of women that say they have no pain and wonder why I am still having pain. Then there is the group that say the pain NEVER goes away. I hope I am NOT in the latter. I can't imagine this going on for years. How do you get on with your life when the pain and pressure is all consuming?",

My drain output was minimal in one drain a week after surgery and was removed. My other drain is still outputting 100cc about every 24 hours. I agree with you on Star Trek med! Kelligirl; Wow back to work!! How far out from surgery are you?  I am sorry about the hematoma. I have an appt this afternoon to have my surgery site checked. I'm having similar symptoms. Let me know what your outcome is. Hoping for the best! SPDgirl; Me TOO! Week 2 is much more difficult for me, than week one!! Week one was kind of a breeze for me. Now week 2, I am antsy and want to be more active than I am able. These muscle contractions and odd pressure in the area of the procedure, and in my underarm, the sensations are driving me batty! This too shall pass! We'll move on from it, and it'll be better soon! Michi; I am told not to so exercises yet as well. I keep wanting to stretch my arm, but then worry, I\"m going to interfer with the reconstruction, or healing, or whatever. So, I am moving as I can comfortably move. I hear ya on the sleep issue! I purchases a hospital type bed, just prior to surgery that raises and lowers the back end with a remote button. That's helped. Falling asleep is hard, but once I'm asleep, I seem to do alright. I hope your sleep continues to get better and better.  Bella2013; Good advice!! I had been drinking tons!! Although now I am having to force myself to drink. Not as thirsty and bored with water. :D   TriplePHTown; I try to walk at least on block, 2 - 3 times a day. I think it helps with blood flow, swelling and overall mental well being. Keep it up! Readabout; You are HIKING already!! You go girl!! I WANT to hike so bad, but am afraid! I am afraid of falling, of burning out midway through my hike. I am walking, just a block at a time. But it seems the more movement I have the more pain meds I need. I do pretty well with minimal activity and LOTS of rest. Though going STIR crazy!! I drove today, I shouldn't have, but I didn't have a ride to my dr appt. It was difficult to lift the emergency break in the car and open/close the doors. It put my healing in perspective. I am impressed by your level of getting back into the swing of things. Good job! Marena: How far out from surgery are you? Getting off of anesthesia is the hardest part isn't it? eo2378; Your diagnosis sounds similar to mine. I had 2 tumors, One was ER/PR+ Her- , The other was ER+ PR- HER-,  I have my oncology appt tomorrow, still do NOT have my staging because my surgeon says my Pr(-) in one tumor, and the fact that I have multiple tumors, complicate the diagnosis. Plus when I had my MSX the tissue removed was too close to the chest bone to have a clear margins. Anyhow, this is stressing me because of the unknown level of aggressiveness with my cancer at this point. Do you have your staging? Did having one area + and another -  interfere with your staging diagnosis or treatment plan? Do you have your treatment plan? For me, I am weaning off the meds. Mainly still doing the muscle relaxers regularly due to the constant muscle spasms. I am finding I am SOOOOO tired though. I can barely stay awake for 2 hours at a time. I want to go back to work, part-time, but can't seem to stay alert for very long, if at all. Any of you finding the fatigue overwhelming at this point?   ",

My last drain was removed last night and I'm amazed how much relief it's given me! Marena; Perhaps you should ask for pain meds? I've tried going cold turkey off of them and always have very difficult days when I do, with the muscle tightness and cramping, and pain. I have cut back considerably, but still am on 1 - 2 muscle relaxers per day, and at least one pain killer. The Tylenol did NOTHING to alleviate my pain. So, it's prescription pain meds for me still, day 18 post surgery. I've given up trying to tough it  out. Now I am merely wanting comfort to get through this.  Fasterpussycat: I was having significant pain over my sternum as well. My ps says the bulk of the msx takes place over the sternum area. So that makes complete sense that you are having pain in that area. I hope you get relief very soon! Kandyhut: What is the latest  news on your left node? What did they find? I'm glad your daughter is helping out!! I would take your oxycontin as needed and just request refills as needed. I understand the crackdown, but when you NEED it and aren't abusing it, that's the purpose of the drug in the first place. I think the entire world is overreacting about this opiod crisis. YES< people ABUSE them. But, those who have had their breasts amputated, NEED them.  Readyabout: LOL \"Two aluminum cans\" How about a grapefruit that's been overripened! That's what mine look like!   EO2378: a MILE Of walking!! Congrats!! That is FANTASTIC! As4me, I am 18 days post msx and am experiencing what my dr calls the post surgery blues. My mind is wanting to get back to the business as living, as usual. While my body is saying, \"Wait, hold up a second, I need to catch my breath.\"  I feel guilty if I am not productive at home, or if I nap too much, or lounge too much. I get tired, and sore when I try to do much of anything. I went back to work after less than 2 weeks posts surgery and realized that was toooo soon. So, back to working from home now. Which I don't mind so much. I am still on my muscle relaxers and pain meds. I find I am too uncomfortable to the point of feeling light headed and unable to catch my breath if I don't keep some sort of pain management under control. I believe it's the result of the TE more than the MSX. But, perhaps a little of both. Waiting for my onco type report and genetic testing. As it stands drs are recommending chemo, radiation and hormone treatments. Because I had two different types of cancer in the one breast, one of which doesn't respond well to chemo or hormone treatments, I'm reluctant to do either of those. But, time will tell. We'll see. I am very fortunate in that my BIL does cancer research. He just published a book titled Outside the Box Cancer Therapies. https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Box-Cancer-Therapies-Alternative/dp/1401954588/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1528232131&sr=8-1&keywords=outside+the+box+cancer+therapies  I'll be staring some IV therapy at his clinic in Seattle, WA next week.  Looking forward to it! ",
