I was up and around a week after surgery and think I could have worked 1 to 2 weeks out. I drove myself 2 hours each way to rads, and did fine. I was tired and emotional I think because of the instant menopause/tamoxifen. I actually think mentally and emotionally I would have done better having a job. I did have some skin issues for several weeks after rads were completed that would have made it uncomfortable to have to dress for work. There were women being treated at the same time as I was who had no choice but to work full time and take care of small kids too. I think we do what we have to do. Rest when you can and eat lots of protein to promote healing.",

Allow your feelings, they are real and valid. I like to think that I have reached a level of acceptance of what is and what may come-but an article I read gave me pause. I think it was a Dr. out Boston? who was trained in Palliative Care...teaching people to accept death and go gracefully...she beleived her own words, until she was diagnosed...then she fought it and went against all of the advice she trained to give others. We don't know what we will do until we are faced with it really. Perhaps the illusion of control comforts some. I think all I can control about most things is my reaction.

It is soothing. I bought a stack of toothbrushes from the dollar store and changed them daily. When the chemo was being dripped, I was told to keep ice chips in my mouth steady during the drip and stay well hydrated after. I had relatively zero mouth issues following this protocol.",

My oncologist felt that the risks of damages far out weighed the potential benefits of doing tax after the AC. I was diagnosed 4/6/09, surgery 7/8/09, tamox 7/14/09, rads x 30 Aug. & Sept. 09. I had a team of Drs. at the Mayo Clinic. My PET was 7/09. The breast surgeon thought that because of the extra nodal extension and my huge tumor that the PET would light up and that I had two years at best to live. After the PET...he said maybe I will be cured...the rads Dr. said that she thought I had ten years before it showed up in my bones. Who knows? No one. I have had mammo as well as MRI on remaining breast, all clear. Chose uni-mast, as NED in remaining breast at that time and my risk for developing lymphedema was very high...did not want to have two arms compromised any sooner than I had too. I did develop it...in my right arm and I am right handed. I had a mammo yearly from age 40, All clear,.... diagnosed at 50 with a tumor the size of a grapefruit. Cancer was estimated to be growing at least 10 years and never found. I found the changes....All the Drs. missed it...for 10 years....  I am happy with my decisions. I had to find Drs. I trusted. The Mayo team was the second opinion. For a long time I obsessed over stats and percentages for recurrence etc. It will either come back or it won't. When they do studies that focus all treatments on only my cancer cells I will trust the results to be absolutely pertinent, until then...it is really a toss up. Why does the same treatment keep some NED forever and others not?Why do some with a lower grade of cancer or no nodes, recur and die? Hopefully the time will come when the science exists to test each individual and create the cocktail vaccine that keeps them alive. I will need to deal with it if and when it returns...and I will...what choice do I have? Make decisions. Trust your team or find a new one. Live life. Long may we run...!",

My skin broke down at the end, so it would have been painful to be fitted. I bought mine at the store in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, but the staff at Nordstrom was knowledgeable. I was told that they would file my insurance though, and they did not...I had to. The store I was at had the prosthesis in stock and you can take it with you. If you need an odd size you may need to wait a week. Bring a few shirts with you that are what you normally wear so that you can see what the fake boobs look like under the shirt. I have the pocket bras for the form. I am now  over a year past radiation and am looking at DIEP reconstruction. The prosthesis is okay, but it is heavy, and hot in summer and limits what I can wear. My closest friends said that in most of my clothing, it does not look much different...I feel lopsided though and am hoping to have scar tissue cleaned up to decrease pain and tightness in chest and arm.",

I am having recon with the DIEP in May...do not want to invest too much in garments that will need replaced...some days I do housework and or excercise at the fitness center...not focusing on the arm other than Lymphedema type work, a few days I have done not much to see if I see a difference...nothing consistent so far...I am being fitted for a night garment as well as referral for the flexi-touch. Guess I will see where it goes from here...hopefully things will get better...I used to hate the sleeve and glove...now I prefer it to the Michelin Man arm wraps...! Ha! I keep reminding myself that it could be worse...at least I have the arm!!!!",

The SS office faxed the acceptance form to the insurance company. I don't know if that is a COBRA policy as well as a teamsters policy.",
