I am at the point also where I don't need or want breasts.  I have had huge breasts for so many years, I don't think reconstruction would be the best outcome.  I really do think flat is the way to go at this point. What freedom it would be not to have the heavy weight and drastic disparity.  If reconstruction is difficult with radiated breasts then what is there to do, to have equal looking breasts, or chest?  I would not want to go through multiple surgeries and possible complications at this point. One side effect that I have heard about concerning mastectomies is the tenderness and discomfort of the skin. Even on the painful side. Have you any comments or experience on that?  I too only wear t-shirt tanks, at home and depending on where - out, with very large tops.  Yes that is what I mean, I am forced to hide.  At this point it is too difficult to find a bra that even comes close to fitting.  But I do on special occasions.  Fhanks for the info and good luck.",

You brought me down to reality and remember what the important issues were in deciding my  treatment.   As we all know it is our decision, for they can only recommend.  It's all so mind boggling having 2 RO's say no and 2 yes.   From the beginning I had the mindset that I would fight, as if I had only one chance at defeating this monster. I did all this so that I could say I did everything I could have done, helping ensure that I would stay cancer free. I chose the most aggressive treatments as I believed in giving it my all, one time.  Looking back on it, I think I have lost why I made the decisions that I made.  Especially now experiencing the side affects of the radiation etc. It's easy to concentrate on what's happening now with the side affects, 2nd guessing & questioning the treatment decisions I made 18 years ago.   The most important issue was what am I willing to do to fight this monster? That was the question I asked myself. Yes I was not aware of a lot of the side affects, but I also have been cancer free for 18 years. That was my main goal then and one I need to remind myself today.  I am very grateful. As for the side affects now, and the treatment options available 18 years ago, I would probably make the same decisions. I do know that it's a difficult personal decision, for the reasons and issues that are important to you.  Go with your heart.

Then immediately after radiation I started the 2nd series of 3 treatments for 7 weeks of chemo. After that 5 years of tamoxifen.  Amazingly I think that was the easiest.   Believe it or not, my whole arm pit and back towards my shoulder blade is still numb.  If I have an itch I have to use a wooden back scratchier and just scratch as hard as possible to feel it.  It is very uncomfortable having an itch that can't be satisfied! Just one of the sides I've had for 18 years.    I remember back that they can certainly be insensitive to your concerns. Since most insurances allow for 2nd opinions, maybe you can get a 2nd opinion from a radio-oncologist. Preferably someone your comfortable with Male or female? Mine was a female radio-oncologist who caught the mistake between the surgeon and pathologist.  Kathec I am working on getting my reports from the Dr. and hospital.  I have just gotten the authorizations and hopefully they will still have my records, because they only keep them for so long. I am very curious as to the dose etc. gilbert good luck and let me know how your doing. Barbarella60        ",

      "Content": "Feb 10, 2014 11:25PM - edited Feb 10, 2014 11:28PM by Barbarella60 After having gone through this many years ago, I am struck at how fresh the conflicts are in deciding what treatment to do. My oncologist gave me recommendations, but said it was my decision. But if he felt I was being too independent he was there to steer me into the preferred treatment.  Talk about overkill treatment.  I am in the process of getting my records, but I had Stage 1, ductal in situ.  I had a lumpectomy chemo/radiation/chemo and 5 years tamoxifen.  In 2nd opinion I was told of only 1 other recommendation, Methotrexate verses Adriamycin. Since I was pre-menopausal I chose the stronger Adriamycin with Cytoxin and 5Fu. Since both treatments had Cytoxin and 5Fu, to me it didn't matter which because it is the Cytoxin that puts you into immediate Menopause. This sealed my fate of never having children.  That I think was the biggest loss that I had to deal with. But at that time they really didn't give me a choice of no chemo, as there was the scare factor in the percentages. They strongly recommended it but you had to tell them what you wanted.  Strange now that I think about it.   As far as 18 years after radiation I do feel my self-esteem has been extremely affected by the radiation. After lumpectomy and radiation I was left with 2 completely different breasts. I was always overweight and because of an ankle fusion, weight has been a issue.  I was told by many plastic surgeons to lose weight first before reconstruction. Well better said than done.  Now 18 years later I have one rock hard perky breast and one grandma's breast. A situation that I have endured for many years.  Hopefully I can now insist on a plan to fix a problem that should have been taken care of years ago, when I was going through the treatments. Also at that time I was not that heavy and not knowing the true effects of radiation, I was never offered any reconstruction in the disparity even at that time. But radiation affects sneak up on you. After a time the true mutilating effects become apparent.   I also took 5 years of Tamoxifen.  Most of the women I knew didn't finish the 5 years. Sunny, point is yes I made the best decisions I could back then.  Yes I do feel like a guinea pig that has spent too many years ashamed of her body, that radiation caused. Only now have I been able to come out of hiding and say enough is enough.  Something has to be done for me to be a woman again. I am thankful that I have been cancer free for 18 years.  Maybe it was the aggressive treatment, maybe not.  If I had to do it again I think I would have a double mastectomy and reconstruction, as I was always large busted. NO I would not have the radiation! I would have to think long and hard on the chemo.  As so many side effects that last or show up years later.  Chemo fog acknowledged now but not 18 years ago (can last for years), incontinence, and forced menopause etc. But I do think I would do the Tamoxifen again.  Solsticegirl22 you are in my thoughts and prayers.  I am so sorry for your Drs. apparent disregard for your health.  Sorry does not even come close to what you have gone through.   The Drs. are very removed from the actual treatment and what we are going through with their prescribed treatments. Anyone going through breast cancer today, really has to be their own advocate and almost become their own Dr. by doing research and talking with other survivors. That is very apparent to me as there are so many women diagnosed with breast cancer now, more than ever before. No one wants to be a number after you have decided what treatment to have, which seems to be the case. But as Desalonde and Solen have said only you can make that decision.  Everyone is different. I hope we can all find the peace and fortitude to overcome these debilitating effects, that will be with us for our lives. Gilbert how are you doing?  Thinking of you.            ",

Jenni I also benefit from sharing with women who have the same concerns and experiences that I have. We are definitely warrior women. We just pick ourselves up for a new day. Did you say when you had your radiation treatments, or did I miss it? You are in my thoughts and to get some relief. Annie what are the \"pills\" you are talking about? And new \"trail\" heartspare? You are truly fortunate to have only a few lymph nodes taken as 20 yrs ago they took them all. The fear of lymphodema is still with me all these years.  Luckily . . .   Hi Solsticegirl. My experience with radiation chest pain, just started now 18 years later with a vengeance.  I don't ever remember chest pain, just the red burning, tenderness and extreme tightness after the treatments. The years between were okay except for the numbness underarm, armpit & around the back to the shoulder blade.  Now I have shooting chest pains, that I thought were heart attacks.  I went to a breast cancer surgeon, and she said that it was from the radiation years earlier.  I asked her if the pains should be as intense, & stabbing as I am experiencing. She said yes.  In addition I now have an almost constant dull aching from inside and also behind the breast. I have had the shooting pains for 2 years now.   I have had a coronary angiogram (normal), then on the 24th I am having a pulmonary function test.  My Internist believes there is radiation damage to more than the breast. I constantly have to remind myself it's not heart but radiation damage from somewhere. I am thinking positive for the pulmonary test. I will second \"best of luck to all\" and a sunny day tomorrow.  ",

But the pathologist disputed that, so the extra radiation.  I am numb all these years from the underarm down the inside of the arm, around to the back and shoulder blade on the left side. My left breast is hard with lumps from the radiation, so I guess reconstruction does not have a good outcome. Solsticegirl was there over-radiation for a reason or just because?  When you mean burning etc under the arm is that from mx or node removal?   I also did not like the drain. My sister who was a surgical nurse came to stay with me for the lumpectomy.  I always fainted at the sight of blood, so she took care of the drain!  Ha!  I didn't even look.  Whimp aren't I?  What chemo did you have.  I too don't know which is worse chemo or radiation.  But I did choose the most aggressive treatment but I believe the major side effects would not have been that much different.  Except for the radiation with extra treatments. Solstice I like your mother's philosophy, as I too agree.  Good to know of the plastic surgeons view and thanks for the site.   TB is sounds like you are secure in your treatment decision. Anymore treatments scheduled?  I wish I would have had that mx choice, rather than surgery, chemo, radiation, tamoxfen, as far fewer side effects with what I believe same result.  Thanks for the support.  Have a good day.   ",
