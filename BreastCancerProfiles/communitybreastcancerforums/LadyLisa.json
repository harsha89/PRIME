Then 5 years later I came across a Dr. that wanted to get it out to just be sure. Well that was just a calcified duct and not cancer at all. But the DCIS was in the underlying tissue that was also removed. And now after another back to back surg I have been found to be loaded with ADH. I went in thinking this is going to be ok 3 months ago to telling the radiation Dr. today that I think I may wait and just take the Temox meds for now. I have a problem with using my get out of cancer free card when its is in the ADH stage right now. And poss have it on the other side as well. To many things to think about at one time.",
