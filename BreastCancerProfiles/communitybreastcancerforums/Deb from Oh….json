I guess I won't know that for sure until Weds when I go back to the oncologist. After having a biopsy, a port put in for chemo, and let's see, a muga scan, ct scan, bone scan, pet scan, mri, the next plan of action is to start chemo first..I then undergo a lumpectomy and I assume the thyroid glands affected taken out if that's indeed the case, then radiation, then 5 yrs on a pill that makes my body cease creating hormone which is what is feeding this cancer. Mine was hormone receptive. It's a Stage 2. And I'm not entirely sure that is true as no tests were done to determine if under my arm is cancerous or not. My calcifications were not considered a large area, but one little spot had escaped the cluster........ Now after saying that, please be mindful that you will hear 2 million different things on the net. You came here, to the right place, I too was scared after reading all that stuff....but there are women on here who have been through all of this, well I call them angels. They are very extremely knowledgable and are sooooooo comforting.......so just keep reading posts on here, the more you read, the more  you learn..........And trust in the Lord, keep your faith........ Prayers going out for you that it is indeed B9. Deb",

I just switched onc's a month ago because of one that treated me badly, I just refuse to put up with it, this is my life on the line, not theirs, I'm paying them. My new onc told me that I would be getting scans later on.....(I still have 11 weekly taxols to go)..........but since I'm getting my chemo first, then surgery, I believe he said it would be after the surgery. I would insist on the scans. Just remember, YOU'RE paying them......... Luv, hugs and prayers Deb",

So I go....er doc asks between 1 to 10 what is pain scale. Said a 2, maybe a 3. He asks if I wanted something for pain, told him a couple of advils...he says oh no, I have something better and shoots me full of morphine. He felt my neck, said it was swelled, ordered blood tests to check for clots and had to go back the next day for an ultrasound. They found nothing. He gave me a script for percocet. I had them filled cuz my hubby had an abcessed tooth. He took one, the rest are on top of my fridge, I hate pain pills. So next time I go to see the witch doc, she comes storming in, says I have been to the hospital twice and t hat I am just going to get pain pills, basically calling me a drug addict! I was so humilated. I explaned to her, first time I wasn't in pain, didn't ask for nothing for pain, she says the second time the ER doc had told that my neck wasn't swelled.....I asked her who was going to give someone morphine, order blood work, and an ultrasound if he didn't think there was something wrong? I told her the doc said it was and my hubby who was with me told her it was swelled.And that one of her fellow docs told me to go......told her I had the whole  bottle of percocet on the refridge...she didn't believe me.....so I switched docs........felt like suing her. My daughter even called her to assure her I didn't have a drug problem! She was very rude to my daughter and at the end said well I can't discuss your mothers case with you but I can tell you I feel she has a problem with pain pills.....I just couldn't believe it!  I have taken 20 vicodeine from back in October when I had my port installed and thats it, other  then xanax.....and I still have 4 of those left and they were prescribed in November!  The doc I have now is a really nice person and it's so nice to trust your doc....I love this guy!

I was just diagnosed Oct 23rd,on my daughters 30th birthday....had to call her and say Happy Birthday, I have cancer.......but I swear it feels as if it's been 20  yrs ago.....Guess will know more next time I see my oncologist.....right now I'm just seeing the mid level care people.....think I see him in two weeks........

One more piece though and what I have done is to keep a notebook, in it I have my biopsy report, everything, tests I have done, even bills I've paid, insurance statements, basically everything.

I haven't had any pain in my breast at all and she removed oh, between a quarter and half dollar sized amount. The node removal incision doesn't hurt that badly either........ So take a deep breath!
