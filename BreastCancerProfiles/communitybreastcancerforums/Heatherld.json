      "Content": "Heatherld wrote: Hi, I have been diagnosed with breast cancer in my right Breast with a ultrasound needle biopsy. Then I was given and MRI mammogram to rule out any other areas. They found something in my left breast. So today I had a MRI biopsy on left breast. All went fine and I went to work then it started bleeding horribly. Took quite sometime two rounds of 20 minutes of pressure on the site. Now my breast is swollen three times normal size and has hard knots in it. Dr said they must have hit an artery and it is common. Has anyone else had this happen? If so how long for the swelling and hardness to go away? Thank you Log in to post a reply",
