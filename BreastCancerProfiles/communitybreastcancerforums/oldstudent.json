A friend of mine who is a 10 year survivor with metastatic cancer has traveled to Alaska, Hawaii, Ireland twice. I think she had chemo while on one of the trips to Ireland. I know it is doable, though obviously scary and takes planning. I'm trying to go away with hubby for 25th anniversary and take chemo while we are there (T/H). My health plan has a facility where we're going, so I can do the chemo \"in plan\". The part I'm worrked about is flying and germs and stuff. Any words of wisdom on Taxol and germs?  Debbie",

I didn't trust a gut feeling and went longer than I should have without getting an excisional biopsy (had other tests but all were ambiguous). The good news is, even waiting quite a long time before they discovered cancer, it was still at an early stage and had not entered the lymph nodes. So hang in there, don't be afraid to ask your doctor for something to help you with the anxiety, and you are doing a great job advocating for yourself. Keep it up!  Good luck and hang in there. Deb",

Someone posted the suggestion for Briochi for acid indigestion, and it seemed to help me quite a bit after first A/C. Tums didn't do a darned thing. Got compliments on my wig yesterday, though personally, I like to walk around the house bald becuase it is cooler. Since it freaks out my kids, I wear a scarf when they are around. Yeah, I've got a farty, stinky dog. They come in real handy! I get much more exercise since having a dog because I feel guilty if I don't walk him a lot. But he's getting older and walks too SLOWLY! Paulding, the ginger candies, and just about anything ginger, are great for gummy tummy moments. I can't go NEAR fiber right now. It has to be BLAND. Had a great last week before next chemo. Planning a good weekend, then A/C # 2 on Monday. Have a great weekend. Love, Deb",

My 20 year old son, also very supportive, was very freaked out by the whole situation at first. Then one night he told me he had a big argument with one of his best friends, which was very uncharacteristic of him. His friend asked him what was going on and that was the beginning of my son building HIMSELF a support group.

Port worked like a charm. Chemo was boring but not painful or miserable. No nausea, but some indigestion (will check out the suggestions here if I can remember the name of the over the counter thing mentioned.) Has anyone tried Gaviscon for indigention? It is 2:21 a.m. Was enjoying the cool summer night sleeping with windows open but some skunks decided to frolic in the back yard and woke me up. EEWWW. So now I'm drinking water, took a tums and put on the airconditioner to clear the skunk smell. Looking forward to talking with y'all as we pass through this trial together. Oh--maybe the indigestion was the Indian vegetarian buffet I enjoyed after chemo? Or the delicious dinner my friend brought over that I ate way too much of? Or the really long walk my dog took me on this afternoon (gotta love those pooches for getting you to exercise!) I wore a \"F*** Cancer\" T Shirt to chemo today, receiving great reviews. Maybe will wear it again but change before I go home so I don't shock the neighborhood kids when I get home. I felt like a junior high kid wearing offensive clothes in front of the Vice Principal! Lots of funny thoughts have wantered through my head in the process. On the mediport: I know how Captain Picard must have felt when assimilated by the Borg! (OK, I'm a total NERD) On the lumpectomy: Couldn't the scar be more like a smiley face instead of a crooked scowley face? On future mastectomy: I'm going to get a decent boob job so I won't be so pear shaped. T/H cocktail in Hawaii in November? Stay tuned, it's my 25th anniversary and damn it, I can feel sick in paradise just as easily as at  home. Just worried about germs on the airplane. . . It sure takes my mind off politics and the recession! Wow, have I got great friends and family. When all this chemo and surgery is over, I'm going to throw a rediculous PARTY. I can't spell at 2:30 a.m. G'night!",

So, after that whole lecture to her, here I am anticipating an unwanted Brazilian wax. Oh, well! Now she can laugh at me! Deb",

Re: going to services, wig or hat, I'm going to synagogue tomorrow for the first time since starting chemo and I'm not sure whether to do the wig or scarf. Probably the wig. Some people can be pretty patronizing about the whole situation, as in \"you are so brave. . .\" Up their nose with a rubber hose! Like we have a choice or something. My rabbi and his wife are both cancer survivors, so they really understand and are very supportive.
