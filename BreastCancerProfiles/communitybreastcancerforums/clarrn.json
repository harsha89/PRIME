It is a hard decision and no one knows how chemo will affect them until they are in the middle of it. It was ridiculously harder than I expected and has given me life long side effects, but some people fly through chemo. I wouldn't have done chemo if I did not have 2 cms of tumor in my lymph node. For a 4% difference I would not, but that is only my opinion based on my (rather terrible) experience. I second the fertility issue. They told me I had about an 85% chance of maintaining my fertility but I wasn't part of the lucky 85% I guess. Good luck with your choice. I think it is smart to get a second opinion.",

Could it be?  Is there really life after AC?   Two people in Calgary rang their done chemo bells today, and one did a video and dance.  It was encouraging to see, but I have a question.  What about those in the chairs that day that won't ever get to ring the bell?  I am thinking about ringing it at the end of all this, but I would hate to hurt anyone that doesn't get to ever stop chemo.  And I could always celebrate away from the centre too.  Any thoughts?  ",

Poor girl is at grandmas but asked if she could come with me bc she is sick too! She loves the hospital.  SUV shoppers - so far we have test driven the the Chevy trailblazer, nissan murano, mitsubishi outlander, hyundai sante fe, jeep liberty, mazda 7, and ford Escape.   All used, some loaded.  So far the Santa Fe is my favorite, nice ride, decent mileage for the size of engine.  Some of the 4 cylinder ones were nice but couldn't tow a small camper trailer which is what we want.    And looks like hubby is going to buy me a boler!!!  I love those cute fiberglass eggs!  Pin it if you don't know what I mean.  I am vintage camper obsessed.  A 4 cyl would pull that but I think we will get the santa fe anyway. Oh and while we test driving on an unfamiliar road we got pulled over going 87 in a 60 zone!!!  Yikes, we had just come off a 90 road and didn't see the sign.   I whipped off my wig before he got to the car and he just wished me luck.  Not sure if it was the fact that it was a test drive or my obvious chemo head but glad not to get a ticket.   Lol.  Oh the chemo perks.  ",

I hadn't even felt any symptoms, so Echocardiogram was after my chemo yesterday.  Will have results by Friday when they ultrasound the DVT site to see if I need another 3 months of Tinzaparin injections....boo hoping not to have to do that anymore.  And they are checking out the non dvt arm also because they don't want to compress that arm in case of another clot.  So after that is ruled out I have to go straight to the store to get a sleeve and gaunlet :(   Lymphedema specialist also broke the news that I can not do ICU nursing with a sleeve/gaunlet due to infection control.   I had a good cry about the loss of a big part of my identity.  Will be forced away from the bedside, and not ready for that :(  I will miss my patients and their families.  I am still hoping that maybe I could wear compression at night instead but with all the heavy lifting required the specilist said no.  Grr.  And who knows what the LE will do after rads. Ack!  But on the bright side I have been thinking a lot a out becoming a nurse navigator if a position opens up, maybe this is the push to do it once I get the ok to work again.  Then MO reminds me that tamoxifen is now off the table due to DVT.  Boo.. wants me to either do ooph removal or suppression and an AI.  But I still was holding out hope for more babies.  Double boo and double the tears.  Then the nurse practitioner who is a good 300lbs gives me a 10 minute lecture on the 11 pounds I have gained since surgery and chemo, talking about reccurence, survival rates and it's like I am in the cartoon peanuts....blah blah blah.  I am walking my 2 km a day and just can't handle anymore after my day with a 3 year old.  At least my MO walked in right then and said no working out or anything strenuous until they get my heart rate figured out.  Thanks MO... I love you♥♥♥  But I do only have 5 Taxols left, and am doing ok by only thinking about that :)  Totally think my down time will hit hard after I get through chemo as well. Congrats to everyone finished or finishing chemo!!!! So excited for august 27th for my last one!!  I agree with the fast/slow time thing with this journey. Football- so excited you are feeling better, and I too am having the bloody nose but only when I blow it. Cold- congrats on your new ride!  Way to go hubby! Jaimieh and holly- fuzzy white hair starting to grow too, I am getting some fuzzy face too, ack!  Will wax that! Good luck to sunshine and holly and all those heading in to surgery! ",
