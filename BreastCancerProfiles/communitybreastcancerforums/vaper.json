The fitter says I am just not use to these things and need to gradually build up time of wearing them. The second day the sleeve went on a lot easier and has wrinkle by inside of elbow. After washing and drying it is very hard to get on again. So does it have to be that tight because it loosens so much Is one wrinkle by elbow inside normal? Is hand swelling from the wrist being so tight? Has anyone had thumb go numb and stretched thumb out by wetting and putting over top of a water bottle or something? Is gauntlet suppose to lay flat across inside of hand? At top of arm where sleeve ends how tight is right? Do you have the spots from the band that holds it up on arm for a long time after taking off?  Thank you!

I put the ace bandage back on. I have worn it all day, but the swelling has not gone down, maybe up more. :( I have a appointment with the oncologist tomorrow. I will see what she thinks. tangandchri, I know dear, the drain is so aggravating! after 2 months I finely got mine out, but I still worry that I might get or have a seroma down in there that is going to cause some horrible complication. I was not given a compression garment or even a ace bandage at the hospital. Many people have told me they were sent home from the hospital with them. After my drainage was still high a month later a nurse wrapped me in a Ace bandage. I was given a prescription before surgery for 2 camisoles with pockets for the drain bulb, they do not compress, or support anything in any way at all! Insurance (Medicare) paid 80% for them. I only wore them a couple times. They were to hot and uncomfortable, they rubbed under my arm where my incision from lymph nodes were removed. I ended up just pinning the tab of the bulb to my night gown or shirt. You might want to see if your insurance covers the camisoles, if you do not get hot easily. (If I was able to drive and you needed big ones, I would send you mine! I got 2 different brands and sizes. They run big.) My swelling under my arm, even behind it was a lot! I still have a lot of extra fat, skin, etc. there. The nurse says it is just my body, but my other (non surgery) side does not have all that extra! I know what you mean about looking SO disfigured! I was so worried about possible infections and other things it did not really set in until recently! sandra4611, I agree! I got my drain out finely 2 weeks ago.

He only works in the center a couple days a month! PA is physician assistant. Yes it is very frustrating having complications!  Thank you!",

I was not warned about all the crazy things! (I had a very small slow growing tumor!) No telling what it would take to get them to scan it, if they ever would! They keep saying if there is infection the drainage will get dark red, and smell really bad.  Did yours get dark or smell bad? And they insist I would have a fever more than the one day that I had one. Now even after the drain tube comes out I will be worried there is one to deep to tell! I just some research and see that some studies say compression bandages actually increase chance of seroma! Praying! Yes, PTSD, I am sure some get!",

She thinks it is not infected because it did not respond to antibiotic or yeast ointments. They think it is the tube rubbing on skin causing the rash. I go back to see them Monday. I had a allergic reaction to the oral antibiotic, they did not start me on another one. They do not think there is infection in my surgery site. I wish there was a way of knowing for sure! My drainage still goes up and down, went from yellow for weeks back to orange for a week meaning blood in there again. Then yesterday is was yellow, but back to orange today! They say that is ok. The nurses said I might still have drainage because I might have a seroma, (a pocket of fluid) that could get infected and turn into a big problem, so they wrapped my chest in ace bandages. They are not comfortable of course, but I have been able to keep them on so far. They want them to only come off for cleaning. Of course if I take them off I would not be able to get back on, and my nurse friend is busy with all kinds of other activities, and the nurses said that home health care would not come for this or anything! They keep telling me to not do any thing active. I keep telling them I live alone and have to! The NP says Monday she will make sure my surgeon sees me. I know he will not be happy, praying for wisdom for all of us! Thank you everyone for your help!",

It seems like t he bulb is just about worn out, not staying flat long at all. So who knows!
