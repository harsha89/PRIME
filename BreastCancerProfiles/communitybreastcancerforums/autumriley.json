I have three children who got a call from their father one day to tell them he was dying of cancer. He too kept it to himself which did not help them . It made it more difficult.We try to protect our children from reality but it only makes it more difficult. Not only does your son need someone he can talk to but you need to avail yourself of a goodÂ  counselor you can open up to. I have breast cancer and will undergo a Mas on March 11, 2010. It was very difficult for me to tell my children who are now 32. 31, 27 since it was only 6yrs ago they lost their father and 5yrs ago when they lost their grandmother to cancer. Pray to the Lord and He will give you the strength to tell your son. My prayers are there for you and your son",
