That first full shower will feel so good, trust me!!! I'm glad they are doing the lidocaine for you. I had a little rush of pain when they removed my SAVI device--but they hadn't told me what to expect (I think on purpose) and I was not numbed so it was a surprise, but over very quickly, and no lasting pain. Remember, too, my device had been in 10 days instead of your 5 so was probably a little more embedded! Yes, they do not stitch wound closed and it must close by itself. I'm a slow healer and mine took a few weeks to fully close but only minimal drainage so a gauze pad in my bra did the trick to contain the liquid. After 2 years I still have a slight scar but I didn't try any scar removal cream either after wound healded so maybe it could be less noticeable if I had tried. Just make sure you keep the wound clean until it closes to avoid any chance of infection. I had been on antibiotics while having the device in as a preventative measure and had prescribed antibiotic ointment on gauze pad after. Not sure everyone is put on antibiotics. Earlier today I had promised you links to other SAVI/brachytherapy threads and after re-reading through some of them, some of the info seems too old or too negative so I'll just add links to the most recent two. As you read you will see some people did not have as good as an experience as you have had, but overall, I think most people were glad they chose this form of rads. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/70/topics/783640 https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/70/topics/842473 Keep up your daily reports of treatment and tomorrow's removal--I'm sure others will benefit. Even after 2 years, I still try to pop in to any new threads or questions newbies have able brachytherapy to answer questions and encourage. BC stinks, but having information helps! Thanks.  Edited to get 2nd link to work!",

It's understandable to be tired, not from the rads necessarily, but from the stress of everything you've gone thru in the past couple of months. Not sure about the nausea. The discoloration might be a little burning from the rads (I had a small discolored spot that went away within a couple of weeks) and the hardness/thickening might be your body recovering from the wound. My doctor left the wound opened and said it needed to heal from the inside out, so a loosened steri-strip might not be a problem. This is all speculation so do check with your doctors if it continues. Do you have a followup app't scheduled with any of your doctors? You could also call the office to ask the nurses your questions and express your concerns. I had gone to a comprehensive breast center so I was able to ask any questions of a nurse navigator who explored the answers to my questions. Be good to yourself, eat healthy, and get some sunshine tomorrow and enjoy the 4th. Hope you feel well enough to return to work--perhaps you can make it a short day back.

I chose SAVI brachytherapy because of much less time needed--10 sessions over 5 days instead of 6 weeks, less chance of burning, and partly because of the another health problem I had. The downside is that the device is inserted in another area so you will have another wound although it heals well, you have a device in you for about 10 days due to placement, testing, and removal. You cannot shower when the device is implanted, although if you read the other SAVI or brachytherapy threads you will find ways around that.

I hope the RO helps you tomorrow. I, too, have an adhesive allergy and just don't use adhesive bandages. I used a breast binder to hold dressings in place during rads and while it healed over. Maybe the RO can help you with the blistering too. I had some darker skin over the LX area that had received rads but never any redness or swelling. Something else to ask the RO tomorrow. I was never told to message the breast but maybe that's something new. Also, my wound was open for about a month, but after 2 1/2 years is just a faint scar. Wishing you the best as the healing continues. Let us know what the RO helps you with tomorrow.",

Glad to hear you don't have to have the device in over a weekend! You'll get to enjoy a full shower sooner than us old-timers too!! I found it never really hurt while the device was in but I did feel a little pressure. I'm sure removal will be easier for you too since it will only be in for 5 days instead of 10. Such advancement in the two years since I had SAVI device. I don't remember a \"key\" but do remember the little plugs they take out and put back in after treatment. A couple fell out when I changed bandages over the weekend and I almost freaked out!! I was fascinated during the treatment to hear the little clicks in the tubes and started counting them as a way to keep myself occupied during the short time of treatment. All the best for the rest of treatment!",

Personally, I had SAVI radiation almost 2 1/2 years ago and have never looked back on my decision. There are different types of brachytherapy as you will find when you read the boards. Although I can't cite a specific reference off the top of my head, there are studies to show either brachytherapy or full breast radiation have the same long term results. Brachytherapy has the advantage of short 5-7 days vs. 5-6 weeks of radiation, and less risk of organ involvement. There is the short-term discomfort and inconvenience of having the catheter in, but less chance of burning. I was given antibiotics to take while the multicatheter was in (in my case 9 days because of a weekend) and surprisingly, the seroma I had after the sentinel node biopsy and lumpectomy started to heal once I started radiation. Perhaps if you are working with a comprehensive breast center, they may have a nurse navigator or someone who has gone thru brachytherapy for you to ask questions of. Otherwise, feel free to post questions here or send me a private message thru BCO. All the best to you as you make a hard choice. Let us know how you are doing. ",

If you've read this thread and some of the other threads that have included specifically SAVI or in general brachytherapy, you can see that everyone has had different experiences. I did not find it painful but uncomfortable when the device was in, but did find it easier to wear a cozy breast binder to hold the device and my breasts in place during the time the device was in. I got mine through my breast center but you can order from many places online including the manufacturer https://www.eabmedical.com/product/breast-binder/ or Amazon. I wore it under a jacket to the rad treatments and therefore only had to unzip the jacket and undo the Velcro on the binder in the treatment room and not have to undress and wear one of the center's wraps.

You kind of had the reverse of my experience. I had a leaking seroma at the SNB site before brachytherapy and it improved during radiation. I had about 3-4 weeks of moderate to lesser leaking after the initial breakthrough and mainly stopped by the time I ended rads. It did heal well and now I have only a slight scar. Hope your energy level is improving too and work is tolerable! Best wishes for continuing improvement.",

Like ladyb already stated, please stay away from Dr. Google. You'll find lots of information and experiences here. What you may want to do now is start a list of questions for your first appointment with the surgeon. I hope you are getting help at a breast center. They most often have a nurse navigator who can be your direct contact person. answer lady, and who can even tell you what questions to ask the surgeon. With what you told us, you should be given an option of lumpectomy or mastectomy and there are several threads on this site discussing both options. You will also want to check into genetic testing before surgery. A second opinion is often helpful, especially if you don't feel good about the first surgeon you meet. Yes, it seems overwhelming, but meeting with the surgeon and putting plans in place will make a positive difference. I choose a lumpectomy w/ radiation (brachytherapy type) and have been happy with my choice. Your choices may differ depending on your specifics. I choose not to tell very many people either before or even after treatment--I just didn't want to hear about someone's aunt's experience or awful stories about treatments or have to tell people answers to questions I, myself, did not yet have.

My device was put in about 25-30 days after LX. I didn't have much swelling, but had a seroma from the SNB and my radiologist thought it was okay to go ahead. The seroma actually got better with the rads! Go figure! Not the norm, I guess. I, too, had the device in for 10 days. From my experience, please ask your nurse how to care for the open wound before you experience that first weekend after insertion and before rads start. If your experience is like mine, the nurse did the cleaning and dressing of the device area on the simulation day, but then you have the weekend on your own. Also, I was on antibiotics preventively from the day of insertion for 10 days until the device was removed. I did not get any infection and the wound healed naturally from the inside out (although I am a slow healer so it took a few weeks to totally close--not typical healing time of others). Again, if your experience is like mine, you will not be able to take a full shower during the time the device is in. Prepare by buying some bath wipes (meant for bedbound or baby wipes) or having access to a handheld shower (I used on lower half while carefully not getting upper, still covered, half wet). I was able to wash my hair in sink, but others have said they had their hair washed at a salon. I did not limit most of my activities during rads. I drove myself roundtrip 1 1/2 hours, walked, shopped (limited how much I lifted), and went out as much as normally. I might have slept a little more, but other than avoiding direct hugs, and little kids on my lap, I did okay. All the best and let us know how you're doing.

I don't remember having any itchiness. I did experience some of those nerve jolts and for a few months felt like I often had a vibrating feeling in the treated breast. That took a few months to disappear, although on rare occasion, I might still have a minor nerve pain or two. I'm a slow healer and my device wound, which they had not stitched, took a few weeks to finally close over. I still, after over 2 1/2 years, have a reddish spot where the scar from device placement was. My surgeon in a follow up appointment last fall suggested I have a fat transfer to level out the very minor hollow where the LX was, but I'm choosing not to bother with another procedure. That breast was always a little bigger so now they both fill out the bra the same!! One good thing to come from surgery! I had much more problems with the SNB incision which had developed a seroma. That SNB scar is still quite noticeable. Blessings as you recover from the stress treatment creates. Best wishes as you heal!!! Let us know how you're doing and ask away if you have questions! I'm sure your positive reports will encourage others. Pass it on!!",

You're not going to be running marathons; just take it easy and be good to yourself as far as diet, sleep, walking, and relaxation go and you should do well. Let you husband pamper you! You won't be able to take a shower while the device is in so plan ahead for sponge baths and have someone lined up to wash your hair. That first shower after the device is removed is wonderful! Make sure you have the nurses show you how to change the wound coverage over the weekend while the device is in, and ask all the questions you need to with your care team or here on the thread.

During the insertion, you will be numbed and you will be aware of the device while it's in, but I did not find it overly painful. I was on an antibiotic while the device was in place to prevent infection. The nurses will dress the wound after each treatment, but be sure to ask them about what to do over the long holiday weekend. You will not be able to shower so be sure to take along some large wet wipes and arrange for someone to help with your hair--especially since you're going to be in a hotel (maybe your sweet DH would like to help you!). Otherwise, try to take along or arrange for your hotel room to have a handheld shower--maybe a handicapped accessible room? Pain and fatigue vary by the person. I personally had little fatigue and minimal pain--more just uncomfortable. I wore a breast binder and a fleece jacket (it was winter) and no one I didn't tell knew anything was up with me throughout the treatment. Perhaps think about going home during the long holiday weekend. You will appreciate the comforts of home. I live 45 minutes from my treatment center and choose to drive myself in each day instead of staying nearby my treatment center, but did have 6 hours between daily treatments. I did everything I normally did and between the twice daily treatments went to bookstores, had lunch with friends, took a walk, and light activities. Yes, beware of kids and dogs jumping up but other than that, life went on pretty normally for me. I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy your special anniversary dinner! The advantage of SAVI is less chance of rad burns and the shorter time. You will be glad to have it over with by the end of May instead of thinking it would be six weeks or July if you went the other route. Let us know how you're doing and please ask as you have more questions. Take care. Ceanna",

I can only speak from my experience--I had SAVI over 3 years ago and have never regretted my choice. Personally, I found the lumpectomy and the sentinel node biopsy sites the most painful part of the process. Doing the SAVI rads was uncomfortable, but not really painful. When they implant the device, the area is numbed. You are wrapped which holds the device in place, and while uncomfortable with little twinges, I can't say it was painful, more of a pressure feeling. With SAVI, I did not have skin burning which can happen with traditional radiation--just slight discoloration over the site, but no pain. Perhaps you can ask your radiologist or surgeon about pain management, should you need it, but do make sure you take an antibiotic while the device is in to prevent possible infection. Likely, if you have the device put in on Wednesday, you may have at least one staging day when they set everything up and then start treatment--I understand the timelines have changed a bit since I had mine done. You probably would not have treatment over the weekend, and after 5 treatment days, the device is removed on the last day. Your schedule will depend on the treatment center schedule but I've never heard of anyone having the device in over 10 days and one person had in only for 6 days. Mine was in for parts of 9 days--Wednesday to the next week Friday. As to working, unless restricted by surgeon, I don't see why you couldn't try some hours. The twice a days are usually scheduled about 6 hours apart and if you're close enough to your work site, why not give it a try depending on what work you do. You wouldn't be able to life heavy things, but if you have a desk type job, and your employer willing, you could try some hours and see how you feel. Some employers may have procedures in place about working if you are having medical treatment, but you would have to check with your HR people. You might need a little more rest than normal, but, again, in my case, I was not noticeably more tired. I did not work during the days of treatment, but did everything else except lift, and watched out for kids and dogs who want to be picked up, jump up, or big hugs!!! Little side hugs are good, though!!! This is a difficult choice and I don't know why your radiologist was more negative the second time you met. Perhaps just question him again and have him account for his recent concerns. He owes you an explanation. Maybe your surgeon will provide more insight also. We're here for you if you have more questions, and I'm sure others will check in with you here before you have to make your decision. All the best. Ceanna",

I'm a DD cup and gravity was also an issue, but I found that wearing the breast binder 24/7 helped me. It kept everything in place--breast and the device. Nothing moved when I moved! My breast center gave me one and I bought another to be able to wash one, wear one. I was able to wear it under a fleece jacket instead of trying a bra and even wore it for a couple more weeks after the rads were finished to decrease movement until healed. This is the type I used http://www.eabmedical.com/product/breast-binder/ It was soft and cozy and has Velcro front closings and covers all around including the armpits! There is no pain from the radiation itself. They will connect the tubes in the device--the parts that hang out of the device, to the delivery tubes and I could feel a little pressure from the added weight of those, but no pain. Just be sure to ask the nurses to make you comfortable BEFORE the treatment starts since you must not move during. I asked for extra pillows and pads to position my arms and kept my fleece jacket on (although unzipped) since the room was cool. Once you are connected, everyone else will leave the room during the radiation. My center had a picture on the ceiling so it gives you something to look at during the short time of the procedure. Otherwise, just think good thoughts and ignore the noises. There will be little clicks and some noise, but over in several minutes. The Savi device I had had 7 tubes and I just counted down as I heard each tube click and empty. I was kind of fascinated by the process! My device was also placed facing my armpit. I had had a seroma (large, fluid filled) over the location of the sentinel node biopsy when the device was inserted, but the radiation actually helped the seroma heal!! Sorry, but you will probably have to look! You will need to clean the wound with the device in over the weekend unless you have someone's help. Make sure they show you what to do. I first panicked then laughed after I called the nurse and she wasn't worried at all when a couple of the purple plugs fell out while I was cleaning the area and changing bandages. Another reason I wore the binder all the time! I chose not to take tamoxifen due to other health issues, so you might want to start reading in the tamoxifen or AI threads. Lots of mixed stories there. See what your doctor recommends. Best wishes on the simulation and the beginning of treatment. Keep us updated.",

You don't say whether or not the open wound is infected or just open but perhaps with the antibiotics you mean it is infected. Being on long term antibiotics will often lead to a yeast infection. I always eat plain yogurt when I'm on antibiotics and it's never too late to start yogurt (get no sugar, unsweetened type with active probiotics). My wound took about a month to fully close (and longer to heal) although it was not infected (I had been on antibiotics while the device was in). I feel part of my problem was the large size of my breasts. I learned the difficult way that I needed to wear a cozy breast binder most of the time while it was healing to hold everything in place as much as I could. I still have a slight scar but having scars a long time is normal for me. I suppose a lot has to do with where the wound is and if I moved too much. My wound was almost half way down the right breast on the arm side and with moving my arm, I could feel if I moved too much. Despite that problem, I was very glad I did SAVI. I did up my intake of Vit. D (5000 IU) and Vit, C (5000 mg) daily when I was not healing and it seemed to help within days. You might want to have your doctor check your Vit. D level. Please feel free to ask any other questions. All the best for the healing process!",

Yes, the breast fills \"full\" but probably won't get any more painful during the next 10 days. I remember having to wear gauze pad to catch the fluid, but don't remember it being a lot. Sitting up in a chair to sleep is news to me--I had no restrictions and just didn't sleep on that side in bed--perhaps it has something to do with device placement. Mine went from the right side of right breast to the cavity at the 2:00 position on the left. I just slept on my left side. I hope they gave you an antibiotic for the next 10 days, if not ask for one tomorrow. The simulation should go smoothly and I don't remember it took overly long. Also, be sure to ask the nurse how to keep the wound clean over the long weekend coming up. They will probably dress it for you tomorrow and again each day next week, but you'll need to do it over the first weekend. I was not informed and had a problem when some of the little blue wires fell out (which turned out not to be a problem). Just think, by next Friday the rads will be over and the device removed!!! Best wishes and post or PM if you have questions.",

I wish I had some great thoughts to share with you, but I'm sad right along with you. Are you able to talk with the surgeon again when you've had a chance to regroup from today and see if there are additional options? Since the device was in for such a short time, perhaps you'll heal faster and can repeat sooner. Perhaps you can look at it this way--With early July insertion and 5 treatment days, you'll still be done sooner than if you did 6 weeks of traditional rads--and now you know the pain can be managed!! Please share when you can how you're doing and what next steps you take. Treatment is a process and this one is taking longer than desired! Hang in there!

It's uncomfortable, but doable, and the week will go quickly with the twice-a-days keeping you occupied! Patsy summed it up well, use some large wipes and, if you can, get hair washed in a shop. Bending over to wash it yourself can be painful and not great for the placement of the device, depending on the direction the device is in your breast. Take it easy, but do try to walk and do whatever you feel up to. I did most everything I normally did but lifting, cleaning (vacuuming), showering, or exercising (good reason not to do cleaning!). I drove, took walks, had lunch between treatments with friends, attended meetings, and relaxed. I had the advantage of having rads in the winter, so I wore a breast wrap under a fleece jacket and most people were unaware of my treatment. I just had to watch for jumping children and dogs, and not bumping into people. Gentle hugs, Ceanna PS - Here's the type of breast binder my center provided and I ordered a second one so I could wear 24/7 and wash the other. It had Velcro opening and pretty snug to hold everything in place. During the scan and treatment, I could just undo the Velcro and didn't have to even take off my jacket. Maybe doesn't apply in summer, but those treatment rooms are always so cold!!!  ",

I experienced discomfort but little pain unless I bumped something (if you have kids or grandkids, watch out for hugs!!). Everyone's pain tolerance is different, but make sure you check with the RO before you take pain meds on your own. I wore a tight breast binder 24/7 for the whole 9 days the device was in and felt that really helped. I was placed on antibiotics and did not develop any issues. The worst part was not being able to shower (you cannot get the open wound wet) but I had bought the big wipes for bedridden patients and used those, and with extreme care used a hand-held shower on my lower half a couple of times. A friend helped me wash my hair in the sink, but I've heard of others who went to a salon for hair care. Self care is the most difficult over the weekend, but make sure the nurses show you what to do. They will take care of redressing the wound the twice a day you have treatment. I drove myself the 90 minute roundtrip and just had lunch and read at the site during the time between the twice daily rads. Most people would never have known since my treatment was also in winter and I was bundled up anyway. I wore the binder under a fleece jacket and was allowed to leave the unzipped jacket on during the CTs and during treatment since the room was chilly. Ask lots of questions of the nurses. They were very helpful to me. Best wishes.",

I think I remember having 2 days between device placement and the beginning of rads while they do the calculations. Yes, uncomfortable and you'll be glad to get it out after treatment, but I did not have worsening pain when the device was in. Just be sure to follow all the nurses suggestions for cleaning the area over the weekend and watch that you don't bump into something! Again, I wore a breast binder (I had two so I could always have clean one) and wore it to keep the breast and device from moving. Sorry you have an additional day because of Christmas, but glad you'll be free of it by New Year's! Yes, saves week's worth of rads! I felt the inconvenience of not showering and the discomfort, and lack of burns, was worth it. I did not let the device slow me down and did most everything while it was in--following doctor's orders of course! In between the twice a day CTs and rads, I went out to lunch, read, and even went to meetings and shopping. It's probably about 6 hours between each twice daily rads so unless you live or work close to the hospital, you can do what you feel up to in between. It's only five days of rads and before you know it, you'll be done!! Personally I am doing very well 2 years out. After the device was removed, it took a few weeks for the wound to close--they don't stitch it shut--but a little gauze in my bra protected it and I could shower without worry. I did have to take antibiotics while the device was in--I don't know if that's standard treatment--did they prescribe for you? I have a tiny red scar where the device was placed and other than some little stabs of pain as it was healing and the oddest of vibration feeling for a brief period in the wound while healing, I did well. Let us know how you're doing and if you have any questions. All the best!!",

I felt fine during treatment and went to a bookstore, read in a sunny room at the hospital, or had lunch with friends during those five days. It probably helped that at the time of treatment, it was cold weather and I could keep a coat on and didn't have to concern myself with clothing fit over the device. I just wore a fleece jacket over a breast binder and could just unzip the jacket for each treatment without having to change clothes. My breast center also had a waiting room with a large puzzle going so a few of us got to know each other over puzzle making! I, too, had nerve pain from healing.

I was on antibiotics while the device was in. I did have a long time of healing, but I'm a slow healer. If you have the same process, they do not stitch the wound shut but allow it to heal from the inside out. I had some drainage for a week or so and the wound itself closed up after a month. Over 3 years later it is only a faint pink spot. Please check with the nurses tomorrow about your self-care over the long weekend. Make sure they provide you enough dressings and gloves! They are so good at packing your wound, but you will do well on your own and be able to handle the dressing changes. I didn't get overly tired and let myself take it easy. I hope you both have a good weekend and take it easy while enjoying a different paced holiday weekend. All the best, Ceanna",

Maybe recommendations changed since I had SAVI 3 years ago, but I could shower the next day after removal. Perhaps it has something to do with where the device incision is. If it is so positioned as to allow water to enter and pool, maybe they need to be more cautious about showering right away. I did not have steri-strips and was told it had to heal from the inside out--but again, recommendations may have changed over the years. My SAVI incision took awhile to heal and I had a little oozing for a couple of weeks--had to continue with packing during that time, but the wound has healed nicely and I only have a faint scar. I used a hand-held shower which allowed me to direct the water away from the wound--especially helpful for the lower body half!! If you don't have one installed, there are temporary ones that you slide over the water spout you can buy fairly cheaply. Were you on an preventative antibiotic while the device was in?

I had a seroma in my sentinel node biopsy incision but they went ahead with the SAVI, and strangely, the seroma improved with radiation! They will numb you before insertion and you may experience pressure as its placed. Most of us did not have pain, as such, while the device is in, but you may feel uncomfortable and have to be careful about what you do and how you do it. You will probably be on an antibiotic while the device is in also. No showers, so make plans for hair wash and refreshing cleansing wipes. Fortunately, it's only 10 days, and with twice-a-days, you'll be surprised how fast those days go!!! Let us know if you're a candidate and please ask any questions you have.

I remember that stage of having pain, some drainage, and pressure from the SN biopsy and the device placement, but truly, it does get better!!! I looked at it that within 5 treatment days, I was done with radiation with minimal side effects and no radiation burns. I didn't have to spend another 5-6 weeks in radiation and by the time I would have been done with regular radiation, I was already well on my way to my new \"normal.\" Best wishes, all.

I kind of like having many people's stories all on one thread--I am one of the long timers here and it's not always easy to catch if someone starts a new thread on a topic I'm interested in, but if someone new posts on an existing thread, it lands in my \"Favorite Topics\" list. lovemyyorkies, how great that your genetic tests came back negative! Let me ask everyone here--those new and long timers on this thread. I have wondered if I should start a generic SAVI thread--meaning I would compile medical info and people's tips about SAVI treatment in one place and then people can ask questions and respond on that thread so as not to have to search to find the basics which over the years have become scattered. Would you picture that being helpful? Maybe others here have other ideas. ",

Everyone is different as far as how they feel, and their experience with SAVI. I was uncomfortable, but able to do most everything except lift anything heavy--let your DH handle the luggage!! One of the hardest things is not taking a shower, so with you staying in a hotel, you might want to consider checking if they have a handheld shower, any nearby hair salons for getting your hair washed, and also, possibly, figuring out the most comfortable position to sleep. You might want to get some bigger wet wipes for body washing if you can't figure out a way to keep the wound area totally dry at all times. I was able to lay down, but I've heard of some who use a bed pillow to prop themselves more upright. If your breast center has a nurse navigator, you can also check with them about suggestions for dealing with being in a hotel. Preparing meals ahead is a great idea, and also ensures you have something you like if you don't feel well enough to go out to eat. I felt pretty good and was able to drive, and didn't have any problems eating out, or preparing my own food, but since you're not home, it's great you're planning ahead. Just eat healthy, and no junk food, even when that might seem like the easiest. If you're like me, they'll put you on an antibiotic while you have the device in, to prevent infection. Keep that in mind if you have a problem with antibiotics, but I always find having plain yogurt, non-sugary, helpful for the digestive system. Take along a good book, or three, or your favorite hobby/craft, or a puzzle, but don't think you have to stay indoors or just sit. If possible, walk, sit in a park, and enjoy sunshine if you have good weather where you're staying. While not a vacation, it is good to treat yourself to a time to relax. I can't say I felt more fatigue, but I made sure I got enough sleep, which may be harder in a hotel! Throw in a movie, a pedicure, and other non-strenuous activities, and it will help take your mind off the rads. If you're like me, you will have twice-a-day treatment with hours in-between to do something special. Just keep some hand sanitizer handy--you do not want to get sick in the middle of treatment!! You might want to consider taking along a little pillow to pad yourself from the car seatbelt if you take a drive, or for on your long drive home. The rads, themselves, go fast--it's the CT scan before and setup that take a little time. Do ask the nurses to make sure you're in a comfortable position. I asked for extra pillows for my arms so they would not go numb in the positions they wanted me in even when that only lasted a few minutes. Since it sounds like you will have an extra day over the Memorial Day weekend with the device in, it's important you talk with the nurses who will pack your wound after the device is implanted, and ask them very specifically how to care for the wound over the long holiday weekend. You will need to clean the wound and redress it daily over the weekend--they will do that on the days you have treatment. Have a backup plan with hubby if dealing with a wound bothers you. I had a little incident when one of the plastic tube caps came off over my weekend, and I hadn't asked about that (learned it was not a problem, but it worried me a little until I knew!). I check these BCO threads most days, so ask away here, or in a private message, if you have more questions as you go, but your best bet is to have the Breast Center phone numbers for specific holiday weekend questions!! Not always easy to get medical personnel on a holiday!! All the best as you have the implant and get started. Before you know it, you'll be done!! Please keep us posted and I'd be glad to answer any other questions. Extra gentle hugs!!! Ceanna",

Instead of wire localization, they insert the \"scout.\" I actually had Savi radiation which is much different so I have no idea on how that procedure goes, but I can weigh in on having an lumpectomy. I think a lot depends on the extent of the surgery. You've already had chemo, which I did not, and that might make a difference also. All that said, my lumpectomy and removal of some Sentinel Nodes for biopsy was an outpatient procedure. I woke up in a breast binder and can't say I had a lot of pain--right after surgery or even in the days following. The next day I was able to drive and actually went to a meeting--still in the breast binder with a fleece jacket over top, since no one there knew of my surgery!! I had more discomfort from where they removed the nodes than the lumpectomy, but each person has their own pain tolerance, breast size, and type and extent of surgery. Just try to ask questions before or as they put in the scout and for the surgery. You can ask for pain pills after, but may not need them. You don't say here if you had a biopsy, but I didn't find the surgery much more painful than that. You will probably be restricted for a few days on raising your arm above shoulder height, so plan ahead at home for cupboards, reaching. It's surgery, but you'll most likely do very well. Thinking and praying for you. Please let us know how you are doing and ask questions and we will try to answer. All the best for surgery and recovery. Ceanna",

I'm not real sure about what to do if it is sticking straight out in front of you, but it sounds like it is under gauze so secure. Mine went in on my arm side and so the wires could be tucked into the breast binder I wore. I've posted pics of the binder before but I'll do again since you're new. I got one from my breast center after surgery and bought another through them (Amazon also has) so I could wash one, wear one since I continued to wear it until my wound healed over in several weeks--I am a DD cup and it worked well. I could wear it instead of a bra and wore it under a tank top and fleece jacket. Don't think anyone could see I had the SAVI in. Don't know what you can wear to work, but maybe that would work for you. You just need to be cautious that you don't bump into anything with the device in.  If your treatment is like mine, you will have to have CT scans before each treatment to check on the placement of the device to ensure the rads go where they should. It goes fast, as does the actual rads, so each twice-a-day treatment will go fast. I'm disappointed the nurses weren't more informative for you--keep asking them, or ask here. I hope you got advice from your care takers so you know what to do to care for yourself over this weekend. You'll need to change the dressing over the weekend, but the nurses will do after each treatment. If not, send me a private message (option on blue tool bar on left screen top) and I'll try to answer any questions you have. The massaging is helpful if you are building up fluid. If not, and I did not, you don't have to worry about it--the wound will drain itself if the wound remains open until the device is removed. If you're not on preventive antibiotics, please ask your doctors Monday. Just a precaution, not a requirement. You need to keep the wound dry, but, believe me, you'll really love that first shower you are allowed to take after the device is out. Meanwhile, I carefully used a handheld shower on my lower half, and large wipes for armpits, etc. Just be careful. I accidentally pulled out one of the wire plugs (not a problem). I hope all goes well for your rads next week. Just think, if you have 5 consecutive treatment days, by this time next week, you'll be done!! Please ask away if you have questions or problems. All the best, Ceanna",

While I did not have the exhaustion, swelling, or burnt taste you experienced, I did have some pain that I guess I expected, and therefore, didn't think much about. The pain was more from the additional wound from the device placement than the lumpectomy and it took me a couple of weeks before that extra wound closed. The pain will gradually go away and each person is different, so it's hard to predict how long yours will last. I still, occasionally, get a sharp or gentle little stab, but because I recently had my annual follow up exam and everything is great, I know there is nothing going on. I don't know if you have a follow up scheduled with your radiology staff, but if the swelling and pain continue, please be sure to check back in with them. I was just so grateful I did not have 6 weeks of external radiation so the SAVI short term problems outweighed the possibilities with long term external rads. Best wishes and let us know how you both are doing. Edited to add: I found that the pain was lessened by wearing a breast binder 24/7 for a couple of weeks. I am a D cup and it helped keep everything in place while healing.",

When the device is in (basically 10 days) I had a pressure feeling and only slight pain occasionally. Yes, I too, had more pain for the SNB and swelling from that than the lumpectomy or SAVI device. You are not to take a shower and get area wet since the wound is open and you can't risk infection, but I have to admit I did cheat and wrapped myself in a large towel on the top and used a handheld shower for my bottom half a couple of times,but really felt ok with using washcloths/soap a couple of times a day and I had also bought the big pre-moistened wipes meant for bathing someone bedridden!!! I could also wash my hair with the handheld by bending over the tub as long as I covered the device area and wore a breast binder to keep everything in place while I bent over. I was also prescribed an antibiotic to take while the device was in to prevent infection. I bought two breast binders and wore one of them each day of the radiation. I could wear under a fleece jacket (I had my treatment during winter months) and since the radiation rooms are cooler, I used to leave the fleece jacket and binder on and just open the front of each during the CTs and treatment and at least keep my arms warmer!! Best wishes and let us know if you have other questions and keep us up to date on your progress.",

Best wishes for the Christmas/Hanukkah break and gentle (((hugs))). Sweetpea, sorry you're dealing with lumpiness. Hope the massage helps. Yes, it takes time to heal. I think the doctors always use the one year timeline, but each person heals at different rates!! It will never be the same but as time goes by, I seem to notice less and less. Sounds like you're taking good care of yourself. Keep it up and best wishes for the coming new year!",

I think I remember part of the reason for the CTs before each rads was to check for fluid or the device moving--if you're having SAVI type brachytherapy. Maybe ask the CT techs about the fluid. Cavity size being bigger than tumor size is probably an indication of your surgeon going for \"clear margins.\" Probably a good thing! Not sure of the answer for your emitting radiation question, but since the radiation comes from the particle coming into the device and the particle is moving quickly with only the clicks indicating a fractional second stop in the tubes, I would estimate the radiation doesn't do too much while traveling fast, only when it stops. I've not heard of having rads 3 times in one day, but I don't see how that would be a problem. It's the cumulative effect of 10 treatments, not the time between them--some people have weekends between treatment days. All the best for a fast week and successful completion!! Ceanna",

Each treatment was preceded by a CT scan to show that the device hadn't moved and I had 2 radiation treatments per day for a week.  I was glad to be done after 5 days and grateful I didn't have to go in daily for 6 weeks for external radiation.  Other than some black and blue spots from bruising from device (which quickly cleared up), I had no burning or skin problems other than the additional wound. Ladyhop, I hope they check out the redness.  Sounds like an infection.  As I noted, I was on an antibiotic from the day my device was implanted until 2 days after it was removed 10 days later.  My gap of days between insertion and starting radiation was explained to me as  the two days it took to calculate how each of the 7 tubes are placed in the lumpectomy wound and how long and how strong the radiation they will use and then the weekend days before I started treatments on a Monday.  It was interesting during the treatments to hear the tiny radiation pellets \"click\" into place in the tube and make 7-10 stops in the tube and then exit back into the machine delivering the treatment.  Total radiation treatment time was less than 10 minutes each time, but the scan, setup and unhooking me from the machine took additional time.",

A lot of anxiety is the norm until we get all the information and set up a plan for surgery and treatment. If you have surgery or treatment options, do a search by clicking on the \"Search\" box in the upper left corner and type in keywords. If you have any questions, just post and someone will answer. As to telling others, I chose not to tell very many people. I am a very social person and a talker, but in this case, I think I made the right decision. I did not have to repeat my story, hear others tell tales of their great aunt so and so and all the problems she had, and never got that \"I'm so sorry for you\" look. I know it will probably depend on your treatment. I had a lumpectomy and was able to be back in meetings the following day. I did not have a physical kind of job and no kids bumping into me so could do it. I did have radiation and could work my schedule around them (I had 5 days of twice a day rads) and did not have chemo. Do what you think will work for you in the long run. All the best to you. Let us know how you're doing.",
