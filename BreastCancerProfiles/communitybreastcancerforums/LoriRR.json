Just today I developed itchy skin high on my breast-the part that shows when you wear a v neck. Dr. gave me some cream and suggested cold cloths. Works great. I hope all goes as well for you. I also started Arimidex last May-before my surgery and I am experiencing a few side effects but they are mild. I hope your days pass quickly! LoriÂ ",
