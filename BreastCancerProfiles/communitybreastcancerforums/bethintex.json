    "Content": "bethintex wrote: ok so statistically I know that the majority of us are using some alternative or complimentary therapies with our traditional therapies. would like to share info on what everyone out there thinks has helped keep them here longer or improved quality of life. during chemo I fasted two days before each round and 24 hours after. had very few side effects from chemo. also was on a low carb, moderate protein, high fat diet through treatment. I ate an insane amount of avacados and pecans. I also kept up a pretty good exercise routine. I was cancer free for just over 2yrs after chemo. its back now. im not sure of what my treatment will be yet but guessing back on Herceptin and prob more chemo. will definitely fast if having chemo.
