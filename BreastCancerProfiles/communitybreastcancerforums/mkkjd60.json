The call backs are just torture. I always say I feel like a ticking time bomb. I read a book about daughters of women with breast cancer called \"My mothers breast\". If you get a chance, pick it up. It was written by a psychologist who did a study of us daughters and she discovered that many of us are suffering from PTSD. We are just waiting to get the bc while suffering the losses of our moms. I would imagine that your mom got her bc premenopausal which commonly makes the cancer more aggressive and sometimes doesn't have hormone receptors. It is not only important for you but important for your daughter that you get the breast specialist and are followed closely. If written properly, a script for the brac test may well be covered by your insurance given your very strong history. My moms brac was covered and the script was written by a breast specialist. I too have daughters and I fear for their future with this disease. As for the cyst, I would go to the breast specialist who may well aspirate it. I really think you are a candidate for a mammo MRI rotation. Again my insurance covered it because of high risk. Good luck and God speed, mary",

They believe that single agents will result in keeping more meds in your medical arsenal. Mom has been pretty stable on ct scan, some mixed results on pet, but onc wants to stay the course because ct scan said liver mets essentially unchanged. Hope this helps. Blessings. Mary",

I know when my mom had the mammo that saw two tumors, they were talking cancer even before the biopsy. She already had a breast specialist since she had some years before been diagnosed (dx) with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) so she had a surgeon in mind. It is a whirlwind and I can tell you it is important that she take someone to these appointments who \"has their wits about them\". My dad was a deer in the headlights, so I went, notebook and pen, and wrote down everything. Most importantly, she should get copies of ALL her reports. Don't let them tell you they can't give you everything. It's hers and you will need them. Skittles is absolutely right...the ultrasound won't dx cancer. Only the biopsy. If it is cancer, only surgery and the pathology that comes out of it will tell you what, if any, spread of the cancer has occurred. It truly is a marathon, not a race, but I understand the fear that comes along with all of this. Good luck, my friend.",

I think farmer is right to go ahead with some genetic counselling even though you have some knowledge of your history. I know a fair amount of people who never consider things like the male line of their family. That being said, I think your situation is rather unusual due to your age. Why not ask the doctor about the possibility of a mastectomy? Ultimately, it is your body...and your mind. Fear of the future, especially at your age, is a real thing. Of course, you can't let it run your life but you should consider its implications. I went to high school with a girl who had a mastectomy at about your age. We are 56 now, living happy, productive lives. Good luck, my dear. Let us know how you do. Mary",

Its such a tough call but the important thing here is that no one in the medical community seems to think your crazy for thinking about a pmbx. So you have to believe it is a very reasonable option for you. I guess for me, if I could possibly put the subject of bc behind me forever, then I would choose the pmbx. You could also opt to do further genetic testing. In my case, I paid $250 to Color Genomics that tests for 19 genes most known right now for bc. (My mom tested negative for brac and bart). It is a \"spit\" test, so nothing invasive. My mom was on the pill your speaking of and did have a lot of side effects. I hope you find peace in whatever you decided to do. So so very sorry about your mom. It never leaves you, does it? Many blessings Mary",

I too wanted to be encouraging and positive, yet realistic with mom. Such a fine line. I brought in hospice but made it clear that they could be ushered out at any time and that they were just here to give ME some help. I was mentally and physically exhausted and mom knew it. I often referred to hospice as \"home care\" . To tell you the truth, that term was easier for me to swallow also. I will say that the more drugs that mom got during the last few months, the more she was in pain - and a lot of pain. That was because the liver just couldn't handle the drugs anymore. It was terrible to see her like that. When we stopped all drugs, I guess her liver relaxed and she was never in pain again. Amen! Aggressive treatment sometimes results in the unintended consequences of sickness and pain. I wish you peaceful days with your dear wife. The best moments I had with mom was when we just sat and held each other in our arms. You sound like a wonderful husband. You have done EVERYTHING you could have. No regrets, my friend.",
