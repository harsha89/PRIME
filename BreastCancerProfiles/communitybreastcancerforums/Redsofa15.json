It was about the size of a 20p, I left this lump thinking I was to young for breast cancer and maybe it was hormone related. I'm 25 btw. It wasn't until last week on Friday I woke with shooting pains in my right breast and armpit. This lump? thickening? So the GP called it had grown, it is at least 3-4cm now and very hard. It is slightly mobile but it's very superfical and is hard. No soft and very mobile as it was 8months ago. The edging of this thickening is very weird, almost like its layed if u must? It feel like a lump on top of a bigger lump. But again I was told today by GP that's its 'mobile' which they suggest is good right? She has sent me a referral off and said i should receieved my letter by the end of the week that's if they don't phone me sooner. I'm so worried and feel a fool for leaving it so long :(  Thanks for listening xx Log in to post a reply",

I was even reading the examination page in the local newspaper and that never said anything about  thickening was just about lumps? I'm very open to all tests and If advised to do so will have any one they recommend. thank you for taking your time hun xx",

I had a severe case of mastitis 5years ago after feeding and expressing for my premature baby. I always found more milk can from my right breast (the one with this thickening) and always pumped more..obviously had to stop when I got this mastitis.  But my question is maybe I always had this thickening from when I got the infection?? Would that be a possibility? Thanks ladies. X",

Although the GP said she would fax the referral over today, she did say the time scale would be two weeks. She also did say I would get a letter this week if I didnt already have them contact me via phone. So hoping it comes through quickly as like you said its the waiting and now I know she was concerned it has made me feel more anxious. Sending you massive hugs hun.xx",
