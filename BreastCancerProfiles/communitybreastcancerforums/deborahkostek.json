    "Content": "deborahkostek wrote: I went for my annual mammogram last week and the radiologist found a growth in my left breast - I was not expecting that.  The radiologist recommended a ultrasound, which was done.  The ultrasound shows a sizable growth that is appears dark - there does not appear to be much irregularity, seems like it has smooth edges.  Another radiologist is looking at it now.  Does anyone know what a dark mass is?  Are dark masses usually considered benign?   Where can I get more information on this? Also, does anyone know if there is a blood test they can do to see if you have cancer - is there such a thing?  I have not felt very well for a number of months.  I am hoping this is not a reaccurance of what I experienced in 1992.  I had a growth removed from my left breast that was cancerous in 1992.  Many of my relatives have died from breast cancer or ovarian cancer.  I don't want to be overly concerned, but I don't want to procrastinate either. Any information you can give would be greatly appreciated. Blessings to you Deborah  Log in to post a reply",
