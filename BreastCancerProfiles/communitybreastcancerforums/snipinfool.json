I am finally checking in on day 7 of AC #1.  I haven't had any serious SEs, just very, very tired.  I was able to go to my older daughter's final dance review on Saturday.  I wore a mask and got a lot of stares from the little ones there, but I didn't want to miss it.  I was able to delay my chemo start for a week so I could go to her high school graduation mask-free.  I am sorry to hear about the hospital visits for some of our group.  I hope everyone is back to feeling much better.  Welcome to our new members of the group.  I know I receive so much strength reading everyone's posts.  I feel so fortunate to have you all on my team. I will be thinking of all of you having your next round this week and pray for everyone to be SE free. Merry",

RedBard and LauraM- Way to go with bringing in the money!  Yea for you and your teams.  Paxton-  Great news about being 1/2 way through.  I hope your blood pressure stays low. Leanna9, Summer38, Drim, and GolferGirl- I had 2 periods less than 3 weeks apart.  The second one was a doozy. No cramping.  Didn't see it coming.  My onc. sent me to the gyn and he did a endometrial biopsy.  It seems like I have too much estrogen.  I thought we already knew that.  He wants me to start taking progesterone since it was low.   Day-  We had several ladies who had completed treatment at the Look Good Feel Better class I attended.  It had not worked out in their schedules to go to an earlier one.  The information would be helpful wherever you are in your treatment. Sacphotomom- I hope your WBC shoot back up and get back where you need them to be. Daisylego and Leanna9-  I will be thinking of you today.  I have my 2nd treatment yesterday and it has been pretty much like the 1st one so far.  I head out this morning for my neulasta shot. I love the pictures that are getting posted.  It is great to be able to put a face with a name.   Have a great week everyone. ",

Oh and by the way, as soon as I went to the gyno, my period went to a trickle.   This morning, I noticed my hair was falling out big time.  It started 2 days ago, but it was bad enough this morning that I had to either shave it or get ready to call the plumber to unclog the shower.  My DH and both of my girls took turns giving me a mohawk.  We took a couple of pictures and then they took the rest off.  The first thing I thought of when I saw myself in the mirror was Tim Gunn (from Project Runway) saying, \"That's a lot of look.\"   My next A/C treatment is Wednesday.  I hope it goes as well as the first one.  I will be thinking of you all this week and hoping we are all SE free.",

I am thrilled to hear that some of us are almost at the end of chemo and getting ready to graduate to rads.  I will be one of the ones bringing up the end of the chemo treatments as I don't finish until mid October.  No rads for me tho.   Take care of yourself and remember that we all are giving each other much needed support and strength.   Merry",
