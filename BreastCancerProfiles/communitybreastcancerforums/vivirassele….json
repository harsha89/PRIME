I would run my hands through it........and (especially around the nape of the neck) it just shed like crazy. I got a \"real wig\" from the American Cancer Society.....but never wore it.  I just bought crocheted beanies.....super soft cashmere beanies......then switched to RIDICULOUS wigs...like a Wendy's wig....Elvis wig.....GIANT afro....bee hive....oompa loompa...anything. I should post them....they really gave me a sense of power and everyone looked forward to seeing what hideous wig I'd come in with next. It took me a while to find my humor, but I did......and am now featured all over Georgia Cancer Specialists.  It seemed to be a great upper to those around me, and gave me control! Hang in there......yes, it's painful and terrifying to not see yourself in the mirror....but it will pass. Take good care of yourself. michele",
