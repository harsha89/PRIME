The procedure had minimal impact (laparoscopy) on my body and recovery was (for me) 2 days. I was advised by my oncologist to have them removed as I have very high estrogen levels. My side effects are hot flashes, I mean lots and lots!! Mood is fine, no real problems there. However, the biggest impact on my life has been without question my libido. I cannot emphasize this enough!!! Dryness is the net result of having your ovaries out and for me the pain of intercourse is just too much to bear and unfortunately I am not in a position to take any of the estrogeon suppositories (Vagifem etc). That said, I was prepared to do whatever.... to give myself the best possible chance going forward. Hope this is of some help.",
