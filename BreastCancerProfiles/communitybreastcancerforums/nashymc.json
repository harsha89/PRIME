Two were similar sizes to yours; one was 5cm and the second was 3cm (unsure of how big the 3rd was as my surgeon found it during the surgery). However, mine were next to each other so could all be taken out through one incision that's roughly 4 inches long along the curve of my breast. From my experience, I had no deformities at all after the surgery and yes fibroadenomas may well grow back in the space but they may never grow as big so I'd say (unless very large and/or very painful) a mastectomy may not be necessary. All the best x",
