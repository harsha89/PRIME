I had my annual mammo on 1/28 which prompted a diagnostic mammo on 2/8 resulting in a Birads 4C - highly suspicious. I had my stereotactic biopsy on 2/21 and am anxiously (ha! That's an understatement!) awaiting my results. The waiting and my personal research has been agonizing. It seems like info the category 4C is all over the place in regards to what it means. And like you, my doctors haven\u2019t really said much either. I will say that this online community as been a WEALTH of knowledge, information and support!!! Hang in there",
