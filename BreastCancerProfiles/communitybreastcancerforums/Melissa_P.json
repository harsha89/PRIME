I had tried to get in touch with the hospital that had done my mammogram and ultrasounds last week, and the films had been read, but they wanted me to talk to my dr first. I did call my dr with no luck actually speaking to some one! I have waited for them to call back, but nothing yet. I got a call from the radiology dept at the hospital, the asked me to come back today for another mammogram and now I am super scared ! Log in to post a reply",

My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and had a mastectomy, with nodes removed. Later the breast cancer spread however, and went into her brain, and she passed away.  I, found a lump, in my arm pit area. Actually, two now. They are larger then peas. I went to my dr for my anual, (I also get regular mammograms too) He said that they are nodes for sure. He also found a lump in my breast as well. Wants me to have a diagnostic mammogram and also a ultrasound. Then, he also was able to get a \"discharge\" from my left nipple. It was not though bloody.  The radiology department was not able to get me in however until September 25th, and that is nearly two weeks away, ... two weeks of worrying, and frustration and fears! I am the first on the cancellation list however! Can anyone please give me any input? Thanks so much in advance !!! Melissa Log in to post a reply",
