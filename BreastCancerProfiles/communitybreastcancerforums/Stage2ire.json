I've pain everywhere, like all my bones,including skull, but especially larger bones..hips back, legs etc. Hoping it starts to lift tomorrow. Did you find any useful ways to alleviate it? I'm 39. I find it lonely being only one of my group of friends going through this. I find BCO great though, I'm not only person in my 30's whose teeth hurt!!",

He was just gone 4 when I was diagnosed in June. We found a book online called \"mummy has breast cancer\". It was geared to his age and helped a lot. He knows I'm sick, and that my chemo medicine makes me tired and I need to rest. When I start rads we'll read him the book again to remind him about it. He asked me recently wasni better yet. I told him no, but I was working very hard with my doctors to get better. I try not to make promises. When I lost my hair I showed him my head and at home I go bald so he's used to it. He says I'm beautiful anyway. Its not easy. I know he worries but I try talk to him and if he has a question he asks. I stay at my mums house after my chemo infusions. She's just around the corner and I can rest. He likes to come for sleepovers and I try spend time with him just watching a movie or going for lunch. My little girl is only 22 months old. She doesn't understand I'm sick. I try have one to one time with her as well. Its been hard as she had chickenpox so I had to avoid her for 10 days then she got a chest infection a week later. Main thing I find is spending time with them and when I feel good I try act normal, cooking,doing laundry, telling them tidy their toys etc. Kids are adaptable. I also try think about what I can teach them about how to face adversity. I don't want them to think of me as bowing down and giving in. Whatever it brings I want them to see me and our family as fighters I don't cry in front of the kids. It would scare my son. I save that for middle of the night wake up sessions like now. (Its 4.30am here). My sleep is a disaster lately!",

I did find as I went through it took a little longer to bounce back each time so be prepared for that. Def eat something and lots of fluids before and after chemo. Stay ahead of the nausea with the meds. I have emend and Valoid, also zofran if I need it Just a warning, if you have your period around time of infusion it can make nausea worse. Also, anyone who suffered bad morning sickness in pregnancy mention to your MO. He might give you an extra anti nausea to have on hand. Apparently women who experienced morning sickness can have more nausea. Hormones maybe? Def happened for me!! I was trying to eat well before chemo but just focusing on getting food in now, whatever it may be and my oncologist said just eat the fries if that's what my body needs :) Also if you want to stimulate white cell production naturally try dark green veggies, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts etc. Apparently the folate helps boost wbc Its doable. Hair loss started day 15 for me. I got a wig but never wear it. Hats or scarves. Good YouTube tutorials on how to tie scarves. I just buy regular scarves, cheaper and easier and more fun to match to outfits. Watch out for steroid come down, always knocks me for six emotionally. They are my tearful days! I've had complications, sick kids etc along the way. Its been hard to learn that I'm not in control but I just live day to day now and try take the rough with the smooth. Good luck to everyone.",

Once I knew Valoid worked I took them before I felt I'll, felt much better on the next couple of doses. It hits everyone differently. I found I didn't feel as sick by day 3 and 4 but that's when the tiredness and emotional low hit. Different SE's for different days. Shaneswife, 6 kiddies, you must be a busy lady! I've got 2 young kids and feel I never sit down lol. Having no node involvement is great, it sounds like your docs are hitting it hard to try make sure you never have to do this again. I noticed a few people settling alarms for anti nausea meds. I'm a bit further in than you ladies and my sleep suffers so I didn't want to wake myself up. I found taking an anti nausea last thing at night and the minute I woke up along with a good drink helped. I do tend to wake around 6-7am so early enough and some of the anti nauseas (I think zofran) are long acting so will carry you over the night. If of course you have very bad nausea that's different, but otherwise you should be OK to try get a few hours straight at night.",

I pushed myself more than I should and unfortunately also developed a wound infection which delayed next chemo by 3 weeks! I've just started Taxol now. Thought I was doing great first 2 days then wham....wall of fatigue and bone pain. I haven't got up today! There is no normal. Chemo affects every one differently. Some people have a few side effects, some people get them all. I learned a few tricks with AC. Hydrate well before infusion, lots of fluids after as well, eat beforehand, stay ahead of the nausea.... take meds before you feel sick. Try to eat well on your good weeks, eat whatever you can on the bad days. How are you doing? When was first infusion? Hang in there and keep going. I've had to learn to live one day at a time and hand over stuff to others. I'm not great at it lol but getting there.",
