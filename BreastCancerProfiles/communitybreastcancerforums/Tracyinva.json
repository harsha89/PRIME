I am scheduled to have a lumpectomy and also with a plastic surgeon that is going to fill in the gap with some extra fatty tissue from my breast. Then he is going to do a breast uplift at the same time. Then I go through radiation and then some months later I get another breast off left on the breast that does not have cancer. Has anyone else had this procedure?. I am really confused. He called it something like osctomy or something like that can someone help explain this?.",

I just had a regular gyn appt back in Feb and had a breast exam and nothing was felt and that is when I got my referral for my baseline mammo but I felt a lump before that so I went in. The dr referred me to the radiologist and they did the mammo and saw the lump. They then recommeded a biopsy for the lump which came back cancerrous along with another small node which I could not feel yet.  They have me schedule for  breast doctor on wed to acesss the options on what I should do next. I hope that makes sense. I really do not know what they are going to do at the appt. I would assume tell me the extent of the mass and the treatment options?",
