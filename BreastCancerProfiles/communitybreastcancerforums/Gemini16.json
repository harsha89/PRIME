      "Content": "Gemini16 wrote: I found a lump on monday, and called my doctor.   I'd been feeling a thinkened area near it for a while now, but finally realized there was a lump there.  My left breast is much larger than the right, and I noticed a bright blue vein running from the base to the nipple.  I've always had a road map of veins on my chest, but usually only on my upper chest and not this many and not this pronounced.  My right breast looks like it always has as far as the veins go. I saw her wednesday, but was a nurse practicianoer I'd not seen before. The one I saw before is no longer at the clinic I go too.  She was very kind, asked many questions, and did the exam.  She did find the lump I told her about and another I had found that morning.  The large one is in my left breast at about the 7:00 position.  It feels like the size of a dime, but more elongated horizonally.  She said the small one at about 9:00 position felt like a fat pocket.  She sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.  She said it didn't feel like it was going to be anything \"bad\".  She wanted me to come back to have another breast exam in 4 to 6 weeks. I had already made my appointment for my annual for next month, so she said that was perfect. I'm 50 with multiple health issues of Rheumatoid Arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.  So, I tend to freak out and imagine the worst.  October, my niece was diagnosed with BC at age 29.  She found a lump but they wouldn't give her a mammogram cause she was \"too young\" and felt it was just a cyst. She insisted on a biopsy and came back cancer.  I don't remember if it's lobular or ductal.  I believe it was lobular and still encased.  She finally had a mammogram that showed an area of suspision in the other breast, but MRI showed it was fine.   Now back to me.  I had the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound today.  The doctor told me the radiologist would give me the results himself today. when the US tech was finished, he took his prints out of the room and said he was going to show them to the radiologist. He came back 5 minutes later and said I was done.  The doctor would have the results soon.  I said the doctor told me the radiologist would give me the results himself today, and the mammogram tech I asked said yes he will.  When I told the US tech what I was told, he stammered a bit and said the radiologist felt the films looked normal and he found nothing of suspion on either.  He said I should get a copy in the mail in about a week.   I still don't know what these lumps are.  I thought a diagnostic mammogram took longer because it involves more views.  There were only two of each breast, and was out of there in less than an hour.  What do I do now?  Wait till next month when I go for my annual and insist on a biopsy?  My nieces cancer wasn't detected by a mammogram.  If she hadn't insisted on a biopsy, she'd still have the cancer and maybe involving her lymph nodes too.   I don't know what to do, but I'm frustrated and feel I have no answers what these lumps are.  Log in to post a reply",
