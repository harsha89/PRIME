As we live in Germany the health system fast tracks you into hospital and so on the day i phoned the Gyno as was at the hospital 2 hours later and she did a small incision and removed the 'lump'. After testing at the lab it turned out to be old skin tissue that was left behind from my surgery and now it seems i have another one. Â Has anyone else had this happen?. I do have breast pain from the original operation and i'm told that is the healing process from the Radiotherapy but could also be an infection from the skin tissue. Also in the U.K it's common for the surgeon to leave metal clips in as markers, in Germany they don't do that so i'm also wondering if it's a clip as it is 1.5cm long and feels rectangular, i'll know for sure in a few days but just anxious and wondering if anyone else has experienced it. Many thanks Log in to post a reply",

The second lump i have the gyno thinks its scar tissue or maybe another skin tissue left in but wants to wait for 4 weeks and look again. It's nice to know that others have similar experiences and not just me.",
