They recommended radiation and hormonal therapy and said I wouldn't need chemotherapy as long as there was no lymph node involvment. After surgery she ordered the oncotype dx and it came back with a score of 23 (intermediate range). They then reccomended chemotherapy because of this. I really do not want to go through chemotherapy. how much can it possibly benefit me.Â  Log in to post a reply",
