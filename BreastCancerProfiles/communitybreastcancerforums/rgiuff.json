I started an AI about 4 months after stopping tamoxifen, mainly to appease my oncologist, but stopped after only 2 months due to big problems with getting to sleep, foot pain like I've never experienced before, and worries about it prematurely aging me internally, as well as externally.  Heart disease and strokes also run in my family.  So I decided that I was done and would keep whatever estrogen I was still making, thank you very much!  I feel that something goes wrong with DNA to start the breast cancer process, don't think it's natural estrogen that causes the problem.  I feel that the issue is more of what is in our environment, the xenoestrogens that are sprayed onto our foods, and in so many household and cosmetic products, the chemicals in foods.  So I've chosen to eat mainly whole foods, organic as much as I can afford, now buy skin creams without parabens, and exercise regularly, as well as have cut down on alcohol.  And studies have been published showing that alcohol and exercise do impact the recurrence of breast cancer.  I would love to see studies comparing these natural factors against the pharmaceutical drugs.  If you want to go the pharmeceutical route, there are other drugs that work similarly to tamoxifen, that have been studied and approved for advanced breast cancers, but I have seen on these boards that more and more premenopausal early stage patients are being prescribed them.  Fareston is one of them, and I can't remember the names of others.  You could ask your Onc about them.",

Unless there is a risk for ovarian cancer, removing your ovaries seems pretty aggressive to me.  Your GYN does earn a living doing these types of surgeries, just a thought.",

From what I've read about soy, the fermented forms, such as tofu, tempeh, and miso, are beneficial, and the concentrated forms, such as those found in supplements and soy powders, are to be avoided.  And it's important that it be organic.  If it's not, it can be full of estrogenic pesticides.  Also, too much soy can affect the thyroid function. Most of the best, clean foods are phytoestrogenic, legumes, many fruits and vegetables, seeds, grains, so trying to avoid them, may be detrimental to our health in other areas. ",

If you are able to have just a lumpectomy and save the nipple, but decide to go with masectomy, you should ask the breast surgeon if you can have skin sparing/and or nipple sparing technique.  This would be the ideal for better cosmetic result.  You should also ask PS to see pictures of the different plastic surgical procedures and their outcomes.  If you turn out to be BRCA positive, you will have to see a genetic counselor who would guide you in all the options.  Some women go for the prophylactic double masectomy, but many don't because screening for breast cancer is very good.  So it would be good to decide which route you would want before your surgery.  But if the choice is too overwhelming, you don't have to necessarily decide right away.  You could have a lumpectomy if you're eligible for that, and then later decide on masectomies if any signs of trouble start brewing in the future.  Prophylactic double masectomy is the most drastic surgery, but some women do it for peace of mind/and or for cosmetic reasons.  You want to know that you thought the decision over thoroughly, and feel content that you made the right one.  Some women do have regrets later over their decision, whether conservative or drastic.  The more information you obtain ahead of time, the more likely you will know everything you need to know to make the right decision. Also, for me money was very important.  Because I went with all doctors and hospital that are in network, my surgery, radiation, tests, procedures, doctor visits, and medication have all cost me nothing.  A friend of mine, who felt she had to have the best of everything, and went out of network to Sloan Kettering, is now years later, many thousands of dollars in debt.   I wouldn't even give it a second thought about offending the surgeon.   They know that patients go for second opinions, and as mentioned by an earlier post, it's the office staff, that you would speak to anyway, not the doctor. You have to worry about what will work best for you and the doctor will always have many other patients.",

If you end up needing masectomy, reconstruction can be done during the same surgery, but you have to see plastic surgeons and arrange for both breast and plastic surgeons to be there during the one surgery.  There are also 2 different routes to go as far as reconstruction goes.  There are procedures using your own tissue, such as muscle and fat from the abdominal area, or there are implants.  If you do end up needing a masectomy, you should make an appt. with a plastic surgeon prior to the masectomy to discuss all your reconstructive options. Once finished with surgery,  I got the pathology report from the lumpectomy and brought that to my 1st Oncologist visit, along with all my mammo, ultrasound and MRI reports.  From there, based on all the data, and an Oncotype DX test, which was sent out to determine whether or not I needed chemo, treatment decisions were made.  I didn't need chemo, but had radiation and take tamoxifen now.   Whether or not you need chemo will depend on what type of tumor you have, if it's DCIS(ductal carcinoma in situ), you wouldn't need chemo.  If it's invasive,  you may need chemo, many factors, such as your age, stage of cancer, and whether lymph nodes are involved, are taken into consideration when deciding this.   For CAT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, they should be able to do all of them in one appt. You can ask.   You may have to drink some contrast solution right beforehand, which is not so bad.  It justs helps them to better see your insides.  For the bone scan, they will inject some dye into your vein, and you will have to wait a few hours after that for them to do the scan, so you will need time to get all these tests done.  None of them are painful. You have a lot being thrown at you right now and it can be overwhelming, so it's important not to be rushed into hasty decisions and to take the time now to research and get second opinions, so that you can later feel that the best decisions were made.",

I researched which hospitals have the best reputations and the most advanced techniques for dealing with cancers and of course, the best ones were in the city.  Sloan Kettering doesn't participate in my insurance (HIP}, so that one was out, but Columbia Presbyterian is in my plan, so I made an appt. there with the one surgeon who took my insurance.  It turned out she only does breasts and she uses the oncoplastic technique, which impressed me, (This is a technique where the surgeon moves over some of the breast tissue adjacent to the tumor and uses it to fill in the dent caused by the lumpectomy). My other major concern with the surgery was not having lymph nodes removed, because as a nurse, I've seen lymphedema in patients and it's not pretty.  I wanted to be sure that the doctor I picked was skilled at doing Sentinel node biopsy, where they only remove the 1st node (sentinel node) to which lymph would drain, and if this node is clear, the theory is that the rest would be clear as well.   If that one is positive, then they would go in and remove the whole group of axillary nodes. I also saw 2 surgeons from Long Island, but was more impressed by the one at Columbia, so I went with her.  I found some of my doctors at Newsday.com/news/health/doctors.  Newsday has a feature called Castle Connolly Top Doctors where you can search for a doctor based on specialty and hospital, and it gives phone numbers, and tells you what insurances they take and at what schools and hospitals they got their education and training.  The website is :  Newsday/com/news/health/doctors.  These doctors are voted best by their peers. I found my oncologist this way and he is here on Long Island.  I didn't want to keep traipsing into the city if I turned out to need chemo, and also, my oncology visits are every 3 months.  He also recommended my radiation oncologist and for that I definitely wanted to stay local, as it was every day for 6 weeks.   I did see one Medical Oncologist at Columbia just to compare her treatment plan with the doctors here on Long Island and they all had pretty much the same plan for after surgery. As far as the tumor size goes, they make the final determination when they actually remove the tumor.  I was told mine was 1cm, after the lumpectomy, it was determined to be .9cm, so just 1mm smaller.   If you have any questions about doctors I've seen, you can PM me.",

I had absolutely no side effects at the time, nor have I had any later problems from it. I am very happy to have kept my natural breast.  Although small in size, I've always liked the shape of my breasts and didn't want to deal with the unknown of reconstructed breasts. And maybe even more importantly,  I got to keep the sensation of my real nipples.  Since going through menopause,  other areas seem to have lost some sensitivity,  but strangely enough, not my nipples. If anything,  they've become more of a help than ever in contributing to sexual sensations.  At this point, were I ever to have to lose my breasts,  I think I would be devastated!",

The other thing that makes me take the tamoxifen is reading about women who have taken it, saying how it shrank their tumors.  In my mind this means that it is doing something observable and that maybe it could benefit me.",

The surgery pain subsides within a day or two and the SNB incision was slightly more painful than the lumpectomy incision.  I was back to doing pushups within 2 weeks, but could have done them within 1, only I wanted to play it safe.  I had some numbness under my arm for several months, some of that has gone away, just a tiny bit of numbness remains..  ",

I never heard about tamoxifen being hard on the hair follicles just like chemo.  Initially, my hair seemed to be thinning a little on tamoxifen, but could have been due to normal aging/going through menopause.  However, the past year, it seems to have thickened up a bit more and the hairdresser still says I have plenty of it all over.  If it was causing me any unacceptable side effects, like uterine issues or like your hearing loss, I would stop it in a heartbeat.  I actually have already taken a break from it earlier on for about a month due to libido/sexual issues and intolerable hot flashes, which all did improve somewhat from the break.  I refuse to start taking meds to combat the side effects of other meds or to start removing body parts just to stay on a medication that may be minimally benefitting me.",

I just started on an 8 hr 7-3 shift,  I work out regularly now for the past yr and a half, have cut down on alcohol, and am eating very a healthy cancer fighting type of diet.  I'm also trying to work on being more expressive, not holding my emotions in, because I think that stress had a lot to do with it.  I read something about a cancer prone personality being someone who doesn't express emotions and worries about others without taking good care of themself.  That's me and I'm trying to be a little more selfish instead of just trying to please all the time. I'm curious about other nurses with breast cancer and what you all think caused yours.",
