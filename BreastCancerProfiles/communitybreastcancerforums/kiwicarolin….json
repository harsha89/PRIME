Only 1 tumor showed up on the ultra sound the others were anafter surgery suprise. at least they are all out now. The tumor panel met last night to decide on my treatment plan so I shouldget all the details tomorrow at my oncs appt.",

While I have no desire to do chemo again I cant help wondering if the zoladex is enough. i had so much treatment last time and it still came back. Still I know It was the tamoxifen that kept it at bay for so long so hormonals maybe all i need. What bugs me is that I asked what would happen after The 2 years he said well we will just wait and see how tough you ovaries are before we make any more decisions. Thats a bit vague for my liking.",

I suppose they can never bee 100% sure. in my mind I would prefer it to be a new cancer and not one that was so strong it bet surgery, rads,chemo and tamoxifen to come back ad reproduce 4 times.",
