      "Content": "ANG1587 wrote: Hi everyone, so sorry if this is in the wrong place. I am a 27 year old mother of a 19 month old who nurses once a day. A month ago I found a pretty large lump in my breast. I have had little lumps that have come and gone with my period that I never became worried about but this one seemed different. First, it's in a place that I have never had a lump before. It way up on my right breast right where the breast starts and about the 1 oclock positition so more towards the sternum than the armpit so you can get a visual. That is 1 oclock on the right breast, correct? I also had another tiny lump around 10 o'clock right breast an inch or so from the armpit (I was not as concerned about this). The US tech felt the first lump and measure it with her little ruler (about 2.5 cm) she had no problem finding it. Then she measured the tiny one near the arm pit. She scanned the whole breast and I was able to see on the screen when she had the transducer over each spot a circular black area compared to the white breast tissue around it. I am not imaging this, lol anyway the report mentions ONE \"slightly lobulated, hypoechoic nodule at the 10 o'clock position corresponding to a palpable area, this appears to be a benign INTRAMAMMARY lymphnode.\" Birads 2. So here is my question. That 10 oclock nodule is not the large palpable lump that i came in for originally. And it says it's a intramamary lymphnode. I thought intramamary lymphnodes were towards the center of the chest? If it were reffering to the 1 oclock nodule then that would make sense to me (even though a 2.5 cm lymphnode seems rather large to me) OR if she describe the lymphnode as axillary, that makes sense at a 10 o'clock position in the right breast. I am seeing my gynocologist next Wednesday and I will go over this with her, but am I missing something?? It only refers to one lump ( the tech confirmed she felt two and then went ahead and manually, with a ruler, measured both). And the huge one (huge to me anyway) is not even mentioned, that's the 1 oclock lump in right breast closer to sternum. Sorry, I'm just frustrated because either, a) they are missing something or b) I'm severely confused and I am missing something Can anyone shed some light on this? thank you so much for reading Log in to post a reply",

I remember the tech measuring the diameter of a big black spot once she got the transducer over that lump (she dragged the curser across the spot) and measured the other black spot when she had the transducer over the little one. (I'm only assuming measuring it what she was doing as I remember my obgyn doing the same to measure the baby when I was pregnant) I figured both would be mentioned in the report even if they were benign findings. I thought all cysts and \"findings\" would have been mentioned regardless of suspicion. I guess what I really want to know is what it is. I guess that's my control issue surfacing ;) and it keeps getting bigger, I don't want it to grow to a size where it will disfigured me. I guess what I was expecting was \"finding was consistent with a cyst\" or \"dense tissue\" or something! It's like going to the dermatologist with a rash and a mole and having only the mole addressed. edited to add: I also worry about the possibility of a clogged duct, I do NOT want mastitis again!-in the past I would let little things go but now that I have a child I feel it's my duty to protect my health so I can protect him, ya know what I mean?

The tech walked out of my room at 9:36, to hand over the films to the radiologist. I had gotten a text from my mom so I remember it well. Anyway, after reading the report for the millionth time (I know, obsess much?), I noticed that at the bottom, the radiologist had signed it at 9:41. Is 5 minutes a normal amount of time to go over films and write a report? Again, I'm sure it is but it's just another thing to obsess about admidst all of this uncertainty regarding the large lump that's not even mentioned on the report! My gynocologist appointment next week can't come soon enough!  Thanks again for your help, ladies. :)",

She was thorough, patient and had incredible bedside manner. Anyway, she did a thorough breast exam and felt the lump. She could even see the lump through my skin. (It's a right around my third rib closer to the sternum so I guess a lump this size isn't hard to see through the skin on a very bony area, I'm pretty skinny). She said she was surprised that this lump didn't end up on the report so she reviewed my films and said that nothing even showed up in that area. So she did her own ultrasound and showed me everything. it's up high near my pec muscle so she said it's very dense in that area and was not able to discern a lump. I thought she was going to tell me \"it looks like dense tissue so let's watch it for 6 months.\" Instead, she said she is sending me for an MRI. She is sending me to the hospital for it because they practice \"interventional readiology\" and will be able to biopsy anything on the spot where as the other local imaging places aren't equipped to do that. I asked her if it could be a cyst or fibroadenoma and she said, \"no, it would have been very obvious on the ultrasound, especially a cyst.\" So that concerned me a bit. she said that the only thing she can come up with based on the ultrasound alone is \"dense ridge of tissue\" but was not confident because the other breast was nothing like that and she can feel some edges on this lump/mass. So she said \"I want to investigate this further.\" she also wrote me a script for a mammogram because she believes her \"radiology colleagues will want a mammo before the mri,\" even though she feels it is unlikely to yeild any answers given the location of the lump and my dense breasts. I told her my concerns about the mri not being approved and she said \"don't worry, it will be approved.\" So now here I am waiting. Oh and here's the kicker! My mri is schedule for Friday the 13th! My first ultrasound at a different imaging Center was last month Friday the 13th. so all in all I'm feeling a little crazy. This lump is so obvious and feels so different compared to the rest of my breast and every practitioner had no problem feeling it and were equally shocked it wasn't caught on film. It makes me feel like a hypochondriac or munchausen or something :( I almost convinced myself to skip the mri and just watch and see. But I'm not. I want an answer and so does my doctor. My grandmother died from breast cancer. I'm not sure which type though but I'm thinking it was lobular because it recurred in her bladder. I'm no expert, though. I really felt confident that this was a fibro but now I have no idea. I'm praying the mri sheds some light and it is in fact a dense area of tissue. On a good note, she did mentioned that the breasts aren't fully mature until after the first pregnancy, so maybe my breasts are still settling? We'll see. I hope they just biopsy it Friday so I'll have some answers at my follow up app on monday. Again, so grateful to be directed to and in the wonderful care of a very persistent and kind breast surgeon.

This mass did not show up on any imaging, hence the decision from my surgeon to do the excisional biopsy. I had a large hematoma surgically repaired 3 days post op from the originally surgery. Since then, no issues to report until this past summer. This past June, about 3 months post partum, I found a small lump an inch above my scar. This one is quite tiny but very hard and has a definite different texture from the surrounding tissue. Not tender and I have had no breast feeding issues. After a move across the country and getting myself and my kids situated i finally, just recently, scheduled an appointment with a new PCP and mentioned to him the lump i found this past summer. He sent me for an ultrasound which found the 3mm mass - 0.2x0.2x0.3 cm hypoechoic nodule with central echogenic mildly shadowing focus, likely partially calcified nodule at 2 o'clock 9 cm from the nipple. Impression: centrally echogenic .3 cm nodule located at 2 o'clock in the rt breast corresponding to palpable abnormality. Likely a coarsely calcified nodule. Correlation with rt breast mammography reccomended. BI-RADS 0. Heres where my question comes in: I just turned 30 and am lactating and this lump is high up right below the second rib/breast bone. From everything I've read, my age and the fact that I am lactating, a mammogram would be counterintuitive? I see the breast surgeon on Friday so we will see what he reccomends but I'm just wondering, given my situation (age, lactating), if there is some known benefit to mammogram that I'm not aware of.. And if anyone has any insite to my report, please feel free to chime in. I've read that it could possibly be a suture granuloma. I know that that odds are in my favor that everything is just fine i just want to cross my T's and dot my I's. Thank you Log in to post a reply",

Your surgeon may recommend the same, mri, or she may go ahead with a biopsy. It could very well be a normal ridge of tissue. It's so hard to come to a conclusion when there is no imaging to go off of and I'm thankful my surgeon is taking this seriously, despite my young age. For now, I'm trying to keep calm by reasoning that it's probably a good sign that it's not showing on imaging, however, seeing the surgeon is definitely the next right step. are you seeing a breast surgeron or general surgeon? The waiting for appointments and scans is not easy! I'm hoping your surgeon takes initiative and you get to the bottom of this so you can put it behind you. Odds are we are BOTH okay but it's important that we follow up and take charge of our health. my thoughts are with you and I hope you can reach peace of mind sooner rather than later! Good luck with your appointment and here's hoping for some more answers :)",

My doctor, when writing out the Rx for the mri actually reffered it to a \"mass/thickening.\" Mine has borders as well and seems fixed to the tissue around it (I.e it doesn't move). Thought I'd add that since you asked about experience with the same type of lump. Hoping your investigation of the lump goes quicker than mine. I had a not so cooperative PCP (really it was the front desk who sat on my refferals) and all the appointments and scans and follow ups in between which has gone on for about two months now. Keep us updated :)",
