Nothing spread, her pet scan came back clean. We had our Second Opinion at Ohio State University. Her oncologist actually worked there and transferred to a smaller hospital. So everyone is on board with her chemo treatments. When we first visited her we were told that she would have AC every 2 weeks for 4 cylces and T every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. My mom went to see where she will be having her treatments and she met her nurses yesterday and they did a great job of showing her what would happen the day she came for chemo. Her onocologist also told her that she would have treatment 3 days in a row every 3 weeks. Has anyone heard of this? My mom is 76 and is pretty healthy, only surgery was in the 70's, so she is not use to her having something wrong with her, it was always my dad with his heart issues. I guess I want to know a reasoning on why they do this. That is a lot to get in 1 week for a 76 year old, let alone anyone else. They told her that the first day would take 7hours, next day about 1-2 hours and then the next day 1-2 hours. Why?? Again she is so overwhelmed, my dad too, that she may have misunderstood. Hoping to check with my mom today to see if she has heard anything different. Let me know what you guys think.. The blogs on here are amazing!!! I have read and reread and made a chemo bag and bought all the stuff she may need to get through this. I wish and pray for you all.",
