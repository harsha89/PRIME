This hasn't put my mind at ease much since I do feel something is wrong with my left breast and they are pretty big so what if they're missing something? I went to see the surgeon today for what I thought was a biopsy of the lump that's deep in the armpit. He did physical examination of lymph nodes and my breasts and then said that a biopsy is not necessary?!. Come back in 3 months for an US to see if the lump has changed ?? This thing is more then 3 cm and makes me so uneasy to go another 3 months without knowing for sure what it is. I don't want to be pushy with the doctors but I'm very disappointed. On top of this my abdominal US returned a \"mass\" in my kidney....going for a CT scan.",

Ultrasound revealed the following: \"enlarged lymph node measuring 2.7x3.4cm with a central cystic area. The appearance is atypical for lympadenopathy and it could represent atypical lipoma. Atypical looking mass could represent atypical lymph node or lipoma.\" What does that mean?? Anyone had similar results? What were the outcomes? (both good and bad) He is sending me for biopsy. Also had ultrasound of the breast and other areas, results are due soon. I'm terrified. I also have tenderness and pain in the left breast, possibly a lump? I'm 30 years old, granmda had BC. I had 2 clinical breast exams and nothing. But I do have very large breasts. Log in to post a reply",
