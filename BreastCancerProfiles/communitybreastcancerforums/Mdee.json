      "Content": "Mdee wrote: It went well. Didn't hurt at all. The techs were so nice. For the last 5 years, I've had a large tissue on the far right side of my right breast where 2 large cysts have grown from on separate occasions and both were aspirated. All testing shown to be normal. Apparently, there is a small change in it from my last testing so they ordered a mammogram.(plus an extra 25 lbs on my part) The lady doing the biopsy said it's possible with my history it could be scar tissue but there's no way to know until the biopsy comes back. Had a good talk with the tech and she explained all the changes that take place in a woman's breast. Since I have fibrocystic breasts, I'm hoping it's just that. I even had a couple of small cysts nearby the area. The tech told me the tissue is listed as 5cm but she didn't know how much of that was shadowing. I will probably know my results on Monday. I'm scared to death. Log in to post a reply",

The breast surgeon who drained the first one told me cysts can always grow back unless you take out the tissue they grow from. It's most likely a new one that filled up.",
