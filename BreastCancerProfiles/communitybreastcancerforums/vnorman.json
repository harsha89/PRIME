I was told to expect 11/2 to 2 hours for each treatment.  I am actually going to work from home.  I am going to be put on anitbotics so I don't get an infection and was told there would be drainage from the catheter.  My doctor plans to use my sports bra to help hold the gauze in place. I have been told that I can drive.  I am nervous but like ICanDo I want this over with.  I refuse to let cancer take over my life.",

I can tell you that I had one lumpectomy on May 23, one on June 6th.  My catheter was inserted on June 23, the radiation started on June 27th and the catheter was taken out on July 1st. Eight days and no radiation is unacceptable!",
