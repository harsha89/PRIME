At this point, I don't know if or what I should tell people about this. Because I have a job that requires me to be on call, I will have to tell my bosses something about this diagnosis and treatment. I just don't know how much to share with others. (I am normally a very private person.) I would appreciate any insight about how you handled this part of your diagnosis. Thanks, -D Dx 2/2010, DCIS, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
