It makes accepting help hard.  My BS is the one who said something that got through to me. She said something like:  you are a lot like me, you feel like a loser if you are not working. But you are not a loser. You are fighting a bad disease. Take care of yourself and you will be fine. This one time accept help. It seems kind of silly, but it is how I feel. If I cannot take care of myself it means I need help & that makes me feel like a loser. In the past I would rather go without. At first accepting help with meals, or the few donations we got, made me hyperventilating. I decided to check my brain at the door  & write thank yous for everything when I felt well. As for your hubbys schedule & how to keep life somewhat normal for him...we switched to buying some pre-made things so it was easier for both of us. Fruit that is already chopped (fresh cuts from the grocery so no prep needed), canned soups, Lean cuisine (I know kinda gross), trader Joe's frozen pastas with red sauce that he could just heat up in the microwave, pizza, broasted chicken from the deli, etc. This worked better anyway, because smells of food bothered me a lot during chemo. That was during AC. I was able to actually cook sometimes, but not too much. I had to send him to the grocery store as my immune system was pretty bad. We ended up with a LOT of snacks in the house because that is what he picked out...not on the list. I had to let that go and be happy we had groceries. It will be hard, but hopefully you will feel as well as I did. After a couple of bad days, I usually would start to feel better. They give you lots of med options to control pain if you have it, prevent nausea, and help you sleep if you need it.  My husband had testicular cancer 20 years ago at age 22. My memory of his treatment & constant vomiting scared the crap out of me knowing what I had to look forward too. Things are so much better now. I did not vomit once, for which I am thankful.  Good Luck! You will get through it. I am glad people have offered to help. Please be honest with them about what you need & give them the gift of helping. Once you do, things will become easier. Jo",

I remember feeling exactly what you are talking about...waiting to get the cancer out & come up with a plan...then boom everything slams into high gear and your whole life feels immersed in Cancerland. I was in your spot right before Christmas. I stretched weird & felt a pull, and upon investigation found a lump...the rest is history. Like you I did the lumpectomy & SNB. Unfortunately for me, they could not get a clear margin on my tumor, so I too ended up with chemo...and then a second surgery.  It has been a difficult 8 months since then, but I finished AC chemo & Taxol, had my bilateral mastectomy, and am almost 1/3 of the way through radiation.  I am an anxious person so I have really had to make sure I keep that in check. I keep trying to remember small hurdles throughout each type of treatment so I do not get overwhelmed. I have learned to let go of things I cannot control (that has been the most difficult for me), and trust moving forward.  Like you, I had some struggles along the way...I couldn't work because of germs, my hubby got laid off & ended up having surgery too...etc. please accept help offered by friends, family, neighbors and even friends of people who care about you. Once I allowed myself to realize it helps them to help you &most people enjoy helping...my life got a lot easier.  It may feel now like this will never end, but I am a stage 2b, grade 3 person who was in a similar position, and I can tell you it does pass more quickly than you think. I wish for you kind caring nurses, helpful doctors and loving support of family & friends. I hope you find a thread here with people who you connect with; who of course understand what you are going through.  Good luck. ",

Good luck to you. So, here's my BC shtick: for Christmas Eve 2013, I became a citizen in CancerLand... I had a lumpectomy and did not get a clear margin on the right side. So i started chemo knowing I would have a 2nd surgery 3 weeks after completion. I had 4 DD AC, and 12 weekly Taxol with Herceptin.I had a bit of a rough go with my liver during chemo and a respiratory infection, which set me back several weeks. But I finally finished June 26th. I have had a heart issue with Herceptin, but they are keeping me on it & I started a new heart med. For my 2nd surgery, after much deliberation and tons of reading, I decided to do a BMX instead of another lumpectomy. I had that done on July 23rd. It turned out to be a good choice, as I had some other bad crap going on in both breasts that while not cancer, raised my risk of a new cancer significantly. I am not having recon until 6 to 9 months after reads...so that is a 2015 adventure. I started rads on August 21st, so today was actually #21. I did pretty well until #15 when the RT mentioned how good my skin was doing. He jinxed me, the next day the middle of my chest broke into this incredibly itchy area. So far the rest keeps getting angry red, but no additional skin breakdown. I am using aloe gel, 2.5% hydrocortisone cream & aquaphor several times a day. I decide which to use depending on what I am wearing for work that day & what will get on my clothes. Ugh.. I am not sure how you ladies with breasts do it. I can only wear the very softest of my cotton shirts and cannot imagine wearing a bra! I am not sure about fatigue, almost everything we do for BC causes fatigue, so for me, who knows why, I just know I am tired. In positive news, only 7 regular sessions left, then 5 boosts. My hair is a little over 1/2 inch long. I am back to work full time and I am finally feeling like I am getting my life back a little.  I am hoping you all have a good weekend. Thank you again for sharing your stories. ",

That means only 2 more to go!  I did quiz down the docs ( which I am guessing they thought was a little nuts as I had already told them my armpit felt on fire). I was worried that I need the full amount & do not want to tempt fate by not doing all I can to beat this thing. They convinced me the 28 is enough, that with no cancer cells in the second surgery my scar will be ok.  Jules NY & mommy, I have also had the Bolus for 25 sessions. I called it a giant fruit roll-up to the RT, as mine seems like it is made out of a rubbery feeling mat. They told me the same, that it is to keep the radiation closer to the surface. It is supposed to be harder on the skin when they use it. Mine is pretty red with the itchy chest & sore armpit. Now that I only have 2 left, I am less worried about my skin. I hope everyone has a restful weekend. Enjoy the two days off. I will be relaxing with my aquaphor & aloe. For those of you at the beginning, it does go fast. hopefully you will find it much easier than chemo. Compared to that, reads has been a breeze for me. I am tired, but have been able to return to work full-time. For those of you getting close to the end, hang in there. It is almost here. Recent graduates, congratulations!",

Rabitvelvet - It seems like many of us are getting a lesson in patience. Lessons stink. Like everyone, I want this to be done, I can handle getting through it, but delays & setbacks are so hard to tolerate. Glad you are well enough for your chemo...let's hope your blood work & my liver keep doing their jobs and we can power through this leg of the journey. I am scheduled for my 2nd round of Taxol tomorrow morning. I have been trying not to complain about the SE since I was so disappointed and upset when I could not get my chemo...plus it is better than the A/C. I had the bright red swollen stinging face for 2 days & now mucsle/joint pain in my back and hips for several days. I am worried about taking any pain meds as I do not want my liver to react to Tylenol & I am not supposed to take Advil because I have a kidney issue (from before cancer). They gave me a really low dose oxycodone, but I am concerned about taking more than one a day (which is what I used to take of vicodin for my kidney pain). I need to talk to my MO tomorrow about this, because I do not think I can stay as is for the next 11 weeks.  Question: How are people handling being in public & germs? I am working from home right now, and was basically a shut in through A/C as it was winter & cold/flu season here. My white & red blood cell counts have been low, but not dangerously low.  I have not been in public without a mask & gloves, but am wondering if I can relax that now. I am going to talk to my MO tomorrow, but wondering how the rest of you are handling this? Good luck everyone, and may you be SE free today.",

My blood work rebounded a bit before last week's chemo, so I hope I am smooth sailing this week. Congratulations to those of you who are done, and those who are just getting one more week under their belt. For those of you who have finished...any real hair growth yet? I still have the baby chick hair, and while not realy hair, it does seem to be growing. My eyebrows & lashes are now completely gone. I said goodbye to the last lash on Saturday. Marren - I have my radiation consult July 3rd. My Med Onc had radiation as part of my original treatment plan, but I changed my surgery plan from another lumpectomy/tissue grab (I did not get clear margins the first time around) to BMX. I had one node with cancer the first go round.  With the change in surgical plan, I am now in a \"gray\" area for radiation, but my Med Onc thinks I will still have it.  Life would be a lot easier if I did not need radiation, but I guess I will do whatever they tell me I have to do. My surgery for the BMX is hopefully July 16th. My surgeon went on her own medical leave, so my appointments got pushed back to July 8th for my last consult & then if I can still get on her surgery calendar, July 16th. If not July 23rd I think. I will be off work for 4 weeks to recover. Depending on the rads consult, I may or may not have tissue expanders placed. I am struggling with anger/bitterness this past couple of weeks.  Prior I have  been able to maintain a pretty upbeat attitude, but have been down the rabbit hole recently & am not sure why. Nothing has changed except me & my reaction to things. I feel like it is all balled up in my chest & will lash out at the wrong person/wrong time. Over the weekend we had company over, and they were talking about a Music Festival they are all going too (even my husband - he has to go as he works the event) and I cannot go because of this stupid cancer/treatments. I am happy for them all, but the bitter part of me wanted to scream \"shut up! & talk about fun somewhere else!\" Later they all went up to a street dance in our town, and I felt bitter about that too, but I did really need to lay down. Thankfully, I am at least able to keep some of it on the inside so these kind folks who visit me do not think I am ungrateful.  Good luck ladies!",

I hope you get the insurance worked out for the cyberknife. You are right, f* cancer. Birdlover - thank you for the compliment on the picture. We had a fun day :) Belle - Hope you are well. I am 2 weeks out from surgery, and feel pretty good. I need to be doing more stretches. I am glad your surgery went well. I am sending healing thoughts your way. Thank you for writing about the rough skin...I have been trying to figure that out!  Chipmunk, I have kind of blotchy white spots on my nails from Taxol. I was just happy they stayed on :).  I am two weeks post BMX, and feeling prety good for the most part. I did not get expander...have not yet decided if I want reconstruction. Heading into 33 radiation sessions. My simulation & setup are next Thursday.",

There is a Race for the Cure Team that is walking for me on Mother's Day, but now I cannot go because of germs & exertion. I am bummed about that. I just want this chemo trip to end...8 more weeks.",

We are not doing a trip, but are planning a small gathering between my last chemotherapy session and my surgery 3 weeks later. I am looking forward to hanging out with friends & family and having some fun. I am also looking forward to having a glass of wine! I really enjoy a glass of wine, and with feeling gross during AC, and then my liver not liking it, I have not had a glass of wine since New Years Eve. I will enjoy those first few sips immensely. I meet with the plastic surgeon tomorrow to talk about reconstruction. I am a little nervous about the surgeries, but ready to get through the next steps of this journey. I suppose I should be looking for a July surgery thread. May you all be side effect free.",

I am 42 years old, and was diagnosed with Stage II, Grade III IDC on December 27th. I had lumpectomies on both sides on January 8th & my port put in on January 14th. My surgery went well, but they indicated they were unable to get clean margins as it was too close to my skin on the right side. The left side they say is not cancer, but also not a cyst. I had 2 lymph nodes removed, but only 1 was positive. I am planning to ask more questions about the left side now that I am less overwhelmed. I started AC for 4 rounds the week after my port was put in, and I finished March 4th. I was supposed to start my first of 12 weeks of Taxol/Herceptin on March 20th, but while the heart & mind were willing, my liver had other plans. The enzymes in my liver were too high, so they sent me home to wait until today to try again. They think it is residual from the AC & things should calm down this week. I hope so. It was a big blow to me for the setback of a week. I know intellectually it is only a week, but I had my heart set on finishing June 5th. Now it is the 12th (I hope). I am also mad my body is letting me down again.  I am trying to take this all one hurdle at a time, but it is so hard not to look forward to this all being behind me. I see my surgeon again in May to decide what I want to do regarding a potential mastectomy (because of not getting a clean margin). I am starting to think I should have just had everything taken off in the first place. I had my BRCA 1 & 2 blood test yesterday, so in three weeks I should know the results of that. Please cross your fingers for me that I can get started on Taxol today...I will never finish if I do not get started. Thank you all again for sharing your journeys. It is so nice to hear about people going through the same things I am going through.",

After more tests, they are less concerned & I will start back up on Herceptin this week.  Side effect question...I know about the neuropathy in the hands and feet (have that one), but I have never heard anyone mention numbness or tingling in your lips. I swear I have sort of numb lips! Not a big issue, just feels weird.  ",

I had my second follow up with my surgeon this week and all is good there. I cannot remember if I shared on here that they did not find any further cancer in the tissue removed, so that was a huge relief because of the positive margin last time.  I had my 2nd radiation consult & received my three new tattoos. I officially start next Thursday with my 33 sessions which should end in early October. Ready to go! I am a little nervous because while I tan easily/rarely burn, my skin is light (especially this year), I am naturally blonde & have very sensitive skin to everything but the sun. I hope my skin holds up...it certainly.has not liked any of the tapes or chemo. I have been so allergy/rash ridden for the last six months that I should have bought stock in Benadryl!  Birdlover - sorry I have no tips for you on natural type hair color, but am interested to hear if you learn of one. I am going to ask a friend.who is a stylist, I just have not seen her yet. Carpe, I hope you are doing well, I have been thinking of you. PS My EYELASHES are about 1/2 the normal length already & my brows are long enough to hold the brow stuff together to blend them into real brows that do not sweat off!",
