I had Tx #2 today as well.  For the most part it went well except that my veins were not cooperating so much this morning (it took 3 pricks in my veins before it gave in......stubborn bitches).  Then I had a mild reaction with the Taxotere; suddenly my face felt very hot.  Not sure if it was the start of a full-blown reaction but the nurse stopped it.  Then they loaded me with more Benadyl, saline, and then slowly introduced the Taxotere.  Once I felt okay with it, they resumed the normal dosage at full speed.  Btw, have any of you ever gotten Benadryl in your IV?  Holy shyte did that burn!  I said to the nurse, \"WTF\"?  She apologized and promised that it would subside in a minute or two, which it did.  But holy crap I was ready to dunk my arm in an ice bucket.  But after all that, I was still feeling loopy, sent my husband out to run errands and I slept through most of it.  It's very doable! kellerka - I'm sorry to hear about your ordeal.  It sucks that now we have to suddenly be so cautious with people around us and catching germs.  But that gives us a good reason not to be around some folks that we tried so hard to make excuses for not wanting to be with them.  LOL! ginagina - You definitely don't look like a 5-head or 10-head.  You really do look beautfiul.  Matter of fact, all the ladies with pics here truly look awesome.  It shows how tough we are!  sakura73 - Well even though you're only freezing eggs as opposed to forming embryos, I'm going to tell you and all my funny story.  When I was in the prep room getting ready for my eggs to be extracted, the nurse told my husband that he had to go to this 'uh hum.....private room' which had 'uh hum......adult magazines (basically porn mags)'.  Well, as he was about to walk down the hallway to the room where nurses were all over the place, I yelled out, \"Honey, do us proud!\".  Needless to say he was embarrassed, put his head down, shook it back and forth just before heading to the 'uh hum......private room'.  Moral of the story?  You have to find humor in every situation, no matter how bad it can be.  And laughter is very good for your health and wonderful for the soul. Okay, now to the last page and reading all the posts.  Guess my idea of going to bed early got thrown out the window.  Oh well! Mary",

Okay, my first treatment was on 3/2.  Fine the day after but then for 2 days I developed a nasty cold that kicked the crap out of me.  Then afterwards I was fine.  Aside from Herceptin with the TCH cycle, I'm also getting Herceptin every week.  So far the SEs were minimal with the exception of stomach upsets and diarrhea for one night and huge acne on my face, my breast (that has the cancer) and my back.  I was told by another doctor over at Duke that taking Herceptin every 3 weeks is just as effective as taking it weekly.  Anyone know whether this is true or if there really is a difference?  Cycle 2 is on 3/24.  On 3/14 I chopped my hair off and made it extremely short.  When I post my before and after pics you'll see how long my hair was.  I thought I was going to be a mess but I was completely fine.  My husband and daughter (6 yrs old) were there.  My hairstylist pulled my hair into a tight ponytail then snipped it off which I will be donating to Locks of Love.  I had my wigs ready and started wearing one to work on Monday (3/16).  Amazingly, no one noticed the difference.  That's the beauty of a human hair wig.  Go figure!  Now, about 2 1/2 wks after my first treatment, my short hair is finally thinning out.  We'll see how I will react to having 'No' hair.  I just need to remind myself that it's temporary and my health is more of a priority. As I mentioned, I have a husband and a daughter, and a cat named 'Ice'.  I swear he has ADD and an Italian gene in him (I can say that b/c I'm Italian myself and I know I can't stop talking.  LOL).  Ice starves for attention and affection despite all of it that he's getting from us.  For those who haven't attended a 'Look Good, Feel Great' class, I highly recommend you go to one.  If nothing else, for the free products they give.  For me, it was worth the 2 hours of my time to be there and I walked out of there with a bag full of products, some inexpensive but most appeared to be b/c of the famous name brands.  Plus it gives you the chance to try new products without having to pay for them and have them sit in the cabinet for years like I used to do in the past. Another btw, I keep forgetting to ask my Onco, but why are we restricted from being in the sun?  Is it that we can but need to be covered from head to toe or we shouldn't at all?  And a big welcome to all the new princesses.  Sorry that you've had to join us, but this forum is filled with wonderful tips and tricks that your Onco or the nurses don't tell you.  And most of all, you are not alone and there are so many wonderful warriors here to help you get through this crazy curveball! Whew, now hopefully i'm all caught up.  Mary ",

Another question........are we supposed to limit our sugar intake?  My Onco and the nurses never mentioned it but I keep reading about everyone's limitation with sugar.  There's been speculation about sugar feeding the cancer but I don't recall hearing that it's been proven.  Then I was told by other BC Survivors to avoid coffee and soy products.  Why would that be the case?  I wish the Onco nurses could provide a list of foods/products to limit or eliminate; would make our stress levels much calmer.
