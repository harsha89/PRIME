I just saw a PS at Kaiser last night and he does not seem to want to have anything to do with my previously radiated breast, except maybe for a latflap - I had lump and rads for DCIS in the left breast two years ago and now have it again on the right side, one of my options per the BS is mx or even bmx or to do lumpectomy and rads again. Went to see the PS last night to discuss this and was not too happy with the limited options for the previous rad side,  I would really be interested in talking to a PS within Kaiser that works more with radiated breasts and fat grafting.",

What I have found is that there is the standard whole breast radiation for 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks, sometimes with \"boosts\" at the end. But there is also a shorter 3 week program that is used in some cases. For lumpectomy there are partial breast radiation programs that are twice a day for 5 days, but you must meet certain criteria to qualify for this. There are both external radiation and internal with the 5 day programs. for the internal there is Mammosite, Contura and Savi. I have been Googling these to ready about them.",

I verified this through the rad office and Kaiser before starting. I had a lumpectomy and SNB through Kaiser and was charged a $500 copay - then I find out that my plan says I have a $500 copay for surgery as an inpatient and only $25 for outpatient surgery - my surgery was definitely outpatient, as soon as I woke up they were like \"here's your clothes, don't let the door hit you in the butt on the way out\" seriously the nurse didn't even make sure I was ok to sit up, get out of the bed and dress on my own, and then I walked out with my husband. So I am having Kaiser investigate the charges. the surgeon even told me on the day of my surgery that I was not spending the night and that she had coded it wrong, but she corrected it prior to surgery, she was new to the Kaiser system.",

Initially I was really against having to have rads, but thinking about the microscopic cells that could still be there, well the rads won out. I just found out last week that I am er/pr negative, so for me rads is the only thing I can do. I am halfway through, 2 1/2 weeks to go and I am done, so I am focused on that. I definitely try to work less, and spend more time with family and friends now, this was a big wakeup call.",

I think that has helped somewhat, but the weird rash is stll there outside of the radiated area. I just haven't had time to call the rad onc, and it hasn' been bothering me. Let us know what your rad onc says. I don't think it is anything to worry about, but it is strange that it would appear right after radiation.",
