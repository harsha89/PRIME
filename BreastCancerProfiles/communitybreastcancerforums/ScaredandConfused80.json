    "Content": "ScaredandConfused80 wrote: I went to my local Urgent Care about a nickel sized knot I found. The doctor there recommended that I get a 3D mammogram and ultrasound done. The recommendations from that are that I need to have a left breast ultrasound to evaluate a 12mm nodule and an ultrasound guided right core biopsy for a 9mm complex nodule. This was my first time ever having a mammogram or ultrasound and to see the BI RAD 4 label my mind is spinning. I don\u2019t know what this all means or how to proceed. Stressed out like I\u2019ve never been and unsure of what\u2019s next. Log in to post a reply",
