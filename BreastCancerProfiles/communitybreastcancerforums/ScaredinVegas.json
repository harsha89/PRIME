Mammogram shows no calcifications Ultrasound shows smooth oval areas that they say are probably benign and the diagnosis is multiple complex cysts. They aren't recommending a biopsy but to repeat the ultrasound in 6 months. Is that normal sounding? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "ScaredinVegas wrote: I have one breast that aches from time to time and seems to be sensitive to temperature like in the shower. It doesn't hurt to touch it is just more of an ache or like a nerve pain. Is this something to worry about and what could cause it? I'm concerned because my mammogram on that breast was inconclusive and I need to do more tests. I do have dense breasts and this one feels different from the other. No lumps just more heavy and dense if that makes sense. I'm very worried because of the mammogram Log in to post a reply",
