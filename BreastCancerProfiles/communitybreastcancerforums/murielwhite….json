This particular Topic \"If' you are not stage 4 but have questions\" is perfect for this type of question. Although I agree with what you say about ladies fretting over every ache and pain I also think that its very important for us to be aware of things that are 'not quite right' Unfortunately it appears all too common that signs are ignored and passed off by our doctors and oncologists. I think the most important thing for us to do is strongly advocate for ourselves. There appears to be many occasions where the patient has noted something different and the doctor/onc has passed it off as nothing and it turns out to be MBC. Thanks again for your posts. Best wishes Muriel White p.s The other thing I wanted to say was about the ladies that actually have no symptoms and find out they have mets just by sheer luck. For me the statistic percentages mean nothing if you happen to be in that 30% or 5% or 10%",

Throughout the boards there are posts regarding 'obscure' symptoms and of course some people who progress with no symptoms at all. For those of us who have lots of symptoms and SEs it would be useful to understand these 'obscure' symptoms. Thank you so much , Best wishes Muriel White",

Apart from head pressure which I started getting last July (and has just gone from occasionally to virtually all the time) I have lots of ache and pains (don't we all!!!!!!!!!!!). My main concern is that now I walk funny! I am a very fit person who walks every day (at least 3 kilometres with my DH). I did it all through chemo, radio and surgery. My DH and I used to pace at the same rate but now I take very short steps and scuff my feet as I seem to have become flat footed. On a walk I often walk/shuffle all over the place like a drunk. My legs and feet are okay, it seems like a motor problem. I have had a couple of spells in hospital and lots of scans and tests. At this moment they still dont know what is causing it. I had a CT done last week of my adrenal glands and this coming week I am having an MRI of head and neck blood vessels. I would really like to know what Is the problem and I would very much appreciate any input? Thanking you in anticipation. Best wishes Muriel",

I was only on femara for a short while as I went back onto Tamoxifen when I discovered that I already had osteoporosis. I have been on Tamox now for nearly 2 years. I have had 2 spells off it to see if the symptoms go away and they didn't so that has been ruled out. Regarding chemo, I had 4 cycles but that finished Oct 2014 so I doubt if that's the culprit. Chef127 I am interested in your neuro based condition? Do you mind if I ask what it is and if you want to keep it private please feel free to PM me. I don't get dizzy, just feel its a 'head' thing with my walking and the swaying seems to be when I correct myself!!!! All very bizarre and hopefully I will get some answers soon!! Thanks again. Love Muriel",

I was sent some info from the Cancer Council on peripheral neuropathy. It states that there is no cure or treatment available however there have been trials using duloxetine which is an anti-depressant which shows great promise. It also says \"Peripheral neuropathy affects 20 - 30% of patients treated wit taxanes and platinum-based chemotherapy, with a spectrum of severity that can affect such daily activities as walking, working, sleep patterns and mood. Although many patients may experience manageable numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, others find peripheral neuropathy chronic and debilitating\" \"CIPN (Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy) may continue for months or even years after treatment is stopped and may worsen over time\". Thanks for your input. Love muriel",
