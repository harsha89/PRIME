It takes into account 71 genes and if you are premenopausal it has a better statistic than the oncotype test. I got both test done, because I have strong family history (mother, grandmothers, aunts, 1st cousin that is just mom's side) of BC my mother was 33 when she got it and they gave her 3 months to live. My BRCA came back negative and I was upset with that considering how many women have it in my family. For the past 22 years I was waiting for the shoe to drop. You are in the unknown stage in planning. Keep a journal to write down your feelings and questions it helped. It is scary, but you will make it through this with support.",

You just breathe and tackle each obstacle the best way. This is a great site to look up questions and answers. Your are now a warrior! Congratulations on having a daughter, because she will give you strength. Just remember it is okay to be scared and have a dark time but there is light out there keep reaching for it. Keep a journal. If you are married I recommend the book for your hubby: breast cancer husband how to help your wife. If you don't have a hubby, I would get the book get me through this!",

I had a wig, but the chemo hot flashes were horrible. So I figured it was better to go bald or remove a hat then take off my wig at the table in a resturant. When I started getting my fuzz back I still just let it happen. I use to have straight fine hair, now I have some Curly Fro'. I'm 10 months post chemo. The curls are thick. My oncology surgeon has assured me that this hair will fall out and I will get another type of hair. I'm starting to embrace the curls and had to by shampoo for them, but I miss my other hair. ",
