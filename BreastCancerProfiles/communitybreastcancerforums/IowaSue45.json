Also new shampoo my sister says makes her hair grow faster, she said it makes her hair need a trim in 3 weeks instead of 6 wks. google it  Biotin B complex shampoo. Can someone tell me how to paste my pic. on here. I have used nioxin for a year or 2 cause I have naturally thin hair, it is probably time for me to try something new. Another tip for straighting is try a blow brush, I have the one from walmart by con air and it comes with 2 size brushes and it works great, it did for me prior chemo any how. I should have kept up on my cosmetology licenses I would have even better tips. I'm am surprised that is something they didn't teach much on was hair loss from chemo.",

Semi permanent or a 30 day color is not as damaging as permanent color but would probably need to be use more ofter than permanent because we wash our hair every day. I think the perm. color is hard to use on short hair because it is not suppose to be on the scalp and with such short hair how do you keep it off the scalp while applying? The daily rinse will get you some color until it is long enough to put on the perm.color.",

      "Content": "Mar 14, 2011 06:16PM IowaSue45 wrote: Carol- Temporary hair color is available in various forms including rinses, shampoos, gels, sprays, and foams. Temporary hair color is typically brighter and more vibrant than semi-permanent and permanent hair color. The pigment molecules in temporary hair color are large and cannot penetrate the cuticle layer. The color particles remain adsorbed (closely adherent) to the hair shaft and are easily removed with a single shampooing. Temporary hair color can persist on hair that is excessively dry or damaged in a way that allows for migration of the pigment to the interior of the hair shaft. It lasts for about a few hours to 1 day. Semi-permanent hair dye has smaller molecules than temporary dyes, and is therefore able to partially penetrate the hair shaft. For this reason, the color will survive repeated washing, typically 4-5 shampoos or a few weeks. Semi-permanents contain no, or very low levels of developer, peroxide or ammonia, and are therefore safer for damaged or fragile hair. However, semi-permanents may still contain the toxic compound p-phenylenediamine or other such ingredients. The final color of each strand of hair will depend on its original color and porosity, so there will be subtle variations in shade across the whole head. This gives a more natural result than the solid, all over color of a permanent dye. However, it also means that gray or white hairs will not dye to the same shade as the rest of the hair. If there are only a few grey/white hairs, the effect will usually be enough for them to blend in, but as the gray spreads, there will come a point where it will not be disguised as well. In this case, the move to permanent color can sometimes be delayed by using the semi-permanent as a base and adding highlights. Semi-permanent color cannot lighten the hair. You can order it online from beauty supply. Or walmart, wal green, kmart. The daily rinse in wal mart is the same brand as the professional shops fanci-full they mostly light medium and dark, I think it would give the grey some color. Its only $5 so you won't be out much and you will probablly get several uses out of it. By the looks of you hair I'd get a med. brown.",

It is still a little chilly in Iowa yet. I take it off when I get home and when I go sit outside I get kinda chilly without my cover. I have a couple of scars on my head too so i want them to be covered befor I go without. I hate that it seams to stop getting length.",

Does it start out thin for most people then thicken up over time? It seams on the thin side. My eyebrows were almost gone and the the started coming right back it, thick of course. Thx ladies as always on here everyone is so helpful. I do take biotin and I use Nioxin shampoo, I did use these before chemo. I have a cosmetologist license but haven't practiced for years. I am familiar with what is good for hair growth and another thing is scalp massage. So next time you visit your salon ask for an extra good scalp massage.",

You can buy a daily color its just a rinse you just put it on after you shower Then there is a 30 day color but you may have to use it 1x a week because we shampoo daily if you shampoo less often it will last longer. But both of these are not damaging to the hair no chemicals. they will get you by until you can use the permanent. Just a tip.",

I have physically felt good the last two weeks. I am wondering if it might be the migraine meds. they gave me to take daily at bedtime, pamphlet says the med. is for chronic pain and anxiety (which I don't have anxiety), and I am always leary that taking med. for something I'd don't have and it having an adverse effect on me so I am wondering if it is making me feel that way. One more thing chemo pause? IDK I've been on my monthly since my last chemo tx just about 3 wks. ago..... I've been thinking STOP already!!!",

The other se that was a little worse this time was the bone pain, wondering if anyone takes anything that works for that, may be from the neulasta ? IDK after the 1st one I didn't have any pain, 2nd time some and this time plenty.  Shaving my head, I did it to myself ( I am a cosmetologist) I used the clippers with # 1 attachment and put a towel over the sink and counter tilted over and shaved from the neck towards the top, I used the attachment because I didn't want to irritate my scalp so I left just a little (after it was falling out a great deal) I did't want anyone one to see me without hair and still very few have, you wouldn't believe how long it was before hubby saw my bald head. As far as sex goes I might be able to have it someday if my monthly ever stops, I swear I have had it for a month now. I do see my onc. each time I have TCH and I said  thought it was suppose to stop and here I am with the never ending flo, geezzzz  all she said is it will. On a wonderful positive note, it was another beautiful fall day in Iowa 78 and sunny 2 days in a row and it does make a soul feel good!!! It is suppose to stay this way until Mon. !! YAY!! Camping this weekend, and its trick or treating at the campground, last year they had a 1000 of the lil cuties, I know my lil grandsons will be there. Chip up and smile girls we are getting closer to being done with treatments. ((BIG HUG))",

Idk about any of you but my nose has no hair inside and my eyes, just the lower lashes have thinned and when I wake in the am the outsides of my eyes are crusty. My nose runs most of the time and if its not it is really dry. I had 3-4 days of diarrhea took Imodium to get rid of it, this was after the 1st treatment onc. thought it was from nausea meds.(amend) not sure if that is how it is spelled its the expensive one. She stopped giving that to me and it hasn't happened again. It could be any of the drugs causing diarrhea or constipation it is all disruptive to the body, it is the bodies way of fighting off this poison. I defiantly can see the fatigue getting a little worse after each tx. If I didn't have a job to get up for there are at least 3 days I'd for sure stay in bed all day, but for this reason I wanted to keep working I think it makes me stronger to have to get up and keep moving. I hope each of you have more good days than bad. I don't really wish for any day to be over. I had a elderly lady in the nursing home where I work put this in prospective for me one day. I was wishing for summer to hurry up and get here and she said I don't want it to hurry up and get here, when I asked her why she said she doesn't want any day to hurry up and be gone because that is one day closer to the end. I was like omg that is so true. So never again have I wished for another day to hurry up get here, I just want to enjoy every day god gives me. I am looking forward to the end of treatment and everyday in-between.",

Since my appointment Fri, I found 2 of the good stuff (non generic) and they still came back after the meds wore off. I am just waiting it out hoping its just a long hormonal headache. I still get my monthly here and there and when it was normal Id get migraines lasting 2-4 days at the most like clock work, does any one know if estrogen goes up or down at that time of the month? Wondered if it is hormonal if they could give me estrogen when I have headache or stop my estrogen to stop the headache idk but its wearing me out. Try dealing with 5 kiddos and a month long headache lol I have a super high pain tolerance (non aspirin does nothing for it at all) but its like a toothache and gets annoying after awhile.",

My migraine meds. maxalt helps so that I can at least think straight it is not a pain med. it works on the blood vessels in the brain make blood flow better. There has been some nausea feeliing. I am going to the chiropractor tomorrow, a different family Dr. that I thoroughly trust in a neighboring town Tue. my 6 month check up is Fri. I never have a problem with them believing me my problem is that is always the 1st thing they was to do for my is scan.Unlike a ladie here in my town who I have befriend through bc and she is actually has her2 also. last spring she had headaches and keep telling her Dr. and they scanned and told her she had bone spurs on her skull 4 months later she collapsed on her floor was rush to the hospital and surgery for a baseball size tumor in her brain. This is her 3 go around with bc she actually had it when she was 33 and it didn't return for 22 years and not she has been fighting for 3 years and they have given her 2 wks. now. So I have goggled her2 and brain mets. I sure didn't like what I read .Wish me luck this wk that the solution is found and resolved. I will have my eyes checked to but I think it has been less than a year but it still could be and that would be a simple solution. You are right Lizzy I rarely whine and I am feeling pretty whinny uggg I hate the worry ever time we turn around. I had those dam fat balls at first that I had to worry about. The little sores I have haven't healed either.   ",

I was hoping to get started this spring maybe 2 months after radiation but, my port is kinda low and a little in the way so she thought it would be better to wait until I am done with herceptin in Aug. plus the recovery time for DIEP is a good 2 months and I don't want to be recovering in the summer, I have a date of Oct. 18th. I'm a little sad about waiting that long, but I know it is for the best plus it will give my skin time to heal from rad.

Woke at 1:30 ( which isnn't unusual) but for whatever reason started feeling my bc mx side and I'll be dammed if I didn't find lumps at least 3 in my pectoral area just before it turns into my arm pit. So I couldn't sleep had the major fear of death gripping me again. Called the family Dr. at 8 and was in at 9. He felt them and told me to get to my bs and I go in Fri. at 12. If any of you remember I had a lump removed back in Oct. it was a lipoma. So I am saying extra prayers again that it is anything but the big C. This disease is going to drive me crazy, I was doing so good moving forward and not thinking about it.",

I am going to wait til the last chemo Dec. 2nd to see him because he is an hour and a half away. I guess after I had the ultra sound results I wasn't worried but after seeing the onc. she seamed a little concerned. Do you even think it is possible for a tumor to start while your having treatment? That doesn't seam possible. But when you think about it why is it more likely to show up in the first 2-3 years after treatment then later down the road. Don't you think that should be the other way around, like you should be more protected in the 1st few years after tx? Idk seams strange to me and hopefully if it nothing. It sure does scare you to feel something else.",

I really can't wait for the last one Dec. 3 Yippee!!!  Today my onc. felt the lump I found a month ago she said we'd keep an eye on it. It less than an inch from the original tumor and she said I should go to my surgeon and have him investigate so next Thur. I go see him. Really hoping it is nothing but inflamed tissue or something very simple. Onc. says it feels usually, so she didn't give me big hopes. But I keep telling myself it can't be cancer because I am getting treatments. So wish me great luck next Thur. I really can't believe I even have to think about this so soon. Then at treatment today there was a lady starting chemo because of 3 new spots and she just finished chemo in July. cancer Sucks!!!!",

She said her doctor expected she had the most aggressive \"triple-negative\" cancer, but testing found that she had two of the three key hormonal receptors - estrogen and progesterone. She said the original diagnosis was \"slightly estrogen heavy,\" but this time it's a strong marker and she also has the second marker.

With bc cancer they don't consider you out of the woods ever because woman have had recurrence 20 + years. Anyone else been told this? I think once you have it there is always a slight risk of it coming back. Hopefully for the her2neu gals herceptin changes all this. Hopefully they come up with something for all others. I know a lady in the town where I live just had reoccurance after 13 years she is her2neu only but 13 years ago they didn't have herceptin to give her now she is getting it. It came back right next to a large vein in her neck and they can't operate on it because it is to close to that vein. For me I will be doing a lot of hope and praying for the rest of my life.",

She had lost her job a couple of years ago and had insurace through that employer. The most recent job she had she didn't get the insurance because of the cost. When she fell ill she didn't go in and didn't go in and by the time she went her family had to call the ambulance because her colon was totally blocked off by a tumor that had spread beyond the colon to her liver she has stage 4 cancer and the Dr. are surprised she is still here: ( I also had the last stage of the DIEP surgery done last week, I had the nipple tattooing done...YAY like the PA called it the icing on the cake.",

I did out smart one cost for breast care, about 2 months ago I had yet another lump right beside the bc area. This time it felt like 2 lumps. Went to the surgeon and ofcourse he wanted to cut them out. I said why cut them out if they may be nothing. Long story short they were then going to send me to the hospital for an ultra sound which usually cost me out of pocket toward my deductible 500- 700 dollars. Instead  I  found a place in a near by city that is a breast clinic I called and asked them if an ultra sound is billed and part of an office visit (which is just a co pay $15) and they told me yes. Had it done there they saw nothing suspicious end of story. Doctor at breast clinic said come back anytime you feel the need to check out a lump. Doctor also told me the tissue in that area is broke down due to  radiation and surgery in that area. I hope it was the right thing to do. Love all the show and tell pictures : )",

Like when I had the wig on in Fl. and even the 1st Bret concert with the cowboy hat on (because I had no hair) it just looks like my expressions so unsure, no big cheesy smile I usually had. I just thought my face kinda showed my uncertainty. DH and I road motorcycles to Co. end of June ( just happen to be when it was 100) we stayed in Estes Park and the church is just a few mile south. The picture of me and DH is in the church parking lot. I have been to Estes park 2 times before (by car) and both those time the Rocky Mnt Nt Park was closed due to snow. So this time I finally got to go through, it was so beautiful. This vacation I truly felt closer to the higher power than ever. I don't know if it was the altitude or the beauty of it all but it left me feeling truly blessed that I was able to have found bc early enough to survive it. One more fyi the lady in the relay for life picture with her arm around me is my daughter in laws mother and 2 years ago she was diagnosed stage 4 with a rare form of intestinal cancer plus has had 2 other kinds of cancer unrelated anyway she wanted me to do this walk. Last month she had a 3 month check up to see how her treatment was coming and they found that it has spread from her liver to her bones and she has been having issues. I am sad for her I just know she is probably on her way out. P. S. Lizzy I also caught the end of that show Parenthood ( never saw it before) now I am going to have to watch this show to see what happens to this lady.",

One of these days I'm going to have to start acting my age because I don't want to break a hip lol. I have to post a picture of our crew on wheels. You know I had my camera.

I swear I've asked this before and can't remember the answer. Thanks Say a little pray for me today (Fri) I have a Dr. appointment for a sore that has been on my arm for a couple months, just dawned on me this am that it could be something . Plus I have been waking up each morning this week with big headaches. Ginger- so sorry to hear about that fall I hope you are feeling better. A lady I know through my sister just lost her sister because she had influenza had went outside to let her dog out got dizzy fell and hit her head. Long story short she later went to convenient care for the flu they sent her to the hospital she was admitted and later complained about her head hurting and they told her that's cause you fell she complained more so they did a cat scan she went unconscious and then died so sad and it can happen so fast. Lizzy- my middle daughter lives in Waterloo. Debbi - glad you got that over with. I lucked out with my stage 2 had no pain even from the lipo. They really could have take more than they needed, I would have appreciated it greatly. I didn't have the nipples made (kinda wish I would have) just the nipple tattooing, which I am still trying to get my insurance to pay for ! GRRRRR",

I knew if your calcium was high it could indicate bone mets and I thought one was for liver enzyme but whatever else I had no clue and I don't think they check me tumor markers for some reason I don't think they do tumor marker for just her2. I will ask the onc. Fri. when I go. I had wondered just how important the blood work was because of the ladies I know personally that had recurrence when I asked them if it showed in their blood wk and they all say the same nothing showed in the bw. I also remember when I was having my first and only mam mo and biopsy why didn't they just check my blood lol because I thought they could tell from your blood. I worked a few years home health and hospice and an elderly man was sick and they did blood wk and all looked normal but a couple months later he has end stage liver cancer died about a month later. I'm not so sure it tells them much. I'm head feels better today not all gone but better. You know how that goes you make an appointment and it goes away before you get there lol plus I called eye Dr. and the 1st  opening is in 2 wks I told them I'd take it.",

Mayo had sent the bill to collection after I had been talking with them monthly about the appeal errr. So then I called the insurance co. and they said it had been approved the day before but could take up to 30 to process it all. I have been so frustrated with both. Anyway good news in the end. I guess sending before and after photos of my breast paid off. Have a good week ladies.",

I have suffered with migraines for years but they usually last 2-3 days and were with my cycle and since chemo 2 1/2 years ago I have had less of them. My migraine meds. help lessen the pain of this headache but if has never gone completely away in a whole month. I am trying to stay positive and not run to the Dr. because I know she would scan and if just a hormonal migraine Id just a soon not pay for another scan.

So calming there.You all know I love it there. Kinda odd it is where I was out on the boat when I got the call it was BC. Dr. did ask if I wanted to come to the office to find out the results or on the phone i was ready no matter where it was, radiologist insinuated it would be abnormal. But it is still my favorite place to be. Hard to believe sometimes that was a year ago in June. So glad to have had this place to share so much with such wonderful amazing ladies!!! Thank you all for so much.",

Early spring I kept feeling a sensation under my armpit but in the bra area and one night laying in bed on my side I just was feeling around wonder what was bugging me there thinking the tag on my bra or something was causing an irritation, I felt 3 small lumps on the outside lower part of me breast. I couldn't feel them if I was doing a traditional breast exam I had to be on my side before they could be felt. Well I started goggling and read sometimes you may be lumpy around monthly  and most of the time it is not cancer so I kinda put it out of my mind I had my youngest daughters graduation coming up in May and was very preoccupied with planning that. After graduation one day it dawned on me oh yeah there were those lumps, I felt and still there hmmmm I call a random Dr.(female) that I had never been to because I am health I really didn't have a family Dr. June 10th Family Dr. for lumps June 11th mammo and ultra sound June 14th Biopsy June 18th told it was IDC  3 tumors size 5mm 5mm 8mm plus multi focal specks June 21st off to surgeon June 23rd I decided bmx June 29th 1st onc appointment ( I didn't care for him so I ask for a different one) July 1st bmx I took 1 wk. off work for this July 23rd 2 onc Dr. Amy Krie ....love her !!! treatment TC xs 6 herceptin for a year possible rads. after TC reconstruction tram flap spring  ( March )at Mayo clinic July 29th echo Aug. 3rd brain mri ( no cancer there Yeah!!!)

I didn't like the 1st one I was sent to he rubbed me the wrong way and he question things the surgeon had told me, and I thought the surgeon was awesome. I asked people I knew that work in the medical field and other who have had breast cancer, with this I was lead to the awesome onc. a lady 40ish that only does bc. She takes her time and is very patient. She gave me 3 options and let me deside what I thought was best and she did tell me if I was her friend she would suggest the most aggressive treatment. I'm having TCH, is this the same chemo as your TC??? Herception is not chemo. I do think you should have  options so you can make the best choice for you. Also  down the road you don't blame the Dr. if it comes back if they decided not to do everything. I would have went with the most aggressive treatment because that is me same reason I had bimx.",

I agree the hardest part for most of us seams to be chemo, Lucky for me that had been pretty doable can't wait until Dec. to get that lasr one out of the way. I had a bilmx and the recovery wasn'tso bad , I was out to wal mart ( LOL yes I shop  there) and to get groceries. I didn't miss the boobs at first and even thought about not getting reconstruction, but seriously I'm tired of wearing mastectomy bras the double one are heavy to lug around, I know my own were not heavy. So I too will be having reconstruction. hopefully spring time. I want to be done in time for summer, I have to get back out and ski. Thinking of summer already when we just had 4 in. of snow : ( I know i need to live somewheere warm!!! I am thinking DIEP will be the surgery for me. I have appointments up the ying yang over the next 3 wks. BS( for this lump) Thur.18th, herceptin Fri. 19th, Tue.23rd radiologist onc. Fri. 26th herceptin and finally last chemo Dec.2nd. That in itself is exhausting. I am hoping the radiologist says no radiation, that would be no fun to try to get to appointments 5 x5  in Jan. in Iowa, but if I have to I will be there!!!  I hope everyone gets back to normal real soon!!!",

Another scan is going to start toward a new deductible, so frustrating!!!! Good luck Lizzy!! I hope all you wonderful ladies had a great holiday this past week.

I have a little insurance problem I am going ask for your input or experiences like this. I had nipple tattooing done (in Rochester MN at Mayo) on my DIEP breast and the insurance didn't pay for the bill. I have called both the insurance company and hospital at least 2 xs. Insurance say it was the coding and it falls in the (other) category. The hospital resubmitted with a letter of explanation on what was done and I'm still getting a bill 5 months later for $1500. It is part of the reconstruction and I don't understand what is so difficult. Any ideas what I should do? Anyone else have their insurance go up after cancer ? My insurance is through my hubbys job and they have just 6 employees and they raised it for all not once but 2 xs now in a year.",

Wonderful lady dr. spent an hour and a half with me, she was really awesome. Unfortunantly she recommended radiation for me. She said that a margin of 1mm isn't even considered a margin. She said that was to close to my rib to risk the chance of cells being left behind, up to a 20 % chance, so I guess I know where I stand now with radiation. I was sure hoping to hear that she was a 100% sure no cells where left behind and  that I could get on with life and just have herceptin every 3 weeks. I probably wouldn't mind so much if tx was closer to home, it is 35miles one way and In Jan. Iowa winters can be horrible, last year we had a insane amount of snow. So just being able to make it everyday will be a trick. I am just a little bummed out, but sure I will survive this too.",

I ordered a wig, a few hats and scarfs, I'm not going to open them till it is falling out in chunks then I will probably just take the clippers and shave my head myself.  I am just wondering if everyone else is using the medicine they prescribe like the steriods, sleep medicine, and nausea med.?

When I had surgeries I kid you not I'd eat 2 whole pineapples the week before and as soon as I got home I'd eat one a week. When I went go for the follow ups they were literally amazed by how well and fast I healed and I'd say it was the pineapple and they'd just look at me like I was crazy and that was true for mastectomies and DIEP.

Lizzy, I just read your post about the bracelets today and last night I sent 41 of the bracelets I made with my SIL because she wanted to take them to her job and sell them. Funny thing was I thought to myself good idea sil maybe you can sell 5 or 10 of them. She sent me a txt at 10:15 am and said she had already sold 15 of them. Then I got a message at 2:30 that she had only 8 left lol I about fell off my chair. She said they are a hit get to making more. I knew I should have taken a picture of those bracelets before she left with them but then I thought a good part of them would come back. When I get some more made I will get a picture.

This is so strange to me who's eyes improve at 47? Keeping my fingers crossed that this is what was causing headaches. Eye Dr. said very well could have esp. because they were being over corrected. My last eye exam was just last June. I asked her if the good vit. and minerals and organic food would make my eyes better and she said most defiantly could.

That could have been from the minor cold I have, not sure. After herceptin and rad. tomorrow I leave for Mayo clinic in Rochester, MN for a reconstruction consultation Fri. 7:45 am. I am hoping to have DIEP. Happy to be heading to the finish line. I do have to have herceptin until Aug. But I do see the finish line. My radiation I set up for 4;00 pm everyday, I have continued to work all through tx missing only 1 day due to not feeling well other than that I have only missed for appointments and even then I try to have them late in the day. Hope you all have a happy and se free rest of the week. Hugs and prayers to all!",

I have 5 reg. mx bras 3 of them are underwire, and 1 sports bra. The sports bra is the most comfortable and it looks like a tank under my tops. When I look for this brand online they are $48. pretty spendy, so wondering what everyone else wears. Thanks.",

I wonder if shaving it til it comes in darker would help? I have a cosmetology license's, but they never taught us much about hair loss from chemo. There are good shampoos and vits.for hair growth and scalp massage is also good for stimulating hair growth.",

      "Content": "Jul 12, 2010 01:48PM - edited Jul 12, 2010 01:50PM by IowaSue45 Hello, I am also part of this July group. Age 44 I had a bilateral mastectomy July 1st 2010 and back to work today. I can tell you I had no pain after surgery some soreness in the arm pit area but not bad at all. I did not have reconstruction at this time. It was hard last week trying to figure out what to wear, make sure you have button shirts on hand. I really didn't care for the camisole the hospital gave me however the pads in them work great in sports bras much more comfortable. I have noticed on these message boards that there are quite a variety in the way the treatments go. Kinda wonder why this is? My plan is surgery, radiation, chemo and herceptin. Is this normal? Should I be questions this treatment plan? They are waiting a month to start radiation so that will start around the 1st of Aug. Just wondering if this is the plan for any of you or a different pattern. Thanks Ladies I appreciate your feed back.",
