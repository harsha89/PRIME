I keep telling myself it will be great once I heal then I can go running and not have to worry about bras. :) I'm actually contemplating not even doing the reconstruction at all. I know I have to wait 6 months before PS will even attempt at another go of reconstruction. We shall see. I have a lot to think about.   Hope everyone else is doing well! :) ",

I'm here now because I am just so frustrated and no one else really understands what I am going through. I need to talk to women who have experienced the same thing and can understand. I had a BMX May 16 (prophylactic left side) nipple and skin sparing with immediate tissue expander placement. The nipple/skin sparing was a disaster from the beginning. Both nipples and skin became necrotic which lead to a second surgery 3 weeks out to remove the dead tissue. Here we are 3 weeks post the second surgery and I find out today that my body is rejecting the tissue expanders (inflammation, necrotic tissue, drainage, etc) so I will be scheduled for the 3rd surgery next week or the following. Ugh! I'm just ready to get this over and done with so I can move on with my life. I also found out during this whole ordeal that I have a 2.5cm stone in my gallbladder so will need to have it removed as well. I consider myself an optimistic person but today I am filled with self-pity and doubt. It's okay to feel sorry for yourself every now and then, right? *sigh*",
