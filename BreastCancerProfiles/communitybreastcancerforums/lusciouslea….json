I'm grateful this was caught so early allowing me to pursue this path, and that the final reports came back with only one other precancerous lesion. Thank you for the kind words and thoughts of healing. What type of surgery is planned for you?",

This was back in March, which led to BMX for me last week. IT started with calcifications on the mammograms. Once pathology examined the other side from the MX, it showed ALH, which wasn't caught on mammograms, ultrasounds or MRIs.",
