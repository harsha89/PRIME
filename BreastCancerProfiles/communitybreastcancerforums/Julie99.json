It may have been there for some time but not detected until Sept when I felt it. I don't have all the diagnosis yet but feeling terrified and shocked. It comes in waves of trying to stay positive and trying not to collapse on the floor in anxiety. My father passed from leukemia very quickly just 2 years ago and this just seems unreal. My husband and 12 year old stepson are my world and want to be with them for many more years but fear the worst. The nighttime is so hard as I sit here at 3am typing this. Reading all the posts is incredible really and everyone sounds so strong. I want to be strong like so many of you! Dx 10/11/2013, ILC, 5cm, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

BikerLee, it's so good to hear about you exercising throughout your treatment that way. I have a trainer thing for my mountain bike and an eliptical in the basement. That gives me hope. Curlylocks, Michele, no family history for me either. My mom has fibrocystic breast disease and we wrongly assumed that mine would be likely the same. Now I have to break the news to her - haven't been able to do that yet. No, not the time to be the hero as you wisely said Rozem...hard to let go. Although I take anti-anxiety meds, maybe I didn't know true anxiety until now. Puts things in a much different perspective. It is inspiring to see so many of you with time and years of overcoming this. It's hard to see that for myself right now. I'm sorry that any of you ever had to go through this but I'm truly in awe of your support. So glad to find you. Sending big hugs back to each of you.",

It really makes me feel less alone, I haven't even told all my family yet. Some dark moments in the night. I am reading these after some sleep which was good to say the least. I've dealt with anxiety issues all my adult life and do take an anti-anxiety med already so that seems to help although taking more than I have in a very long time. It's not a med that helps with sleep but it can help in general. Funny really I had all but forgot about anxiety symptoms until the last month. I am continuing to read all your posts and so glad to have found you all too. Watch out you may hear lots from me! Feel stronger just knowing others understand. Thank you so much.",

I wasn't sure how the PM worked yet but glad you received the message. Good plan to focus on the treatment and not the worst...I need to do that too. Hugs back to you.",
