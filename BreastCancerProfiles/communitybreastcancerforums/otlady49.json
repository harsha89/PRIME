The side effects scare me the most, I feel like it is a trade off BC or possibly uterine cancer later! I have not decided yet, but I will look at some of the sites mentioned above and try to make an informed decision. I am Est Prog Positive,",

Thanks to everyone for all the input and good info",

I am either taking Benydryl or something to try to get some sleep or losing sleep and today I woke up so tired and irritated both mentally and physically, I almost broke down at my appt.  I am scared to try different creams, cause so far they have either made it worse or not worked at all.  I am frustrated and tired. I hope one of these natural creams everyone on here is talking about works for me.",

It has helped a lot, my skin feels and looks so much better, after reading all these posts, I told my doctor he had to give me something for the itching, He prescribed Atarax a pill which I am now taking 3 times a day along with the 1% cortison over the counter which has helped I dont feel so drowsy in the morning. I would highly recommend the My Girls Radiation Cream, wish they had told me about it at the beginning or even before, I am telling anyone in the waiting room and hopefully the nurses will pass it on. I start the boost tomorrow, 8 more to go, Yeah!",

If my chest is this bad now, I cant even imagine how it will be in 6 more sessions.  I asked him if then the rash will move to the lower part of my breast and he assured me \"no\" and that the other chest area would be healed He made it sound like \"right away\"  this forum has given me some insite that the doc and nurses surely dont. Do they just get numb to this hearing it over and over all day long? I had hives before and this is worse. Sometimes I want to scratch sooooo bad but I dont.  Thanks for listening and giving me a place to vent.",
