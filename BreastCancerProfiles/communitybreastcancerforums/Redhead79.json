I'm scheduled for a bilateral mx with reconstruction (expanders) on May 16th. My case was rare. I had abdominal pain I thought was my appendix. The CT scan revealed I had a spinal tumor (met from diffuse large b cell lymphoma), and my breast lump was discovered the night before my initial PET. I was ER/PR +, HER2-. Tomorrow, I'm getting a couple bras, size 1 diapers, and button front pajamas. I think I've got the rest covered. I am very nervous about my recovery - both mental and physical. Any advice is welcome!",
