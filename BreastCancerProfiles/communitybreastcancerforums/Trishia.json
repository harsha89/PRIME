Inversions actually help my flare ups.  Weird, huh?  My PT says it's because of all the scar tissue and fibrosis, that when I am in down dog it actually opens the channels and allows for better flow.  I can't plank on my hands anymore though...I have use my forerams, and I can't hold them for as long.  Same thing for push ups...I have to way modifiy because my shoulder gets fatigued so easily. ",
