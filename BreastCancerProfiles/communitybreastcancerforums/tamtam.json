I have tried to be sent to a specialist and they cant be bothered, my test results were sent to a general surgion here in town because I no longer have a Doctor and I asked him if he could refer me to one and he turned around told me to take my top off and he felt my breasts for about two seconds and said nope you dont need one (my mouth was hanging open) thats our doctors up here and at the point I gave up.  I have never heard of a bone scan? You sound like you are going through quiet allot of stuff? How do you cope with everything ? specially with the health care system we have here?  I tried asking my old doctor some stuff and he use to look at me and say \" who told you that? \" he never liked being questioned and he never liked if you asked him to be referred to someone else arrrgggg.... I do not have any faith left in any doctors around this area at all :(  I have seen and heard to many stories here that people have tried to push for there health issues only to be turned down and sent home only to find out later that it something far worse and to late and nothing can be done at that point and the doctors shrug there shoulders and say well if only we new earlier!  They just dont listen to anything we have to say :(  I will ask about a bone scan when I go for my Ultrasound on thursday and see if that exists up here or if someone will even listen. My aunt and my dad both had breast cancer and its still not a concern to anyone go figure. As for the MRI last time it showed what the mammo showed dense breasts and that it couldnt see through anything :(  so felt like i was back at square one :(  Thank you for the good luch wish :) up here I will need it lol, I  am sending you big hugs and wish you luck on your upcoming surgery, I am whining about doctors appointments and here you are going through so much more, were do you get all your energy from?   and how do you get around all the bs of doctors and appointments? big big hugs :)",

As for living far north your right lol I guess I was sort of raised like a hermit lol so the farther in the bush i am the more at home I feel (strange I know) but our cabin is only about 15 minutes from town although two minutes out of town is pure wilderness anyways hahahaha there is no way into our cabin  unless you have a four wheeler and a boat so its very isolated but you can your weekend of piece and quiet and only the animals lol   They would have to give me something to calm me down even to strap me, I am very claustrophobic I have even tried closing my eyes and tapping my feet and I just barely got through the test so the last two times they have to give me a little pill first lol. How do you cope with such a long wait to find out your results?  Waiting last year for my results almost drove me bonkers.  I am already nervous just going for the Ultrasound, I know its not painful its what I see and what they see that makes me nervous. They measure oodles of cysts and to my untrained eye they all look bad lol its the multiple complex cysts that make me uneasy.  I will keep in contact and I will probably have 20 questions once I get my results so you will hear me running to my keyboard before you know it lol Thanks so much for listening and I will be around :)",

I will ask about an Oncologist when I go in and next visit to the emergency department I will ask them if there is one this far north :) Thank you for the extra info, I know I tried to ask to be referred to a specialist and was turned down by the general surgeon its like pulling teeth to get anywhere here.  I know we have it pretty good where we don't have to pay anything plus I have my plans at work that pay for any prescriptions or extra costs if any but just sometimes I wish we could choose our own Doctor and if we didn't like them move on to the next one that would fight for you and dig deeper but instead I have doctors that greet you with stern looks and make you feel like \"what are you doing here\". When I went to make my Ultrasound appointment yesterday the women that made my appointment told me OMG you need a doctor and sent me to a place where my name can be put on a waiting list for a couple new ones coming here yippeee :) and that's if he accepts me I will cross my fingers.  As for the Mammo maybe after the Ultrasound and the MRI they may recommend one although I am not sure what good the mammo would do since it cant see anything through the dense breast tissue. I started my own file and keep copies of the reports I receive the past few years this way I can read them and say I am not imagining it all and I always like to read it over before I go in this way I can ask some questions  and that's if they will answer them or talk with you during the tests.  Marysden, being a single mom is hard enough and trying to do everything on your own specially if you are going through any type of scare is hard enough, Im not sure but sometimes being busy takes your mind of things. I know I am a thinker so give me some quiet time and my mind starts running all over the place. My teenage son keeps me on my toes adding a few grey hairs a day lol and my hubby has two young boys ages 4 and 6 soooooo all boys in the family and very busy but I try to keep it that way so i dont think so much. It took me months last time to try to push it to the back of my mind and not stress about it but it never really goes away, they are always hanging right in front of you day in and day out lol sooo you cant forget about them lol.  To keep my mind of things I try to go fishing or go to the cabin as often as possible but each person has there own way to de stress themselves and my is the outdoors lol.  Barbe, I wish they had a magic pill for energy or I wish I could send you some of what I have even if its only a little. I am sort of stuck at the first one to two steps of this process and you are already going through all the right steps. You said you have a Onc ? do you have to travel far to go see them? and do they look after you much better than a normal doctor?  The appointments up here can take just as long to get in to see any type of specialist months and months, the MRI has taken two months to get in and that's fine with me I don't look forward to the IV for the dye lol needles aren't my strong point lol and I also have to have an MRI for the head lol that one sucks..... the cage they put around your head is a nightmare for me lol  but its got to be done lol. If only we could pay the doctors to have a little more bed side manner that would be priceless :)  When I was younger I had lost a baby at 21 weeks my water broke and I had to go to the emergency department the doctor came in took one look at me and his words \" your baby's going to die\" turned around and left the room soooo believe me I know they don't care and they show no sympathy I should be use to it by now I guess lol.  But i did get a giggle out the Mcdonalds and french fries Barbe lol ",

I will keep in touch and ask some questions I am sure when I get the call, then after that I will go for the MRI in August. I will keep myself busy until then I guess lol  ",

I was suppose to go and get another check up within six months of my last visit and have put it off until now (stupid I know) but i found the last time rather draining and got no where with anyone medical personel up here and can say my bubble was pretty much deflated and left with more questions than answers arrrggg. But its that time again and I have to go for my Ultrasound this thursday and I have a MRI scheduled in August, Im not sure if the thoughts ever really leave your mind about what if's ? Testing every year sucks but I understand why it is necessary but do you ever feel like you go through all the steps and have all the tests done and then you still feel like you know nothing or cant get any further ahead? I have been going through this each year and the test results change a little every year but it feels I dont know anymore now than I did a few years ago . You go through the steps and motions like your suppose to do but does it feel like what good will it do if the doctors wont talk to you or push you aside making you feel like your just a number or that your being silly? ohhh Im from Ontario Canada I have no doctor at the moment so I have to go to the emergency department for any medical attention or appointments or perscription refills, so a new doctor each time I go and each one feels differently about different things. I went in last fall and was told by one doctor that read my results and said to make sure I go back in for the six month check up but I put it off for a bit just from the fact I felt flustered right? So i put it off until about three weeks ago and said ok the one year point is here I have to suck it up and go back in to see if I can get the appointments required and I did but not before the doctor on call tells me he does not agree about the appointments and makes me feel its a waste of their time and this is a doctor that hasnt read any paperwork or looked at my file and knows nothing about me arrrgggg. So the frustration already begins with just making an appointment ..........  I have had mammo grams, Ultrasounds, MRI with contrast and each will say something different, this time I have only requested the Ultrasound and MRI and we will see if anything has changed in a year I will keep my fingers crossed one more time and try not to get to flustered in the process of it all. I have very dense breasts, I am 46 years young lol have one child at the age of thirty and have many cysts and  multiple complex cysts in both breasts. To do a breast exam is like looking for  a needle in a haystack lol I have so many cysts I wouldnt be able to tell you if I had a new one or not and if I were to have them all removed I fear I would have no breasts left after lol Ok its not a joking matter but its the only way I know how to deal with it lol soooo you will see allot of lol on my typing sorry lol.   Let the fears begin.........   Log in to post a reply",

I'm 49 years young and I'm no stranger to the six month waiting club  I'm due to have my ultra sound in a month for an area on my right breast that looks like a honey comb, I also have very dense breasts and multiple degrees of cysts in both breasts as well I have microcalcifications in both breasts and the doctor told me a couple years ago that I have fibrocystic breasts. I have had mammograms,ultrasounds and a MRI. My bi-rads scores have started off being 0 to a 3 now, I was gearing up for my next appointment but during the wait time I noticed one day in the mirror when I was putting my pj's on over my head I just happened to notice a dimple or indent at the six o'clock position of my right breast. When I have my arms down its hard to notice and I have a 36D breast so they tend to hang a little 😕 but when I raise my arm there it is looking back at me 😱  Now this indent is a new one to add to my list of troubles in my breasts but my question would be is there anyone out there that has had these dimples and it turned out to be nothing? I thought perhaps it was old age and my breasts heading south might be the reason but it's only seen in one breast not both 😔 now the lump that I need to get examined again is a bi-rads 3. Would anyone be concerned about this longer looking indent and ask to move my appointment closer instead? Or not to worry much about it?  Any imput would be greatly appreciated 😊 Thanks so much  Tam Log in to post a reply",

I wanted to ask for a MRI, I had one done in 2011 as a baseline comparison but haven't had one since not from a lack of asking though. They wanted to exclude possibility of a tumor process. The dimple is longer and not completely round and it has a couple small lines along side of it. I do feel stabbing pains sometimes in my breast and the last month my nipples have been sore ? Not sure what to make of it. ",

I have had one cyst removed about 6 years ago and it was B9. I to do the google but in some strange way what I have learned had made me feel better at least I know a little more so when the doctor will talk to me I will have a bit more understanding of what he is talking about. At least I will feel prepaired for the worst and if it turns out ok and is B9 then I can say I learned a little more for the next time. I send my thoughts out to all of you and wish B9's for all but know your not alone and I too am playing the waiting game and i am just as scared and I guess each one of us handle it differently but having this site and everyone sharing there unique stories helps us all feel a bit better knowing were not alone.  Its hard to talk to family and friends about it but coming here you know there are others going through the same fears, thoughts and a roller coaster of emotions that only we can understand.  Thank you all for being here it is a comfort to know that we are not alone :) ",

Post Gadolinium enhancement as well as subtraction images show moderate amount of background parenchymal enhancement. Sensitivity of the study is diminished as a result of this.    No focally pronounced areas of enhancement  are identified in either side. T2 weighted sequence shows bilateral scattered cysts all of which measure less than 1 cm in greatest dimension. Axillae are normal No other findings. IMPRESSION: Moderate amount of background parenchymal enhancement diminishing sensitivity of the study. No focal abnormality is detected. Bilateral benign cysts are seen. Also please note that low or intermediate grade DCIS may not be detected by MRI. BI-RADS 2 Ok I just wanted to ask your opinions about this before I go see the Doctor today after lunch and if I should be asking any questions?  I find some of the stuff written on the report makes me feel a little less than satisfied because when I have my Mammogram it reports the same thing. I know I have very dense breasts and the mammo doesnt work well but isnt the MRI telling me the same thing that it cant see everything ?  On the Ultrasound it shows multiple complex cysts and many in the Axillae but the MRI shows nothing in the Axillae?   I should be happy with this report right ? but it feels like its giving me cautious news and goods news at the same time?  Your opinions would be greately appreciated and if you think I should push for further tests? or ?    Any help would be great  Log in to post a reply",

Why do I feel so frustrated right now? ",

      "Content": "tamtam wrote: Hello everyone 😊 I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me understand my MRI report that I received today. This is what's written: Post enhancement sequences show moderate background parenchyma like enhancement. T2 weighted sequences shows multiple bilateral scattered cysts all measuring less than 1cm in size. On post enhancement sequences there is a 7 mm enhancing mass in the upper inner quadrant of the breast and an area of non mass enhancement possibly a 5 mm enhancing mass with an adjacent non mass enhancement or vessel seen just superior to the nipple at 12:30 o'clock position. An ultrasound examination of the left breast will be arranged for the patient together with what will now be a diagnostic mammogram.  Impression: No suspicious abnormality on right breast. In the left breast however there is a small enhancing mass medially and an area of non mass enhancement just lateral to the nipple line. Further assessment with mammogram and ultrasound examination is warranted. Right breast- BI-RADS 2 Left breast- BI-RADS 0 Over the years I have gone through many ultrasounds and mammograms and MRI's for cysts and complex cysts and I've become use to them and don't worry much about them but this one is different and this has never been stated on any of my other reports before so I am a bit more concerned.  I would like if you could share your opinions or knowledge on the above report and what was the outcome as well as clarifying the report in laymen terms 😔  Thanks so much for taking the time to read and respond to my post it's greatly appreciated.

I go for the Mammo and Ultrasound next Wednesday hopefully I will get some answers in a few days from that. I had a mammo and Ultrasound about 6 months prior to that and nothing bad showed up then. Could a type of cancer show up within six months that wasnt there before? ",
