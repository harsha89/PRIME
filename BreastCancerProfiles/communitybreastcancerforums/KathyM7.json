Fortunately my skin took it well, but I'm still dealing with the fatigue which I agree is not a \"sleepy, nap helps\" kind of thing. It's more like a very emphatic internal command: \"this body isn't doing anything right now but sitting or lying down\". I also am still feeling some tenderness, tightness and just weird feeling like I need to support the breast. I was finding it all depressing and not helping with the emotional recovery. In the past week I've had follow up appts with surgeon and radiation onc (who have both been terrific) and felt much better when they told me that's all within normal expectations. They told me some stretches to do for the tightness. The rad nurse told me it can take up to 18 months to fully recover from radiation!! I hope not - I'm impatient after 3 months!",

Then they leave the room and the x-ray is the first thing. Usually then the table adjusts, presumably by the techs as they watch their screens (which they showed me on the first day). Then on to the actual treatments. I don't like the idea of the extra x-ray but I'm guessing the amount of radiation is very low compared to the treatment rays. Also if it helps keep my heart out of range I'm good with it! I had an extra long weekend, since they take Easter Monday as a stat as well. I'm grateful that I have a little extra time to heal before my final 6 (2 regular, 4 boosts).",

It feels really good to be done, and very emotional - had a few tears when the machine finished the last \"shot\" and also when I rang the bell. I took treats for all the amazing people at the clinic. My boosts were just from one direction directed at the scar/tumour bed from almost straight above. I guess it depends where it is. I was worried about it aiming at the heart and asked about it: they said the boost rays (at least in my case) are electrons and don't travel very far below the surface. Hang in there ladies!",
