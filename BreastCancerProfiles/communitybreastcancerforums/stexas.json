The report said: There is a 1.3 cm irregular density mass with an indistinct margin in the right breast at 11:00 posterior depth 9 cm from the nipple. They suggested a second 3 D mammogram with closer up images and a ultrasound those were performed this week. The radiologist came in the room to talk to me and scanned my breast again after the tech did it. He showed me the mass and said it was small which meant it was found early but since it has indistinct margins and blood flow these make it concerning for cancer. I sensed a bit of urgency in his voice to get my biopsy set up. He said that the imaging showed NO node involvement. My biopsy appointment is next week. I honestly was not expecting this so I did not ask a lot of questions at the time. The report from those two test should be available for me to view by tomorrow. I find I can pick apart the reports better by reading them. My grandmother had a mastectomy and I have no idea what type of breast cancer she had this has been many years ago. My mother which was her daughter had a lumpectomy and I have no idea what kind hers was I never asked. That is the only breast cancer I know of in the family but both my mothers brothers had prostrate cancer. My dad had prostrate cancer and esophageal cancer and his mom had brain cancer. I appreciate any information anyone can provide and for some reason the thing that scared me the most on all this was the fact it had blood flow.

I have been going through some gastro testing & the radiologist asked me to put it on hold for now and concentrate on the breast findings. The abdomen ultrasound showed a polyp in the gallbladder that is 2mm. The bile duct had a small echogenic 3mm focus within the cbd without associated acoustic shadowing. I have learned I have diverticulitis and my esophagus is spastic and requires being stretched out while doing a EGD to check out the bile duct issue. I have been having choking issues so this was part of the reason for this gastro testing. I was in the middle of all this when my mammogram appt. came up and now I am on hold until the biopsy. ",

This correlates with the mammography findings. Color Flow immaging demonstrates that there is increased vascularity. No other suspicious finds are seen within the right breast.

I have tried pretty hard not to jump to conclusions but the mind starts wandering and here comes GOOGLE. I really want to see those reports tomorrow I thought it was today and was so upset when I realized it was tomorrow. It is like they hold them 5 days so the Dr has time to get in touch with you first. Funny thing is I talked to the radiologist at the ultrasound so I know the basics just not the details it might list. I am sure since my primary care dr ordered the first test that led to the other test she will be the one to call me with results of the biopsy. If it is bad then I start the next steps finding a surgeon and a oncologist. My mother had the testing done and it came back negative at the time she was quite relieved to know she would not pass breast cancer on to us. We just have so much cancer in our family.
