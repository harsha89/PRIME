      "Content": "Nov 10, 2008 05:37PM - edited Nov 10, 2008 05:39PM by Alwayssearching I had my bilateral mastectomies with tissue expanders on Oct. 16th.  In bed, I used 2 bed pillows.  I own a back rest pillow from Target and the little arms on it irritated my drain area so I did not use that at all.  The best recomendation I have read about getting in and out of bed was to buy silky/slippery pajamas.  I did not read that until after I was mostly recovered but it would have helped a lot!  Moving in bed is a challenge because you cannot use your arms like you are used to - so the silky pajamas would definitely help.  With regard to the recliner, I own one and love it.  But I did not sleep in it after my mastectomies.  I needed to lie down in bed for sleep and like I said above, the two bed pillows adjusted as I needed worked just great.  I did splurge on 2 new pillows prior to my surgery.  I found Calvin Klein pillows at Macy's for $9.99 and I LOVE them. Good louck with your upcoming surgery.  The waiting is the hardest part.  It will be very painful but only for a short period of time.  I am three weeks out and am really starting to feel good again!",

Thanks again, Sharon",
