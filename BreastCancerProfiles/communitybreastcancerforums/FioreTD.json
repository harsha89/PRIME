I keep telling my family that I'm not worried so it's nice to share my concerns here. You're suggestions are very helpful. I will write down everything she says because I do prefer to go by myself.  I really think I don't have anything serious but what worries me is that my PCP referred to a BS right away before even doing the US. It makes me think she is more worried than she pretended to be. Also, they gave me an appointmet very soon which is very rare haha.. Wow, I'm really overthinking everything! However, I'm very thankful she didn't ingnore me.  Thanks again for your encouragement and comforting words! ",

Now I don't know what to think or feel.  My intuition tells me there's something wrong because the pain is not normal and my PCP felt something.. But how to differentiate between a gut feeling and paranoia? Do you know what I mean? My family said: \"that's great, etc..\" But somehow it doesn't feel like that.. I hope the BS gives me some answers.  hugs! ",

The BS said my chest wall is inflammated (don't know why) and that I just have dense lumpy breast. Nothing to worry about! She told me to come back in 6 months. Even though I didn't like her I'm okay with what she said. I'm just going to be more vigilant! I feel so silly for worrying as much as I did!!  Thanks for all your support and many blessings to all of you! ",

I have no idea what the BS will say, probably I'm completely fine but should I bring someone with me to the appointment? I don't even know if she will have the ultrasound results by then but I worry that I won't remember anything she says.. Thoughts?",
