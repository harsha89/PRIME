Spoke to PS who I work with as an OR nurse and decided to have a mommy makeover. Oncoplasty in cancer breast to get rid of exsisting Seroma and a mastopexy on the left plus a tummy tuck. About 6 weeks post op cancer breast got red, swollen and enlarged. 8 weeks of antibiotics with no real significant improvement. Had a sonogram and huge seroma found. Was referred to Interventional Radiology and a drain was placed and initially 60 mL extracted. Drain in for 5 weeks. In addition, IR did 4 Scalaratherapy treatments where they inject Betadine into the \u201cdead space\" where the fluid collects to help close it up by irritating it Had the drain removed yesterday. IR docs said it was time. Output was 6 mL a day and all was fine for a few hours. Woke up at midnight to horrible pain and swelling. Breast super sore. Hard walnut size lump where drain was removed and skin red and angry. No fever. Have to take Tylenol and Tramadol to not cry from pain. Seeing PS tomorrow. Wearing tight bra and trying to massage but it hurts! Anyone have a similar experience? All my docs seem to be at loss. I've been out of work for weeks and really feeling depressed and hopeless. I'm really at the end of my rope. Any advice or comments would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
