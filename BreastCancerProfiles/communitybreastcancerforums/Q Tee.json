    "Content": "Q-Tee wrote: Recently, I noticed a small bump on my bra line. It is sore because my bra is right up against it. I had my first digital mammogram, and I was called to come back for additional films. I also had an ultrasound. The Radiologist told me that he did not see any signs of cancer, but he also suggested that I return in 6 months. I am still concerned, so I made an appointment with my OBGYN for July 1st. He has the report, and knowing my doctor and how thorough he is, I am sure that if it were an emergency I would have been there today. I want him to check it, and advise me as to what I should do, if anything. I am hoping that it is only a cyst. If there were any signs of cancer, wouldn't they have shown up on the mammogram and ultrasound? I am very concerned because my mom had breast cancer. Q-Tee Log in to post a reply",
