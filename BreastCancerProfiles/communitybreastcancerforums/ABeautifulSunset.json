They want to add keytruda to see if the stable mets will disappear on the new protocol. Here is my dilemma. 1. I currently already drive for one hour in each direction every four weeks for labs and my xgeva shot. Now I would have to go every three weeks. Keytruda is an infusion that takes thirty minutes to administer. 2. My side effects are currently tolerable. Not perfect, but I certainly don't want to deal with MORE possible side effects. 3. I've been on this combo for 18 months (I think 22 months is the average time to fail). I've never been NED on this combo, although I have been NED in the past. So,my time may be running out on this protocol. Adding an immunotherapy could potentially give me a nice boost. 4. I do have the option of radiating a single bone met, which could also potentially take me to NED, but radiation has its own side effects, and it won't help me systemically. 5. I COULD wait until I have some progression, and then decide to try it. I believe the trial will continue enrolling for another year. But, of course I would rather not progress. I would love some input from my community. Here is the link to the trial. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT027...

Now I have to decide if I tell people that it has come back. If I do, this will be the first time for them hearing I am stage 4, and they will definitely have strong reactions. My dilemma is, if I don't tell anyone, I cant really talk to anyone about it, or they might not understand why I am down, or not feeling well. At the same time, I don't want to deal with the reactions of people, and I don't want to bum out the room. And I don't want people looking at me like I'm going to die, although sometimes a little sympathy along those lines would be nice. You see I am very conflicted. Does anyone have any advice on this?
