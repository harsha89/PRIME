    "Content": "jesnort5 wrote: My nipple began to flatten and change about 10 months ago. The doctor found a 2cm lump just below the nipple and sent me for an ultrasound. I also have been dealing with a bit of bloody discharge (occasional drops in my bra). The radiologist said he wasn't overly concerned because of my age (30) but the changing nipple gave him pause. We skipped needle biopsy and I had an excision biopsy today. After the surgery, the doctor literally talked to my husband for about 20 seconds and said, \u201csurgery went well, we removed the mass and found the duct causing the bleeding. You'll get results in 3-5 days.\" He didn't stick around for questions and hurried off. Would he have told us if he thought it was cancer? Can a surgeon tell just by looking at the tumor? What benign conditions have a flattening/retracting nipple, lump and discharge? I am anxious with all the waiting, but also wonder if I shouldn't be concerned after my doctor acted like everything went well. Would love some insight! Log in to post a reply",
