My niece stayed on the couch by my side for three nights. I did not put my expectations on my husband. Hopefully, you have friends and maybe nieces, etc. that can help you do a few things. From the size of your bc, you may or not need heavy duty medication. I knew someone with a small area and grade 3, lumpectomy and tamoxifen for her. You did not give your age, and that may come into play in this relationship. I would definitely consult a mental health counselor who can help you figure out what is going on.",

What I have realized in my life, is that you just never know when the person you will eventually settle down with will come into your life. I don't know your food situation, but I think having some healthy foods prepared and frozen, would be helpful. You could just pull them out to reheat and have dinner in minutes. As far as surgery, my first reaction was to have a mastectomy and go right to implants. Only when I learned that the lumpectomy plus radiation has the same long term results, if not better at preventing recurrence, did I have a change of heart. If I would have had it in both breasts, then I would have gone the direct to implant route. But, your doctors will know everything before proceeding into surgery, except lymph node status. With both breasts maintained, I have mammograms which detect early changes. There are pros and cons to each, and really suggest that you visit the Lumpectomy Lounge on here, because the girls are wonderful on that thread.",

It will help keep swelling down and you will heal faster. My surgeon has just done her fellowship at the University of South California in onco plastic surgery. I do not have a scar. I did have radiation, and it went pretty well. I could not sleep for a month after, but Tamoxifen fixed that.

Since they know that there are positive nodes, the chemo and radiation should take care of those and any areas of infiltration. Doctors that are concerned about the long term consequences of node removal, are more conservative in how many are removed at surgery. Don't worry about the nodes at this point, that is what your doctors are for. Be thankful that they did not strip your lymphatic system. Many women suffer from lymphedema as a result. It is very natural to feel adrift and worried, as a matter of fact it is par for the course. When do you start chemo? Try to stay as active and as positive as you can, because it will help you get through the days ahead. Prepare meals for freezing, take some long walks (when recovered), get into some Netflix shows.

The only area of concern would be the use of Methotrexate with Tamoxifen. Methotrexate is an anti-cancer drug used off label for R.A. Methotrexate is a recommended to treat breast cancer, not prevent it. Lupus and ulcerative colitis are autoimmune deseases. You need a psychiatrist that is also a medical doctor and they do exist. The good news is that your bc was found early and is hormone receptive. What are your other choices for R.A.? You need a good gp that can break down all of your conditions and meds. When you had your initial radiation, your doctor most likely target your lymph node area and chemo would have caught it there too. You need a breast cancer surgeon and not a general surgeon. You are doing everthing possible to stop and prevent futher bc. Just knowing that you are \"all in\" is the best that you can do. Trust your doctors or get new ones.",

You have to eat regularly or use Ensure, Boost, etc. Is there a friend or relative that could provide company to you for the next few days. I think it helps to have someone around that you trust, so that you can just relax. I believe getting a diagnosis and having surgery are very traumatic to begin with. From the size of your mass, it looks like they took a good amount of breast tissue. It takes time for your body to adjust to having a part of it removed. It is quite possible that your nerves have been severed and will take time to regenerate. You are going to be okay. You are just three days out from surgery and have the strength to get online and ask for help. As my breast surgeon told me, \"you are not going to die from this.\" Know that.",

Being a mom, you probably have your kids eating healthy, so you probably eat healthy too. My advice 1) get a therapist first, 2) deal with the fear, 3) get an appointment with an oncological surgeon, 4) find out what type of abnormal cells you have (I have a hard time saying cancer.) 5) do research on the type of cancer and treatment. Chances are if it is rare, you willl get a brand new set of breasts that match and may need chemo (as the worst possible scenario.) Don't read more into what the doctor told you over the phone. They are not the surgeon and don't decide what is best for you. They deliver the results to you and your ob/gyn can help direct you to a breast surgeon. Many cancers are caught early today because of advanced technology and awareness. We are seeing alot more women and some men diagnosed early. If you have a sister or sibling that can take care of the kids for a while, give yourself a break to get your head around the situation. Can your mom come stay with you for awhile?",

Increased blood flow and a birads of 4/5 means that the radiologist saw something like a spiculated mass. No one that has been through breast cancer surgery/treatment/anti hormonal therapy, is going to sugar coat this for you. Go in with your eyes wide open and take someone with you that can take notes. Use this time wisely, because how you prepare yourself physically and mentally, can help determine surgery outcomes. Assuming that you will be diagnosed with breast cancer, increasing your stamina will help your recovery. Also, mentally focusing on how you will recover and having an idea of who can help you, can be very valuable. With 1 in 8 women (which I think is more like 1 in 5 women) getting breast cancer, we have between a 12 and 20 percent chance of getting diagnosed. Another tip that I have is to start increasing the amount of protein in your diet. Protein will help you heal faster, if and when you need surgery. If you smoke, stop...if you drink..stop. Both increase your chances of having breast cancer. Your lungs will have to be clear and meet a certain standard to have surgery.",

Keeping breast cancer in perspective .....it is a condition that can be treated....helps to calm the mind. Start educating yourself on lumpectomy vs. mastectomy. If you need a plastic surgeon, look for an oncoplastic surgeon. They can cut around the nipple to remove any mass, and stitch it back up. I have no visible scar from my surgery.",

I've been going to the same place all these years, however 6 different radiologists have looked at my films in that time and none of them felt it was suspicious enough to warrant a biopsy. I keep clinging to that as a positive sign, however they are \"general\" in that the center does all kinds of imaging studies so they do not solely focus on breast studies. The radiologist I am seeing now ONLY does breast studies at the oncology center and he is concerned, which then makes me nervous! With 6 radiologists concurring that your tissue was benign, I think that is a pretty strong positive sign on your part. The radiologist at the breast center has to look at everything under a microscope, that is their job. The other 6 radiologists have seen plenty of cancer in all areas of the body, and I would bet are well versed in spotting every suspicious looking area.

I feel really great, take 50,000 units of Vitamin D per week, walk almost everyday. Prior to ovarian removal, my iron was low, vitamin d was low, had to have iron infusions. Now my iron is perfect and no more cycles. Also, no more risk of reproductive cancers, or minimal risk.",

I think initially, we all want a bilateral mastectomy, until we realize there are other options with just as good, if not better outcomes. I know I originally wanted to just have my breasts removed, until I learned about oncoplastic breast surgery. I had one of the best breast surgeons who had just completed a fellowship at the University of South California. I had my surgery and 4 lymph nodes removed to check for node involvement. She got everything during the first surgery, plus great margins. My nodes were fine. I went through radiation without any trouble and now my breasts look exactly the same. You cannot even tell that I had surgery. I can't stress enough to know your breast surgeon and have an ongoing dialogue with him/her. My doctor called me several times to discuss exactly what we were going to do, and the type of incision that she was going to make. I had a say in the decision and it made me feel in control of what was going to happen to my body.",

Keep it private until your know more about your situation. As my doctor says, stage 1 or 2 are not life ending diagnosis, so react appropriately. #2 Get a counselor to help you deal with the anxiety and xanax medication. #3 Work on a hobby and don't focus on breast cancer. #4 Six months down the road you are going to feel differently than you do now, I promise. Then, if you want to tell anyone or be that shoulder for the next woman diagnosed, go for it. #5 Get walking with some \"groove music\" like Barry White. It is very healing. Don't stop walking until after your surgery, then rest a bit. Keep moving and get your blood flow going. #6 Cook ahead and freeze meals.",

No matter the outcome, you will be followed closely and that is a positive step. As a nurse you understand how people panic when something could be wrong. Walk as much as possible. Walking will clear your head and help get you ready if you need any surgery. Exercise also helps prevent breast cancer.",

Don't tell anyone, except immediate family in the beginning. You are in shock after the diagnosis and need to let it sink in a bit. I told very few people, and I am glad that I did. I don't want a million questions or pity. I feel fortunate that my bc was found on an annual mammogram. Your health is nobody's business but your own and you can choose to tell whomever you want. I warn though, once that information is out there, you can't take it back. When you are through the tough stuff, chemo, rads, surgery, meds, etc. then you can tell who you want to know. If you have chemo and your hair is a giveaway, then you might feel like letting people know. Personally, I would opt for cold caps to keep my hair if I had to do any chemo. There has been alot of progress in minimizing hair loss. I am going to have my ovaries, tubes and uterus out in 12 days. I should have been in menopause several years ago, but my body never started shutting down. I want to minimize my risks of too great of hormones circulating in my body. I was very high ER and PR positive, and want the choice of meds for the next few years without concern of endometrial hyperplasia or ovarian issues. Am I telling anyone about this? No. Just my immediate family and one friend. Good luck to all you ladies going through your surgeries this month. I know how stressful it can be, because I totally wigged out after my diagnosis. As one of my girls on a volleyball team said to another, \"we are in this together.\" Yes, we are. And we can do this. Yes we can.",

That being said many recoveries are similar whether you are a stage 0 or a stage II. The reason for the tight wrapping is twofold: first, to prevent movement and swelling, second, to prevent seromas which could lead to infection. My doctor, a fellow from USC, oncoplastic surgeon, wrapped me so tight I could barely breathe. I had minimal swelling, took only a couple of tylenol, no seroma or hematoma, no infection. My BS did the wrap herself and she is very petite. I wore it for 3 days and then switched to wearing 2 sports bras for compression. My breasts are nearly identical after the lumpectomy on my right side. My surgery was August 2016.",
