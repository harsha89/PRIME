They did the mammagram too and i will go to the doctor on Thursday or friday to get the complete results - am I okay? Is it normal for them not to look at the mammagram first? He said where is the lump and just looked around the area for a minute then said - can you feel it when sitting up? Show me. then ultrasounded the area again for a minute then said you can go?? opinions - I know I am trying to figure out the impossible but how important is the mammagram vs the ultrasound?
