Good luck!! ",

      "Content": "Oct 13, 2011 04:57PM - edited Oct 13, 2011 05:09PM by llm005 Hi Jerseylicious, After my first docetaxel (Taxotere) I ended up with febrile neutropina (fever, no WBC) and spent 6 days in hospital, 4 on intravenous antibiotics.  No source of infection was ever found.  It took a few days for the fever to go down, but it did in the end.  I can completely understand your friend's fear.  I was very worried when the antibiotics had been flowing in, but nothing was happening to the fever.  But it DID go down after a couple of days, would bump up again a bit, and then down again.  They kept me on the IV antibiotics for a couple of days after, and when I was sprung from the hospital, I continued on oral antibiotics for two weeks.  Apparently this happens to about 25% of those on docetaxel.  I had to take neupogen for my next two rounds of it to stimulate my bone marrow into producing WBC.  And I didn't have this problem again. I hope everything goes well for your friend.  Tell her to hang in there. ",
