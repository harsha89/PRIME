I could take 1-2 every six hours. I was taking one and not every six hours. I saw the nurse a week later and the pain was getting worse each day. She told me to definitely take 2. Then the pain was unbearable and I finally started taking 2 every six hours. I don't know how I could have survived with out doing that. I had to keep ahead of the pain or pay the price. I'm 9 days post rads and felt some improvement today!",
