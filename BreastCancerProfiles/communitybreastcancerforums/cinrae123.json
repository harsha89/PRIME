I see nothing wrong with going to the wig shop,,,,,,looking around,,,,,,,trying them on,,,,,,,,then just tell her you will think about it and be back.  Then go on line and find the same thing for cheaper.   I mean,,,,,,,,,why not?  With the rise in cost in everything,,,,,,,,,I am after bargains.  lol My insurance didnt cover a wig.........not sure why,,,,,,,,,,,guess all insurances are different. Good luck with your decision and I am sure you will find something. Cindy",

Is that a picture of you and your daughter?  How cuuuuuuuuute. I'm glad you will be finishing up your treatment soon.  Good for you.  Hard to believe that a few months ago we were in the midst of chemo huh?  I look back at it now and say,,,,,,,,,,,,,wow, Cindy, I am proud of you.  lol  Just as I am proud of you also and all the other ladies before me. I hope life is treating you well.  Post occassionally and let me know how things are going ok?  Nice to know that we all move on after bc huh?  I post occassionally on the site to check in with others, new ones and old ones.  I feel for those going thru this now and just want to lend them an ear and tell them that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Have a great week. Cindy",
