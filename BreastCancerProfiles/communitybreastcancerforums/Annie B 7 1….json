We are doing it through IV and I have a small track or scar from infusion 1, used a different vein lower on the arm for infusion 2 and by the end it really burned. Any tips for infusion 3? I'm thinking of asking them to use the back of my hand have any of you done this? Also- chemo or maybe steroids are making me moody and cranky. What's been helpful to you all with moods? Thanks",
