I went to see my GP on Friday after only finding a lump on Thursday and had convinced myself he was going to say it was nothing.  He did say that he thought it was a cyst, as it felt smooth and movable, but wanted to make sure.  I'm 41 by the way.  I am absolutely terrified! I know I have to be brave, but I am getting married a week on Saturday and this has completely overtaken my excitement about the wedding! I think I will be having a mammogram and US too. Whereabouts do you live?  I know exactly what you mean about overthinking it. I'm driving myself crazy going from one scenario to the next. At least we may have some more idea what we're facing (if anything!) tomorrow.  Your age has to be on your side, and 90% of lumps turn out to be benign apparently (I know, I should be telling myself that too ) Better to be safe than sorry! I've taken to wine and watching Sex and the City to try and take my mind of it tonight! Good luck! I'll be thinking of you tomorrow and looking to see how you get on. x",

I am having a glass of wine for you tonight (I'm not an alcoholic honestly, but I'm sure you will know what I mean when I say it's been one hell of a week!) Goodish news for me too - all of the tests say I have a fibroadenoma and the lump is benign but the Consultant wants to make sure (because of my age) and so I have to have a core biopsy at the end of the month.  So I'm fairly happy with that and he seems to be being very thorough which is good. So pleased for you",
