My father died of cancer when I was young, and now about 9 years later my mother (she's my whole world, we're as close as it gets) has just been diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer as of yesterday. I don't know how to deal with this. I want to be there for her as much as possible and stay strong and be supportive, but I am a mess. I've always feared losing my mother too young (she's in her early 50s) and I've been having a really hard time keeping myself together.Â  Can anyone here help me? I suffer with clinical depression and I'd really appreciate any help/uplifting words I can get. Thank you so much xx -Liz Log in to post a reply",
