I feel like it is pit acne.  it comes up from deep and leaves a large bump on my face.  I am too old for this.  Does anyone know what to do for treatment.  I have not had the chance to talk to my onc yet,  it started 4 days ago and is getting worse.  It started between my eyebrows and now is around my chin. ",
