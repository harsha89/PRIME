But #4 hit me so hard that I called my MO's office a week before number 5 and asked if I really had to keep going, or if they could lower the dose. The nurse encouraged me to speak with my MO before my next tx. I did and decided to go ahead with it (and completed 5 of 6 a few days ago). But even on the morning of I wasn't 100% sure what I'd do. I know a lot of us have difference diagnoses and different courses of treatment, and I applaud all the ladies that have to go through more rounds of treatment. I look forward to the future and coming on these forums to read everyone's stories on making it through the chemo. Sometimes I even read through threads of those who started a few months before me, just so I can get encouragement that chemo will end someday (whatever else may be coming after that).",

But I started losing my eyebrows after chemo 4 of 6 and they are completely gone now. I'm used to having thick eyebrows, so my face looks so different without them. I'm using a brow gel and powder to try to recreate them, but I'm only mediocre at it. I'm really hoping my eyebrows come back within the next week or two.",
