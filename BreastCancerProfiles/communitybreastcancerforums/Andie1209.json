Typically the imaging has to align with the sampling. My clip migrated 2cm immediately following my biopsy but the radiologist said there were changes to the mass post biopsy. I also took my imaging CD and pathology slides to a surgeon at a different hospital for a 2nd opinion. She said there were pictures of the needle going into the mass so she felt confident in their findings. I am so sorry you have to go thru all of these tests...I can\u2019t imagine the stress and anxiety! Praying you get benign results on the 3rd attempt",

Assuming you had your mammo, they rated it a 0 because they saw something that needed to be looked at via ultrasound and/or diagnostic mammo. You then had the follow up ultrasound and/diagnostic mammo, and they gave you a __? Assuming it's a 4 or 5...I've never seen 4/5. In order to do a biopsy, your score must be at least a 4 (sometimes they do 4a, 4b, and 4c). 80% of 4\u2019s come back benign. A score of 5 means HIGHLY suspicious of cancer",
