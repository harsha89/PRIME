    "Content": "ClareInChicago wrote: hi Everyone, I had been on the boards and posted my story of having breast issues since I was 34 years old (had ultrasounds, mammograms, etc.). Finally at age of 40 (this past May), the 3.2 cm mass in my right breast and a bonus mass under right armpit appeared in my screening mammogram. So on July 9th 2015, I had the ultrasound guided biopsy. Today, the results came back as benign. The 3.2cm cyst was aspirated (during ultrasound) and tested and was benign. The armpit lump is a small benign lymph node. I'm definitely happy with the results. I will not borrow trouble. Lastly but definitely not least, I want to thank everyone on here for your prayers and well wishes. You are some of the strongest women I've ever not met in person (lol). Reading the discussion boards here have helped me to not lose my mind these last 3 weeks. I will continue to read your stories and pray for your healing... xoxo Clare Clare Log in to post a reply",
