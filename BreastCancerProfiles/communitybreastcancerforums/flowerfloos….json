That doesn't make me very happy but it is what it is!  I would like to know the advantage for the patient for excisional over just MRI guided tissue bx? Have tried to find this online and haven't been able to. Wondering if they visualize lympy nodes during this proceedure. I also am wondering the difference between lumpectomy and excisional..why wouldn't they take good margins and look at your lymphs in one surgery??",

They were very accomidating and professional while at the same time very real and caring. It was explained to me that because of my breast size and extreme density, they needed to match each test to make sure they were getting the exact area seen on the MRI to biopsy. They had the top US tech there with a fellow breast surgeon and radiologist. They are concerned because the MRI shows a well defined mass but the US is very hard to find. AFter more than an hour of looking on the US, they gave up and said that they couldn't biopsy it this visit and would have to go to the MRI guided biopsy next week.They did quite a few mammos. After a while the US tech came back in and said she wanted to try one more time because of one area she had seen while doing the US. She found it!! I was amazed at her tenacity and commitment! So they put a beebee on my breast and took more mammos to correlate it.  After over three hours in there..they were happy with their correlation and scheduled the biopsy for Friday at 2. So I had that yesterday and they told me that in comparison with other patients I was in the top 3% of difficulty. They were successful and took tissue from 6 areas of the mass. It was actually interesting to watch. Then they sent me to have another MRI of the breast. I was so exhausted that we stayed another night in Menlo Park and drove home this am. I didnt' have any problems with bleeding and was so numb because they used so much lidocaine! Was numb all night. They will call me Monday or Tues with results. I feel so much better now that I have someone in charge of my care. I think I told you that my NP went on a 3 mos leave of absence in Feb right when I started going thru this.  I know that there was much concern by the radiologists and doctors there. I am trying really hard not to read into that and just be patient for the news. I am someone that can handle anything if I know what it is..it was just the feeling of no one taking charge of my care and I found that at Stanford. I would recommend it to anyone! Thanks for asking and hoping you are doing well! I have not read your story?? Flowerfloosey ",

This year I insisted (on a friends advice) that I be given a breast MRI as I had been told about my very dense breasts over the years but no recommendation to have an MRI by anyone. I had my mammo and then recall as there was \"asymetrical density\" and \"Architectual distortion\". They did more films and so I talked to the radiologist and he said it looks fine sent me a letter saying congrats! They did not do an US and I scheduled a MRI due to NP agreeing to order that. Low and behold there is a 3 cm mass that shows clearly on the MRI like a beacon in the night. I have contacted Stanford University Cancer Ctr and will see a BS and have a biopsy next week. The radiologist that read the MRI called me back for an US and it did not show up there either. He sent me a certified letter telling me to schedule a biopsy and see a breast surgeon in a timely manner. Very upsetting! I am a very high risk woman so there should be something in place to catch these ladies that really need MRI's. It is very scary and disheartening to think of the people who just believe the neg mammos!",
