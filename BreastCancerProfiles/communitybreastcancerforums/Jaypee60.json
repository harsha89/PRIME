I have bone mets and went through a month of radiation in May (Monday-Friday) which relieved the back pain but really tore my stomach up. In June I started Abraxane chemo, once a week for 3 weeks then 1 week off. I was only able to have two treatments then I must have caught a bacterial infection which gave me an awful case of stomach cramps, diarrhea. So when I went in for the 3rd treatment my lab values were too low and I had lost 8lbs in that one week. At the 4th treatment lab values were up but just barely and my Onc decided to wait another week which would give my body a chance to recoup and get me back on 3/1 schedule. Last week had chemo and things were fine until Friday night. I ate some left over mac and cheese and immediately knew something was not ok with my stomach. At 4am started have bowel movements which soon turned into diarrhea by Saturday. Eventually took Immodium on Sunday. By Monday everything seemed ok and trying to keep hydrated but today the stomach cramps are back with awful fatigue and cold,cold cold. No fever.Â  Does this sound like some food borne bacteria problem or what??? Any ideas??? Log in to post a reply",

They seem to come on the 3-5 after chemo. We brought refrigerator/freezer thermometers to make sure the refer was below 40F and freezer 0. Food borne bacteria grows rapidly above 40 degrees F and because our immune systems are not what they should be food bacteria can affect us much more quickly. Anything past 2 days old in the refrigerator I cannot eat. Now that I know what will probably happen on day 3 after chemo I go on the BRAT diet for diarrhea....bananas, rice, applesauce and toast..and if the diarrhea gets out of hand, Immodium. The slight temp probably means you have some type of infection going on, especially for 2 weeks. You need to talk with your Oncologist.",
