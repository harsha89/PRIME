I didn't think anything of it. My doctor didn't notice it. In 2015, the dimple was still there. My doctor didn't notice it. The notes for my breast exam say that the breasts are symmetric. NO THEY WEREN'T!!!! Two months after the exam, I find out I have breast cancer and this dimple is a clear sign of it. Color me angry that my doctor didn't even LOOK at my breasts when he examined me. My issue is that I went there and paid this man to examine me and look after my breast health.....if he wasn't looking enough to notice a dimple (like the one in Kirk Douglass's chin!) in my boob, what the heck was he doing? Did I pay someone $200 bucks to feel me up? Apparently, I did...because some impersonal groping is all I came away with from that exam!",

MD Anderson in Texas (where I went) and Sloan Kettering in NYC are the two two cancer centers in the US. Dimples don't usually develop and progress for no reason. There is a whole area within MD Anderson for Undiagnosed Cancer. I recommend you do it...for your safety and your peace of mind.",
