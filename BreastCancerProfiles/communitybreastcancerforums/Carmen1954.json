After the colour was put in, it turned out more like a strawberry/golden blond and did not cover the silver/white I had in the front.  She could have bleached my hair first, however, was hesitant seeing this was the first time I was getting my hair dyed after chemo.  She was concerned that the bleach would burn my scalp or damage my hair.  I intend to wait a few weeks and see whether I'll have it bleached or not - my hair will also be a bit longer then too - right now my hair is about 3\".  Hope this helps.",
