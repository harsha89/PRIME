I guess that's why I didn't sweat so much. Anyhooo, as it turns out. I did work hard. I simply didn't realize the basement temp (where the treadmill is) was so low. I do hope we get heat soon although the temps tonight aren't going to be frigid. Just below freezing. I suppose I can always treadmill in the night to build up some warmth.",

They can bunch, slip, move around and you'd be unaware until you wake up with a problem. Now having said that, I will nap sometimes during the day with mine on (20 minutes asleep perhaps) but I either prop it up on a pillow lying on my back or lie on my side with a pillow on my hip and my arm on top of that. Over the years (7) I've become fairly adept at sleeping and not moving my arm unless I'm awake and changing positions. I definitely do not lie on my affected arm.",

Despite no nodes being taken on the prophylactic side there has still been trauma done to the chest, there is risk on that side too.   ",

All I was told at biopsy time was that it was IDC, and about 3 cm.  It was after surgery I got the final pathology.........node involvment and hormone status.  Our imagination does tend to run away at times where every little (or big) ache or pain we figure is cancer.  This is a normal reaction.  But where you don't even know your node status...........that's what I mean by don't gallop ahead too much. I hope things get more sorted for you this week.  Once things fall in to place and you have a game plan you will likely feel a bit better.  All this takes time to sink in.  Gentle hugs. ",

This happened a long time ago but it stuck with me.  A friend (animal savvy) took her old dog to the vet to be euthanized.  He asked her why she had waited so long?  He told her she had waited too long.  The dog had suffered needlessly.  The vet was from the old school, and he tended to both her large and small animals and knew her well.  The story has stayed with me over the years every time I have had to make that fateful decision.  The pain in one's heart is almost unbearable but my motto has been 'better a little too soon than a little too late'. It's very difficult at times to let our better judgement overrule our emotions. Sending hugs for your aching heart.",

Kane, sorry about the flare.  This darned heat doesn't help.  I found my arm so uncomfortable today I had to take off my sleeve late this afternoon.  Tomorrow is a wrap day.  Blech!!!  (I can't seem to face wrapping in the evening so I wrap every third day, sleeve the other two days and wear nothing at night.)   Now that it's summer and the weather is HOT I still have yet to see anyone else with a compression sleeve on.  Even when I go to the hospital........I've seen NONE.   I need to marry my therapist. ",
