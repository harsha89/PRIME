My wife was recently (about a week ago) told to have biopsy done after having both mammogram and ultrasound done. Her primary doctor (internal medicine) seemed to suggest it's pretty forgone conclusion that she has the cancer. Does she? I'm very scared. I was told that many \"spots\" were discovered and the biggest one was less than 1cm. We will go see the surgeon next week for counseling (I guess), and don't know when he will schedule the biopsy. I guess we will know more after the biopsy is done. I'm just very nervous and scared. Nick",
