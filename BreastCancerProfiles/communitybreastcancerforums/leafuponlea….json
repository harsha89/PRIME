We are doing this alone and just beginning this journey, trying to stay grounded. It's great to know there are other young women of color out there who can relate. This message board is the first community I have linked with. My gf is going through emotions of shame and embarrassment and doesn't want me reaching out to anyone yet. However I think in time she will open up and realize how much we need this. For now, its just me. I will certainly be in touch. :)  Here is my blog: sweetlittlelightning.wordpress.com/",

She is receiving care at Robert Wood Johnson hospital. I hope it's good, I feel a little mad at myself I never pushed for a second opinion. They are expeditiously pushing her through testing and a treatment plan. If she can just be somewhere positive while she heals I will be able to sleep better. Thank you for your reply.  Here is my blog, I hope everyone can connect online perhaps in a blog network for support. sweetlittlelightning.wordpress.com/ Peace & Light Kristina",

I whole-heartedly agree about doing the cookbook, however right now... she's so down and out, she isn't exactly inspired. However I know this is just the beginning and I hope she turns around. The culinary school she was accepted to was a long time coming, she received a full scholarship for and it has something to do with timing... although I hope they will give her a second chance. Your idea of fundraising with local restaurants is a great idea! and thank you for mentioning the American Cancer Society. I will look into it. Tomorrow we visit her doctor for the treatment rundown, we also need a social worker. Tomorrow I will know more. Thank you! :)  Peace & Light* Kristina sweetlittlelightning.wordpress.com/",
