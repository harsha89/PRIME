I had my \"dry run\" yesterday, and am starting with radiation today...yesterday the radiologist wanted to see if they could do the AccuBoost therapy for my boost rads, and they said it would work, so today I start my first of 8 AccuBoost therapies, and then after that, 26 regular whole breast rads. I'm a little nervous, but also a little relieved to just start getting it done. I've \"lurked\" on this board quite a bit, so I feel informed, and ready. I hope. :) Hope everyone is having a good day!!",

I've been told \"all is healing up just fine.\" Sometimes it feels swollen, other times it chafes - and I don't know why. I find myself walking around and doing the \"chicken\" with that arm just to stop skin from touching skin. I have taken to placing a clean hand towel folded over twice under my arm at night so skin isn't against skin, and it helps the chafing sensation. Also, if I'm wearing a lose enough shirt, I will also put a clean, folded wash rag under my armpit and inside my bra to keep skin from touching skin. It has worked wonders on the chafing at least. I'm finding sleeping to be much more comfortable with the hand towel there (I live in Phoenix and sleep in cami's or tank tops). Also, they both help with sweat - I wasn't allowed to start deodorant again until today, and again, being in Phoenix, they help immensely.",
