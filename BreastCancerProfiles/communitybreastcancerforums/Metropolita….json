The results are astounding. I've gone from a painfully swollen neck to a painless, much less swollen neck. I can actually turn my head without pain. Of course there are some minor side effects but I'm told they are temporary. Dry mouth is one, for example. Salivary glands get shut down when the neck's radiated. Thankfully it's reversible once the sessions end. However, it is paramount to keep the mouth & teeth moist at all times, especially during sleep or else cavities set in rather quickly. Biotene left sample packets in my oncologist's office. They make this wonderful moisturizing gel for dry mouth, which does the job. I highly advise it should anyone have to do this. My dentist also gave me a script for a fluoride paste, which I've started using 2x per day in addition to regular toothbrushing with the Biotene fluoride paste. With radiation to the neck, come the mouth sores, so, Magic Wash to the rescue. It has lidocaine, so it helps do away with the pain when it gets unbearable. Two weeks into the treatment and with mouth sores I can only down liquids or puréed food. I've started using the blender more often. Plus with Tykerb on tow, my mouth has lost the taste for many fave foods. So, drinking lots of nutritious shakes right now. I think I'm finally going to shed all those unwanted pounds. As far as skin burns, my brilliant onco-radiologist recommended I apply Calendula lotion daily on the radiated area, and alternate with the cream they gave me. So far no burns. Then again, I'm only halfway through my 25-session treatment. Regarding the radiation fatigue, coming home after the daily sessions all I want to do is lay down & nap, but once the nap is over I wake up energized again. I'm thinking about getting back on my treadmill & walking for an hour again before the treatments. I hear it'd be beneficial. I'll keep posting any other updates here to worth sharing. Gotten used to the radiation sessions by now. The mask is not painfully tight anymore, and now that I know what the whirring is about, I can actually keep track of its movements around me, as it targets different spots in the neck. No longer a stressful situation. Again, I cannot say it enough. Aside from the minor & temporary side effects, I have become a believer of radiation as a weapon in our war. I'm getting my face and neck back, and hopefully soon I'll look normal again and be able to lead my normal life. Will post more....",

Tomorrow I begin radiation therapy on my neck and the right side of my head at Columbia Presbyterian. It looks like my disease has traveled to my neck lymph nodes and is wreacking havoc there. My radio-onco team is made up of wonderful and very communicative women, and I'm feeling quite comfortable with the whole process. Despite that, however, I want to find as much credible information as I can about this treatment. I was thinking, perhaps someone in these boards has undergone a treatment similar to mine.  I have a question that may get answered tomorrow, but thought to ask it here also for the benefit of all. I have just started taking Tykerb. (On my third day today and thankfully no side effects so far). Tomorrow I begin radiation. Every August I look after a lovely little kitty in my house. I was wondering, given that I'll be undergoing radiation for the next five weeks, if either the radiation or the Tykerb will affect the sweet little kitty. He's about 10 years old. He lovest to cuddle and hangs out with me when here. Also, I have young nieces (9 and 7), who visit on weekends. How does Tykerb chemo and daily radiation therapy for 5 weeks affect children and pets around the patient?",

Once I'm done receiving the radiotherapy session, it does not linger, so no one around is affected once the session ends. So, that's good news. Today, first radio-onco session. I walked in with some lingering pain (2-3 in the scale of 1-10) and interesting enough I walked out with no pain. Within the hour though, I began to feel a stinging sensation in one of the areas that received lots of radiation. Not sure what that was. The session though, I'd say looong. It lasted about 20 min, but it certainly was not a quick in and out. I could hear the whirring of whatever machinery around my head, but since my head was being held down by a plastic mask, my eyes were shut and I couldn't see a thing. Perhaps it was better that way. The mask was tight. It's supposed to be that way so you don't move. I tried to keep calm & not panic. Went to a happy mental place, swimming with fish in the Caribbean wearing my snorkel gear. Same tight mask feeling. It helped. The good news is that this first session killed the lingering pain that had begun to subside with Tykerb. I forgot to mention I'm getting acupuncture three times a week, I hope this helps me with the side effects. So far none. Of course this is the first week. Will keep updating here. Thank you for your feedback.",

Good for you that you overcame that. Gotta tell you, the radiation is beginning to take its toll, and I still have a week and a half to go. My quality of life is suffering, but I keep telling myself this is only temporary. I just wanted to stop in, say hello and thank you. I'll check back in for updates and final update on results of the radiation treatment. My neck is a little burned and I have a rash. Hard to swallow & losing my voice. Looking forward to September!! Have a great weekend! M",

I read up various forums on the Internet with feedback on when to take Tykerb. It looks like the nightime is the preferred time for most people.  Because I take other things at night (Melatonin, Omega Oil, Dandelion juice right before bedtime), Tykerb at bedtime did not seem like a good option for me. So, I started taking it as soon as I wake up. Normally I drink two glasses of water in the morning (my daily internal shower). So now I wait for a bit after the two glasses of water, and then take my five bright orange pills with another glass of water. I eat as soon as the hour is up, to avoid nausea.  Today is the third day on Tykerb. So far no side effects. No diarrhea. No nausea. No constipation. I am beginning to feel sensitivity in my mouth. I hear mouth sores could be a problem. That would be a real bummer on my diet since I enjoy salads and fruit. I hope it's not the case. Also, I'm making notes on your feedback here about salads. That's a real bummer since it is my main meal of the day.  I am also fearing the hand foot syndrome. Walking and jogging on my threadmill are very important for me. I was told by the pharmacist that I may have to give that up because it may instigate hand and foot syndrome. Does anyone know how true that is? If so, are there any other exercises one could do that would not bother the hands or the feet?  One thing I have learned is that exercise is the #1 medicine against depression and tiredness, especially for people undergoing chemo and radiation. So, I don't want to give up exercise. I start radiation therapy tomorrow for my neck metastasis. But discussing the radiation in another board. Any ideas? Tips? That is all for now. I will post here any other things that may pop up with the Tykerb. I will say that on the days before starting Tykerb, my pain was 4-5 in a scale of 1-10 (10 being the worst), and moving my neck was painful. Now on my 3rd day on Tykerb the pain has subsided greatly, perhaps down to a 2-3 scale and I have more freedom of movement. Of course, this could be a placebo effect because according to the package insert, Tykerb reaches steady state in the body within 6-7 days. I bet then is when we'll see any side effects, but more importantly, its therapeutic effect as well. Will share more within the next few days.",
