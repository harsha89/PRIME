Then onto flushing of the port and hooking up the IV line and then pre-meds for 2 hours (so I won't get an allergic reaction to the tax like the first 2 times), then chemo/Herceptin for the next 4 hours.

He couldn't really tell a percentage of recurrence for me if I did the radiation either.  Thinking of all of the possible side effects is a little scary too.

My onc wants me to talk with a rad-onc about having rads after chemo is finished. I had a mastectomy with 1 lymph node involved. The onc says I should only need rads in the arm pit area where the node was and in the superclavicular area also where other lymph nodes are at, but not on the breast because I had clear margins there. Is anyone in our group doing anything similar to mine with rads? I still haven't talked with the rad onc yet until I finish my last treatment to find out for sure. Yes, It is Alyad's last day today. Good for her! I still have my eyebrows, but they are very thin. My eyelashes are hanging on too. I still am shaving my legs every now and then, darn it.",

Anyway, I had to lay on the hard board with my arms above my head for about 2 hours total!! They let me get up once to get some feeling back. They kept reassuring me that it would not be like this from now on....only about 15 minutes. As soon as I got home I took a shower to wash off all of the markings and then I slathered aloe vera gel all over.",

I go in tomorrow for my 2nd Herceptin only treatment. My WBC count was low last time and I am hoping it has improved. I had a MUGA scan last Thursday and am hoping that my score is still good so that I can continue getting Herceptin till March.  I am having a radiation simulation on Tuesday, after painstakingly deciding to do rads. I got a second opinion because I was in the grey area. Both rad onc agreed it will benefit me. 26% chance of recurrence without rads and under 5% with rads.  That is what sealed the deal for me. The bad part of it is I visited with my PS and he wants me to wait 6 months after rads are finished to get my expander exchanged into implant. That means ANOTHER additional 7 1/2 months with having this very uncomfortable expander. I have had it since my surgery in February. Also, I have my 6 month follow up appt next week with my surgeon who did my mastectomy. Seems like there is something all of the time. I can't wait for all of this to hopefully be over and get on with my life!! Take care everyone!",

I don't understand it because I have seen the NP the last 3 times before my treatment. The only thing that may contribute to me needing to see him first before treatment would be if my MUGA scan results didn't come out good, but then I wouldn't be able to even receive treatment.

That's too bad you don't like it. Give it a week or two for you to get used to the change (as we all here should know, lol)  Deb...Good luck with your chemo this week. I was scheduled for my 13th Herceptin treatment today but the doc office called and said my onc is out sick today and I had to re-schedule for Thursday. He wants to see me before my treatment to go over my MUGA scan results and I need to schedule a PETSCAN. I have'nt had a petscan since 5 days before my mastectomy back in February so I am anxious to find out if I am NED. Also, I think most of you know that I have to have my tissue expander removed in the next month because my radiation caused my scar line to open up and now it is draining a yellow fluid. My PS here said it is not infected but it needs to come out soon. And I cannot have implant for 2 years, so i have opted to have a flap surgery. I want to get an S-GAP flap surgery and my PS doesn't do those, so I have been talking to the Breast Restorative center in NOLA and trying to get an appointment there at the end of December. I found out about that place here on this website and have heard great things about it. They specialize only in mastectomy and/or breast reconstruction and have top doctors.  It is about a 12 hour drive from my home, but I think it will be worth it.",

I had yet ANOTHER set back today....  I have an expander and it seem to do well during rads until a week ago I noticed a small 'open area' along my mastectomy scar in the front part of my breast that was dark in color. I asked the radiologist what it was and he didn't know for sure. Then a few days ago, it started draining a yellowish fluid out of it non stop. I went back to the radiologist yesterday and he said he had never seen anything like it and he thought maybe it was a hematoma. He set me up with an appointment with my PS to find out what it is. I went today and he said that my expander is pushing its way out from under the muscle and the dark color is the actual expander itself! So, now it is contaminated, and that means I won't be able to get my implants in 6 months because of the contamination. He said I could do the flap surgery or just have the expander taken out and have nothing there. I am upset because I didn't want to have to have the flap surgery because it is a long surgery with a lot of recovery time. And I am upset that I have had to wear this very uncomfortable expander for 9 months for nothing. I have to make up my mind pretty quickly because of the risk of getting infection.  What type of reconstruction has everyone else had/having? I am going back and forth with this and I really don't know what to do.",

I did have a couple of things show up that were non-cancer related. I have a nodule on my lung and a hemangioma on my backbone. I would have never known about those if I hadn't had the scans.

I have a few issues, but not cancer related.",

I had to deal with client's hair and hear all of their complaints of them wanting their hair  thicker, thinner,  curlier, straighter, longer, shorter, a different color and etc. I just wanted to say to them, at least you have hair, and you don't know how lucky you are!! But of course I didn't. A lot of my clients are telling me to keep my hair short, but I personally liked it better longer, and I really can't wait for my bangs to grow down to eyebrows!

I am now 8 months PFC and have colored my hair about 5 different times and have added highlights the last couple of times. Just make sure you get the 'chemo ends' trimmed off every 4 to 5 weeks.  Also, your hair may not turn out the same color as it was before after you color it even if you use the exact same color as you did before. Your hair is totally different now and it may look a little brassier. Just keep that in mind.",

Charmaine...If your hair is already grayish-white, then the hairdresser needs to pull your hair through a highlighting cap and put on a dark brown color to get the same look that Jamie Lee has. But your hair needs to be at least a couple of inches long before you can do it. She won't be able to pull enough hair through the cap if it is too short. And it is probably too short to use foils with lowlights.",

My hair is a little over an inch now. I wear my wig to work still (I am a hairstylist) and my clients ask me everyday what if my hair is growing yet or not. Soon, I will ditch the wig, but frankly, I don't look good with only one inch of hair! I will probably graduate to hats for awhile first. I use Nioxin shampoo and follicle booster everyday, and in the evening before bed, I put aloe vera gel on.",

Think of it like this...if you take 2 ends of a rope and rub them against each other, then that is what the ends of your hair does when you wash it. Don't rub your head with your towel either, just blot it dry.  And any added heat like from the blow dryer will cause it too..   So, please, don't be afraid to get your hair cut!! Just tell your stylist to cut off only the tip ends.",

I had 2 infections after my first treament because my WBC were too low. After the second treatment, I got the Neulasta shot which helped that from happening again. They had me on some good anti-naseau meds called Emend,  so I never got sick. The chemo mainly just drained all of my energy, I felt like I was in a fog for the first week. I took off work the first week after each treatment, then worked half days the following 2 weeks until next treatment. I started to lose my hair 16 days after the first treatment.   But, one thing you need to remember is that EVERYONE'S side effects are different. Just remember to drink A LOT of water, that is so important because it helps to flush everything through. I don't know if you will have TCH, but there is wonderful thread on the chemo board called taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin that is very informative. Keep that in mind. My next step is radiation because I had one positive node. You won't have to worry about doing that. Good luck and take care!",

Ok, what I have learned recently about radiation is that your hair only falls out when you have radiation on your head, not your breast. So, that is one thing I don't understand. Secondly, when I told her that I was having 33 treatments, and that I will go in everyday for 6 weeks, she said she had 35 treatments and went in only once a week for them. I have never heard of that either. That would be 35 weeks of treatments, over half a year! I didn't question anything she said to me, but am I wrong in thinking that something doesn't look right in this picture?? Honestly, she has been known to 'fib' about things in the past to get sympathy,sooo....who knows? I am going to ask my radiologist about this when I see him on Wednesday, but I am curious to see what you girls think.",

A couple of nights ago, there was a bunch of green ooze built up on both of those areas. I called the office yesterday morning they had me come in and said that I didn't look that bad. I personally think it looks awful!! They told me to keep the ooze washed off with liquid antibacterial soap and then slather on Silvadene and then put on Xeroform petroleum dressing over top. I have done all of that and my skin look absolutely raw and red underneath. And it is very painful. My skin did so good during rads, it got bad only after rads are finished. They said that it should look better in a couple of weeks and I am hoping that they are right because it has me a little worried right now. ",

I am scheduled for 25 and then 5 boosts.  I have been using calendula lotion and my skin is looking good except for right in the middle of my chest. I have a few red bumps and it itches a little. The rad said I can use hydrocortizone on it and if it gets worse, he wrote a prescription for Silverdine. I get 5 zaps because I am getting all of my lymph nodes  around the breast radiated too and it takes about 20 minutes. The rad said no antioxidants during rads and my onco said I could get the regular flu shot anytime. He was a little weary about the swine flu shot because they don't know the side effects from it yet. I am 10 weeks PFC and my WBC is still low. It is at 3,000 and the normal is 5,000-10,000.",
