It made it a bit easier for me to deal with the low times, knowing that they would pass soon.",

I wonder what the response would have been had the words been different? How would you respond to the question of do you consider yourself healthy?  Because, for me anyway, I am not in denial, I am not healthy, but I am not sick. Sick for me, and for many people here, seems to be something that is used for people who are incapacitated in some way. Someone who is unable to get out of bed is sick, someone who is unable to walk is sick, someone who cannot work is sick. I can still do all the things I did before cancer. During chemo it was difficult and took longer, but I could still do those things. If I am in denial then I like it here! I found the lump about 6 -8 weeks before i did anything about it. During that time i was not 'sick' so why should i be sick now? BTW excuse my ignorance but what is NED?",

Yet, before I had cancer - I always thought of people with cancer as sick. But now I think of people with cancer as people who might be getting side effects! Strange how my perception of people has changed so much! ",

My chemo unit ( i'm in the UK ) runs a monthly club for people with breast cancer - perhaps you could ask if there is any such thing near to you. Sometimes you need to speak to people who have come through this - just to reassure yourself that you can make it. And you will make it through- and in a few weeks you will be offering hope and comfort to others through these boards. They will read your posts and know that the scared and angry feelings that they are having are what most of us here have been through. You are never alone - we are all here for each other.  ((hugs)) Jo",

I'm grade 3 too - as far as i understand this means that it's fast growing and quite aggressive? but before you panic, as i understand it these tumours respond well to treatment - mine has shrunk after two chemo treatments. My cancer has not spread at all - i had a bone scan and CT scan to confirm this. Maybe this is something that you could ask for? Write down all your questions - even the ones that wake you in the night! - as i forgot loads and had to book appointment just to ask questions!!  Then write the answers down too. Also - get something for the stress - we treat the physical effects - it's ok to treat the psycological ones too. I had never taken any pills for stress before this, now i will take them - only if i need them - but i do take them and they help. Don't worry about the anger and denial, as icandothis said you will go through so many emotions.  Come here often - rant, rave scream - we know how it feels. I know everyone says 'this is do-able' and your probably thinking ' no way' but really it is. And its not as awful as you think it will be.               (((hugs and good thoughts))) Jo",

With regards to your performance at work - have you asked yourself how you would respond to finding out one of your workmates had cancer? would you want to help and understand them? I know that if one of my collegues had told me this news, before it was me, i would have tried my best to understand and be supportive. I think that, for me, it has been REALLY hard to sit back and accept help and support from people - I'm an independant person and to suddenly be 'selfish' has been so hard - but it's what you need to do! If you feel your performance at work is not what it was - so what? it's not forever - people know that you always give your best - but for now - you are under great pressure. I guess what I'm trying to say is - go easy on yourself! your doing your best - thats all that matters! Your priority now is you and your dogs! Not your performance at work! I actually had a hard time remembering that I am ill - i used to wake up and go look in the mirror and say \" your ill - you've got to take it easy!\" everyday! What dogs do you have? I have one cross breed - oh, he has been great - if i have a bad day - he dosen't care! - dinner is still at 6pm !!! so i get up, crying my eyes out, and feed him - then it's play time - again - it dosen't matter if i'm tired or sore - IT'S PLAYTIME!!!!!! lol! When i walked in the house with no hair for the first time he reacted by pretending not to notice and bringing me his ball!! He dosen't care if i've got no hair, or am exhausted - i'm still the same to him - the one who feeds him and plays ball!! I hope you can be a little easier on yourself - I know it's not much help - but I'm thinking of you and sending you good wishes - all the way from the UK!  ((((hugs)))) Jo ",
