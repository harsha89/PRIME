When my wife went for Chemo back in 2008, she met a lady who was stage 1 back in 2005. No Chemo.  Cancer came back 2 times. I know it is a personal choice.  Losing hair is a minor thing. Chemo + Herceptin works very good. My wife is without cancer for 3 years now. She doesn't think too many of the disease now. We are planning for our vacation in a few month.",
