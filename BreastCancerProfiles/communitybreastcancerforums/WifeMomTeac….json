It wasn't miserable, but I definitely could feel the first 3 samples being taken. The first one almost felt like it hit a rib. I'm 29 with small and dense breasts, so not sure if that affected the local anesthesic or not. Now to wait some more. : ( Good luck to you! Hopefully we both hear good news soon!",

Thankfully I got my mammogram result the same day and the ultrasound the next. Now waiting for a surgery/biopsy consult, and then waiting for the biopsy to be scheduled, and then waiting again for the results. This is such a long process. I hope your answers come soon!",
