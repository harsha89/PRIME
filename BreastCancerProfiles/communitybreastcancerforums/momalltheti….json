In other words if young women as herself would not have gone for MRI/mamo which they normally would not have, it would have just been dormant.

Well, either way in your case, presenting what you sais you see in your breasts, yes, a breast Center would do a Mamo, and many a times certain lesions are shown even when there is dense breasts. So I still am not clear if you are at a Cancer Center, if you are seeing radiologists that only do breast imaging, these people will know best your situation. So I'd still ask for the Mamo. The MRI has to be read correctly. A good radiologist would not need a report from a 2nd radiologist, he should give his opinion. The truth be said, they say if you put 3 radiologists in a room you get 4 answers. I hope you think about what I said, If you have any questions you could PM me.",

And with so much going on, like NO it's not normal for your nipple to be inverted, or to have a change in your breast shape. ANY good professional will take note of that. YOU NEED whatever images it will take to know definitely you don't have a/t to deal with. Of course an MRI, an ultrasound could miss something, first of all it depends on the expertise of the technician, also even a good one could miss a spot, and something not seen Monday could be different Wednesday, absolutely. So, i don't know where you are located, but you need to go to a good accredited Cancer Center. No playing around or be intimidated by ignorant medical staff. Wearing a white coat does not make them perfect. Sorry, but i've been around, and I hear this ALL the time. You just need to know that you did what you could, and was checked by competent professionals. There is no such a thing of a little pregnant. YOU need to be sure. Any place could be a Womens clinic, the name does not impress me. Call NCI ask them what they would recommend. Go to another Gyno if you have to. One could have fatty and dense breasts.

Are you from a Jewish Ashkenaz descendancy, you should have the genetic testing, even more because you have family with History of cancer, even if it owuld not have been BC. I am from Jewish Ashkenaz descendancy, but my daughter was BRCA1/2 Palb2 etc...negative, they don't think i or my other girls would have it. But there is such a thing of just having familial History, that in itself puts you at a higher risk. And many non Jewish people have the BRCA gene also. As Bhmomma said definitely try a big Cancer Center they should not only understand your concerns, but advise you to pursue it. Also, what's you age bracket, that would be another flag if you are young...Please let us know, we could all learn from each other. You said it was benign but what were the tumors?",

Dani did get her Enzalutumide, but it came a day short from our scheduled visit to Clinical trial doc recommended by Onco. So she called them up because I remembered something about wash out time, so they told her to hold off. The visit was all right, aside from her Onco not having sent any current info, so was kinda lame. Today i got them all they wanted, and they accepted her. This is for the DS8021A something very new. We had a long convo with NP today, it's very extensive, a lot of time, there are other appointments pending. Part of the problem is getting communication going with Onco, as life always has a wry humor, Onco's father passed away, just like that, you can't make this stuff up. Yes, of course I feel bad for her. Hmmm but so she is not working understandably, and we are left with not knowing what to do. Now I am starting to think maybe she should just take this meds. Argh.. this is so messed up. I think anxious left a long time ago, we are way passed it...going to.... And then they ask this stupid question, are you post menopausal? You are not pregnant right? I am telling you I thought i was gonna give her one, WHY would they not bother looking at the records, just the tx alone, would give it away, a lot of them are only given for postmenopausal women, to have to see her face fall, she is so darn young, and i cringe when she has to answer this questions, i jumped i said hmmm, she had an oophorectomy, like do you have to add to the injury. i gotta make sure next time before we go to another winner, i tell them ahead of time - like do your homework. On the bright side, Linda thanks for sharing your grandnephew how big he got. Lita love your new set of wheels. Classy! Shetland how are you coming along? Deanna so glad you coming about. To everyone have a great night.",

Healthy sick is a true example of the reality you face everyday. Maria, prayers are always good. Thank you all. Yep, she was extremely young, 25yrs old, and she also was nursing her 12 week old baby, she went to the first Mamo with her Medela pump bag.from there straight to the surgeon (he stayed late to see her), I'll never forget those eyes when he saw her with the bag, he's like hmmm yeah, you better stop nursing, you are having a lumpectomy in 2 days.Never mind her Gyno told her she is too young for her lump to be a/t. He would not give her a prescription, Mamos are too dangerous with all the radiation and stuff. OH my gosh I could still remember my anger, of course I took her to my private radiologist, she does not take Insurance anyway, and she gave her a Mamo and a needle biopsy that same day. So I could so understand you. Shocking is not the right word. No fam hx. She is 32 now! Openmind and Leftfootforward thanks so much for such good explanation of the details of this trial. Emilylouise that's a very interesting mixture of treatment you had, was that a trial? And this new combo you are on, DD was on it separately. Navelbine is supposed to be very good, and so is Xeloda. Unfortunately, these good stuff does not stick to her. Shetland how are you coming along now? Alissa so happy for the wonderful news. LindaE so sorry this thing is giving you trouble. Scans are not a bad idea. You know someone should finally start a thread about the mouth sores and thrush \u2013 it's just such a terrible issue and so painful. Would be nice to hear what ideas everyone have. So sorry you are going through this misery. Babs this is really a wonderful time in your life, just the expecting part is fun already. When are you starting the new treatment? Z waving at you.and thaks for sharing your knowledge. And thinking of you all. There was much running around to find answers where to move on to next, Dani started the trial last week, this week will be the 2nd infusion. Last week was insane, one full day going to docs that the clinical trial thinks is important, scans then she had a liver biopsy, then started treatment, then going back for days for Blood work. We can only hope now.",

Guys, we did get the results, but the whole thing got very messed up. Onco called even though she is on vacation, she said I should not be alarmed when I see the results, toomany things going on, but basically they are treating it as not much progression, so they are happy about that. Yep, these days that's how it goes. One is happy with NOT MUCH progression. So continue on the trial for another few weeks, and then scans again, although she said if Dani would not be on the trial she would be more aggressive treating the liver. Basically, it's much the same, some got a bit higher SUV and few got less. what got messed up is that they usually do CT's but I wanted PET/CT because it was time to see the whole picture for Dani, and they have a hard time reading and comparing. Crazy, also the fact that it was done on a different place, never mind they told us it would be ok. When it goes wrong it just does.... I asked for the Ca27.29 she says it does not really matter, because they really go by scans. Weird. But ok. I'll pick my battles. Foundation One came back with many mutations, most don't have accessible treatments, but some clinical trials. I have to look through and study it! And the biopsy came back with Dani still being Triple Positive. A lot going on. Now I am onto entertaining the little ones.",

Do you mean the type of blood they draw every few hrs? Did the WBC show high? Sometimes these fevers come and it doen't show high WBC.Tonz and tonz of hugs Linda just so sorry. What is Epirubicin, I looked it up, but I don't know anyone taking it. Guys I was not writing, I was busy thinking and talking to doctors. Friday, Dani tells me she feels still some pulling inside, so we were back and forth with Urologist's office, the bottom line is we'll go tom for a revisit. In the meantime, I was just leafing through some (I only got some) paperwork from the Urgent care, and I am fuming. First off, the urine sample, after checking in with Dr google, def screams look at me, something serious is going on. The report sent from Urgent care, is that the blood got lighter, and so they sent her home for outpatient follow up. IT'S Freaking NOT TRUE!!! They sent her home because the CT was closed. They did nothing for her. I am so mad. She suffered so much. THEN there was a problem with EKG that I noticed, I could not believe it, I immediately faxed our Cardiologist he said this needs to be rechecked, NO ONE told us that, we have an appointment 9AM tomorrow morning. So this is distracting me from the important things of really looking how she could be helped. Onco sent a response email that she is on top of it, looking into options. BUT I cannot communicate with her. Maybe tomorrow we'll call someone else .Babs was so kindly nudging me to act, I was trying very hard not step Onco's feet. But if I can't get to see her, she can't set up appointments, then I'll have to do something else. I think the only way out now would be Chemo, Taxol? Of course she took it already, but, and the side effects. What other option? Another trial? How can she go on another trial, only after 4 weeks from the last CT it showed progression in the liver, we did not even see the rest of her body, who knows what's going with the lungs, it's so crazy, she is at a top Hospital or so they say, in NYC a top doctor and so what??? I'd prefer to be in the boondocks!!!!!!!!!!!! Any and all suggestions is welcome.",

Z you wrote it so well, I feel like keeping all your posts. Z I absolutely totally agree with you about the pure careless sloppiness in healthcare professionals. We all understand that there are few in between, as in any part of our lives, but being in this mudslide for quite awhile, and experience with parents/in laws, the reality is mind boggling. A simple simple fact, I call for CD to be emailed from the dept of films, that's all they do, anyway, yes I'm advised send an authorization and we will send it out. Fine, after an hr, I'm like I don't want, but let me check to make sure all is in order. Of course my phone # was there also. Anyhow, the sweet ignorant voice, said oh yes we got it, BUT WE need to send to you an authorization and send it back, hmm really??? And it goes on and on. Shetland e/t you wrote is so true also. I think there is much truth about why there is such a delay in treatment, particularly in certain societies. Now, how one could explain it in a capitalistic economy I'm not so sure. LisaYI cannot even imagine your shock. But at least they are moving fast. Are you having WBR? What kind of surgery are you having? Rhonda sorry you joined, but this is a gr8 place. Could I ask whom did you see at DF? Cristina it's so frustrating, many many hugs. Bluebird, it's quite a feat for you to have these docs look at you as whole person, with the different issues you need to contend. So - how does one make the decision - re Y90 or TACE? Last PET/CT obviously showed progression, all over, D's ALP is in the 400's it was never that high, her ALT/AST in 100 somehting, never so high. She was ignored and neglected by the people that swear to do NO harm. I can't even rehash it all, but... Last week, right after i sent out the post on the 10th, i got the dreaded phone call, bleeding again, going to the ER. i met her there. This time to the new ER. Another sewer. The thing EVERYONE knows. NOT one person at the place, doctor/nurse/patients they all know it's a disaster, and nothing is done about it. So if Dani was admitted at 2:00AM by her private Onco from the Hospital, there is no going upstairs because a team has to accept her on the floor, (the team that never saw her during her stay), and that team only shows up at 8:00AM - I KID YOU NOT. So one rots in the ER waiting for that horrendous hour, and then i still needed 3 nurses to make sure the paperwork gets done. This with someone bleeding, doctors knowing she has clots. Anyway, off to the floor, first they want to treat her conservatively, D kept saying it's not gonna go away just with CBI, gotta cysto. Then i insisted we see a REAL doc, not his residents etc...finally doc came and said oh, yeah, Houston we have a problem. Next day cystocopy and hopefully THIS TIME they took it out. He told us, the reason it was still there because 1st URO prob was worried to take it out w/t knowing the status pre-biopsy. Now that he knows it's b9, then he could take it out. Came home Friday evening, What a nightmare. First off Hemangiomas are rare, even rarer in such young women. And then have this recur it's absurd. I got a friend to get in touch with yet another URO in a different Hospital to look at the report, and maybe he could reassure her she won't have to worry about going out in case this happens suddenly, otherwise she is not making plans to go out. While there, new Onco came in, he said - what do you expect from me, i'd like to know, oh she told him - don't drop me like a hot potato. He promised he won't, well we'll see. Turns out he gave Faslodex in the Hospital, and ordered Neratinib. It should arrive tomorrow, took a good few days for Ins to ok it. Xgeva also given already. The brain MRI showed progression also, she has numbness in the chin/lips and besides e/t else, protruding in the orbital area. So he had an emergency MRI of the Orbit ordered while we were at the Hospital. Follow up with new Rads doc this week. It's really much much longer than this, but I'm drained, we did not sleep for 3 days, continuously, and she could not eat so i did not, her hubby went home to be with the kids, and then my girls went to join them. So many times i had to make sure she gets the right care, let's just say the Medical Chief came in and was mystified by some of his people. I have his card now. SO - tom - Neratinib/Faslodex(already done), what you ladies could tell would that be enough, Onco thinks so. Actually, i have another opinion from a diff Center and they agree. I really hope so. Y90 was suggested by Onco, the former one did not want even want to consider it. But even what you said Bluebird it seems it has a lot of negative, i wish it could be a simple bullet. She has it in both lobes. Rads simulation will be on the 19th, we still have to see where to, because there are so many areas to be addressed. Lalalady thanks so much for the pm's Always thinking about all of you. Prayers and hopes. About the peritoneal mets - i don't think it always comes with ascites, D has peritoneal and sometimes she has ascites, sometimes not.It would show up on a PET/CT or CT.   ",

You could actually call yourself F1 give them the info, they would speak directly to you. Zar is absolutely right. I called, sent them the POA from my DD to me, and they had no trouble in sending me the info. Zar how was the treatment on typhoon day? Grannax thanks for checking. I was so wiped out last night, i went to sleep 9sh!! Ok i took 2 ambien in middle of the night, i did not want to think. If i am wiped out i cannot imagine Dani, but she will NOT complain. It went very well. they were all terrific with her. But their faces when they spoke to me, spoke volumes. They - the nurses, Fellow they could not believe the amount of damage they saw. IR was a bit more reserved, but he told me also. They do the angiogram, to see the hmmm architecture of the liver, they do the mapping, the same as when regular radiation to the rest of the body is done,then they send the person to Nuclear Medicine, they do a SPECT scan, it's very detailed 3D scan, they check if a person has no shunts or something not allowing the radiation to pass to the right places or worse that the radiation ends up where it should not. So the results for her is that she is a candidate. So we were happy. You know when my kids were little and the doc said yep it's strep, i knew hey this is not a good thing, but i was so happy because i knew- ok, let's get that antibiotic and it will all be well, so something like this here, i know (we know) it's a tough procedure but it could help her. IR said that there is no question it has to be done, otherwise any treatment that needs to be metabolized through the liver is not gonna work, the liver is really jeopardized. BUT, it's scheduled ONLY for the 3rd. He is not in the Hospital that week only Friday. It might work out for her because she needs to get the other Rads and they did not want her to have a break, (she would need to stop on the day of theY90), like this if it's on a Friday ( e/o is fooling themselves, and just letting it go, knowing that Sat/Sunday there are no Rads here anyway). So RO agreed that she could start this Thursday. BabyRuth thanks for the heads up with your experience, she really cannnnnnnot afford 6 weeks recup no way!. I could distract the kids a day, two but they need her up and around. As is, her sibs are helping out, but still trying to get things running at home. I'll try to get the report tomorrow, we'll see the new Neuro, then i'll see what they really saw. I'll definitely keep you guys in the loop. You are all really my backbone.",

      "Content": "Nov 14, 2017 09:47PM - edited Nov 14, 2017 09:49PM by momallthetime First and foremost I am sending good angels for you Nina, boy I just saw your post from a few hours ago and then the last one, I hope you are being taken care of. When you have a chance please let us know. What if I tell you I was organizing alllll the papers that I was getting since Sept. with the ER situation, all the procedures, scans and blood tests, then ER again. We also went to many new docs, so I took out from the pile certain papers that was particular to that doc, like the 2nd doc for URO, the RO etc\u2026and going every day to doctors, I was not putting things in the right place, and I am paying a price for it. But getting there now. There are so many discrepancies if i look at the records, starting with lesions that were seen on the first PET/CT right after dx, things we were never told. At the time i looked at this stuff, but i didn't realize what it all meant. They did not diagnose her with mets, but at the same time there were nodules in the mediastinum, something in the ribs weird. They never told us. And looking through the last records I see she had at least twice b4 blood in the urine, and I remember that, and onco never thought in looking deeper into it, they lied in the reports about a time when she needed blood transfusion saying that SHE WANTED to wait for more BT and that's why she ended up in the Er. NOT!!! And then I read your posts, and I am like how does the world go around with these people messing up like this. And so of course if I did not check in, when I do I see all these messages. Dani finished today her head and orbital part of the Rads, she is totally drained. She has a terrible sore throat from the rads, food is not going down well, she lost weight again, it's really hard. She can't sleep. I just came back from her house. She has a few days and then next week she starts the rads to the rest of her body. I wrote things up on the side, and I am gonna copy and paste here, because I had to write things down as I was reading it. Zar reading what you posted, my heart stopped a few times!!! NO WAY???? 25/30 lesions they could not see? And the guy that did the other biopsy how could he have missed it? Don't they look at a scan, US or CT? Oh my, how are you feeling??? And in Japan no scans of any kind were done for you to know a/t?? You musta've fallen of the chair no??? You cannot have contrast? Why was the Pet/Ct w/t contrast? And Zar \u2013 what about your numbers, IR pushed us to do the Y90 now, because he said that surprisingly her #s were still on the ok side, creatinine and all of that, and of course the enzymes, well those have been surging up. And what Lindalou said about the steroids, I know s/o that has it done every time, and it works gr8. Lindalou you get MY vote! I am reading further and I see Italy?? For real? With the fam? Oh my goodness, that's gonna be awesome. Which is the thread for Y90?Is the one with Trish03? If it is I saw that you wrote that it's better to wait 3 mos b4 Immnunotherapy? Really? Could you please explain? Re: those radiology services, it could be very interesting, just gotta make sure that they are reputable. How can you find out? Z what you mentioned about the palliative mindset, is so true. I believe that the wonderful RO, the last one is a good person at heart BUT she def was looking at Dani as \u2013 we'll try to spare you\u2026And MO also, they dragged their feet.You are truly amazing, i could imagine a big ballroom and everyone is there talking and explaining one to another all that is going on, that needs to be done, that would be awesome.

With the Pet/CTs have shown that Dani is ( and by now -was I hope) almost full of liver mets on the right side, on the left side somewhat less. The PET/CT lit up like a Christmas tree. ALL OVER!!! The IR said she has a \"bulky liver\" \u2013 hmm I am trying to figure out what that means, but the way he was showing me is that it's difficult to treat. I think MRI has almost if any radiation, so it would be gr8. BUT I am afraid if I'll mention MRI they will nix the PET/CT which I think it's so important in picking early small cancer no?? She had SPECT right after the Y90 procedure and no scans till some time in December. Kandy for once we would not want to be in the presence of smart and BAM yeah, that's what RO said to my DD also. Hers was marked as innumerable, and this happened in a matter of 4 weeks from 2 lesions! How are you doing? Do you know I don't remember ever reading about necrosis on her scans, ONLY lytic?? I Robin how are you feeling? What's the plan? Do you need rest? Are you able to go out? What is the expectation now that you had the surgery? When do they check if you are ok? Oh my gosh as I am reading forward, YES that's what they used for Dani, she is so petite, the nice nurse hid the cuff in her room so she should always have the small BP thingy! Robin how amazing to see how you explain e/t. I wish I would have my head straight and be able to decipher all of it. Yes, it has been difficult for D. It's been one thing after another. But as I mentioned b4, really happy she got to do some of the rads. They are giving her a break and then start to the rest of the body next week. You know re: the research, I feel that at least it gives me a small sense of control, there is not much else I could control. I must tell you these furry ones are the bet. It turns out that Dani is looking in getting a tiny one. She wants to cuddle with and give love/care when she's at home resting. Hmm she kinda told us that we'd be next of kin when she has to be away for long hours. Can I say no?? NOT. I actually always like dogs. That's what she wants, she is looking to the ones that are grow till 8Lbs. She lost weight, so this way she could snuggle with it. Open for suggestions, if you guys know of a good breeder, or a good fit. Claire waiting to hear about your results. Fingers crossed. I will ask a very stupid question how does one know if a PARP is a good venue? Re: carbo/gemzar Dani had it years ago she could not tolerate either of them, pain, prickling she got off it pretty quick. Jeenee thanks for the info, so glad that you are over with that part. Now the waiting. LindaE always thinking of you sweetie. We go back a long time. Grannax you had the Y90 done twice? That's about how many times IR said it could be done. And TACE could be done after that? WOW, and how bad is the progression on your liver that you think you will be doing it? Lulubee me and you, oh yeah, I ain't opening up my eyes for nothing! I don't like closed places, and that thing hmm being so small, I had to have MRI's a few times, and I go in w my eyes closed and out we go.  ",

The problem is this horrible bleeding that forms clots, i really would like to hear of s/o that had the same issue, the internet is not very helpful with this info, very sporadic, they tell stories of newborns, or mostly much older people, and the one i saw in the 20's they did the procedure and voila, no problem. Actually, does anyone here know of a good site as this one but for the bladder so i could get info, again i was trying to find out but were not successful.

JFL thanks, yes honestly it's exactly 2 months from the first time, and Dani still looks at me like how much odder can I get??? Cancer at such young age, no HX, constant progression and now this horrendous thing that is so painful when it block the urine passage and having to beg ER and doctors to take it seriously, she tells them, can you imagine when you just have to hold it in a bit how it hurts blah blah...they are going by what PUBMED says... Yes, i am reaching out to tonz of people, first as of in 10mins Eastern time, I am reaching out to differnt docs, but it would be great to know who is the one Doc that dealt with this 1% of ppl. The MO was emailing us back and forth and he called, he was away, we so did not want to bother him, but the URO was awol and his team was not coming, they kept saying they have an emergency Dani was I am an emergency, it was insane. We had to fight for e/t. Then friday nt, they said we'll keep irrigating (which is their way to clear the blood/urine from the bladder) for 48 hrs, we were like what?? And I know they wanted to drag it along until the URO will show up Monday morning, we had such a fit, and through Onco and then after the resident came late at night he saw how bad it was, because they could not even get things out by flushing, he said you'll go tom morning for cystoscopy and then fulgurization, then they kept apologizing, and I was like i don't accept it. It was inhumane what they did. I am getting an email from the Chief of Urology and i want to post a formal complaint about this URO. I hope to get tis done this morning. Zar Dani had a port, but then she took it off she just could not deal with the reminder of it in her body all the time, now she watches her vein all the time, and she fights to get decent phlebotomist, and thanks the ones that are careful. bluebird get to know you are more in peace with the team. let's hope for good news. Everyone big warm hugs, i gotta go do my homework.",

But great news on the PET front, MS stable is a good thing, the ERBB2 and the ESR1 they say it may indicate it's an aggressive form, Dani has those, but things are working fine for you. So...if you have questions you could call them and they will recommend a navigator that could advise you. Robin it's good they finally got some info that could help. You could be on treatment at the same time as taking the antibiotics? 27 is quite low. Could it be a problem with the marrow? In Dani's case Onco says it did not heal yet from all the rads and the marrow did not recuperate yet...I'll pm to you the info re the wigs. I actually did it all and then this damn thing disappeared. I wish this site would have some kind of security, that when this happens it would ask the author if they really want to leave etc..but i'll send it to you. Kayaabor knowing you, you must be in a lot of pain. You are lucky that you are able to get this combo and hopefully that will make a difference. Well IMMU did not do a thing for Dani, they keep calling to wanna know what she is doing, what's their business once she is off it. By no means Im telling you that IMMU is not the answer, but you are concentrating so much on it, what about a good old fashioned chemo? Kay not having coverage is really a difficult situation, and working full time like so many of you is a superhuman task. As I said b4, Dani had a business but she couldn't keep the promises of delivery due to not knowing when and where she will be at any time, so sadly she gave it up. She developed clientele, started the business from scratch, she sent accessories around the World, and just like that is done with. So doc added Leukeran i never heard of it, did anyone hear of it? So weird, unless Dani gave me the wrong name, i'll confirm tomorrow, He lowered the chemo dosage and added this. Her platelets are still in the 70's which is much better than it was.

So sorry for this mess. Artist I am cheering for you to get the info you need at the new appointment. Timothy maybe there is a department at the Univ. that could help you get around paying this nonsense amount for a 2nd opinion. It's just not right. We sent out all documentation to different doctors for a 2nd opinion and now waiting back. Onco called today, still unsure about doing biopsy or not, his plan would be to put Dani on Lynparza(an ovarian cancer drug) with immunotherapy and keep Ibrance and Letrozole and Herceptin. The Letrozole he wanted to change, but when I asked why he did not really know and it seems he will keep it for now. He does not look overly concerned about TWO spots in the liver, but I am, she did not have this 8 wks ago, and after a few years with bone mets she had mets to a major organ. I don't get his \"not so worry\" tune. Also, Dani had a blood biopsy done with Guardant360 back in January and NOW he says he looked it over and sees that \"the tumor\" has a BRCA2 mutation. Hmmm what does that mean? I know she is BRACA1/2 negative, he said it has nothing to do with that, it's the tumor that has the mutation not her. Ever heard of such a thing?? Gonna ask around, it sounds really odd. And b/c of that he feels the Lynparza would work. Waiting for 2nd and 3rd opinions docs to get back to us regarding appointment, let's just say she is not doing any of these stuff before we hear from other facilities. If anybody has input on Dani's status I'd love to hear it. Stephanie, so incredible how you think of everyone. Mutherflush hope you get your answer soon. Definitely worth looking into it, maybe even doing a biopsy.",

Best best best!!! Gramen, just reading your post made me nervous. For sure a little longer on the Navelbine would make more sense. Were your numbers so weak? If not, why not make sure your liver is getting the message Stephanie, Re: difficult convos, yes it could make a lot of sense. And I truly know that you guys have the best thoughts for us. But I must say it's a bit different when we are talking about young children, or young adults as Dani. From the mid of her 20's she dealt with this monster. She was just starting a life, starting parenthood, a small business. It all came tumbling down. And it's been since then. Of course, we had some great moments and how can we not be thankful of science miraculous advances for the Grace of G od. BUT there was not time to live the life, there won't be a future. It's constant fear of what if this will work and that, she cannot plan for a/t in advance, bcs she is always called in for this scan or that appointment. It's just not business as usual. I, we don't even know what normal is. Her sisters did not move away as they wanted, and had opportunities, always wanting to stay nearby, always needed. This is the reality. I just read this book from Will Schwalbe The end of your life book club -writing about his mom's life, death, and she did not wanna leave until\u2026BUT she had so much to look back, grown children, trips, marriages, dreams and Dani had this stolen from her, it just is. Sorry, maybe it's a rant, it's just very, no totally unfair. Stephanie, thank you for all your thoughtful links.!! Babs I PM'd you. Did you look at the PM not going through. This is really BS. Aghh you were so happy. Lisa what is his rationale if you did progress, why is he keeping you on it? And Btw if you go to the Ibrance thread, there are many ways that WBC could be regulated, by different dosages or schedule. Z I have been asking for them to the AR testing on Dani, and doc keeps postponing it. BarbD they must come with something Sanidlee all I could offer you is good vibes. Never liked roller coasters. Leftfoot is there someplace where we could watch, follow your heartfelt speech? For the newbies, welcome, hope you find much comfort here. Dani did all these therapies already, she alwasy had SE's. And so it goes. I happened to ask at the latest infusion, first of the 3 wk Ixempra, about Herceptin, and I just found out she was off it, Hmm, when I emailed doc, I received back an email during the weekend, that she should be on it. Tomorrow we are going to get to this mystery, and appointment with new NeuroOnco. More decisions. Hugs to all",

QUESTION: I am trying to find out the following: I have asked in the past for progress notes from the RO (I've gotten from this one and from the past RO also), from NeuroOnco that we just visited, from surgeons and even from past Onco. This week,when we asked for the progress notes from the current Rads treatment, the secretary said oh no, we don't give this to patients. I know she is wrong, we are entitled to reports (call it what you want). But before i speak to Administrative secretary, i don't appreciate it when people that are secretaries wave the power flag, I wanted to ask - How did you, ladies, get some records from any of your visits. The scans we get from the Radiology, no problem. Blood work is accessible also. But there is no info in the Portal from the visit or assessment of doctor. I like to have paperwork with me for many reasons: first I like to see what they wrote. And also, it's much easier to have the paperwork if one wants to ask a question either to the current doctor or take it to a 2nd opinion, I don't need to beg the secretaries to hurry it up etc.. It's certainly one last thing we need to deal with now. I requested something that pertain to me (the patient), and it should be, yes ma'am of course. Thanks",

Dani's tumors some are smaller, some are larger, some are new...the same for some bone mets, Onco says it's something thou, so we can only hope till the next scan at the end of the year. Insane!!! JFL thanks for letting me know about the TM's, hope it's not a pattern, then I will worry more, we'll see this week how it goes. Smarty thank you for sharing about Holeinone passing. Just unbelievable. Amy so sorry about the mets. I so wish they would do a liver biopsy for my daughter, but they won't. Onco did a BT with Guardant360. They do not wanna mess with the liver. Aghh, I thought it could bring new info, but they say they have enough. Alissa so sorry. Dani is on Xeloda, it does help a lot of ladies with these mets. Gramen, crossing even my legs ;) hoping for good news!! If you could get the results, as Zar said, either from the facility (I've gone back the next day, if I wanted it really fast), or if you could work with a Family Physician, which we do, and Dani always puts his name as another doc to get the results faxed (not just mailed), then we check with the facility (if she has it done early we even check the same day late) and then we get the results usually from Family Physician, I wish everyone would think as Zar said, what do they think, we are gonna hang ourselves when we see the results. Babs wishing the best of luck with the new treatment, and can't wait for you to hold that baby!!",

While it's supposedly stable, ok we could hold on, but these things have a tendency to just go the wrong way. It is a miracle that finally at least we were able to get a brake, I think Xeloda really was the kicker. She started it in November. It has been about 6 wks only. True, true. But doc was anxious bcs she had no good responses b4 and she did not want to be surprised so she ordered the Pet/Ct. Stable I have learned from here, is a great magical word. But, we are Humans, and with the large load of tumors she has in the whole liver, somehow what can I tell you, it's not so comforting. Some bone lesions did get smaller.Numerous fractured ribs?? Doc sent me a one sentence response, and nothing about the fractured ribs. Argh.. I was quite discouraged with the report. I would call it sloppy. It was done in the major Cancer Center, so one would think that they get into at least a few details just here and there, to show that they actually did some work. But all they did is pretty much say, less avid or use words as smaller and grossly unchanged! Would I accomplish something if I were to complain? Not so sure. She is on Xeloda 2wks on one wk off. Ixempra 3 wks. Herceptin 1 week on, 1 wk off, then on again. And Xgeva every 4 wks. Interestingly, her doc also took her off Letrozole, she said obviously she is not responding to Hormonal tx because she was progressing. Last week they skipped the infusions because her platelets were very low, and the Hemo. I think it's because of Xeloda. I would like to ask the doc If giving Herceptin more often would make a difference. Like 3 wks on. They seem to think she won't tolerate it well. She is extremely petite. So I think they are careful. Her Xeloda dosage is 1,000mg twice a day. That's it. I think it's wonderful that you are seeking more opinions. I believe also that you can't get good advice from the same place. Also, even in the same town, these docs stick like glue and they will want to defer to the other doc. Yes, it happened to us, a few times. Cowards, in my humble opinion. Instead of a blue wall, it's white. Also, could you explain how you will go about the Rational T? Where, what, when, how much...thanks a lot. Thank you leftfootforward, yes, the numbers, but somehow it does not paralel with the pictures. I still don't get the AST/ALT ALKPH getting better, and not having a/t change in the liver. Z i also would love to do a biopsy particularly on the liver, but doc is very against it. From my convo with her in the past, she prefers not to do procedures on D if she does not have to. I hope she is right. Bad at user I did look into this, so far I am not so convinced. Do you know of ppl that actually went. I was looking at a video but it seems you have to totally give up the treatment one is on, and other things, not so ready for it. ",

Dani and I looked like silly teenagers when we heard it was the lesion with have to deal with, so rads for now instead of surgery to the cervical area and upper thoracic. Only you guys could get that. I was telling her in the car, can you believe we are smiling that it's a tumor\u2026Insane! Don't think we don't curse each other out, she is very angry that I have to deal with it (she doesn't tell me that, but i know, because she knows how much it hurts me, but it's unspoken) ) and I'm always the bitch telling her the bad news, telling her about the scans that are probably due, shlepping her to one more doc, when all she wants is to live a normal life. Oh my gosh! What's a normal life???Cannot remember at all. Hope the kids are feeling better, it is awful to see them not well. Freya wow I could truly imagine what you are feeling, I must say we go through this all the time. Navelbine was D's onco's first choice. What about Xeloda, were you on it already?Tykerb? Those are supposed to help with liver for many here. What about biopsy, to check if anything change, would that be an option? It is nice to have a Onco that is willing to go the extra mile to help you. Warm hugs!! Hmm D's neutrophils were zero, ANC 0.06 you name it, but can I assume it was from the chemo? RO said something that she thinks it's getting worse, I should not be surprised, WTH, i assumed she didn't understand what's going on, I don't have the info in front of me from yesterday, but the WBC went up to 33 (Neulasta) i'd assume ANC would follow...that it's not the bone marrow...she also had quite a few rads...can't stop thinking about it. Rads to the spine next week, and brain MRI sunday, so maybe we'll know if this Ixempra/Xeloda/Herceptin is helping. I did see that CA15.3 that was going down and had Onco thinking treatment is helping, went up a few points this week, weird and weirder.... Do you guys take the CA15.3? Is it a marker the doc goes by, do be honest she would go by of how D is feeling also, but I have no details of the liver other than it's extensive mets all over the liver. (from Pet/CT)",

Letmywifel I do agree with Zar it's probably a different view. But interestingly, that's what I have been asking the boards since last week, Dani is on Xeloda since October, the last 3 blood tests, Alkaline Phosphate has been going up , like jumping up quite a few numbers for her. I am definitely concerned, because her Blood Tests have been a mess lately, I am not sure if it's from Xeloda or Ixempra. She actually was not able to get Ixempra as usual due to the extremely low numbers, so my question is: Is the liver acting up?? Her CA15.3 that Onco says would point to treatment performance was good and it has been going up, slowly but surely. I am very worried.I would love any ideas. This Wednesday she gets her next Pet/CT (just 6 weeks from the last), Onco was not shy in saying she wants to make sure, knowing how Dani's monster has never been quiet. I am even wondering if Pet/CT is a good modality for the liver? I hope so. It's just in your case the jump came so fast. Your wife is on 14 on 7 off? Dani was just changed to 7 on 7 off, 2000 a day.",

What could it show? How crazy is that????  If the ascites are there, they better get a move on it fast, time seems different for them. So I think, they see this all day long, because she could have these results by 4sh, i got it 430, why didn't she brainstorm already?? So here we go again. NO freaking break for her.

Sorry I am not greeting all the newcomers with the attention you deserve. I am following you and will try to be there for you. Cathy that was a disappointing experience, but hopefully they could figure out soon enough how to proceed. LindaE so glad you are starting the process, fingers and toes crossed. Stuffed, that's a new one. So finally the PET/CT was done, after the going back and forth with Insurance. We haven't heard from Onco, this would be too much to ask. We got the report a few hours after Dani finished the scan. PCP got it, and sent it to us. It's not good. There is progression in the liver particularly, with words like confluent now, where it was not like this before. 6cm is one for example.Bone mets, few are stable in FDG some got more avid, and larger. C1 which scares me, and others. Of course the lung nodule is still there, the last time Onco did not even mention it. Brain MRI tonight. Zarovka sweetie, thanks so much for the caring PM and the enormous amount of info and help in getting me to even start somewhere. You are great. Babs dear, thanks for your concern. Hope you are doing better today. Bens Mama so nice of you to share. It gives everyone a boost. I really need a crash course on Parp inhibitors \u2013 M TOR inhibitors. I remember hearing these words a long time ago, but haven't heard in a while. So I forgot. Who could tell me about the TP53 -I reread the F1 report on Dani, it says that it's splice site 375 G>A , WHAT IS THIS? am thinking because of Jen's link of Taxol with Reolysin, so I am grasping at straws does it make any sense? She has other alterations, but it's this something we could work with? I have no idea what Onco will hopefully recommend tomorrow, I'll email her again, and we'll see what she responds. Her answers are usually one sentence. I think it's best to see her personally no? We'll see if she will grant us a visit. The last time when we had to decide about the trial, she gave in to my insistent emails and called me, she was gonna take care of it through email. She is a decent person, I think, BUT i think for sure she has that wall set up as not to get too involved. One time, she responded to something I asked, and kinda suggested that D could be emotionally vulnerable, when I asked what she meant, she DID NOT respond, i let it go. Cure ious if you see this, i'd love your input. KD keep up the good work. Nice to know you've got such great support. It's everything. JFL good luck on your treatment. Keetmom for you too. And for the Mamas out there, hope you had a peaceful day.",

A lot of ladies had this, including Dani. Some people only get a local. Some something to just make them a little sleepy.

Even though i used to go to these things with Dani, it just felt wrong today. Now Im sticking around till they come home from school. That's what they want. So like sure!!! Anyway, how did you get the Bilirubin to lower?? It was through the roof for Dani, and doc didn't do a thing about it. I am super happy for you. Was it just the chemo?

Also relating to your question Miamix from what I saw with Dani her ALP surged crazy in her last 2 weeks close to 900 unthinkable for her, ALT/AST also went crazy so something must have really been going on, her numbers did absolutely not correspond to what the real status was from the scans. And she was almost always not well and it did not show in the numbers, but more on the scans. She was ALWAYS right about her body. I hate to tell you. Sometimes she felt better and then was disappointed when the numbers showed a different story. So sorry it's not a more optimistic straight forward issue.",

Kaayborg \u2013 I think about the ifs all the time. My thoughts are the opposite, are we wasting time by being in this stupid trial, instead of a strong chemo? In the trial, she is not allowed rads which might help quite a few things, and it's wait wait wait. The numbers I see in the BT are scary, but Onco seems convinced it's worth to wait another few weeks. Based on what? Nothing, bcs it is a trial. So\u2026there will always be that doubt. It's absolutely true about the wash out time, remember Dani couldn't get her Enzulatamide on time, we were so aggravated and when it did come it was already the 3 week mark for the wash out time this trial needed, so she jumped in and went for the trial. Prayers and prayers. To be honest, this is the constant worry that Dani goes through all the time, there is so much to be done, the kids need so much\u2026 Very interesting about the platelets, 15 flights huh, okkkk. Ebru such good news! Zar your take on it was hilarious.",

How many lesions in the liver? Would they radiate it? Is it in one lobe? The wonderful ladies here will chime in. WBR could be very helpful, go to the Brain thread also. Namenda is recommended. The best I could tell you is to go to at least one more opinion, you should feel better about the decision. If doc herself is telling you that she's not used to ppl with mets, then maybe it's time to look elsewhere. Keep us posted.  Dani's BT came back with very low platelets, and HGB, but still manageable, we are used to seeing this in her results. There is blood in the Urine, but they are not doing e/t crazy now, she will retake the tests next week and check on the status. Culture did not come back yet. So we are happy she does not have to go in to the Hospital.",

How many people would travel the world over alone to do what you are doing. You are fire girl!!! What does DD do while you having these infusions? How was it all taken care of?Z thanks for making me laugh!! I pray and pray that THIS should be the last thing taken from me. That sentence about your life not depending on this.

You are doing all you can. Wendy this is terrific!!! You came a long way baby. Oh Shetland let's hope for the best. Lindalou I cannot believe you are going through this. Grannax so glad u r home, could the rash be from pain meds? GUYS it's been a marathon every day. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! for thinking of us. I'll try to put it in a nutshell, since that horrid episode in the Cancer Center from HELL, 2 full weeks, we were emailing and calling Onco's office to ask what's next. NADA!!! One time Onco, emailed that she's working on it and will let us know. Baloney. I just sent a good healthy rant to the director of this sewer hole, and told them they are a disgrace to the public. BUT, more importantly i had to get SOME names of docs and opinions about what to do next, because these other place obviously is negligent. So, today Dani got Brain MRI and PET/CT ordered by a new doc at a new facility, and tomorrow we have to make the difficult choices. Obviously there is progression in the liver, the rest we'll know tom. This doc wanted a trial with Ruxolitinib but it's very new, Phase I and i told him I don't think we could afford to put Dani on a trial at this time. Who knows?? Anyway, then we went to Neratinib, that's the one he will prob offer tom. I'll throw in these others given by dif doctors, Abemaciclib, or Pembrolizumab, or chemo. The chemo would be a different type very regulated, 1) CAFVP. Has worked when resistance has developed to CMF or CMFVP. 2). Navelbine 25 mg/M2 weekly and Gemzar 400 mg every other week continuously. 3). Methotrexate 150 mg/M2, 5FU 350/M2 and Solu-medal 40 mg weekly with leucovorin rescue at 20 hours - take leucovorin 10 mg severy 6 hours x 6 doses. I am suppose to make this life decision tomorrow. NO WAY i can do this. It does depend on what the scans will show. Any takers, wise ladies and gentleman?? In a way yes chemo to knock it down, she has plenty of pain in the spine and back etc...i really don't know. (i'll prob post on the other threads so sorry for the doubles) Everyone waving at ya.",

Thanks for keeping tabs on us. Hey LindaE how are you doing? Bluebird very curious on what you will find out about Y90. Yesterday was a big scare again, after spending 7 hours, MRI again this time specific to thoracic, 2 docs visit, Faslodex shot - I left and she stayed on, just as I was getting home, she calls me the bleeding returned. I headed back asap, which was 1 hr, MO sent her to see URO, he was doing proceures, her hubby came running,we spent 4 hrs with much anxiety, then URO came and said, if it's not clotting, there is nothing they could do. This is gonna happen. The Hemangiomas had been fulgarized, and this is expected, something about the scabbing coming off, the truth IS it's so rare for a young woman to have it in the bladder, that they don't really know. In the bladder as is, about 3% of ppl only get it, males more than females, and certainly older ppl. Freaking unbelievable, that's what it is. We were sent home happily and scared stiff. She was just trying to do all the things that are scheduled and settling with what's ahead, and to have to deal with this level of anxiety, am I gonna bleed at the grocery suddenly? Is this gonna be the night to run to the ER due to retention, pain, clotting? How could this be any way normal?URO said, I'm sorry you have to deal with this crap, but\u2026 AND never mind that the 1st URO at that horrendous factory, told us unequivocally there would be NO bleed? Hmm that's weird. If anybody ever hear of this in the bladder, I'd love to hear. One URO at a dif place, was asked by our friend for an opinion, he said \"formalin embolization\" , this URO said that's crazy treatment for her, totally inappropriate. Today D started Rads for the thoracic and Orbital, and I gotta look at the reports than I'll know exactly details. Pray and pray that she should be able to be ok so she makes it to the intended day for Y90. A nurse there was trying to make me feel better, she said just pray, I kinda gave her that look like hmm yeah I am and \u2026so she said don't give up praying until you get what you are praying for. Deep and sweet. But it's hard.",

How upsetting that they were not in sync with you. Sending a PT really? Is there anyway you could have someone with you at the appointment, I think it could make a bit of a difference, to you they might feel more comfortable in disregarding, but if you have reinforcement it might just change the balance. Babs, you are absolutely right about your chart, know that Dani first of all if she's in the same institution if she has to see a new doc, at the questionnaire she writes see chart, see chart, they could look it up on the comp. If these young assistants come in, she says she will only speak to the doc, she does not waste time with them. And only a fellow is allowed in the room with the doc, she does not want a bunch of residents gawking at her, right or not, she is not in a clinic, and she feels most comfortable this way. Sometimes it takes a minute but they get with the program. Kayyborg that's really great that you feel it's going in the right direction. NO1-2NV I'm suppose to be writing tomorrow all kinds of pointers, to different departments, they asked me too. And yes, I shall mention this person. NOT to believe. Letmywifelive I dicussed this issue of these traveling doctors with a doctor, he told me that among them they have a name for these traveling souls \u2013 Delta professors, yep.

And it's nice to know that you are in good hands, but what I unfortunately found out is, it's almost best not to get THE best, THESE bests cannot and do not take the time and energy to think of the ppl that needs them the most.

The Y90 is ont chemo but a good healthy dose of radiation with the spheres. Gotta stay away from your pets (you should ask for how long) kids is best about 3 days, so we arranged it for her to have her 2 visits done at the end of the week, so my daughters slept there one night and the the other days being the weekend they came to us. She hates to be away from them. Even from hubby it's advisable not to get close at least 24 hrs. JFL I cannot hit any of the adjectives you had for the MO's, the last one was interested in her career. Period. There was NO communication, as you all could remember, she decided after a long time in what direction to go, no matter how many times we asked to be part of the equation, I don't care if she had a good heart, no meaness intended, empathy yes, but she was too busy traveling the World for academia to care about one soul. I will ask IR again, but from our past visit, he thinks TACE is harder on the body. After the mapping with the angio,Zar yes they put it through the femoral vein I think it's called. I would caution everyone, to have it done only at a place that you know does this a lot, after the procedure and the mapping they do a SPECT some type of nuclear medicine scan to make sure that they saw what they saw and it's not gonna go to a non targeted area. The more I read the more I see how it's advisable to do it. Also, from what I understood from the IR is that if the liver is less burdened of malignant lesions, the whole body could function and react to tx better. Dani has innumerable hypodense lesions, some of them were conjugated blah blah, he felt it as very urgent in her case. I do have to tell you that her enzymes AST/ALT/ALP are better!! I don't know if that means it will stay like this, but there was a drop of a few hundred.!!! It's very exciting, just a real pitty that she is loosing weight because of the rads to the Cspine area, to the mandibular etc..and she cannot swallow, Ziz she wants to eat, she just can't swallow. she's been on Carvel icecream but even water is hard. If it's not one thing is another. SO of course her hgb is low, potassium etc...because now there is some malnutriton. You know she had the idea for them to hook it up to so me IV Glucose, while she was doing the procedure for mapping and that brought up the hgb levels a bit. Babs did you get stuff for the constipation? You think the bloating is only from constipation? Those pain in the right side could be a nerve hitting the wrong muscle.It could be pain from the liver or a pain coming from the neck area. In the C level, just saying.

One thing is for sure, article after article, book after book you will see stories of doctors when they or their family become patients they then realize what's this all about. The waiting games that they put us through, the indignities, their whole outlook, forgetting that we are Human beings and something attached to us, not the other way around. I can't shake off this idiotic phlebotomist (im not sure what degree she had) coming into Dani's Hospital room and when D told her to be careful with her veins she said, Oh you are chemo? Kid you not. Don't worry, Dani kinda ate her ear off. But def, i felt the same way, i was working so hard doctoring these so called doctors, always looking over my shoulder, it's the bottom dollar that they worry about, that's it, nothing else. It's a real problem how much energy can one have to run around and figure out the best way to live, when they were suppose to devote themselves to this. I am sending you the warmest hugs, trying to keep you level headed. So sorry. Guys I posted an update on Dani's thread https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... not a very good one. She is back to zero. Treatment did not work. i'll check in on you guys, take care everyone, hoping Robin feels better soon, and Nina so glad they are trying to get you better.  ",

I needed and wanted so much to be BCO but I got a substitute full time job and to be honest the stress got to me. It's been a rough night. Yesterday we got the Pet/CT and Brain Mri for Dani back. So that everyone could follow, in brief, she is my daughter, a vivacious young mom. She has had Mets to the bones but yesterday the results came back, according to this Radiologist there is one spot in the liver 1.5cm, also the mesenteric thingy that has been growing on the left side of the abdomen, is getting bigger every time we do the scans. Some lesions on the skull got a few mms bigger. And the whole skeleton is still acting up, but not really getting bigger just not really smaller. So they call that part stable, so he thinks some of the stuff she is taking is working. Hmmm hard to think. Ladies, I will be speaking to doc in the morning, If you see this, what's your opinion on \"one small lesion\", does it make a difference if it's small, or once it invaded the liver it's a different \"monster\". Doc told me last nt, oh, it's so small, maybe they will just radiate it. But should a biopsy be done? I really don't know how I am going to tell her, she deals with what she has to, but she was so hopeful. She does not want the details. In her everyday life she is a force to reckon, but this is just too hard (that's where I come in, she relies on me, looking out for her, doing research and getting her to a good place). The lesions on the skull, were supposedly stable after some Gammaknife, but now it started growing again. Yes, not by much, but growing. He is considering Proton therapy for this. (to some of them) She is now on Ibrance/Letrozole, Tykerb/Herceptin. ER+PR+(less than 1%), and HER2+ (FISH +++) Her status of HER2 changed from the original HER2- to HER2+ on biopsy a year ago. Could it have changed again?? Maybe he is thinking of adding Immunotherapy to it. She has been on everything already, besides some very new ones. WHAT is going on?? She will be devastated, I really don't know how to tell her. All info and opinion on this is so appreciated. ",

Regimen, Navelbine 2 wks on/1 wk off with Herceptin every 3wks, and Xgeva 6wks. That's IT. What say you?? I don't recall who is on Navelbine, I think I just read about it yesterday. I have to reread some threads, but cannot do it today, that's for sure.Was a bit of a anticlimax, about the Treatment. Xeloda maybe some other time, and she has some clinical trials in mind and biologics in the future. What's biologics, could not understand. She's not into Immunotherapy for Dani's case, it's not proven yet. Well during the physical, ANOTHER node was found under the axila, REALLY??( what the\u2026) so off for a PET/CT she goes again, probably still this week, waiting for approval. And I guess then it will be definitive. Still have to see Rad Onco this Friday particularly for the skull Mets. Maybe they will keep Letrozole. Ibrance is a gonner, she does not think it's helping in Dani's case. Liver depends what this PET/CT shows. If it's next to each other, if it already got larger? Ablation, maybe? Z, I have to ask her about the Alpha lipoic Acid. .Really wanted Xeloda now. But... She did see in F1 Dani may have the mutation TP53, she wants to do a BT to make sure it's in the tumor and only in the tumor not in the whole body(which she does not think it is, but just to make sure for the sake of the relationship with kids/sibs, to make sure it's not Genetic).Otherwise she does not think there is much to get to TP53. Off to Geneticist we went, she will do the BT when she comes in for the infusion. Also of course the newer mutations, like PALB2. Also in one of the threads I remember much convo regarding Luminal, yep, she weighs this. Dani has Luminal B, and that says a lot about the status. She can't do Tykerk/Xeloda, bcs in that trial if u were on Tykerb already then it's a no no. Everyone it's been a long day, but I thought of you guys the whole time. I was able to understand a lot due to our conversations here. Check on you tomorrow! Great night to everyone.",

      "Content": "Aug 11, 2016 05:13PM - edited Aug 11, 2016 05:18PM by momallthetime So I finally got to everyone. I am mainly now on this thread, and the brain mets one. Dani is being watched for one large lesion on the skull and innumerable \"others\". So, I am in constant guard, that this systemic tx works, so to get that particular lesion down also. I am really concerned for her weight loss as I wrote above. DancingVegg so sorry, it must be really tough to have all that xtra fluid. You get rid of the ascites on your own? Holeinone I think they are trying the mildest chemo for her bcs of QOL, there is something to it, but I am concerned that maybe she needs something stronger. As I wrote just before, loosing 10lbs in 4 wks, weighing at 87 even for a small frame, it's really scary. I wonder if they are paying attention to it. I am quite freaked out. Holeinone, if you are the type that likes to know, then why not look at the report yourself. I know many many people, including my sweet daughter, do not wanna deal with all the ugliness. It's too much. Sandilee cheers for good news, it gives hope to everyone else. Gramen I think you are the only other person that I know that is on Navelbine/Herceptin. Hope it works for Dani also. JFL that's exactly how it is with Dani. She never got a break since mets dx. Constant progression. JFL, everyone is talking about Xeloda, and she is on Navelbine. I know what you mean about no rads, that really makes me upset. And being that when she was dx with mets, she did have a status change, and being that none of the tx work for her, I do think she could have had a status change again. Everything, from the get go, was weird about her C thing. Just getting it at 25 with no history, and the aggressive progression, just awful. JFL so how old are your kids now? So you had to wait to have the baby and then started tx? Dani's BC was found by her, while nursing her 3mos old. Gyno refused to send her for a mamo, he said she was too young to have BC! Yep, we went on our own to Rads place, payg privately, and the rest is history. I hear this stories over and over. JFL yeah I know what you mean. People definitely have different relationships. And some ppl just can't deal with it. Part of me still does not believe it. But I really have no choice. She is extremely close with her sisters, and hubby is great, but she can't bring herself to talk about it at all with them. She really thinks that if she does not discuss it, they won't think about it, meanwhile, 24 hrs a day, I could tell you they only think about it. They are not moving away, bcs they wanna be nearby, and they are always available to help with the kids, when I have to be with her. They designed their work and fun around her needs. Actually, she prob knows about it, but there is no talk about it. Hugs to you sweetie, I know it's tough. Babs thanks sweetie. Kaayborg aww thank you so much. I see your girls, and I see Dani's. They look a bit like yours, also the 10yr old is much taller then the 8 yr old. You guys make me hope. Onco said it's possible to get rid of the tumor burden she has kinda of, she put the number at 60/70% ONLY! I am the one that asked, it's possible to get rid of it, then she gave me that answer. To tell you the truth she did not look very comfortable. Artist thx for the support. Coming to this site, has been a true support for me. Who else could understand all the nuances. Here is for the hope that innumerable mets to the liver is just another bump! Holeinone is it not from the liver not working properly? I know it happens sometimes. If you do take diuretics, keep in mind to be well hydrated. Cristina so sorry Xeloda did not work. But great that you have this appointment. Who are you seeing over there? Cristina I have to add if you are still looking for the slides, you could reach the Pathology Dept. and they usually send it directly to the other institution. You have to sign a paper releasing it, and they communicate directly with the other place. What I did, was I went personally to take it, and took responsibility for it, and took it to the other place, but you need to be able to travel back and forth, and it may be difficult for you. The same with the reports, if you sign a release hey send it electronically in no time to the other place. That was my experience. Good luck for you! Hugs to all of you",

Like everyone has said over here and in other threads, it's a constant waiting game. Always being courteous to the secr (the gatekeeper!), and then begging for the Queen to respond to you. Gramen totally get you. That's why Dani does not want anyone to know. With her sibs, they are there if once in awhile she comments on her hair not really growing back, (last chemo was in 2014, and she barely has a pixie look), but otherwise she does not want pitty looks, or rubs in the back! How about just having at least a stage IV gathering? There is no point in mixing the 2 breeds! Much different concerns! Here, here for a peaceful quiet weekend.",

You make a lot of sense, and get that. I believe I am dealing with a sophisticated bunch at this Center, she specializes in mets. BUT I must tell you they don't really really understand what is like to every day having to deal with the nitty gritty of this monster. I am always trying to make them FEEL life from Dani's point of view. They are respectful, as when I tell them that all her scheduling has to be around the fact that she wants to be home when the kids are back from camp, school etc\u2026 But I keep bringing her back to life, that this is a thinking person, with the same desires, hopes as someone that does not have this thing!! When I met NP I told her how I am the front for Dani and her hubby and it's too much to wait many days to know what's going on with the enzymes\u2026and then I spoke to her about her family a bit, to Humanize her, and then I gave her a big hug (well she was nice at the visit), we have to bring these ppl down to earth, that they are not just dealing with numbers and patient number, but there is a real Human Being behind all that. NP did email me the next day Friday with the BT results, no so good, TM's going up and they decided that they will do scanning at the end of the 2nd cycle and not wait. And best of all Dani did tell me that Onco mellowed out a bit. Zar I haven't gone to the bone mets thread yet, what's going on with you? What happened to the scans in the other place? Any treatment plan different than what you are on now? Oh ZIZ really appreciate it. Keeping good vibes for your scans. I asked them about radioembolization, someone mentioned to me as an idea to lower the tumor burden, but they told me that if it's really all over the liver, and not contained it would not work. If this tx does not work now, I really feel we have to do something. I am not ready to throw in the towel. Every doc I spk to, sooke to my private doctor, spoke to NP from prior Onco, and these new docs, all seem so pessimistic and then I read this thread, and people are doing well, so I don't really understand.",

I am waiting to see what the TM's and enzymes will show this week, I'll prob only know in the middle of the week at the portal, as I said they make us wait for results.

I would have liked because I keep thinking what if it shows a different property than the other biopsies she had done, but Onco thinks it would not change protocol, and she does not wanna mess with the liver. Her liver is pretty much full with tumors, with Xeloda it has gotten very few to a lesser size, but so far it was not significant. She had the F1 done then one yr later due to progression Guardant 360 biopsy and both confirmed the same dx. I still would like to do the liver biopsy, I'll give it some more time with Xeloda but if it doesn't change on the next Pet/CT maybe I'd try to push some more. Also, I keep thinking if an MRI would show more details in that organ, but they keep doing only the Pet/Ct. the truth is Onco discusses e/t with a tumor panel, so it's not only her opinion, but I still would like more details. Robin so sorry Xeloda did not work for you. I also put so much into it that this would work for D's liver tumors. For her, Onco said it's way too many lesions for ablation. It grew from 2 very small ones, to multiple within about 4 wks we were stunned. But then Onco dragged her decision to put her on Xeloda bcs she was afraid of toxicity and QOL, so they put her on Navelbine (did nothing for her), she was on Herceptin and Ixempra also. So they finally changed to Xeloda 2000mg a day, after 2 scans were showing no improvement on Navelbine. Now she is on the 4th cycle of Xeloda. Still hoping. They are too cautious I think. She is young and very very petite ( at this point her weight is minimal), I'd like to see them be more aggressive. Zar thanks for the info about the \"reasonable\" approach, it makes me feel a little better. Happens to be that's what Onco tried telling us, I just don't like to hear it. Sharethehope I am sorry but this guy seems way out of touch. And when a doc talks to you like that, there is not too much hope he will do his best. I don't think you have a/t to lose in going to someone else. Oh my gosh you are a baby at 75, it's the new 50! You kidding! Puleaze, attitude is more important. I've seen young ones very sick. Age per se, should not be a barometer what your tx should be. My mom was 95, she behaved like someone in her 60's. Jewelry to her last day! Awaiting with you guys on your biopsies!  ",

Her tumors were just progressing so she added on the Xeloda. And she takes Xgeva every 4 wks. Being triple+ maybe you could ask for Herceptin added, they have studies that Herceptin with Ixempra (chemo) is very beneficial. Just saying k.

Desperation at that time was at all high level. That's where you are at now. Do you have other options? Then do it. Instead of driving off the mountain, sit by it, look out at the beauty. Please don't drive off yet k. We are all in the same boat, you are not alone. Let us be there for you. Please look at where your options are, if you want I could help you look into it.

My Hubby takes it, he is not diabetic but doc wants him to watch himself, and he lost a little, not that he needs to, so I told him I want also, but I can't because my sugar levels are good, aghh. Louis, you made me laugh out loud! You are on the ball. If not now, then when is a husband for? Difficult? Of course it is, beyond words. I try very hard to be in touch with my SIL, he is very attentive to all D's needs, I can't even ponder what it would be like if not. We live 30 mins away, I or her sibs are there, in a blink of an eye, if an appointment arises( all the time), and I go with her a lot to the docs, but it's not the same as being in the house. And trust me, she does not want Mom in the house! Besides, she is very independent, and wants to be as much and long as possible. Hubby helps with the kids, again we do when we can. But, he is the plant! We'll keep him. I started with sleeping pills, the moment this thing wears off I am thinking about the situation, too hard. And therapist is great for everyone, you are doing a great service to the fam in getting support. Z this is just extraordinary. Seriously, who could keep up with this. Margarine is good for you then it's not. And so on. I gotta read and reread this stuff. D was on Lupron when she was on A/I \u2013 at the time I don't know a/t about estradiol. So I don't know. That's Dani's motto, normal. So there is not much talking about \"IT\" unless she needs to tell me something. I don't know how she does it not really discussing it with anyone, but it is what it is. You guys are so correct, I think all doctors tend to overlook a lot of things. I do put it in excel, but it's such a mess, that I don't even know a graph would help. The portal has a graph for vitals but nothing about treatment. I looked over the synopsis sent to D's primary, he faxed it to me, and it says, that her HGB was 7.5, and \"wants to wait for lab results next wk for transfusion\", it's a straight out lie. We never said a/t. I did not know her labs were so low. That's the day she went in just for the Neulasta shot, I did not go, and they said there was no space for a transfusion chair till Monday. It was Thursday. I am fuming. Now what? I don't really wanna call them on it, because we need very much their attention now, things are shaky, but I don't like it. Still dealing with the mess they made with the report being wrong, and some docs missing it by not looking at the images, and only by getting a 2nd opinion they caught up with it, now they are trying to make nice. Last week no Xeloda due to tanked #s, she started back on it at the end of last week, and had to stop again due to rads to the T1/T2. And now doc is thinking in changing treatments altogether. Hmm, we have to wait for them to let us know when to come in. I am none too happy about all that. Tonight is Brain MRI follow up. So much is gonna be talked over. No treatment for 2 weeks. Herceptin only. Lita, what's doing?",

Even middle age women many don't just change to fatty breasts automatically. Anyway, I am quite schooled at it, she should definitely have at least a sono or even an MRI at least for a baseline and then every year due to your family History. It's a fact that nowadays they know that just saying Mamo is good and having dense breasts is misleading. They cannot really see even in 3D Mamos specificities. And it's best if she has this done at a place that only does Mamograms and so on. I have lots of experience with my daughters at this age and younger, so my antanae goes up! You could message me if you need more info. KD \u2013 Halaven could be great.Good luck with that. I could literally feel your disappointment in the Medical world. I and many others feel the same. First just to clarify If you don't do this yet, make sure to get a copy of the reports after every single time that KD has a test. If it's difficult to obtain it from docs office, as in favors \u2026then if it's easier call the place that you had it done and tell them to fax it to you, or if you have a good rapport with PCP have them fax it to him and get it from there. Also wait to get the CD. Or at least if they don't want to give it to you while you wait, ask it should be sent to you. I do this. I usually have the report before Onco decides to call. She usually does not. I email her and tell her the report is ready if she could look at it, and let us the poor souls know what's the next step. But I can't just wait till she is ready to let us know. And this way, I could look stuff up with Dr Google, get info from the wonderful people here, a lot of the lingo we know already, so she can't just be evasive about certain things. Like the last time, she was telling me that yeah, she sees progression from the liver blah blah and I am like yeah, BUT the ascites\u2026aghhh, I hate when someone thinks you are too stupid to understand. And the mass in the lung. She didn't even, although Dani told her many times that she should discuss with me everything. And most of the time I know things because I look at the report, and even that is not totally reliable. The last time, radiologist totally misread D's mass in the T1 and disc area, saying it was a herniated disc(which is bad enough) but the advice was surgery and not the radiation she ultimately had due to a miracle of another doctor actually looking at the images instead of just reading the report. I tell you all this, so you could learn from our experience. And yes, you know Louis, I am right there with you. D also does not wanna \"know\" the ladies. She asks her sibs for names of books and movies that absolutely do not have \"C\" in it, we totally understand. Even more now, that there is so much going on in her body, and she still wants to be The Mom and Wife, so she cannot have this as part in her life. She treats it as a nuisance. Nothing to see here, move on. She's gotta make it to PTA. I think some doctors (in any field) like informed consumers, they think it's helpful to e/o goal. But some like the idea that they are the Chief and we are their pawns or not worth it of their time. Just in and out of the office. Letmywifelive wow we know you were so worried which direction the mets were going, so great that tx is working. Hope the SE's are manageable. And yes, let's ALL be bold to pray for regression.",

I dont'want this liver thing to get out of control, that's my fear. But I will only know the new results in a few days. So I'll keep an eye on this one. From what I read on Dr Google, yes, it was disturbing. And no, they are not there to really explain, she doesn't wanna ask. I did not go with her, I will not go tomorrow, and I thought I would wait one more time, if it's still up I will email them. Would you know from any other #s that are liver directed that I should watch for? Ast/Alt are still in the low 60's. So I can't tell.

Tomorrow she is due to continue with the Trial, so she won't be able to be with the kids, she hates that. This thing is always invading in the moments of life. But we'll be with the kids, and try to distract them. D's sisters are taking the day off and going hiking with them. Not bad. I hope you are coming out of your funk soon. You also miss your daughter, these things are not easy. Stefajoy sorry you are here, but it's good they are doing a biopsy. Dani's lesions are visible on the US, they were originally detected in the Pet/CT, but just now she had a scare, so they finally did a US, and they got measurements seem to me very precise. So go for it, it takes a little time to get the results, I even called F1 directly after a week or so, and got the results from them, by the time they sent the results to doc and doc called us, I had it already. Everyone else take good care,",

You have been through a lot, it's nice to hear some calming news. Letmywifelive thanks for your pm. Sandi cheerleaders are always needed. Grannax what about a sono? Could you get that done so it's not consider like a major scan, and they could see ascites with a US. Scwilly I know the same as what Zar mentioned, it hurts when it gets really bad. But this whole thing goes prob with the story of losing one's limb and still feeling it. You are concerned and rightfully so. Naturegirl2 aghh so sorry. You certainly had a longer run with Navelbine than Dani did. Gemzar is suppose to be very good also but it's quite tough,but she was taking it while on Afinitor, even after she stopped Afinitor she had hair loss. But it's powerfull stuff. Leftfootforw good for you. MJH, Artist, Kaayborg waving to all. I for sure let someone slip by, so sorry If I did. Lynne it's a talent to be able to look at things this way. But it's the only way, hope is a powerful elixit. Zar are you back from the adventure? How did it go? Thanks for all the insights, all very helpful. You are like my private lioness. Babs thanks for checking in on behalf of the crew. Hope you are coming along.Great pictures of your lovely daughter, proud mama. I feel so bad that I got you guys worried. I don't like to turn off from this group. I find comfort in these pages. You guys are amazing. But I was just going and going. And by the time I got to the computer to write, I was spent. It's that simple. Things are under control now, Dani is chugging along, not bad at all, she has fatigue and nose bleeds, which was a concern, but it was decided that it is what it is. She starts her 3rd cycle this week, it's 2 weeks and then it's scans, they might do it a bit earlier if the #s are still messed up, part of me wants her to go the full throttle and part wants to be able to catch before things get out of control. My Uncle started treatment already. He actually is making use of a new Immunotherapy for his cancer with few supposedly SE's. It's just the things of life. He has a folly. This is a very proud charming man and a charmer at his age, so it's not sitting well with him. But we finally decided on the different doctors and care he needs, so it's a relief. ",

Meanwhile, the Pet/CT that I was hoping for Dani, was negated by Insurance. They say they will only ok a CT. She never had just a CT? How would they compare it to the last scan, which was a PET/CT?? are they willing to take such a chance? They could see the History. They are so ignorant. I am upset also at onco's office, i don't think their hearts are aching, they are dragging their feet with that. Tomorrow we'll have to be more stern about it. Dani did not want to rattle the office, she is going in tomorrow for the last infusion of this cycle, but she will tell them, that her life is too precious for them to just sit back and let some bureaucrats decide on what's best for her.

Onco's office said they left a message with Insurance, when Insurance called back they said they could not get hold of doc.Whatever. The thing is she's off treatment comes the 31st 3 freaking weeks. I am so nervous, cannot even begin to explain. I could send a whole expletive email, it was in my head a whole night.  Well, short of it, i am thinking if i should send an email, telling her of our apprehension, And something to the effect that we really were hoping the office would have taken care of it. Yes, Insurance could be difficult, but the way we see it, onco's office just leaving a message and making a note to follow up, i think that's the real problem. they call, do something else for 3 hours, then when we call them they say oh yeah, we'll try again, and they allowed this to get to Friday pm, when they close!! Friday is almost not a day there, i learned they only know of 4 days(making fun, but it's like that), and with this long weekend, don't they have a responsibility in making sure their ppl have a supposedly life saving treatment. I just know that her liver mets expanded, and there is progression, so how could they in good faith go to their boats....I am really very mad. And very anxious!!! I think i'll write something, not harsh, but let Onci have it an email, they don't like that, because i think their email get checked by big brother from time to time, and it won't look good for her. If anyone wants to draft something, by all means. I just pray to God this thing does not go out of whack. ",

Just to confirm it says it's only .2%but it does not show any amp, for the ones that showed amp there were some suggestion of the therapies that she then tried and they did not work. So go figure!. Stephanie, can't believe you put so much effort into this. Thank you so much, love the links, and you make it so easy to understand. I read the stuff, but believe me I gotta reread it. You write so eloquently. It's exactly what you said about being a professional patient. We gotta be informed, and try to ask the right questions. As I told Kayyborg I read it once, but I gotta study it now. And is BRCA really driving her tumor - especially if brca was not mentioned at all in Foundation 1 biopsy of the hip bone, in Jan. 15, but only now by guardant 360 (blood biopsy). What you guys wrote seems like poetry. And someone else in a dif. thread sent me another link with the same idea, incredible. I call you guys, my peeps, my true friends. So helpful. I am wondering should he have not seen it back in Jan., when the blood biopsy was done. Would that not be able to be used asap. Why wait to get to this point, and only bcs I pushed him to spk with a colleague and review the plan. There are a few others that have the same low %, so maybe he should look into those also. I am still working on the 2nd/3d opinions. And I still would like to know if the majority of ladies here, did you have a biopsy of the liver tumor done when liver mets were discovered? And any rads? Timothy rant away. And you have all the right to do so. What was the delay in diagnosing your wife's cancer, if I might ask. This is what we have to do. For me my daughter going through it it's just as if I were going through it, but worse, bcs, she is so young so much to live for, her family, life and I wanna try to stretch this as long as we can. It's really absurd. I am sure it's just a bad dream and someone will wake me up soon. Hope you get good advise asap. Thank you so much for all your help. Love ya.",

I could tell you 3 Oncos did not respect Guardant much, Dani had it done, and even the Onco that ordered it, did not think it was so precise. And in these posts here, whoever knows about it's grandiose, feels that it's circulating so the blood has to have the circulating mutation just at the right time. But F1 is respected, she had it 2 1/2 yrs ago, and hopefully if they finally got it all right (Onco's office) the order went out to send the liver biopsy to F1 and see if a/t new shows up. g LMWL just form experience, UCSF does make more sense at this time. I usually like aggressive thinking and treatment, but this b..h of a monster, took me down and I am learning to slow down and be more patient. Not much but a bit more. You doing good, hope your wife will feel better soon. It is weird that from 1.2 to 1.6 Stamford should consider as progression and change tx so fast. Babs i have someone in mind that is from Paris, trying to get in touch with him, will def ask. Today Onco sent an email after I kinda said that I'd love to hear about the PDL1 reuslts, that they tried ordering the PDL1 mutation check on D's liver biopsy, but dear old Weill Cornell does not want to test it, they say they only do it for lung cancer. She's asking them to send it to an outside lab. I told her they will fall behind times. But truth be said, did anyone ever hear of MBC with PDL1 being treated with Keytruda (for example), that's one of the things Onco had in mind for sometime in the future. I wonder why the clinical trial does not do any CA27.29 checking, she did not have that done in ages. Everyone thank you so much for all your support, i push myself a lot, because I think what would this one say what would this other one do? I got you angels with me all of the time.",

Also re:PET/CT - Onco insist in doing skull base to tight, not full body like she used to have. Is it really harmful at stage IV to have Pet/CT to the full body? How long does it take for radiation to actually harm the body, would it not be worth the benefit of knowing now what's up as opposed to what might be from the repeat Pet/CT, she will be getting it anyway but not to the extremities or to the head, how could that matter?

I must comment on your picture Kaayborg, oh my gosh, they are just so precious!! Love it! Zar also has little ones, and I see with Dani it's just so hard! How much can you ask of someone? You doing great. I don't even know how to address what's going on. Pet/Ct done. Onco EMAILED me late pm (after I emailed her that PET is done, so she should know) so she wrote that it shows higher SUV everywhere. AND progression. She could have called. I don't understand these ppl. What's wrong with them. Yes, it takes time, BUT when after a 4wk period PET/CT shows such ugly differences I THINK they should take 5 mins and call the person.I can't even\u2026. Anyway she told her to come in for in for BT (which she said it could be next wk, and I am like NO, we will be there early tomorrow!) anyway to make sure about the therapy. Off she went on Friday. Then we had a meet with Rad Onco for the lesion on the skull that has a life of it's own. They really wanna do Rads, but there will definitely be loss of hair and no regrowth. And it's right at the front close to the forehead. So how do you fix this? So major problem. Dani is really not happy about it. Downright angry. Onco ordered an MRI of the Brain for this week, and THEN if it's still going crazy she might not have a choice, if it's not, Rad Onco is willing to give it a chance with systemic, hopefully. (D is already working on a wig with bangs, she sent me a picture, I guess it's her way of saying she knows she might have to go that way) Liver: innumerable lesions from 2 discrete ones! And physiologic uptake in the spleen, gastro tract, renal and urinary bladder. What does that mean? The monster is in these areas? I did not get detailed explanation. Could someone explain it to me.And all the bones the SUV is higher by almost double. And the mesenteric left quadrant that I keep telling them it gets bigger all the time. And uptake on the right Hilum. Are we talking lung here?? And nothing much on the node that doc felt! Something there but they are not sure what. Seriously, should I go bonkers now?? What is she thinking, this so well renowned new Onco, I have to call her tomorrow and she will run the BT results with me and that's it? I really hope when I call like 9AM and tell secr that I wanna come in, that she will welcome me. It's hard to get all that through the phone!!! So now I worry about this stupidity. They took her off Ibrance already, she is onlyon Letrozole and Herceptin. Soo nervous. I asked again about biopsy, and Onco was not keen about it. She doesn't think it's gonna show something new. Hmm I don't know, that was before when we only knew of 2 lesions in the liver. I am stunned really, HOW could this be? And D does not know yet, I could not bring myself to tell her b4 the weekend. Docs, Onco and Rad Onco agreed that thereis no need to tell her at this point, about the enormity of the status. She knows it's not good. She did not even ask me if I got the report. We'll make a plan and then if it makes a difference for her we'll tell her, if not then we would try to push it till next scans. She is busy. Today is outing with the kids. There is not time for this nonsense!!! I am really shaking, and it's been 3 days already. No one would know. I went about my business, doing what I gotta do. Did not tell my other girls, trying to go easy on this. AND, wait, you know it's always interesting with us. On the way back, after literally a whole day in the city, we had a cab, and someone rear ended his car, twice, I kid you not, we are ok, the guy had to wait for the police, we left and had to take 3 trains home!!! That was actually funny!! Everyone thank you.",

How is your hubby? How is he taking this? Helping you out? Stephanie, thank you so much for your quick and good response. I tell you, she has not had much of an appetite for a long while now, she eats when she wants. But she is scared of eating sugar and white flour this last year, so she is more limited. And she does not like wheat. She tried that. She eats infrequently, only when she is hungry. If I say something about that, she gets very upset. To be perfectly honest, part of it has to do that she does not want to see herself \"as sickly\" so she does not want to entertain a real way to combat this. your recipes of foods seem to make a lot of sense to me, but she rebels. I could ask for doc to approach her next week and suggest a nutritionist next week. But they cannot use words as \"in your case\" she will ram them down! am afraid it's cachexia because she had this lack of food delight for awhile now, and only now she had this drastic weight change. Babs, she is not nauseous. Well I sent an email to MO, no answer! I am gonna call tomorrow. The foods sound just right, I gotta get it across to her. Thanks. ",

In my case, of course being hopeful and optimistic is the only way. I do pray every day that something else will be in the Horizon. But the fear is real. Carol, dear, thanks so much for reaching out. How are you doing? Yep the disappointment is tremendous. As Zar said, it's so true about bringing back the memories, everytime, and funny as it may sound, every year it's been difficult but the worst always happened about the same time of the year, very odd. Carol, you are not alone. And they do have many different treatments, when is your next set of scans? Patti are they doing a/t for the small lesions? I just feel that maybe they could have done some ablation as soon as they found out about Dani's lesions, they were only two at first, but they didn't wanna do it. Longterm I know how you always have us in mind. Thank you. I actually think back to you, when they wanna go on that trip that it's really serious, I say, no, I know people that are doing well. You give us so much inspiration and support, thank you. I will try to make a long story short, the last PET/CT showed MORE lesions, bones, liver AND brain!! So Onco immediately made a change for Ixempra weekly. Herceptin every 3wks. Dani was still having rads to the spine, and now she's having for the Brain. And there was a visit to Neurosurgeon, if some big lesions are not gonna shape up at the end of another 6 wks, then it's surgery. First Ixempra seems to be quite hard on her, the whole 9yards of symptoms of chemo, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain,and extreme fatigue. I tried the Ixempra thread, believe it or not, there are only very few responses on it. Does anyone here know anything about it. If Dani could take that another few wks, they would add Xeloda to the mixture. But so far she needed IV fluids, so let's just really hope she is able to stand it for awhile. These nasty liver mets really gotta get down, and some bone mets too. The whole time we were under the impression that we were able to do Rads for those large lesions on the skull, and Surgeon tells us now, NO. And even that area is considered Brain mets. We had no idea. Now this Surgeon is in his late 30's, yes wonderful background, but Brain surgery for someone like maybe 39? I am told by numerous persons from the group that he is fantastic. Yes\u2026. To all wonderful ladies, feel well.",

Re: Opdivo, I know someone with Ovarian Cancer on it now in a trial in California. W/T knowing much about a/t this does sound very promising and if you were to add Abraxane wow could be a real punch. I can't believe you have to deal with this now?? The beginning of the year? Are you still on with the school? So sorry, it's a real punch. Yeah, Dani had the Gaurdant360 but Onco is not a fan of it, it was done and it could be helpful, but her take is that it's circulating cells so it may not be so accurate. Liver biopsy should give you more details. It was sent to F1. JFL was your HER2 sent for FISH? Is that what showed 2+ equivocal, because if so, I could tell you Sloan and Cornell treat it as def HER2+, and yes they give those tx appropriate for it, no doubt. Dani is even continuing on the trial that specifically tagets HER2+ even though she started with an older biopsy showing Triple positive HER2 and then recently with the new liver biopsy it's 2+",

Truly a full time job. So sad in reading your post. That's right, you have so much to do. All that goes on here, I see it happening in our lives also. Dani had a \"nice\" size met in the bony cheek, and when we were looking at the brain scans ( the head etc..) with RO, they noticed it, but it was NOT in the report? Really??Shetland regarding your question, of course a 2nd opinion is always good, not so simple though, because the way I see it they would not just give you an opinion but wanna see your whole record. That's what happens with D, when we were in discussion for Rads, the RO wanted all the past radiation hx, all the chemos blah blah\u2026. Having said all that, I've been asking for ct scan for a while for the livers, even after Pet/CT, but Doc is basing herself only on TM's, enzymes and Dani's feeling. None of them are good, and that's why she changed her therapy again. I just think that CT are better modalities for this, but Doc does not.The truth is usually, liver mets are not painful until is very aggressive, the pain or uncomfortability would be radiating on the right side and/or even shoulder pain. But they should listen to the patient, I find that people feel and know what's going on with their bodies.",

It is so true about people not being able to handle illness. And as Zar and others told you, zap it. It is very painful, it is not the way you envisioned it, but to spend your time mulling over THEIR weaknesses will distract you from the care you need for yourself. They must be scared and angry that this is going on with you, and many people I find that instead of dealing with the real issue head on, blame the person that is the least blameless. Hope you could rest after Cyber, Dani also had that done, the procedure itself was hellish with the screws pressing etc\u2026but it did help at the time, and she was able to feel better not too much after that. And Shelby, Stephanie was right on target. For sure it's something you should do asap, you need a Proxy, where you inform who could and should make decisions for you, and Power of Attorney. Who could access your info, finances, blood work etc\u2026 If your relationship is so volatile, will your sister be there when a tough decision will have to be made? Will they allow hospitals and doctors just to act in what they think should happen to you? All this paperwork is not foolproof, but at least it's something, it's best to be notarized with witnesses. It really gets my blood boiling, I've been in these situations many a times. Either the nurses come in and ask to do stuff the patient does not want, or for instance if you find yourself in the Hospital and your \"real\" friend is at your bedside they will not give her info if she is not listed on your directives. Lita would you take a sleeping pill, Ambien maybe? Would that help. Gina best wishes for Pauline. Kandy a big hug for you. Are they thinking in radiating at all?

Also, Onco showed us the results for FoundationAct, (she had done FoundationOne, and the blood circulating one), but this was taken just a few weeks ago, on this recent one, it showed that one of the mutations is KRAS G12D equivocal. (0.36%)(Trametininb and or Combimetinib) in Clinical trials (but it's not in NY she said, it was closed) meanwhile she will start her on Xeloda. Zarovka, I know you are very interested in this. So KRAS really??? And it was not there before?Hmm this is an ugly one. Did you ever hear about it? ERBB2 (which we knew already) which only Herceptin MIGHT be doing something for her, all others nothing. TP53 splice site 375g ESR1( and a bunch acoompanying that) Onco did not say, but she did not look happy, she seemed worried. And we were so preoccupied with the Brain mets that we did not go into deep convo about the KRAS business. Also, they were not so helpful in giving us info on blood work results for prior week, saying that we could look at the portal, BUT the portal gives info only 4 days later, and then 3 days later again, so we (I) cannot prepare enough before next visit, which is weekly now. Not weekly with Onco, but weekly for infusion, but if I see something, I could ask or call attention, but there were so many things going on that I just did not have the energy to tell them they were being insensitive (in a nice way of course), but the hell with it. We also met with new Onco Neuro, bcs surgeon that RO sent us to, told us that she needs surgery if things don't get better, but it was bothering me that RO had told us that she would do Radiation, so instead of going back and forth, we saw Neuro, and that day, 10 days ago she went straight from his office to MRI for the Brain, bcs she felt new things, and he saw that the MRI done 4 wks prior had not shown that. So, he called the next day that he communicated with all the docs, and he scheduled her for Radiation this week. She started this week. He said absolutely NO surgery, bcs there are so many tumors first of all, and surgery is really harsh and what happens in 2 wks if something else pops up, and she absolutely cannot afford to be off any therapy! I thought I was in a cuckoo house, but again no time to point fingers and tell them as Shetland said, this is a major Center, and you guys are screwed up. For 3 wks, we were thinking she will have to have surgery of the brain. Now she is getting IMRT, very precise Rads, and they will target many, not all. Including the mandibular. Then, wait for it, Ins. calls that they will only pay for WBRT whole brain rads, which is very difficult, and rescinded of earlier approval. Then, only 2 days ago they finally approved. So Ins person calls me to say this, BUT then she tells me, you know now that she used her 3 line therapy the next treatment will have to be peer approved...(what was until now, it took a few days every time). And she started telling me you know ppl in this situation, I was like and how is your family doing? ... And this is with good Ins, my sil tells me they pay so much, I am so scared thinking what will be when we need to move forward? She was on a lot of treatment, yes, but there is so much still, she does stuff, what do they mean? And she said they would not pay for Clinical trials? Is that how it goes? Who pays for the Clinical trials. Thank you everyone, it's been insane. But sure looking forward for Xeloda to kick in, and hopefully these Rads will do something!!    ",

Unfortunately the thinking is the bigger Centers in the bigger cities would be a more logical place to be at. Newer ideas, protocols etc...( oh my gosh I also still have a hung up with Dr. Kildare, it's true ;) ) BUT they are not really approachable. Questions are answered via email. SO connotations, intonations are all questionable. The emails gotta be very precise, otherwise surely they won't answer. And these days docs are being bought off by conglomerates, they are literally scared of saying the wrong thing, or ordering one more test (and then being harassed by the biggies WHY they ordered that). Yes, i am bitter, because in NYC at large Centers, with the top doctors that has been my experience. They fake it yes, that they are interested and care, but even if it would be true, they are extremely limited in the amount of time they could give, and docs that want to move ahead have to go into some kind of research and the trial docs they all have to give a major amount of time to be in clinic so they cannot possibly worry their heads with one person's issues, concerns, pain etc...And i truly feel i am chasing the storm, pardon the pun to all going through the storm, i try to understand all that the wonderful people here try to tell us, but it's really hard for me to get it together and persuade these docs. That's where i find ourselves now, i don't think there is much promise in this trial for Dani, her #s are creeping up and up, and they still want to hold on to it, it's a trial, so how could they know that it will work in a few weeks, if it did not in over 2 month. Tried to get an appointment with Onco to discuss this, and she pushed it off, saying, she is thinking of different approaches, but stay the course now. Also, just to get them to actually discuss those ideas with us is a losing battle. We get patted on the head, \"we'll let you know\". Of course I am gonna try again and again, and I need to do my homework, which is very hard for someone that really can't understand much, and my brain has turned to mush.

You should know I called directly Foundation One(that's what you are waiting for right?), and spoke to someone and got them to fax me the report. They were very nice, Onco took a few more days to call me. In my case, I sent them POA of my daughter, and no problem speaking to them. If you have POA, maybe if you would like you could try to contact them and see if you could get the report in case it's ready. Were you comfortable with those Oncologists? Question for all: Onco did a B12 test it showed 376 (not too bad), Ferritin 64.0 Iron 45 TIBC 431 UIBC 386 Iron Sat 10.0 . Sorry to bore you with these numbers, but Onco never did these BT before. I just saw it on the Portal. Does anyone know what that means? Why would they have done this now? Nothing is so crazy on the BT that I could tell that would make do these tests. Sodium is on the margin. Hmm, what would bring that on anyway? Onco does not deviate from the norm in BT they do every week, in the past I've asked for Vit D etc...they did not think important to do. So why this? Next week we have an appointment again, I could ask then, but would like to have some background info to be able to ask the right questions. Thx for any info.",

You know having \"a team\" as they are called, not so much one that I chose, but the doctors chose could be a good thing and sometimes not so good, because they give each other courtesies, a bunch of BS if you ask me, and therefore thoughts could be deferred shall we say? Shetland what about Xeloda, is that an option? For sure, first Xray, CT then Mri then maybe Pet/Ct. I know someone with Prostate Cancer that I am helping out, the way the found a met was with Pet/CT but now when I told him to ask it's been 4 mos since original scan they should do some kind of scan, they only did an MRI which did find another met in the ribs, but still refused to do a Pet/CT? Did you ever? At Sloan, mind you. I don't get it. The guy has excellent insurance, don't trust doctors. Period. Robin I also try, but they have a way to make sure you don't ask many questions. Once in a while one is very lucky and you find a doc that actually appreciates someone that knows things. I tell you I go through this every day re:my DD. But also in any medical setting. I have pushed myself because of some wonderful ladies here pushing me, and I do try to get a balance between not stepping on toes and saying what you want. It's not easy, that's for sure. It's always a good idea to keep a copy of all scan reports, CD's, Blood tests. If you have that you could just set up an appointment yourself, you should enumerate the treatments you were on and for how long. The best thing would be a recommendation from someone you know. That's the hard part. Kaayborg why not just do it, these things proliferate like crazy. I am so mad thinking back, how Dani had 2 lesions, and Onco was pondering what to do, meanwhile I was trying to find another onco, 4 weeks later, these things were all over the liver, and still are! Hey Z, how on earth do you manage to do all this homework?? With the kids? I can barely catch up to you. Cristina good to be prepared. good luck. I've been asking for some kind of scan to really see what's going on with the liver, ONCO keeps saying they saw what they need to see with the Pet/CT, should i still ask for the MRI? what's gonna change?",

Shetland sorry that you are dealing with progression. And also what Artist said, D's onco also refused to touch the many liver lesions. It's too many to do something about it, so we keep hoping that the treatment systemically will do something. Z I wonder what are the limitations or contras from TACE. I do feel that her Onco is very conservative. Every time I mention a/t to do with the liver, she just looks at me like I am from Mars. Kaayborg so glad that you are going ahead and doing something about it. I am still hopeful that they would do something like this for D also. The thing is, in these large Centers, when a doctor is not working for themselves, I am always wondering is it Corporate that want something done in a certain way, or it's a good medical decision. I am just too cynical. I am not even sure Xeloda is working so well for Dani any longer, she had to be off for 2 weeks, she started again but at a 7 on 7 off routine, her TM's have been creeping up, I still don't have the BT results from this week. She still could not have the Ixempra this week due to very low Platelets so...it's kinda of a mess now, disappointing.",

And do you drink a lot of it, because now she is being told to drink quite a lot of liquids (water\u2026)so\u2026 And like Zar asked who knows of a good machine that does that, maybe it would be worth it for Dani. And if you could remind me the reason is because cancer cannot live in an alkaline body? And how do you know if you have too much alkaline or not, I was reading about having a balance?? So sorry to hear about your disappointment with these new quacks!! What's with these ppl??? They really don't see the urgency in any of this. It's like take-out, next! Next! I am afraid that the type of people that are needed are gone, medical schools are producing robots. Period. Aww Wendy that is so cute, 10 years!! Cheers cheers\u2026it's gonna cost you a lot more when you renew it again. SandiBeach thanks so much for the blog, i shall try. Animalcrackers it's so incredible that all these stories that we read here, is happening all over the country. IMO humbly, I think it's going up like this because something is brewing, when is the next set of scans? This business that ppl have TM's in the thousands is ridiculous, because if you'd see D's scans and the RO's face you'd understand, her liver is full of lesions, there are innumerable lesions skull, some pushing into very sensitive areas in the face etc\u2026all over the spine, I'm telling all that, because of course her TM's are elevated but certainly not in the thousands, so who is to say she doesn't have a lot of C!? Kaylyne that's the trial Dani was on in the first part of the year, even though she is not officially TN onco thought there is something to it, and many ladies here were very excited for it, so you it could be very good. Lynne you are like our guardian angel.",

You'd think in their profession they would be sensitive to those things, but it seems to me that there is complete obliviousness about the whole thing. I will tell you reading over and over accounts of docs that get seriously sick, they cannot get over what goes on in Hospitals, and the pain and loss that their patients went through. Let's just say they see the world with a different lens. Did you get to see more CD's? The AST/ALT/ALK Phosphate \u2013 and MO also checked for GGTP \u2013 creatinine those are I think the blood tests most related to the liver. Willy is adorable!!Very cute- it's a beautiful thing to take care of these lost animals. What breed is he? How big is he? She was thinking from a breeder, because we thought they would be better cared for, but now you are saying it's not so. And Robin can I ask you how do you know about the adoption stuff what the dog went through before getting there? This trial sounds very promising. Looking forward in getting your news about it. How often do you do BT for it? Robin, you think it's too soon for the 2nd phase? IR wants it actually close one to the other, I was asking him if it could be done in January but the way he told me that way you get the liver lesions down and the rest of the body could function better. It sounded good but what do I know. It sounded so bad when they saw the PET/CT and the #s were going up so fast, that we felt a real pressure to have this done asap, so I didn't really shop around, MO recommended him, there are more superior IR right in the same office but it would have taken a few weeks to see them, and what shall I tell you I got scared. I know how other docs don't like to finish the job of the 1st, and I do think it's best if she stays within her circle of docs in case\u2026so\u2026it's kinda \u2013 unless it's a real no no How do we know who is a good candidate for PARP inhibitors? Grannax only forward. I cannot even explain to the \"average Human\" what she does every day, it's weird when you tell people yeah, I've been going to docs or scans or BTfor the last hmmm forever all the time. Grannax how long did it take you to see the results from Y90? Weeks/Months? Grannax did you also had nausea/vomiting after the procedure? So hers will be just about 4 weeks. And good that the kids keep you on your toes. Claire so happy for you, it took awhile. Good luck going forward. Bluebird what seems to me is this is a GOOD business, that's clear. Anita just a dream, thanks for transporting us.",

Yes, most people have responsibilities ppl that need them, surround them, Human beings just wanting to go about their mundane life. JFL -Re: Y90 - i am not sure it's the best idea if it's just a few mets. Then they could try some form of burning it no? Robin and JFL i can only tell you what IR did say they do it one lobe at a time because if one liver is out being traumatized, or if something goes awry with that side you got the other lobe taking over. how late is late? I am not sure, but he was serious when he was looking at the screen and said she's pretty close of not being able to do it, because the liver was so full of mets. Def the #s are important. Yes the albumin, creatinine are very important. artist, maybe you should write a note to Onco - that you are very disappointed that you did not get the Xeloda yet, and one of the reasons is that you were hoping the doc is fighting for you. you know th e Pharmacy is also an issue, but they should be very concerned that you are off treatment. I say to write an email, they don't like when things are documented. A phone call is just a phone call, on paper for the records it does not look good. We did that just about a yr ago. we were having so much trouble, exactly like you, and I wrote such an email, saying that it's very sad that Dani would not be able to get t blah blah, they called from the office right away, and said they would get s/o to work w the Pharmacy. This is just wrong. So sorry. Dani came down with a fever this afternoon. She was 6 hrs at the freakg Hospital, having the rads and also appointment with Uro, and the fever was spiking up once she got home. She is drained emotionally and pysically. Tylenol is bringing the fever now everytime it goes up, but really?On a holiday? again? every time she has an emergency it's either at night, and mostly on weekends or Holidays, always, it's bizarre. At the Hospital today departments were closing at 2 or 3 pm, no one worth his salt is gonna be workg the next few days. That means if she needs help tom and so on, we are doomed. At Uro's appointment today, she told him about the blood clots from 2 days ago (happened at night of course) and showed him pictures. He said it was very concerning. NOW he tells us that he thought by now the bleedg would settle down. The only thing to do is do another cystoscopy and fulgurize again. He'd take another biopsy. He hopes it's not new bladder Hemangiomas. I asked him if he ever dealt with this b4 he said no, he never saw this, it's very rare. We KNOW. I got a friend of a friend to get a Urologist to check in and opine, and he said he never saw this, does not know how to treat it, but he called back that a radiologist he knows could laser it. Now we have to decide do we wanna laser it or fulgurize. How can we decide? We are so worried about this. I don't think we gonna have the fam gathering, too much going on, it kinda wiped us out. (im trying so hard to find docs familiar with bladder hemangioma, but nothing. the literature they do have is when they found a baby that is bleeding and then they found this.) ",

That means she is no particular treatment. She had Herceptin, but in itself I don't believe it has any effect on her. At another doctor we have for instance, there is someone that all she does is approvals. But he is a private doctor.

Dani's MO also refused to even let her have a biopsy when the liver mets appeared, they were only 2 at the very start, Babs i share your frustration. NO she wanted only systemically. So we did. I am not blaming her for it, just wish maybe that she could have had ablation..but with these beasts being so aggressive, who knows where the tiny ones were before and it would not help the ablation at all. Maria,you are right in being concerned with the numbers, D's MO also does not get excited when the ALK goes up which it has been, the ALT/ASP, i do, she seems to have more patience for it. Also there is the Lactate Dehydrogenase that they take in her blood work, LDH supposedly is one more way to see if damaged is being done to the cells, if it's high it shows there is damage if it goes lower it could show treatment is working. From a lot of reading, the way I see the PET could get info at the cellular level, when a lesion is really small, a CT alone cannot catch this. If it's at all possible for you to get this in the States, then it might make you more comfortable, but as you know it's not a one time thing. You would wanna have follow ups. I do know people that come to the States for other treatments due to lack of availability of options and waiting time in Canada. Hope you figure out soon what you have to do. Letmywifelive you are facing the same questions we were just 2 weeks ago, it really at me up. We did decide for the trial, but we did not have good choices. I scamed over the info you sent, it could be a good possibility, you have good doctors, what do they advise you. One thing that Onco said, and many wonderful ladies here, is that you have to be healthy to be sick for a trial. They said if D waits and things get worse, the researchers might not accept her to a certain trial. There was one in Baltimore with the NIH but they would not take her due to brain mets, and the one she is on now, is Phas1 part B, so they accepted her still, but they said they don't know what will be when they move forward. So seriously, i always hated to gamble, I don't even buy a lottery ticket, and here we are faced with gambling with this precious life. What about a biopsy to see if something changed would that be an option? Wish you the best. ANd yes, maybe there is something good with Xeloda, but how can you make this decision? Still waiting on liver biopsy results. Waiting is the new key word. ",

I sure try to understand the talk, but it's really deep. Bluebird it's crazy the pain and the alienation you have to go through. Happens to be that Dani also had enormous pain in the blade area after Y90 and Grannax interesting to note that you also had that. Although no doctor put it together. Babs thanks so much for passing the message about Dani. How do I make this short. The week after the most horrible experience of being ignored at the Hospital, was a difficult week. Dani had rads that week so the trips there and the weakness from going through what she went through and then having Y90 at the end of the week, then more rads was just monumental. All that week I was hoping to speak to chief URO so we could see another Uro, anyway he granted my hubby and I a visit on that Friday afternoon. We were ushered in to what was a consult room with that chair for examination etc... not an office. In that room in came the nurse, the resident that treated Dani at the hospital, a social worker, and someone else i don't remember and of course the chief. He is well known as good in his field. The first thing he tells us, is - do you know what your daughter wishes are? does she have a living will? do you understand how sick she is? did a/o tell you? (Bluebird almost word p/word of what was told to you). We were flabbergasted. He said i don't understand these docs, they treat the liver, separately every part of the person, they should look at the picture and sometimes you don't treat. He will discuss it with Onco. Maybe it would be a good idea to speak with an ethicist? A chaplain? I told him, but she's doing her chores, she functions, she is not running around, but how do we just give up on someone that is doing everyday stuff, i said she's just 30 something, u guys brace yourself! He says we just lost a 5yr old. Kid you not. If i didn't have a heart attack then...He said we have ppl doing irrigation 6 weeks. Irrigation would mean a cathether in the uretra, and water coming in and blood going out, very uncomfortable, because obviously there is clotting involved then they would have to flush, don't ask. I said 6 weeks? But hse has children, that's her life, that would not be living, he smiled, some ppl go from this and that some ppl from bleeding. We were speechless, i knew these people were garbage, and there is not talking to them. When we left the room a saw a policeman waiting in the lobby, no one was there anymore friday afternoon, and he accompanied us and the social worker to the elevator. I asked her in the elevator, is he here for us? and she said oh no they roam the elevators. And they smiled to each other and he left on the 2nd floor. They thought we are gonna be violent becausee i had said i wanted to complain. Do you believe that? That's at Columbia Presbyterian in NY. We were very broken and shaken, by the Grace of God i thought of one Onco i know, that is very old fashioned, not the fanciest person in town, but i knew that he would fight for her. And after 2 weeks of going back and forth and paperwork, he is trying to come up with something to help her. She did use a URO he recommended because the bleeding is still there. On and off. Like a hanging noose. They did vessel embolization, not an easy procedure. It helped somewhat, but any day any time, she will call me she just passed clots, mind you that's from the urethra.you could imagine what she's going through, she has to drink all the time, so sleeping is not really getting done, she's constantly scared there will be huge clots again, and then she won't be able to pass. URO is still trying to figure out what to do. It's been difficult. She is off tx. Neratinib proved to be a cause of major nose bleeding, and mouth sores and a rash. I've pretty much became paralyzed, i barely go out, i did not touch the computer till today. Z you were right. I started on Celexa. It helped a bit. Every minute i wait for her call. My hubby kinda broke, he looks lost. It's hard for me not to be able to discuss it with someone that knows her well. So this pressure gets even harder. I am really alone. The sibs know and they help with the kids etc, but i can't tell them of all my fears and every minute i know she's bleeding, they have to work and mingle, it's hard to do that if you are constantly in a crisis mode. Of course the bleeding gets worse at night. The sheer panic of hearing the phone ring Platelets are down to 43. She cannot plan even a doctor's appointment for her dd, she had to cancel twice. I don't know where this is going. She lost so much weight, she tries to eat, but this stress i honestly don't know how she could take it. I do wish and hope for a better tomorrow for all. Love,",

Miao love your parable, couldn't be more true! Is it ignorance or greed?? I guess we all know the answer. Big time money with cancer specifically. So awful. Fingers crossed for great results on your test. SandiBeach I am getting madder by the minute, Dani had a hard time breathing I the last few weeks, the scan showed pleurisy and a big one at that, why didn't the doc act and send her to get rid of the fluid, I read that could do a number on the heart. I think it did. Can you guys imagine something ridiculous like that, it being something stupid like being callous about getting rid of fluids that could have given her comfort and extend time?? He was scared of sending her to the Hospital that I know. I just reread the latest scan, CT because she could not stay any longer in the machines (mri/pet) \u2013 too much pain, and it points too so much going on. But he was soooo slow to act. The BT was crazy. E/t was so out of control. I'll be straight with you guys, I know that there could have been more intervention, would it just prolong her misery?? The pain was intense, yes, it's not even about should have could have, I know could have!, again my only solace is that she was in her own bed like an angel, but I know If doc would have taken care of the details, she had more of a chance to have more time.Just saying. JFL \u2013 Zar interestingly, Dani was first Her2- then after biopsies she was 2 Onco last year put her on the Clinical trial of IMMU132 which was geared for HER2- but she felt strongly it would benefit her. It didn't. That was till June, then the next 3 months this same Onco pushed Dani to go to MSKCC with the trial for strongly HER2+ DS8201a, yeah, they said \"we have gr8 results\" but it did not help her. Btw, she has been on Herceptin plus different treatments, I think it was a mistake to get her off Herceptin.The bottom line, it's all a f\u2026\u2026. crapshoot. The trial at MSKCC seems interesting, I must say. Just remember, trial people don't have your best interest in mind.",

Let's see what they tell you about the brain Nouzay from what I know Faslodex is recommended for when letrozole does not work or vice versa, actually we were told that after a break of the hormonals one could try it again.

IMHO i think your gut is right, chemo is more true and tried, and to give it a big punch i think you make sense that it would be a better option than a phase I trial. Just saying. Cheering for you.

Of course we don't have a crystal ball, but there is a lot more I think you could do and not get defeated. So sorry to hear about your pain. Dani is also having pains she did not have b4. The other night she thought it was the appendix that's how bad it was. How obnoxious from Onco to pat you in the head. If you ask it's because you want to know. Re: the lesions, I hate to tell you but I think the liver kinda pushes into other organs and swells up if there is too much there, the other lesions are probably smaller, they usually mention the larger ones, I saw D's PET and it's unbelievable the amount of lesions the liver could hold. If it's ascites they could drain it. Robin don't get ME started. You are absolutely on the right. Yes, they are Human. But they are careless. Dani pre-Y90 had was told to take Protonix. The bleeding and her not feeling well, she read the interactions of Y90 and Neratinib and lo and behold it cannot be mixed. And also the Neratinib causes bleeding!! She kept saying to the former Onco, she had massive nose bleeding, like an hr and big clots coming out of the nose, and he never thought it could be the tx. New Onco, told her to get off e/t. And the nose bleeds stopped. Definitely be looking out for yourself. Robin what ideas can you give us how to get the platelets up. You say you work a lot for it. Dani's platelets are also in the 40's 50's and Onco wants to keep the chemo at a lower dose because of it and it becomes an extra worry. Thank you for the info re:platelets, Onco does not want her to get platelets at the 40's mark either, I thought for sure, but he asks if she is holding up then he does not. Lindalou I remember someone here had hemangiomas in the liver. You could imagine what this word strikes in me. What chaos do Hemangiomas cause in the liver? Does it bother you?

SO i said u know i do wish Hell for him, she said Hell is getting really crowded with these people. Artist hope you keep things stable. Kaption i think we learn to say pretty good. Dani is going through a rough patch. The bleeding is still present, sometimes more than other times. Today's tx was almost held back because all her #s are wacko. So far her platelets didn't rebound back much, I didn't see the BT yet, prob tomorrow, but e/t is low. She's been pretty much not doing any activities to due lack of energy and pain. A lot of pain in the bones. She could not even drive her DD to the doc because her arms are so weak she did not think she could handle the wheel. So re: pain meds. I'll get to the bones thread also, but she cannot take the Anti inflammatory because there is concern for thinning the blood and she can't afford that with that condition. Tylenol doesn't do a thing for her. And the other stuff with codeine or stronger, she doesn't want to take, first because she says she has to be aware and make sure she goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night to make sure the little clots come out, and during the day she wants to be able to be available when the kids come home and do stuff in the house. I don't know. I don't know what to say, she has constant pain, they will finally do a MRI of the shoulder and the spine to see what's pressing where. I know for a fact that RO didn't do all she said she was gonna do. But in the meantime, she is pretty much just plopping down on the couch. He took off the new added tx to the cocktail, no more Leukeran till they see the BT getting better. He wants to see if that made her have less energy. I think so. I called him in the AM and told him how weak she is. I can't imagine how bad she is feeling.",

Anyway as so many wonderful ladies are telling you if it's really important for you, try to go. Maybe you could prepare yourself, these phone numbers could be a beginning. Finally, you know last year Dani's sisters prepared long and hard for an Oregon trip, out of the blue, Dani decided she wants to go away with them instead, they actually called the airline, I think it was JetBlue and believe or not, after they heard of the story, they refunded their tickets.

You make sense in your thought process. I am still always wondering. Dani has always gotten a PET/CT, when she was on trial they only did a CT and they ignored her brain (she was getting Brain MRI's for mets), anyway, just 2 weeks ago she was gonna get an MRI for the Brain and the spine, but she was in such pain, they switched it to CT w contrast. And, she was due in the next week or so to get a head to knee Pet/CT and there is no way she could be in the machine that long, so it will be just a CT w contr. Yes, we are upset about it but no choice. Although i did hear that in Boston or and in SF they only do CT's. I think Deanna said only CT for her. Zar hope you get a lot done over there.

I'd say the minimum you need a US, you could have an MRI or a CT, even a PET/CT but i learned that an MRI or CT could be even more accurate to find mets in the liver. That's my view, i'm sure other wonderful ladies will chime in. It's irresponsible from doc. Of course i can't say for certain you have or not something going on, but what you are describing needs a follow up. Take care.",

I think they will do another scan in 4 or wks, if it's not good I'll ask for a taxol or something. She did have a biopsy 1 1/2 ago when it started spreading in the bones like a bonfire, it showed that her status did change to HER2+ everyone was so excited bcs they thought she would be helped with all the new targeted HER2+ tx, but it failed her. Constant progression. She did not have a break for yrs. She's now 32. And the last 2 mos it went to the liver. She did get in the skull for 2 yrs already. had Gamma done and radiation to the skull. And now it's growing very much there again. I was hoping for ablation. We got messed up with the prior Onco dragging his feet also. I think. Now...she does not know yet. And i will have to talk to her about doing Rads to the frontal part of the skull, which will leave her with a large bald patch and no hair regrowth. She thought she does not have to do it, but it's not looking good. And so it goes... But now doc does not see a reason for biopsy, I was also thinking maybe there is a new mutation. They don't think so. they think it's the process from this monster. But, I may still ask again, bcs what if now she is Triple Negative? We'll see. She was trying to \"go there\" with the convo, I spoke a bit about it, but it's surreal. Holeinone I know what you mean, thanks. I asked God to make an exchange.

Let's just say that since diagnosed 2 wks ago he has not been able to speak to Onco directly. First thanks for your support. It's so not my personality, I do tend to deal with people very direct, but these ppl hold so much power, that at this time I think the best I could do is really try in a very nice way to work with her. The problem is, that I really feel these docs try to distance themselves from difficult situations. What was the reason they denied your PET? Too soon? You know, sometimes doctors could and should fight that this is not a cosmetic issue! Aghh so sorry you have to deal with that on top of other things. Kaayborg in a perfect world, yes. This is a BIG Center, BUT as I have learned, it feels like one is falling the rabbit hole. This Onco was recommended by the MAMA Onco there, but this one specializes in Mets. And just today, I called Mama Onco and asked if we could also have a visit with her, I told the secr I don't wanna step on anyones' toes, but..., and she is like, oh no, now you are a patient of the other doctor, but I should not worry bcs they convene all the time and discuss everyone. Yes, but MAMA ONCO, was old school, and she cared!! Yep, and so it goes. Maybe, maybe this one will warm up. Although I mentioned it to my GYNO, (who happens to be from the same hosp) and I asked, is there anything I could do or say to get them to really care, and him also being older than Dani's onco, said no! Either it's there right off or \u2026. Before I got to this Onco, I was looking into another onco in the Center, and that secr told me she will see if the doc will accept Dani, because it would be called \"transfer of care\" and she does not do this. Yep in big old New York. Politics, politics all the way. We are just an afterthought. Shelby how lucky for you that your Onco went through all this trouble. Freaking Unbeliavable!! My daughter had been 2 yrs ago on carbo/gemzar, it was tough on her. They took her off it. And btw she had progression even on it. I truly think she sets the record for the weirdest wildest C monster. So far, no doctor could make head and tails from it. Thank you for giving me the info on the lesions. She started with 2 lesions. Then in 4 wks, went to numerous. I don't have sizes, the first two, were about 1.5cm each.Let's see what the enzymes and TM will show this time around. BTW which TM do your doctors take for liver? The TM that she had was CEA, but they stopped, and then only Ca15.3 Anyone did the embolization?? TIA everyone,",

Sometimes some ppl could make life so difficult, for no reason.(ignorance is the worst). Yeeh for your trip!! You are one smart lady. Bstein, when did you feel something was not right? Did you do a CT or Pet/CT? So the doctor ordered it urgent? I've wanted Dani to have s CT for awhile just in that area, she has innumerable lesions, but so far they are only going by the PET/CT. Hoping for the best, you are always so helpful to all in your posts.",

I don't believe one has symptoms at the onset of liver mets, if it's not responding to treatment or constant progression, then you area talking about swelling ascites etc..She has innumerable that progressed from 2 in 4 weeks span, some large some not so large, still working at it. I would have liked a biopsy to get some more details about WTH but Onco doesn't recommend. Xeloda/Herceptin/Ixempra for her, she is triple positive. A CT would be able to give more detailed info for you no? Sono? Blood work, I think gets messed up when liver is on the way of being damaged, etc...it does not appear right after diagnosis.

Scans? Or BT? I am always worry about the liver. Dani almost missed her treatment because her #s were so low, but Onco decided to take a chance, I am glad, she is coming along. MPV was 7.9Neutr% 1.0 The Hemoglobin also fell below their limit of 11.7 it's really 9.8. At what number btw would someone need transfusion? Below 6.0? Onco said it rebounces the week after, she is extremely concerned with the liver mets etc.. (innumerable, some got smaller, some larger, some new! So she always has this serious look), so I'd say Onco feels she could do that. Dani also does not have symptoms. Also, the AST/ALT is coming down, the Alkaline Phosphate was a bit down also, then going back up, three times consecutively, should it not be in sync? Anyone here knows? Also, I am trying to gather thoughts. Gifts. Dani has been going in 3 weeks one week off. So we get to see all the nurses that administer the infusion, NP, front desk person, secretary, the phlebotomist, other secretaries that sometimes take over when main secr is not there, insurance person, yep, and Onco. Also RO and NP of RO, and the people outside, she will see them this week or next again, and she has to be in touch with them every few weeks anyway, to follow up on Brain Mets no matter what. So what now? How do we gift everyone? Hanukah, Christmas I think they kinda would like to get something\u2026Just a nice chocolate ensemble, no. Little gifts to each person? It's a lot of people but if it's the thing to do\u2026Could I ask what are you all doing? TIA",

My plan is I think, to wait how things would change with the next scans, by then the Xeloda would be in the body much longer. Also, I do know that Onco discusses (she has to) with a tumor board so it does make it a bit easier to accept. But, thanks, it's def in my mind the option of going for a 2nd opinion.

Lynne of course stay, if not at least put some warmth in the jar and close it tight, then come home! So, finally Onco called in the afternoon. First she mentioned Taxol, then another treatment with be a trial with Enzulatamide or the one Onco prefers the IMMU 132. I thought Taxol she already had, we know it's a tough one, the 2nd choice would not be at her Center, and the 3rd she was involved with for TNBC but could be promising for advance stage IV., loss of hair included. I kinda agreed to IMMU 132, it's a 3 hr infusion, 2 weeks, one week off. So it's pretty much gonna be a whole day affair for her, which she is not happy about. She would have to wait 2 weeks to get the last treatment washed out. Which worries me very much due to ascites, but there is no choice. Onco thinks her lung nodule and everything could get better with this.Of course they are going blindly, and what am I doing? I feel like I am taking her to the slaughter. She depends on my research, on my opinion. What can I say? It's just that so much has gotten worse, that I don't know if we have the flexibility to play around, but which is sure? Even if she goes on Taxol, do i know? Should i go with a more familiar tx like taxol? And I really hate these 2 weeks with no treatment. If that's the path, then next week she has to spend a full day having pre screening, also, her HGB is low, for this trial it has to be at least 9 or 10, it has not been there in awhile, so short of blood transfusion, let's hope that by not being on any treatment maybe it will go up. I did not tell her about the ascites or the nodule in the lungs, maybe with time..., PCP and Onco agree. She will be examined, if she complains then maybe we'll tell her, she doesn't like to know much, i hope she does complaint if she feels something. I'll put hubby in charged of spying how she is doing. I shall be copying this and posting in my other threads, sorry for the doubles. I shall keep you posted, Always open for advice, ",

Enjoy!! and breath. shetland i think you make a lot of sense, from the very little I know, i think the same is true for Dani, while she was on Ibrance/Letrozole her liver mets crept up, to innumerable. Then the new Onco said, hormonal tx is not for her. I always hated playing Casino, if its possible Dani is even more cynical than me, we don't believe in lottery etc...AND NOW she has to play this stupid guessing game, it's all it is. Kaayborg let's keep hoping, keep a smart eye, and always wish for the best. Cristina i thought D's onco was cukoo, but your mom's take the cake. Hmmm that's not acceptable, you should tell him so. Zar i kept my cool, you reigned me in, Dani is the one that wrote a lengthy email and cc me too, so they knew that I am keeping tabs. At the same time my sil sent emails to all CEO's he could find from the Insurance, he told them she better not get worse due to their lack of everything, he got a call back in no time.... Thank you everyone for your concerns, I am very nervous, anxious for this meeting, all her numbers are going wacko, the Alkaline Phosphate was never that high, and the LDH also not so good. And the TM's increased. We are going late afternoon to Sloan to see what the recommendation for trial is, we are depending a lot on this thing, so she better be smart about recommendations. As is, D got the Xtandi the 1st, YEP, so i told her to find out if maybe the new ppl would tell her to hold off in case they wanna start something new soon, so it's not in her system, and they said yes, wait for the appointment. I must say we had a good laugh, after all this theater about getting the drug, we were oh my if Onco or Ins finds out......so it goes. The patient from Hell by Stephen Schneider - it's a good read, how he educated himself to try to get the system to work for him. A good dream. ",

LindaE I am so happy for you. After reading and re reading posts mostly in these threads, I started thinking how i need to get answers re:biopsy and not wait. THIS PART IS REPOSTED FROM BONE THREAD - Actually, my mind has been on overdrive. I checked in last week to see if they got any info on the liver biopsy, so far it seems that she is still triple HER2, but all info is not in yet. Then I asked about Foundation One, and they tell me that it was not ordered, but another type of mutations test, but that one takes months to get answer, AND it's pretty much for research, I am like hmm that's not what Onco told me.So waited till Monday, then sent back and forth a very political correct email to Onco, about our understanding that she gets her mutations checked, and I told her that in Dani's case waiting months, is really ages, time that she ain't got, like should we not take the opportunity to send tissue now that she went through this ordeal. So another day goes by, and finally today, she said, yes, we'll authorize that. So now 2 weeks later we begin again. Ughhhhhhhh. Every little detail, then there is another mutation PDL1 that has to be sent separately and wasn't, so I gotta beg for it, and see if tom they will do it. Then took the scans done by trial doc to her RO to recheck Brain MRI because it showed a larger edema, and I would trust more her RO than the ppl doing the study. SO yeah, I feel blessed that things are or will come together, but it's insane the energy spent on checking these people's work. And that's good people, in the big city, how does a/t function anywhere else?? How do planes don't fall from the sky??? It makes me wonder. It's always something. Dani's is resuming her trip as we speak. It was great to be away, they enjoyed every minute away. Away from this madness!! Weather wise also was a great week. We'll keep you posted. Take good care everyone.",

Much much to understand. My car was stolen from right in front of my house, it's not so unthinkable in NYC, but a true pain. We are thankful no one is hurt, it was in the middle of the night, and they just took it for the parts. Let's just say the police said - Lady you don't want us to find your car, trust me. It won't be in a condition that you would want to get into it. And so, much much distraction, not welcome, but so is life. Dani had her PET/CT done, BUT there are no results, the one i did get was comparing to 2 yr ago, so I called up the radiologist and I said I know there is a lot of mets, but there was treatment in between and we need to know from a scan from 8 weeks ago IF it's working, not comparison to 2014! and they say oh mistake, but now there is a delay. And our nerves are really shot. Let's just say what I did see, DID NOT look good. I just cannot believe it. We probably won't hear anything till Monday for sure. Really really anxious, it's like till today we were going with the wind, but now the wait is cruel. I cannot imagine what Dani is feeling. Now we wait again.",

So today we got back the results for the PDL1 and Dani is negative for it. I am still waiting to see the report, I'm disappointed because I was counting on it to be an easier segway for Immunotherapy if needed. I did start reading about it, it does not mean that's a nono, but to begin with Immuno is not so big for BC it seems, and not being positive means that it may work only on a small portion of ppl that show negative for it. It's just complicate things. Too bad. Well we have to wait 2 more weeks, then we'll know how this trial is coming along. Just trying to prepare.",

Wendy wishing you to feel stronger fast. I had something like this come overnight, finally went to doc he said it could be the beginning of an Ulcer, he put me on Protonix and Zofran, because i was so nauseous, it took a few days but it got better, my burping kinda stayed, strangely i never had this, i am more careful in what i eat.

RO thought would be too much to do it all at once, so she will give her a break then do the body. And Y90 they want to do again the whole process in 4 weeks time for the left lobe.

And you guys are pointing out very important factors in these readings. I think some of these radiologists, are just lazy, doing their umpteenth reading, and skipping many details. I see the difference even in the same place how they address what they see. It's very frustrating if not life threatening. JFL i was already getting so scared that we mighta've missed something because she almost only has PET/CT but it's good i read what you wrote in the end, and you said that's the one you have. I really am so confused. I know that this IR is going by the PET/CT. And sometimes i don't want to ask them for MRI because then they will say so not PET/CT and she has so many bone lesions...I do believe that at the last place where she was doing the trial they PURPOSEDLY did not use contrast with the CT because they did not want to see what's going on with her, even at that CT it showed progression and they pooh pooh it away, even the Blood counts were going awry they looked away, they wanted to push her to continue the trial, say what you want, I CALLED them when the last CT showed much progression in the liver, and i said you see what I see AND THEN she said, yeah it might be to her advantage to get off it. Ok. That was just venting. Kaayaborg how are you feeling? Shetland so happy to see you around and helping e/o. it's a feel good moment. Gosh you really took the bull by the horn. Good for you. Dani is now on neratinib and Faslodex, but we won't know what's doing for at least another month. Hey Artist I lover the \"bother\" part, so right. You bother him all you want. So glad you finally got to have this one on one. About time. Great news about the scans. Now you will get good advice on Xeloda.",

I guess there is a lot of depends... Aoibheann is that how things are done there? You are not entitled to see your records. In the States a patient or a rep has the right to have it, sometimes it's ackward maybe if we don't want the doc to think we are double guessing them etc\u2026but by law they have to. I just read your next post, honestly I cannot believe it. How patronizing in this day and age that a DOCTOR could determine if you could handle the situation or not. In the States they might do it too, but it's frowned upon. Robin so the new trial that you were just on, is that the one it did not work? How are you feeling now? Bluebird you are dealing with so many issues, and you are so gracious \u2013 thank you. They really put you through the ringer. Grannax cheers!! Yes, all of you beautiful ladies make me push myself too. Good for you, it seems perfectly reasonable for you to get back on track first. Shake this thing off real quick.",

But she is kind of telling IT k you are sticking around but I will too! Zar my hubby has back issues, I convinced him to get a wheelchair when he travels, and now it became a thing, it's the best. This is for sure something you don't have to deal with. Good for you. On the upside you get to go to the front of the line. 😉A friend of mine was running late to get to the gate for her flight for her mother's funeral, she is a MD herself, anyway she plopped herself in a wheelchair and voila, her hubby and kids and herself got through security asap, let's just say she made it. It's music to my ears to \"hear\" you speak so highly of the RO, this guy has no idea what it means coming from you. NO1 maybe you go to a dermatologist? How could you wait that long to see your doc? Shingles definitely are painful it's just an unusual place to show up,but\u2026Maybe you could try at least the PCP to see it. Lilliem.. it's hard to judge not knowing exactly all the details but that is what I heard as soon as Dani was dx with liver mets, first if there are too few, they won't do it, they do try systemic first, it probably makes some sense, one would think zapping with ablation one or 2 mets would make sense, but I don't think THEY think so. About it being diffuse or not, I am not sure it makes a difference, let's say the Y90 it's done one lobe at a time, so in that particular lobe would not matter if it's one next to the other or not. But it's a good convo to ask under which situation would he recommend the Y90 then you'll know if it's something he's just scared of or what. We together in these threads found that a lot of Oncos are just not familiar with it, and that's one of the reasons they don't recommend. Maybe a visit to a intervention radiologist specialized in this would help the convo. MJH I am no expert on Y90, but it irks me that a doc would say it did not prove to prolong survival, IMHO is not just longevity that people are looking for, but QOL while going through this or any Hell. BUT really what an absurd thing to say, it did not prove to prolong\u2026.and for sure that are many that do have this treatment, of course if may not work for many, it depends also on how aggressive the C is etc\u2026or how all the numbers look, and many other details, that I could understand, but\u2026 Southern how are you feeling?",

And the other problem is that they pretty much radiated all T's and C's so they would either have to find a different pathway or... but thanks, will keep your recommendation in mind.

She was even on rads because e/t was so bad, and they timed it so, she gets a mere 3 days or so off to push the Y90 in. And here intermission was more like 6 weeks for the 2nd lobe. She did feel a hardness after the 2nd Y90 that really bothered her. We never got around to investigate, because more pressing issues were coming up all the time, but she was upset about it. To be sure, there are doctors that think differently, i'm just giving you our experience. I keep thinking how Dani had her issues ignored by the doctor, things were just piling up, i am so angry and that's one of the reasons that i did not call him on it yet. We precisely seeked him out because he is known to fight for life, e/o knows. BUT somehow, either he's getting too old (is in his late 70's), i don't mean agewise, but really im thinking if he was not thinking right, if he forgot, something went wrong in the way he treated her. Yes, he liked D, he spent time with her, but he did not pay attention to the last symptoms. What would you say, if when she was telling him all the issues iwht the liver, including swollen feet (like trunks), yellow eyes - he was looking into Hepatitis? Yes, i even have the Blood test. He told her that. WHY??? One thing i could think of is that he was protecting her. He knew how bad it was and did not want to scare her. Fine. BUT he did not tell her hubby, or myself. He knew we both were with her all the time. Very weird.",

She was diagnosed at 25, nursing her 2nd daughter. BTW her GYNO did not want to give her a presciption for a Mammo, he said she was too young to have a/t. I kid you not. Well she paid out of pocket and in 3 days she had a lumpectomy and the rest is HX. The reason i'm telling you this, it's because i want to impart to you that you could do it. I take Celexa now, she was having a very hard time lately and i was in full panic attack. It does help, you still aware of e/t that's going around, but you probably won't be crying all day (nothing wrong with that, but if you want to have it controlled because of the kidos..) I also take ambien - after reading on the internet, a lot of ppl said that if you cut the 10mg in half is just as potent. That's what i did, it gives me 3 hrs and then i pop another one when i wake up. You are totally right, laying in bed is probably the worst time for the demons to come. Don't let them. When you can give us some info of your status if you have like ER PR etc... and what your plan is, was is DCIS? or... - You will get a plan and then you will be able to feel better knowing that you are doing something. Also, from experience i'd tell you make sure to keep copies of all blood tests, any scans you have done, etc...i and many others in these threads have found it much easier to get it after each test, if you wanna go sometime down the road for a 2nd opinion you would not have to go begging your doctor's office for these results. Do let us know how you are, and try to go to the thread most similar to your situation, you could learn and have support from all the wonderful ladies. Also, from experience and from other ladies think before you tell someone, tell whomever you feel comfortable with, but i'd tell you not to rush and tell e/o right away, when you are after the shock you might want to do things differently.

I feel exactly the same way, Dani is even going along with Onco, she's like yeah why do I need more radiation, hmm, how do I tell her it really does not matter so much, she's quite clever, but she chooses to believe what she believes, and i don't wanna be the b..tch you know, so...I'll try to ask her once more, oh, did i learn to bite my tongue! How are you doing? Meanwhile the circus continues, and i keep checking to see if the slides were sent out to F1, i just found out that supposedly there was something missing in the paper work (as if either F1 or Onco or the pathology dept did this for the first freaking time), so it should be going OUT Monday or tuesday!!! I'm telling you if it wouldn't be so sad, I'd be rolling with laughter. Mind you the PDL1 request, THEY ARE LOOKING where to send because this BIG center in NYC is not doing it anymore for bc patients,they are looking...so weird, how could they not have this info in the tip of their fingers, this is so common these days, honestly this is absurdity...

My daughter has ascites in the abdominal area, and now they found it in the pelvic area, I think there is much t be done still. What about using immunotherapy, could she look up some clinical trial maybe that would be compatible for you? Would a biopsy fo some kind guide you in a different way? where are the ascites? There is another wonderful thread of peritoneal ascites, you might feel comfort there too. When is the wedding? Is the Center nearer to you a major Center? So sorry you had to go through this.",

First off these business of being called \"patient\" should really be ILLEGAL, we are all people that either broke a leg, had a cut, or this monster. BUT we are all people. I really think they hide behind the word patient, so as to have one degree more of separation from you to the doc. So wonderful to know that you found decent people that will be taking care of you. That alone will ease up the stress. Now, onto getting that dress!!",

I'd tell you don't let it get out of hand. And yes, your symptoms are a staple of this monster. At least your doc is hurrying it up with the biopsy. What is he trying to see, if something change in the mutation? Raeywin it was so special of you to share these wonderful moments with us. WOW we have such a competition here with gorgeous pictures. And what is there to say for this wonderful effort of your family to get you this exquisite quilt, so glad you are enjoying these. Keep up the good work. Artist let's hope this Abraxane kicks butt. Maria it's a tough decision I think what Shetland said makes sense, if they could tell that the progression is fast. Go by your gut, that's how docs make decisions I think. And sometimes they ask me What do you think? Hmmm I'm like you serious? But truth be said, Dani has excellent intuition if she does not feel right about something, i'll go with her. Anita, yeah Dani was also told no need for Mamos, but in this last PET/CT it showed a new lesion in her breast, was not there b4, but they haven't talked about it, I think e/o is scared to open up a can of worm. A lot is riding on the results of the next scan. Grannax that's really wonderful news!! Look at you! I'm so mad that they did not give Dani this chance, only systemic treatment and Onco is so afraid to do a/t mildly invasive, if this trial does not work, i'd try to be more aggressive in asking for something like the Y90. So true about the sharing part. People truly cannot understand how you are doing what you can but only treading a think rope. It's not about them. Rule #1 and the ONLY rule. We don't bother. Dani does not discuss w anyone. Shut case. Dani has no major SE's in the trial, but the BT's numbers are not making me very excited. We just keep hoping.",

All this, because Memorial Sloan in NYC, THE place to go for Cancer Center had no clue how to take care of her. With an ER similar to what one would find in a 3rd World Country. Docs that are rushed, and don't have a clue about emergencies. She came in with clots when she was able to pass some minimum urine, and in extreme pain. Then she could not pass at all. They sent her home in the middle of the night, because they said the CT would only open up at 8 AM. She went home and half hr late she woke me up saying she's gonna explode and in so much pain. Back we went, no scan till 2pm. Then, all hell broke loose. They saw she had a large Hematoma, so as soon as she got back to the room, the urologist team arrived, and they had to irrigate. It's a crazy thing,a catheter go in with 2 like faucets, one for saline to go in, the other for the clotted blood to come out. This went on till the morning, with a nurse coming in every 5 mins to make sure she gets the saline in, so the blood does not get clotted. Dani was in so much pain, and the place ignored her. She kept saying I'm not just numbers, the HGB was not at a dangerous level, so they did not take her seriously, then when it fell below 7, of course they ordered blood stat. She did not eat for over 2 days. Not a thing. They did not want her to eat, not knowing when and what surgery she would need. She drank a bit the first day, nothing the 2nd day. She had the procedure in the pm, was in the surgery dept. They were successful. They Cauterized the blood vessels and sent a 1cm lesion for biopsy. They have no idea if it's malignant or not. It will take about a week.  In the meantime she is off treatment. Trial Onco called, there was progression of the liver in the CT that they took for the bladder, and the markers and enzymes are going up so it's in D's best interest to stop the tx. Yeah, I've been telling her, hey the #s are not going in the right direction. Now, we are hoping former Onco should respond and see what could be done. D is in no mood to get chemo, which the trial doc said she'd probably get now, I mentioned Immunotherapy Onco said they are looking which trial would accommodate her. And she really can't afford to be off a/t. We are just floating, waiting for a miracle. Thank you all you beautiful people for your caring and encouragement, I felt your positive thoughts.  ",

The Intervention Radiologist seemed smart (he does not look it, don't judge by the cover..) and caring. He was extremely concerned, he said and showed it to me on the screen, D did not want to be in the room, he showed how the tumors took 50% of the liver, pretty much the whole right lobe, the left is not so bad comparingly. First to the bottom line, he called the Hospital and cancelled some of the ppl he had on schedule for Monday, and told the assistant THIS is urgent and get her in. He said there is still a very small window, if it gets worse no one is gonna wanna do it. The procedure: Let's say, Monday, it would be something like an angiogram, to make sure that no physical aberration would interrupt the process, and that there is no pathway to the lungs ( so this radiation does not get into the lungs)etc... if she is approved, then they would order this treatment from Syrtex in Australia, it is specially dosaged (my word) to the person, and it is time sensitive, in other words, it should be arriving about a week after the order, and they will call exactly what time she has to be there, then they insert this high radiation thingy, he explained but i can't relate back, and she is \"suppose\" to go home the same day. BUT she cannot be near the children for at least 3 days. So of course she is very upset about that, her life is really being turned upside down. My SIL said he will tell the kids they are going away for 3 days and I'd move in, yes, but they are middle of the school year, they won't like it, they will smell a rat. I asked IR do we have an option? He said no. Life would be much shorter. This monster needs to be stopped. The liver metabolized the chemo, and if she will need chemo of some kind, if it won't do the job there is no need for the chemo. Going back to the AM, long long visit with new RO, she could not believe the amount of mets. Damaging ones at that. The orbital area, is in danger of causing visual loss it's that bad, nerves on the lateral is causing numbness, her shoulders, other lesions that are pushing into the skin on the chest, and much to her concern the thoracic she is very scared what she will find when she sees the MRI specific to the spinal area that she is ordering, she is afraid she will see dangerous compression. NOW, this girl was being cared for by top docs in top Hospital. I have an email i just reviewed from June, RO telling me she reviewed THE REPORTS, and it's stable. No it was not stable, and she did not bother looking at the images herself, i think, because this is a train wreck it did not happen overnight. I can't even, because i'll explode. How could they? New RO says you can't just treat little pieces always, you gotta look at the big picture. Conservative is not always good. And then I ask you, they know the situation, just do it damn it, what are they protecting her for 20yrs down the road, she told them this hurts this hurts, and they kept saying systemic systemic, of course you can't do every bone, BUT her pictures are horrible. So new RO says oh this urgent, so i called her in the PM, and i told her you told us this is urgent, but IR is saying the liver is urgent. So she said liver is MORE urgent. She'd give her a break of one day after the Y90 and then she'd start her on extensive daily Rads for up to 3 weeks. Mind you, IR told me that after Y90 there will be great fatigue. I asked him what kind of fatigue, he showed me like the sleeping kind! So hmmm how are we gonna drag her to Rads....I don't know. Grannax does any of this ring a bell for you? Did you go through the same steps? Was it very tiring after. I wish we could all hear from more ppl that went through it. I asked how many he has done? He said about 150 p/year. The truth is from what he says, we don't have the luxury of waiting for appointments to get other ppl and delay this. And the other Rads are being held back because of this. She is taking the Neratinib it's causing abdominal pain, i hope she could tolerate it. Yes, my friends, honestly it's unthinkable.",

I'd say that is applicable everywhere. Crazy, instead of being the norm, we think we found gold. Ronnie no she won't take that, thanks. I saw that potassium was very low, RO ran BT on Friday b4 starting the 2nd phase of the Rads from the neck down, which was today, and this is one of the things that popped up, aside from low hgb etc..and banana she won't take, too difficult yet, so I saw that raisins are good, so she's gonna swim in that. Also, she still has the hematuria, last nt was scary she almost could not pass urine, and then forced herself to drink(because she can't really drink yet- if she drinks a lot it suppose to help), and thank the Lord she passed large clots and then it quieted down. BUT really WTH??? she does not have enough to deal with??? THIS is for sure the devil we DON't know!! It's about the Bladder Hemangioma, URO fulgarized it, and the type she had there is like 1% of ppl that get it, and mostly males, so like what??? So the question is for how long could this go on, she is so young this is not a 90something person, that is maybe more used to dealing with this type of indignities URO is so nonchalant about it. She has an appointment very early on Wednesday with this winner, she feels something on the left side of the pelvic area, I don't know what he'll say. For all she's going through i should have been on some good drugs when i was pregnant with her, at least i could have had a good excuse. This is not normal.",

Dani had another episode with the clots, you know the rule never go to the ER on a Holiday/weekend/doctor we broke all those rules. She had to go the ER thursday evening, we were in the Hospital till a few hours ago. Doctors were not in. The bottom line, the Urology team was messing with her. Finally she got the cystoscopy again with burning of the burning vessels in the bladder. While at the ER she went overr to the Rads department, because she could not have a break. Foley and all. All doctors that look at it or were asked about it know and say that this is extremely rare in the bladder, Hemangioma, and the problem is this is not stopping, it's not the end. Now she is home, but still very anxious and apprehensive. I am looking for different options. This urologist, he wasn't in but his team did the dirty work, but he messed up badly. Could anyone here give me an idea how can I find out WHO is an expert in something like this? How can I even look into it? In all the reading I did in the internet I could not find anything. We are desperate, it seems it's only a matter of time it will happen again. She's so bruised up in the area from so much trauma. She still cannot swallow, she weighs less than 80Lbs. She is trying very very hard. It's hard to come back from something like this, in the midst of radiation on top of it all. At least mets she could understand, but this is unthinkable. Blockage of urine, pain and having to deal with miserable doctors that want to access the situation before acting. I was with her all of this time, her husband was there but went back to be with the kids, we did not sleep or eat. Something has to be done. This is taking a real toll on her. Of course she needed blood transfusion again. Her counts all tanked. if you have any doctors friends/family if you could ask how do I go about finding a very rare disease doc. Thank you all. I read your updates. Artist, your situation breaks my heart. it's unthinkable the uncaring of all these ppl. Babs just a great picture, thanks for sharing with all of us.

Hopefully i'll get the low down on the dosage and exactly what chemo she is on this week when she goes in for the tx and i'll post it. Zar where you vacationing? Unbelieavable how every step of the way something is gotta be. The port did not bother D much, but once out, she never wanted it again. Now she is a professor in veins. Don't mess with her. Whoever takes her blood or gives her the infusion better listen to her, first she's always right, and if they mess up, let's just say I don't know her.i really hope it works out for you. Zar only you could pull off such a sophisticated plan. WOW sure hope you writing these stuff down. It's so exciting. Kaylyne being off treatment and being on trials that were not really geared to Dani's well being, but to statistical numbers definitely messed her up. My opinion. So glad you are on this tx now. Thx for sharing the good news. Artist I hate to say it but exactly, I've read books of doctors that WHEN they find themselves in the patient shoes their whole perspective changes. Just got this article, it's one example. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/well/live/resolutions-of-a-cancer-doctor.html?hpw&rref=health&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well Kaayaborg so which chemo will you be on?

Kimberly thank you so much for keeping Dani in mind, she also bought a very expensive European hair wig, but she loves it. Even when she was not on hard chemo, her hair never really grew back, she was brunette with straight hair, her hair grew back curlish redish. She was so young the first time around, 25yrs old, when she told me she's shaving her hair it was so hard. Like Zar said, and everyone knows, hair is our identity, it's one more thing you lose control over, it's definitely a reminder. It's a very important factor. Of course you miss it. But Zar weren't you now on those chemos? Could not that have been the reason for you to have the hair thinning, I know that this Onco when he put her on this tx he said he will try to keep the dose levels down, and her hair should not really fall out, but there would be some thinning (from the thin). And she also has bald spots due to rads. She almost always has her hair covered with some kind of Gizmo, people always ask her where she got this hat or that, you know more like a beanie, she also got bangs separately and a wig like with a halo type and puts a beanie on top and voila she has another look. She used to customize it for people, pompoms and whatnot, she was selling it at one of the Centers, but then she could not control the tx schedules, and she said they could not count on her any longer, she packed it all up and called me, and I ran over to pick it up to give away so she should not have to look at it and feel bad. Zar when are you traveling for the rads to start? JFL so glad you got things going. Husband it's truly beyond. All this adds up to pure negligence. It's very convenient when the patient knows what they need and are able to articulate. She is a lucky and smart gal. Guys, this is what just happened to my aunt, she is 90yrs old, kinda Alzheimer's not too bad, she is a rehab/nursing home place because she fell broke her femur, had surgery but needs full time care. Anyway she has a feeding tube for years because she was not eating. Nurse (not aide) comes into the room and tells her she will be fed(in other words just hooking up the bottles and in it goes), my aunt said she is not in the mood, nurse says ok and leaves. My aunt has a private aide 24/7, that aide called my sis right away and when my sis called adm and told him that she will make so much noise the place will rattle. In no time she was being fed. BUT if she were to be alone, the rest you all know. Btw, it's in one of the better places!! MJH oh that mutation line PRECIOUS! I agree they would not change, they would be annoyed.",

Type like Einstein, not that disheveled hair, but if you were to tell me a few months ago that Dani has a relationship with him, i'd laugh it off. Yes, the first time was a few hours the appointment, it looked like a funny show, we were all together in the room (her hubby also) then he went out then i went out, at one point neither were in the room i was with the doc discussing notes. Then also i was on the phone with him a lot, sometimes she asked me to call him, sometimes the 3 of us had conference call, mostly due to the bleeding, but for the 2nd infusion I stayed with the kids, it was snowing, and she was just fine with him, she's in a private room (albeit very old) and he comes in they chat, they are learning things about each other. She is very much her own person, she lets him know what she likes what she will put up with. One of the ppl there, is a miserable person and Dani let him know she's not working with her.

So sorry about the hair issues, you worked so hard to protect it. Candy-678 I don't know if we could answer with total certainty, one might say different docs order different scans. But just a thought, of course Onco is worried about the liver, so are you, but having active mets in the bones as much is not a priority it cannot be ignored. There are many discussions which scans are better, for some reason bone scans don't always show active mets. Pet scans are more reliable I think. You could say you hear so many stories you'd like to be more aggressive about it. Most MO's I think only want to order scans for the brain if there are complaints. In my DD case, when her mets started going crazy I got advice from BCO caring gals, that she should insist on MRI and she did and lo and behold she had already mets to the Dura. She did have then the first rads to the area then. Granna it's a dilemma, if you feel comfortable asking straight out would help you understand what MO's thought process is. Dani has ERBB2 ESR1 the whole thing and many more, and nothing takes for her. Go figure. Abraxane/Halevan Carbo/Gemazar, afinitor, you name it, she's had it, all the new ones also aside from Immunotherapy. Even Herceptin did not get her to a decent place. Herceptin/TDM1/ Perjeta just go through it all. Very weird. Zar what an incredible force you are. Well done. So sorry it was a rough go for a while, but you showed C who is the Boss! WOW what an incredible story. And you do all this on your own?? How did you do it? Love your explanation about the scans. You know we are always debating this over here.

Who helps you with the drainage? Re: Dani, Thank you so much for the reminder, I reread it. Love your input. The truth is it was a Genetic Counselor, and she did explain but the more you read the more you understand. I tell you the truth, it's scary that's for sure. As you said, there is no target therapy for the P53 but if they even have a small suspicion the way we are looking at it, it's only responsible to go for it. Unhappily. But not to do it, then she and I, we are gonna be wondering the whole time. Dani has 2 sisters, and 2 little girls, I don't think she has much of a choice. When do we say no? And they also wanna check for PALB2 that was not around a few yrs back when she was checked for BRCA1/2. Artist with the enzymes going down, is it worth it to continue on Ibrance? Is it not irritating your liver? If Ibrance is the culprit, what's the plan? Barbe so sorry for the way you are feeling now. Are you having the ascites sucked out? What's the plan? Timothy I don't know the details of how you deal with the docs, but if you are doing the research and you think you would know to speak with docs more directly, would be a good idea for them to have your number and speak to you? Would that work for your wife? It all depends on how you guys like to tread on these issues. I know docs don't like to spk twice to family, that's why I am mentioning this. Also, from experience, do you have a Health Proxy, a Power of Attorney? Both. Even if you are a husband, and officially next of kin, things could get very messy very fast when you get underpaid overworked professionals with ego issues. I just read Hospital Stay Handbook, by Jari Holland Buck. It's all there. She did everything for her hubby, was with him 24hrs at the Hospital, but you get one wacko and she was almost barred from being in his room. Kayyborg so glad for you that you had less SE. How many kids do you have? It's beyond hard to have to worry about Money. This is beyond difficult. I wish the best of luck to resolve this asap. Shelby wish you the best. They didn't decide what they gonna do for the liver for Dani, my daughter, maybe after scans tom and after Rads Onco visit on Friday. Onco said they might not know much by doing biopsy that would change treatment now. So she would be on Navelbine and Herceptin. But so many here are on Xeloda. She was on it, 2 yrs ago on it's own. But maybe Onco wants to keep it for reserve. I mentioned it, but she prefers this tx now. Sherri sorry you have to join, but this is a wonderful set of the best people, so we will all help you through.",

All of you ladies are soo wonderful, and thank you so much for being so supportive. I have been extremely anxious with this status now, also with the lesions in the skull. I spoke to an outside RO and he said we should ask for Radioembolization. I will try, but they seem so adamant in doing less. I cannot even get them to do a biopsy. And I know, ONCO does not make decisions on her own, she has group meetings. I do wish they would be more aggressive. I think.",

Hmm to throw a wrench into all this, my daughter was PR+95% PR15% Her2+ 1 only KI67 30%she is Luminal B, which no Onco ever told us or bothered explaining to us, I found out about the importance in this site. She was put on Tamoxifen of course with all the other chemo, rads, but was not told about taking out the ovaries, and BS was not in favor of mastectomy, he said studies have shown it did not make a difference. This lasted only 2 yrs, very short time on Tamoxifen which in itself is already a sign that is aggressive, then after much prodding to the Onco, a new biopsy was done, (also because scans were constantly showing progression), and it showed PR1% and then it showed the HER2+ change. At that time she was advised to have an oophorectomy/hystero asap, which she did. In her late 20's. It was eating me up. Not that she was thinking of more children at that point, but Menopause at 27\u2026 she dealt with it better than I did. But it did allow access to more treatment options for Menopausal women. She had 3 biopsies. Biopsy of Iliac bone, Foundation One, then BT with Guardant360, then this year Foundation Act also BT (because there was constant progression). All have shown the same. Onco said to me, well we could see she does not respond to Hormonals, that's why she took her off Ibrance/Letrozole (they were trying it, even thou it's for HER2-). I was thinking if she is ER+98% how could she be not responsive to Hormonals, now I am thinking so is it because the PR is 1%?They don't take the time to explain. I waste so much oxygen wondering! And also now they tested for Androgen Receptor, which came back at 75% I believe. Butwe have not gotten to speak about it yet. It seems in the future Onco wants to be able to access it. Not that there are known tx for Androgen Receptor in MBC but maybe\u2026. Letmywifelive Thank you for looking into the Ixempra thingy. I understood that you were not so keen in going UCSF, do you have other options? Zar what a terrific link you sent, I am trying to understand it, but it's very informative. Robin - Letmywifelive there is def a problem with trusting you doc. It's hard for me to just let go. And no, I don't trust them. In a major Cancer Center just a few mos ago, I happened to ask my daughter if they gave her the Xgeva, and btw the Herceptin has to be given etc...( i called her she on the chair having the other chemo), she asked the nurse, and she said oh they took you off it, Onco was not in town, I was like what? they didn't tell us about it, but then Onco said oh they misread my notes, and because of that she had to have Herceptin started again as a new infusion(time wise) instead of just the regular follow ups. Not the end of the world, because I caught it, but this goes on all the time everywhere, in my opinion if nurses see something that has been given from time immemorial and it's not there, she should double/triple check and if it's a new thing, they should double/triple check. You guys no the drill. And it's not just the doc in a private office as in the good old days, now there is a whole Hierarchy so whatever doc says is not enough.Oh I could tell you stories.

I always call pretty much the next afternoon, and ask if the report is ready, it usually is, and ask them to send to PCP. PCP's office is more accessible to us, he also sends me the fax so like Zar says I could be prepared to speak with Onco. If it's really bad, he will call even in the middle of the day. Onco's office takes their time. It's run like a factory. Also, I have gone to pick up the report myself to the Imaging place at times. I cannot imagine having to wait this long to get a response.

She had rads to T1/T2, they were kinda taking their time procuring the best way to do it, and I spoke to RO to remember that she is off treatment so they should get moving. Well it's done, and now she will start today. Her AST/ALT have been holding, BUT the Alkaline Phosphate has been going up - is this something to be concerned about? Her CEA also all of a sudden has gone up. But aside of her TM's, which I don't bank much on, is the BT telling us something? TIA",

Zoladex less than a year later and Tamoxifen was added- Zometa StageIV \u2013 Halaven/Zoladex - Oophorectomy -Then Faslodex then Gemcitabine/Carbo then Femara -Then CMF and then MF then Xeloda \u2013 then Examestane+Afinitor- Afinitor was taken off \u2013 then Examestane +Cyclophosphamide THEN Halaven again. After 2 years of this nonsense, Onco agreed to do a biopsy, lo and behold - Her2 change to Her2+ then in was ER95 PR 1 Her2+ (fish 3) Herceptin/Perjeta/Xgeva \u2013 Then Herceptin/Perjeta/Abraxane \u2013 then just Kadcyla \u2013 then Ibrance/Letrozole \u2013 then Added Herceptin \u2013 Dropped Ibrance/Letrozole and started Navelbine/Herceptin \u2013 then Ixempra/Herceptin/Xeloda till now.(Xgeva) I hope this says it all",

They could measure it. But maybe it's good to know. I'd love for DD get some scan specific to the area, but Onco keeps saying what's the point, we know it's scattered, innumerable some quite large some small. I hate to tell you, but one only feels it, when like Isy got bloated or it's painful or even pushing up in the ribs etc... and a higher grade of ascites,so things could be going on prior to all these symptoms. And if you know before, i'd say you could act sooner. good luck with your decision. Thanks for the tip on Hopkins, I'll keep it in my to do list, she will try this new Trial, starting tomorrow. We all hate the wait, but there is not much of a choice at this moment and just pray that this thing kicks ass. ",

I do have to ask you, why would they put you on a trial if you tried so few treatments. I know the trial people were happy she had been on TDM1 already like yourself, they said this was like a stronger TDM1. For instance Tykerb could have been taken with Herceptin. Xeloda with Herceptin. How come this was not done in your case. What basis was treatments changed in your case, scans were always showing progression? Dani had those treatments with Herceptin, as a matter of fact I think when they started her on 2 consecutive trials with no Herceptin(of course), that's one of the reasons things started really going haywire, and also the fact of the long wait with no treatments. Im sorry I don't want to worry you,but it's the truth. Im not sure for people (as Dani) with aggressive cancers waiting for trials, is such a good thing. And the brain mets, she had to get an outside RO to do it, because they were not concerned with that. Their goal did not include, did NOT CARE what her brain was doing. To be sure, Im not sure WHEN it's a good idea for trials, but in her case it messed her up. If Onco is telling you that they can't target your HER2+ this trial targets exactly that, so maybe you could ask them why do they think this is the right answer. As we've all learned maybe you have more than one type of HER2... Babs how wonderful to hear how busy you are with Anton, good for you. Scan shmam you ARE in control. Anton time it is. JFL what's the name of that trial? I hope you get a hold of the original biopsy. How could they expect people to have biopsies from so long ago? Happens to be that i have Dani's biopsies, i made sure to get it, they made me sign that Im responsible for it, and the liver biopsy I also made sure to get it right after it was done, it's not easy but I thought i should tryYou gotta get the right ppl on the other end to cooperate.

I have that info, i even called them. Your heart was always with concern for others. You had that wonderful vacation with your family. Beautiful memories. You always spoke to me of your daughters, how proud you are of them, how close they are. You left them a legacy. Now they will carry on with that legacy. Peace my good friend.  ",

My daughter is a young woman of 31, with 2 little girls, she never ever complains or expects pitty, but what's really annoying(besided EVERYTHING), is that in her case she is being constantly reminded about the monster that took over her life. Trips for infusion every week, she just had a couple of weeks of rads again, (they spaced it out so not to be too intense), and other visits to a dentist specialist, eye specialist, neuro (in a way we are very blessed that we DO have all these ppl looking after her, and the infusions of all this stuff that did not exist years back, let's face it). BUT, she would like a little time to feel like a normal young woman. Just some break to forget.",

First, my best wishes to you! My daughter is 31yrs old, with mets for 3 yrs, but now it's all over the skeleton and we went to an interventional radiologist, and guided by the CT they did a biopsy from her hip. At this point, bcs the chemo is not really workg, they wanna know if there is more info on the type of cancer she has to target it better. Canuklehea i hope you are on the road to get the right meds.",
