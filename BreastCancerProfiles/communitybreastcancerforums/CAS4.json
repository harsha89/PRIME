You inspire me, I'm gonna step up my game. Still have tremendously weak legs from chemo. Rad #10 was today. Noticed armpit rad site is sensitive today but so far only physical effect. I do have to crash about 2-3 hrs after rad, it's like I crater into exhaustion but 45 min of hard sleep and I'm good again. It's very frustrating, I'm a go person. I'm learning this year to embrace the down time with my pups and reading and taking care of myself. Still frustrating at times though. LMVerna I'm glad yesterday went so well!

I wore crazy hooker wigs in all colors for chemo to get others to smile. I'm currently in the baby bird phase of re growth and its shockingly almost all white and silver!

I kicked chemos ass and the week following my final one it showed me some teeth. But these first two rads have absolutely exhausted me. I glided thru chemo so I've found this upsetting. I hope the fatigue stays here and doesn't continue to increase with the next 32 rads. Glad I finally joined, been on the outside reading for months now. I can't believe YALL are working. You are wonder women! I can't sleep at all at night and have ridiculous hot flashes and left leg pain every damn night which my heated chest joins in on the party now. I also began getting pain in my right arm yesterday, my rad arm. As long as I don't use it it doesn't hurt or have discomfort- thank god I'm left handed.

I put the crappy, old, open in the back gown on, race across the hall take my right arm out and lie down, thereby exposing my right side from neck to waist of my jeans- or pajamas, whatever I slapped on. The techs from hell- or I should say the techs I'm just giving up on- tape the gown down the middle of me and then begin their daily artwork. They return between \"zaps\" to add more sharpie lines some of which they like to cover in scotch tape. No getting \"that area\" as in my right front and side wet until I'm done w treatments - 32 total, last 5 boosts, #13 tmrw- dec 22 is last one- until then I smell like roadkill on a hot highway. I actually blamed a stranger's dog for farting last week at the vet- true story- ugh- the owner was so handsome and sat on my right side- the stinky side- my only defense was to blame his damn dog and it worked, he even apologized for the damn dog. I've been instructed to fill a sock with cornstarch and \"slap\" it up into my right armpit- I see no point in this activity at all except maybe if I need to make a stinky paste. I've also been told by techs and patients and an RO that sometimes radiation can cause terrible odor- let's hope this isn't permanent. I actually was asked to do a photo shoot w my surgeon for MDA and for some medical journal about her new technique of surgery that saves more lymph nodes. Lucky me I got to dress in a crappy, old, open in the back gown while she pretended to feel me up for the camera. I asked the photographer if he would send me one or two of the pics. He did. It's the most horrifying photo I've ever seen- and its me!!! Ugh. I know I've gained 40 and I know I'm pasty and I know my tits are \"misaligned\" and I know my hair is growin back in pubic style patches and I know my eyebrows and eyelashes are gone and I know my face is puffy and I know there are bags under my eyes and I know I look tired and I know I don't walk as fast and I KNOW I'm kicking cancer's ass- but that photo hit me in the gut and there's not a damn bit of it I can blame on photos adding 10 pounds- besides- with 40 already gained why should I give a shit about 10 more!? I'm merely a suggestion physically of the girl that began this journey. So I've had to pull myself up and dust myself off this weekend and slap myself around and remind myself it could be much worse and I see the much worse every day, whether it's patients at MDA or the sad, bitter woman at the grocery store. It can always be worse. And my 4 dogs don't seem to mind nor my true friends and most strangers are incredibly polite- I just have to remind myself to be polite to myself as well, I deserve it, we all do. Remember that, ladies.  Yikes1 / Gongshow- I am slated to start Tamoxifen after Rad and I'm dreading it. Caralex- I've done 12- was extremely exhausted after 8-11 oddly. But a 45 min nap completely recharged me. I drink tons of water- tons- other than that no side effects yet at all- I do walk my dogs a few miles a day but not all at once. The leftover side effects from my chemo bother me more. Radiation hasn't bothered me yet. Chemo was easy for me. Lots of issues with my knees now and I can barely move if I've been seated more than 10 minutes, horribly stiff when I awake. Began after rad 2 having extreme neck, spine and under right scapula pain, extreme and I can handle pain. Threw Advil, Vicodin, ice, heat, you name it at it to no avail. Saw my chiro 3x this past week for deep tissue, tens machine, stretching and adjustments. He says he sees it all the time in Breast cancer patients- the radiation can destroy the muscle tissue and cause permanent damage and lifelong issues. I've added some stretching exercises and bought a lacrosse ball I put on the floor and roll it around to try and break up the knots in that area. The dogs uses this as an opportunity to give me a facial, so that's fun. I asked my surgeon about it and she said yes it is a side effect that's possible- I wanted to tell her finding a baby giraffe is possible too but not likely! The lists of possibilities are endless and it irritates me what they \"forgot\" to mention- but it wouldn't change anything, I'd still have my gloves on in the ring with this monkey working on a KO. Sure am glad I've got YALL! Anyone putting on a big meal this week? I'm so scared of sugar and dairy and carbs its damn near ruined my favorite meal- happy Monday!   ",

My oncol said she had never heard this complaint- they tend to always say that- odd bc many of the women going thru rad with me had similar complaints. Today was ur first, you might have been tense, we all were. After a week I went to see a chiro I know that does PT- he immediately started doing deep tissue massages and using tens machine 4 days a week. I don't think i could have endured that pain much longer. He said he has a patient whom is a Breast oncologist that underwent treatment herself 10 years ago that he sees 2x a week. For some folks as the radiation goes through your body it damages the scapula, lat, and other muscles in that area. It's another reason stretching and exercise are so important. I wouldn't have made it thru rad without the physical therapy, period. I also began to grind my jaw in my sleep. Dentists wanted to give me Flexeril but i didnt want to be more R constipated than I was. I've spoken with oncologists I know outside of MDA and they have said these are normal occurrences-",

Mmtagirl- I did #8 today this morning and at 430 face planted into bed for 90 minutes out like a light- I mean I slept hard- much to the delight of \"the girls\"- our Italian pointer and standard poodle. That was unexpected! my question is what do you do for your workouts? Bc I moved our 4 dogs here with me I walk 4 dogs 4 times a day- each walk is about a quarter of a mile- but today my I asked my RO if I can add light weights and she said yes. She says no cardio bc my lines will sweat off- I can't believe this sharpie business- got great, soft camis at target btw. My legs are so damm weak from chemo- I wear heels as much as possible as it helps strengthen my legs, aids with my posture which is suddenly crap and offsets my neuropathy for some reason- I discovered heels were more comfortable during my AC. Go figure. KatieC so you start tomorrow? I hope your muscle spasms go away soon. I'm going to see chiro tmrw- have such bad upper spine pain its been humbling- heels help I swear, or lying down- hope he can fix it. I hear you on back/stress/pain. Sandy.....hope you are feeling better!! Goodness!! What a scary thing! Perfectly.....I think radiation in winter is good- just think if it was hot and sunny when you were itchy, uncomfortable and sunburned? Now that would be worse! Bald in summer worked well for me too- hats are suddenly my friends- thank a God I brought a bunch from home in Wyoming when I moved down here. You get to start R and then celebrate with turkey the same week! I requested and was granted a meeting with the lady that runs all the R tech teams. I explained to her that I was there to advocate for the women too scared to use their own voices. My tech team stinks- they are cold, rude, just inappropriate overall as far as I'm concerned. Several other women have voiced the same dissatisfaction about their teams. I was polite of course but concise. We will see if Miss Pissy as I have named one of my techs can generate a damn smile tomorrow- I'm not giving up yet on her! Hugs to all!!! ",

I've had serious nausea every am since rad 4 but take Compazine. Sleep is a joke but if I get the ac to 60, walk at least 2 miles that day and go 100 miles an hour I get a few hours with some medicinal assistance and two nights ago I said screw it and poured a vodka on Ice w fresh cranberries. My dr gave me these giant sticky pads I cut to size and wear for 24 hours to alleviate burning and itching and they're a damn miracle!! Ask for them!! 4 reg rads left then 7 boosts- ie 11 left. Keep rocking ladies!!! YALL are all amazing!! Anyone ready for the holidays? If so post some pics please",

So I was advised to lightly use a clariosinic (if I had it) once the area healed to try and keep the skin from not being So tough after. Who knows. I'm not really worried about it, it's all a part of the journey. YALL can all do this!!! You are all warriors!!! We are all cheering you on to that bell, it will be here before you know it!!!!",
