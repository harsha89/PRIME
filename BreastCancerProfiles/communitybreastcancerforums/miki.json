Had bilateral mast. had 3 lymph removed, that included sentinel, in May. Began letrozole Jun, Had 1st round of Zometa, just a week ago. My pain is in shoulder blade on involved side as well as the same general area where my mine began before diagnosis. Which was treated as inflammation, Motrin, warm packs on same. Now I'm having diff. pain, sharp ,along with the constant. It will wake me out of sleep. I know I'm not alone, or the first to be scared about pain, if ur out there with like symptoms, would appreciate hearing.",

Yes, this sure is not the life we had planned for ourselves, but that does not mean we can't have life. You don't have to feel guilty,,,Jenn.  Go out there and embrace new opportunities, new challenges, new joy, life gives you!  Take charge of your life once again. As you live your life with passion, with resilience, you WILL provide hope to others.... Hugs, Miki",
