All you have to do is sign up and have your doctor fax a note confirming the chemo treatment. Cleaning for a Reason will have a participating maid service in the zip code area of the patient arrange for the service  http://www.cleaningforareason.org I wanted to use this service while I was going through chemo but  was unable to do so due to I live in a rural area that didn't have participating service. This organization serves the entire US and currently has 547 partners to help clean. Be a blessing to someone and pass on this information.
