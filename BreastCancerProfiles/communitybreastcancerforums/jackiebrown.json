For some reason I assumed I would be feeling just fine within 2-3 days, obviously it was an unrealistic expectation. It was certainly easier than my bilat 2 years ago but more difficult than I thought. My path reports should be in later this week, but the surgeon made me somewhat nervous when he said my cysts were complex and more suspicious than he thought, he also added we have to find out if it's invasive or not but never actually directly stated it's cancer. Hopefully it's nothing more than a reaction to tamoxifen. Thank you again everyone for your comments and support!! ",

I know it is supposed to be an easy surgery and recovery but I'm experiencing quite a bit of discomfort due to a bloated tummy and gas. Does anyone have any advice? I can't seem to find a comfortable position and have switched to tylenol only in case the pain meds were making my tummy situation worse. I would appreciate any advice.

I've read so many posts that say the laproscopy and recovery were easy and I started to think I was alone in my discomfort.

The next step is to decide what to do about my medication since it seems this was all a result of tamoxifen. I am 42yrs old, was premenopausal (before chemo), and have been on tamoxifen for one year. Ideally my breast oncologist wanted me to stay on tamox for another year but now thinks I should move directly to an aromotase inhibitor. My gyne onc prefers me to stay on tamox for a while longer. Any advice?",

I am 41yrs old and have 3 young boys, when I was diagnosed I first had a lumpectomy and was then told I needed a mast. At that point I sought a second opinion and switched surgeons. I ended up doing a bilat and chose expanders then silicone implants. You certainly will have more options for a symmetrical reconstruction result if you do a bilat, and of course the peace of mind regarding bc in the other breast is huge!",
