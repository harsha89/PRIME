My surgeon also confirmed that there are often better outcomes in mild cases, because long term damage hasn\u2019t yet occurred. The screening process involves several imaging tests and overall clinical assessment. Completely agree that some docs might not be aware or believe that earlier is better. I can completely relate to the feeling of not wanting this to get worse, and that this is already bad enough. I'm also in my 30s and can't fathom dealing with this for another year, let alone the rest of my life. I hope you find someone to at least assess you as a potential candidate.",

This is my second time around, I was first diagnosed in 2014 and had a complete response to chemo, had a mastectomy, and about two years later have received a new diagnosis. Oddly enough this cancer was picked up on a routine screening MRI that I was having yearly, and is just located in a lymph node on the opposite side of the original cancer. I am at one of the biggest cancer centers in the country but unfortunately still seems that I'm a rare case. I'm having TCHP this time and it's been much harder than I recall AC-THP being. I was not expecting any side effects, so I got on a plane the next morning to go cross country for a friend's wedding. Ended up feeling pretty exhausted, achy and a bit nauseous the entire time! I'm hoping that this is not how I'll feel with each round... anyone else have side effects actually improve after subsequent rounds of chemo?? Taxol previously caused me to have very low white blood counts, so I think that Taxotere is probably affecting me in the same way. I can improve upon the anti-nausea regimen but it's been hard to deal with the fatigue while working and spending time with my son (who's 3)... Anyway, best of luck to you all, and I look forward to sharing tips and experiences... Megan",

I have mild lymphedema in my hand, thumb and arm. I wrap several nights a week and use a custom glove (Jobst Elvarex) and sleeve when playing tennis, running or doing anything overly active (usually weekends). I tried an off the shelf Juzo glove and it made my hand swell badly - but it was nice and thin and soft. So several days each week my arm starts aching and I know I should be wearing my sleeve and glove. However, I need to constantly type and write for my work, and I just can't do this with this custom glove! It's thick and uncomfortable and every so often my thumb will go numb or start tingling for no reason. Does anyone have recommendations for a glove that allows them to type/write or do other things with their hands, but is still effective? I am considering a Barton Carey glove but would love to hear about any others. Also, is anyone aware of an off the shelf glove with a pocket (for added compression) on the top of the hand?
