I have received AC and TAXOL until June, 2010, had Mastectomy in July and then had radiation for about a month at the UNC cancer hospital. I am taking Tamoxifen, Lupron and Zometa infusion. I thought everything was over, and I was going to be better after my treatments, I had hopes in my heart. However, after having PET scan, MRI and bone scan, my oncology doctors told me that the cancer got into my bones, It was proven by a biospy last week. I had very difficult time during & after that biopsy and I learned the pathology results recently, therefore feel very very down these days. I feel very lonely and don't understand why I am going through this at the age of 28. It is very devastating. I came to this country 6 years ago with lots of nice dreams and hopes for the future, I furthered to my education, with lots of good intentions to help the society, humanity in a better way. At an age when one is supposed to be productive and full of life, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and now I feel as if my life is slipping through my fingers so fast. Nobody only God knows what we are destined to see in coming days and I am looking inside to find hope and strength to endure all the things happening to me, however whenever I am in pain and spend sleepless nights my hopes are going away, my bones are as sharp as a knife and giving me too much pain although I use pain reliever, I can hardly sit on my buttock.  I feel as if I am turning into a winter tree which lost its fruits and all green leaves. Only God and my mom knows exactly what I am going through every day and every hospital visits,  (I am sure you also understand me well since we are all on the same boat), my mom has been going through the very same things I am going through, unfortunately I am not a mother but if you are a mother I am sure you'll understand my mom's feelings very well. In such difficult times of my life, what can I do to find strength and fight against the cancer????? I would appreciate it very much if you could share your thoughts with me as I need advice from those who can understand what I am going through. Actually, To me, living a very long life doesn't mean that a person will have a good end as there people who go astray and do wrong things throughout their lives which I think is worse than what people are going through with a deadly disease. Personally, I strongly believe that this life is so temporary and there is a hereafter for sure, I believe that people are being tested in different ways in this life. Maybe I am a loser in this life as I lost my health and those very nice dreams and goals for my future but at least I want to live the rest of my life peacefully and with good deeds. What can I do to feel better, stay positive, get patience and have inner strength? How can I overcome all the bad feelings that this disease brings to me??? I'll be very pleased to get your good thoughts and suggestions. By the way I have been getting treatments at the UNC yet because of my recent diagnosis we are planning to go to MD Anderson. Do you know if I can find very young BC patients there or where can I find people are going through the very same things I am going through?? What do you do to get rid of the bony pain (if you have mets in your bones?)  I sincerely thank you for being here, and reading my post. I hope I can get support & good advice from you, ladies.

Though I couldn't answer your messages individually, you are all very very close to my heart and thank you so much for supporting me through this battle. I am continuing my whole brain radiation, it is very exhausting indeed, today I was very emotional, I fully trust the almighty God who knows exactly what I am going through every single day and do my best to keep my strength and faith strong yet today I've been crying a lot because I began to find difficulty in finding words and stutter. I have never experienced these kinds of things before in my life. On March the 4th, I will have an operation and they are gonna remove my ovaries. I feel as if I am losing everything and I feel very scared, if you put yourself into my shoes, how would you feel, what would you do? I can only sleep only 4-5 hours everyday, and I don't know how I will continue like this? Every single minute, every breath I take and every day is such a precious gift from God, I try to live my life daily and be thankful for each day I am given. I wish I could write here everything I am going through nowadays, I don't know what I'll be seeing in coming days but I'll do my best to give you update as long as I am alive. I wholeheartedly thank each of you for being here to support me, it really means a lot to me. All I request from you too keep me in your prayers, my dear friends.  May almighty God bless you all and reward you with best of everything.  I am sending hugs, love and warm greetings to all of you.  Take good care of your health please & Good night ~ Nil",

I read each post and sincerely thank you for supporting me, May God, the almighty Creator bless you all. Unfortunately, I've been having very very very difficult days recently, I wanted to keep you updated soon but Believe me I couldn't absorb all the things happening so suddenly and that I've been hearing from the doctors. According to the MRI result, my oncology doctor and radiation doctors told me that the cancer got into 9 different spots in my brain. I am in a very very serious condition, and we were just planning to go to MD Anderson for my bone mets but the doctors began radiating my whole brain last week as they think it is very very critical for me. Today was the 3rd day of my radiation, I feel so weak, I began to use Dexamethason, steroids drug, to help with the swelling in my brain. First days, my brain couldn't accept food, I was throwing up, my hands began to tremble and had headache. I feel very scared, I hope I can overcome all the things happening to me and I request prayers from all of you. I believe that Everything is possible, miracles can happen through the help of Almighty God. When I feel better, I'll do my best to write you back. Take Care pls, I am sending love and warm greetings, Nil (Nilufer) ",

Before leaving for the hospital, I sincerely appreciate your support and thank you for all your posts, I read them one by one and tried to write back to you individually for the last 30 minutes, but the website wanted me to login again and that long post disappeared!! So I am writing again, I hope this time my message will be posted. I would appreciate it very much if you could keep me in your prayers. Starting tomorrow, I'll be spending my days at the cancer hospital, I hope I can come back here with good news. May God bless you all and give you a very good health, sunny days filled with peace, love and happiness. Much Love, and Warm Greetings, Nil (Nilufer is my full name and it means waterlily)",

Only God and my mom knows exactly what I am going through every day and every hospital visits,  (I am sure you also understand me well since we are all on the same boat), my mom has been going through the very same things I am going through, unfortunately I am not a mother but if you are a mother I am sure you'll understand my mom's feelings very well. In such difficult times of my life, what can I do to find strength and fight against the cancer????? I would appreciate it very much if you could share your thoughts with me as I need advice from those who can understand what I am going through. Actually, To me, living a very long life doesn't mean that a person will have a good end as there people who go astray and do wrong things throughout their lives which I think is worse than what people are going through with a deadly disease. Personally, I strongly believe that this life is so temporary and there is a hereafter for sure, I believe that people are being tested in different ways in this life. Maybe I am a loser in this life as I lost my health and those very nice dreams and goals for my future but at least I want to live the rest of my life peacefully and with good deeds. What can I do to feel better, stay positive, get patience and have inner strength? How can I overcome all the bad feelings that this disease brings to me??? I'll be very pleased to get your good thoughts and suggestions. By the way I have been getting treatments at the UNC yet because of my recent diagnosis we are planning to go to MD Anderson. Do you know if I can find very young BC patients there or where can I find people are going through the very same things I am going through?? What do you do to get rid of the bony pain (if you have mets in your bones?)  I sincerely thank you for being here, and reading my post. I hope I can get support & good advice from you, ladies. May God bless you each of you and all your loved ones and May 2011 bring you good health, peace, love and joys. Take good care!

Believe me each of you holds a very special spot in my heart and I am praying for myself and I am praying for you too.  May our Creator bless you all and reward you with the best of everything.  Here, I apologize from all of you for being away, I wanted give you an update regarding my condition earlier, however after all the devastating news, my life has been very hectic, I had a very busy schedule at the cancer hospital lately. As the doctors told me that I have 9 spots in my brain that has cancer, they had no option but to begin to radiate my whole brain immediately. Now every single day, my mom and I go to the cancer hospital to get whole brain radiation, I feel so tired but I am thankful that I am lucky enough to get treatments, there are people who are less fortunate. I remember one of nurses saying that I am now on a road without any roadmap, that is they think anything may happen to me at any time. In fact, I have lots of different feelings going inside, but no matter what they say about my situation, I fully trust in God, the Almighty, he is the one who Created all of us and gave us life and again He is the one who will take care of everything. Though everyone thinks that I am in a very critical condition, as the cancer is in such vital organ, with God everything is Posssible. Therefore, I kindly ask you too keep me in your prayers. When our mortality smacks us in the face, it hurts, but through this I've learned a lot and I thank God for this. If everything goes well, and as long as I am alive, they'll continue to radiate my whole brain until the beginning of March, and today they also began to radiate my T-spine as it was causing to much pain. Then hopefully, we would like to go to MD Anderson to see doctors there, I hope we can make it. The doctors are planning to do Lumbar puncture to see if I have this disease in my nerve system in the spine. They will remove my ovaries to keep the hormone level low, I know that I'll have difficult days but I'll do my very best to keep you updated.  Once again, I sending you many thanks from the bottom of my heart for your kindness, lovely messages, positive thoughts, and most importantly for your prayers. I would be very appreciative of it if you could keep my name in your prayers. That is what matters most to me.  Sending you hugs, warm greetings and much love, Nil (Nilufer)     ",

I apologize for being out of touch for some time. Though we don't know and see each other in person, I personally think that you all have very gentle, kind souls, I really feel that way. The things you write here really makes me feel that I am not alone and May God, the almighty, reward you with the best in both here and hereafter too for you are all very kind and caring. I have been having some difficult days after the radiation. Thankfully, my whole brain radiation and bone March the 2nd; however, my condition is serious because of 9 tumors I had in my brain. I sometimes have shooting pain in my brain and forehead, I hope my situation is getting better not worse. Because of some strange symptoms I had, my doctor wanted me to start oral chemotherapy last week, and since I was not feeling well enough I had no option but to reschedule my ovarian surgery to a later time. Only God, our Creator, knows how long we are destined to live in this earthly place, nothing is for granted in this life, we don't know how and where we will die, just like those healthy people who died in Japan because of the disaster. I am a firm believer that none of us belongs to this earthly place, when our time comes We will return to our Creator, this life is a nothing but a test therefore I am grateful to God who has created me and showed my existence. I've been feeling very tired and can only sleep only few hours everyday because of the swelling in my brain and stereoids and all the other drugs I have been using, but I'll do my best to give updates here as long as I am alive actually I will ask my husband to post here if I pass away so that you'll know it. If you'd like me to follow on Facebook, I'll be happy to add you to my facebook list too because I see all of you as my friends not as strangers. I will have lumbar puncture this Wednesday, that is tomorrow at the UNC hospital here in NC as my oncology doctors wants to understand if I have leptomeningeal metastates, that is if I have cancer in my spine fluid or not. I hope I will not hear any bad news from them after tomorrow's operation. If everything goes as planned, we are flying to Texas on March 20 as I have appointments with oncology doctors and scans at the MD-Anderson cancer hospital.  After my appointments at the MD-Anderson we may go to University of Pittsburg to take part in a clinical trial that my doctor recommended to try.  I don't know if my situation will get better or worse but I hope I can always give you my good news here. I am really going through very difficult times yet I have no doubt the almighty God is All-Hearer and All-Seer. I trust Him and I know he has a plan for everyone He created. Before I stop here, I'd like to kindly ask \"everyone to do at least one small good thing for people suffering in JAPAN, , Please pray for them.\" Try to put yourself into their place, imagine yourself losing your child, parents, wife, husband, friend, any loved ones, home, car or food or anything that you thought that belonged to you and Please try to understand how much support, prayers they would need from other people around the world including \"us\". Nothing is For Granted in this Life, Who knows what is waiting us Tomorrow???. One Individual Can Make a Big Difference, and that indeed, it is each person's responsibility to do so. One small good deed you do for them may change a person's life completely.  (I posted some photos on my Facebook to support them and show what they are going through nowadays)http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=282425&id=593943310&fbid=10150109754348311 ) I hope I can come back here wih my good news. Take good care health please and I wish you a beautiful spring season full of sunshine. May God watch over you and always shower His Blessings on you, my dear friends. Sending you much love, hugs and warm greetings from North Carolina. ♥♡♥♡♥ Nil (Nilufer) PS: I would also like to share the following nice, inspiring video with you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0daM97RT0k Please take a minute to ponder: If you are alive and healthy now and if your organs are functioning properly, I think it is a such a big blessing to be thankful for. With Love, Nil",
