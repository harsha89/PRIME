My surgeon did a wedge resection which is removal of some tissue surrounding the symptomatic duct.  My results came back benign, but I got a second opinion and I am having my slides read again by a pathgologist at a comprehensive breast center.  Those results should be back any day now. I'll post an update when I hear anything. Take care, Michele",

I was having bloody nipple discharge, one side, one duct.  I had ductoscopy and major duct excision performed on Sept 4th.  They took one duct and did a wedge resection to the surrounding tissue.  The other duct they explored, but did not take.  Path report was benign-hyperplasia, chronic inflammation, lobular changes consistent with fibrocystic disease, no evidence of atypia or malignancy.  Now it is almost 4 weeks later and I am having bloody discharge again.  Has anyone experienced this?  Michele Log in to post a reply",

I appreciate what you are saying.  I am not completely at ease with this situation.  Initially I was, but now that the bleeding has returned I have started questioning a few things.  How does fibrocystic change cause bloody nipple discharge?  The only thing I could find that is known to cause this was papilloma and cancer.  I know these are questions I need to ask my surgeon.  She is more than sweet and helpful, but I try to do my research in advance. Thanks so much for listening! Michele",
