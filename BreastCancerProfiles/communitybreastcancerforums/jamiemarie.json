She even indicated she could be convinced to keep me on ibrance/faslodex because the progression was small. I asked about the aromasin/entinostat trial, but it had just closed. But she offered to contact a neighbor hospital to see if they had slots. She had also contacted a colleague about another trial testing a new mtor inhibitor but that trial wont open for another 4-6 weeks. So I was overwhelmed and felt a bit unprepared, even though I thought I was. I almost felt like she didnt know what to make of things. We are doing another biopsy and she will send to caris too. I am starting exemestane and she also prescribed afinitor, but instructed me not to begin it until we decide on what to do about a trial. I brought up localized liver treatments and she wasnt very excited. But said i could talk to IR when I do my biopsy consult. So I guess we\u2019ll see... I wish there was a crystal ball on knowing exactly what to do when...Thanks again for all the help and kind words, it means the world to me! Jamie",

Numerous trips to my primary care physician were fruitless- they claimed I had a stomach virus, pulled a muscle in my back, etc etc. It got to the point where the gallstones traveled to my pancreas and I ended up in the hospital for over a week, severely jaundiced and with acute pancreatitis. I had my gall bladder removed and it was a relatively simple procedure, and this was 13 years ago, so I would guess its even better now! I will say, I think our minds and that of our doctors are quick to attribute our symptoms to cancer. It could very well be, but unfortunately, having cancer doesnt mean we dont have to also worry about other health issues too :(",

It just sucks that I go from my first staff meeting in my new position to a doctor appointment to discuss progression! I almost didnt apply for the promotion- what ifs kept running through my head.

She preferred to keep quality of life for as long as she can. They found out it was now HER+, so i mentioned that there are a lot of new treatments that do a good job at addressing that aspect.

You bring up a lot of good points that hit home for me. We had our share of struggles, and then when I was diagnosed, instead of bringing us back together, it just widened and exacerbated the problems. When I went through all the shock and emotions of diagnosis, I turned inward and didnt want to talk about it with anyone - family, friends, or my husband. He has told me that hurt him a lot. Which then manifested in him disconnecting- in many ways, but in terms of cancer treatment, he wouldnt ask me how I was feeling or how doctor appointments or scans went. He just ignored it all. With all the feelings scans bring up, plus some health setbacks, I just couldnt get over him not being there. You are so on point with caregivers often feeling left out. In my own example, I can look back and now see some of that contributing too. I have kept the number of people who know about my diagnosis very small - its pretty embarrassing to say I didnt think much about how that was probably very hard on him to not have people to confide in. I guess I am just at the point where Im trying to get some perspective. I know we all wonder what life would be like if we didnt have cancer. Like I said, we had our share of struggles before my diagnosis, but there is no doubt in my mind that it (and all that goes with it) sent us over the edge. I know I would have done things differently post-diagnosis if I had the perspective I do now. But I also try not to blame myself (too) much, because I was just trying to survive mentally, physically, and emotionally then and now. Any maybe its just easier to blame the cancer than myself and my actions...! Thanks for listening to me ramble :) trying to get my head around things and feel safe here",
