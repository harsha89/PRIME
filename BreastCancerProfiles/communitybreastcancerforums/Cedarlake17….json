I was diagnosed with extensive DCIS in my left breast about a year ago. My doctor recommended a mastectomy. I also had some questionable spots in my right breast. I have two children (4 and 6 years old at the time) and was in a similar position to what you describe, facing the seemingly impossible choice as to whether to have one or both of my breasts removed. I ended up deciding to have a bilateral mastectomy. While that won't be the right choice for everyone, for me it was a good decision. I felt that if I only did the single mastectomy, I would forever be worried about my other breast. (My mother has been through breast cancer treatment twice in the past two years). I was also worried about needing to take the possible time and energy to go through everything more than once, especially with two young kids. Ultimately, my post surgery pathology showed no evidence of cancer in my right breast, but I still feel confident in my decision (most of the time). What I have found the most amazing about this whole crazy journey, is how incredible my kids have been through it all. Pre- surgery I was naked around them fairly often, and we would take family showers and baths. I thought that would be over post- mastectomies, but they are totally fine with my body. They were a little concerned and curious at first, but now it is just normal to them, which helps to make it more normal-feeling for me too. I did immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders (last April) and replaced the expanders with permanent silicon implants in September. Although I have yet to post very much on this site, I am very thankful to all of the women who have shared their stories and advice here. It is an amazing resource to help you find your way.You will make it through this. ",

Thank you to everyone for sharing your thoughts and experiences so far. Hallsnj5- I just read one of your posts that made me feel better about some of the decisions I've made on my journey so far. You have been through a lot. Thank you for sharing. I had extensive DCIS with positive margins and a small IDC tumour with micromats in one lymph node, so despite getting a bilateral mastectomy my MO recommended TC x4 and RO is recommending 25 radiations treatments post chemo. I had immediate reconstruction and have TEs. Am trying to figure out when to do a change over to silicon now that radiation is on the table (but I suppose that topic is for another thread...)  I also wanted to mention that icing finger and toe nails is standard practice at my hospital . They said that for the patients that keep their nails cooled for most of their taxotere (docetaxel) treatment they see very few nail complaints. They provide something similar to a ziploc bag full of ice for each hand/foot and said some people wear fingerless gloves and socks with the toes cut off to help manage the cold discomfort. Probably something pretty easy to bring yourself if your clinic doesn't provide. The ice was almost melted by the time the taxotere was finished, but still very cold. Of the two types of chemo I'm getting, apparently the nail issues and icing are only important with the taxotere. So the nurse took them off when they started my second med, cyclophosphamide. I also used a cold cap (to hopefully help keep my hair, partly in the hope of looking a little more normal for my kids (4 and 7), so was pretty frozen and shivering through the first part, but thankful to have a heating pad,some warm blankets and a good friend to help me laugh about how silly I looked... Highly recommend bringing a heating pad if you're doing icing!",

I had my first round of TC yesterday and am going back today for my first neupogen shot and to learn how to self-administer (the same kind of thing as neulasta, but split over 7 days...not looking forward to 7 self-injections after each round...has anyone else done this?) I'm also cold capping with cold comfort canada. Their protocol is to pre-cool for 30 minutes before chemo infusions begin and to continue cooling until 1.5 hours after. Ironically, I donated my long hair about a month before my diagnosis. I've cut it a little more now, just in case, so have a thick bob. GingerA - I hope your hair has finished shedding and the rest of it holds on through treatment. I have really thick hair and am nervous about shedding too. I guess I have another 12 days or so before I start to get a sense of what my hair is going to do. Please keep us updated about how this goes for you. It also might be worth asking your MO about his/her thoughts on neupogen vs neulasta. From the little bit of reading I've done comparing the two, it looks like people on neupogen have slightly lower rates of bone pain because the dose is spread out over a number of days.",
