I was seeing a very good breast surgeon near my home in Jersey but always told myself that if I ever had to deal with a serious diagnosis, I would go across the bridge to Philadelphia where some of the best hospitals in the country are. Lucky for me, Penn is only about 30 minutes from home. I just feel a certain level of comfort and confidence knowing I am in such good hands. I think it's all about your comfort level. There's no real right or wrong. Two weeks from today, I'll be one day past my surgery.... oh boy....   ",
