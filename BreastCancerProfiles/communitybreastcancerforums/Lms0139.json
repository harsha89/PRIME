After surgery did 10 days Bactrim antibiotics and on 10th day redness returned to left breast, no fever. Cultures from surgery showed only a small amount of staph which Bactrim should have taken care of. Sent to infectious disease doctor and being treated for strep infection with Vantin. Over weekend redness traveled to right chest which still has the TE. Started taking Advil and doing moist heat compresses, per family doctor. Redness returned to just left side, but my entire chest and sides are swollen! So uncomfortable! Waiting to call infectious disease office when it opens. I was told in the beginning that since I had several surgeries and radiation on the left breast it will be harder for this side to heal. Ugh!",

      "Content": "Nov 16, 2013 08:42AM - edited Nov 21, 2013 01:05AM by Lms0139 My surgery was November 4th (BMX w/ TE). Sent home 11/5/13 with scripts for Tylenol 3, Cephalaxin and Doc-Q-lace. Had to take 2 T3 every 4 hrs along with the Doc-Q-lace. Got constipated and quite sick. Cut back the pain meds to 1 / hr and switched to OTC Dulcolax (after using suppositories to clear everything up). Drains were out at 8 days and after they were removed I've had fluid retention across my chest and under my arms! I HATE this! I sit around with two small pillows under my arms. My BMX surgeon injected the blue dye into my nipple to more quickly locate lymph nodes which left a dark blue scar which may need to be removed next week......this sucks! I feel so tight! I find myself getting panicky and need to remind myself that it only been 11 days post op. No longer taking pain meds except Extra Strength Tylenol as needed. I take a mild Xanax on occasion at night, (most nights), to get a decent amount of sleep. I don't want to become dependent, but I get anxious if I don't and I'm up off and on throughout the night. Thanks for letting me vent! I hate sitting around doing nothing! However, I'd like to add that I realize that I am in a far better situation than some of my BC sisters. My love and best wishes go out to you for your journey! UPDATE: another surgery scheduled! Infection started 1 day after I finished my 10 day course of antibiotics. PS called in a new Rx for Bactrim on Saturday and he saw me in his office on Sunday, removed 50cc fluid (looked the same as what came out in drains). Went back to PS on Tueday, PS scheduled surgery for tomorrow. Won't know the outcome until he gets in there and see where the infection is. Also, there is a LOT of the SNB blue dye still in the tissue of the breast that has to be removed.",
