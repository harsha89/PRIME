Would the 3 month wait drive you insane or cause you guilt if things progressed for the worse? Five weeks ago I had a vacuum assisted core biopsy for a 1.2cm mass that had a birad 5 rating. Breast surgeon wasn't very hopeful as mass was taller than wide, lobulated, and angular. Surprisingly, it came back benign/fibroadenoma. Had my follow up yesterday and she affirmed how worried she was and then so surprised at the benign result she even contacted the pathologist. It is a complex fibroadenoma with moderate ductal hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia. So I guess that raises my bc risk somewhat, plus this is the 2nd FA to form in the last 2 years, it is complex as well didn't know that until yesterday. I am 43 and hate having to have 3 to 6 months follow ups but that is a part of my having very busy but benign breasts. To think last year I was adamant she remove the first FA and she said it was stable and not mess with it, now since another popped up so close just 2 years later I'm glad I left it alone. Right now for me, I feel better leaving them alone and see how things look at next appointment. Hope you find some peace with whatever decision is right for you.",

Since I was just diagnosed with another fibroadenoma which has 2 of the benign components as yours. Was your FA pretty typical looking on ultrasound, what size was it? Now I feel like mine could be a bomb in waiting.",

A week or so later my gyn posted the report online and I noticed it said 2 benign, stable solid masses in left breast. I knew that was wrong. I only have one, which is a fibroadenoma which has been the same since diagnosed in Feb. 2013. I confirmed with my gyn and she suggested I call my breast surgeon. Needless to say my breast surgeon is as ticked as I am. I saw her Friday and am very surprised with her reaction. She looked over my past films and reports, and said it definitely wasn't there when I saw her last May. This is a 1.2cm lobulated mass, taller than wide, and she said something about borders but I zoned out then. She even asked to bring in a student surgeon who she pointed out details to on the US. She said it doesn't look benign and made sure to work me in this friday for a core needle biopsy. Now I am at that hurry up and wait point. Even worse my mother in law passed suddenly Saturday morning and wil be having her funeral this week too. Log in to post a reply",

They are common in your 20's and even 30's. I pondered getting my first one removed 2 years ago but with close watch it's stayed stable so I've left it alone and sure enough a new one popped up this year. Now since I have 2 and each is over 1cm and sitting right next to each other I will be keeping a closer watch on them, mainly because of my age and having several other benign conditions. Just keep watch on your's for any changes in shape or feel and if so get it looked at again. If it stays stable it shouldn't cause any problem.",

I am 43, lots of cysts where they don't even count the simple ones anymore just the complex ones. Three biopsies, 3 fna's of complex cysts, and many simple cyst aspirations because some keep growing over 5cm. Just had birad 5 biopsy in April that came back as another complex fibroadenoma, doc had said she has never seen a fibroadenoma with so many malignant features. My first one came about in 2013. Breast surgeon says she prefers to leave them alone as long as they stay stable, will follow up in a few months for another US. Biopsies have shown moderate ductal hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia and part of me says get them out as things keep progressing but I want to trust my surgeon as long as they stay stable and be thankful they are benign. I am pondering a second opinion. So many here say to remove because cancer can hide and be missed. Do you see a breast surgeon? How old were you when your first fibroadenoma appeared? Are you previous ones in the right breast too or bilateral? Just curious as I have never found anyone my age with multiple complex fibro's. Hope your biopsies are soon and benign. I know it stinks to have such have busy, rare breasts!",
