I had two mammograms, followed by an MRI, all of which reveal something suspicious (so far it's categorized as architectural distortion). So, now based on my OB's and radiologist's recommendation I'm headed for an MRI guided biopsy this Friday. Is this the right/best/most prudent \"next step\"? I don't know what the best options are and am assuming the MRI-guided biopsy is best. But is it? Can anyone link me to a relative discussion. So sorry if I'm asking that the wheel be recreated!

My mammogram last month showed architectural distortion so an MRI was ordered. The MRI took place this morning at 10 am. I was told the results would be available and forwarded to my OB within 24 to 48 hours. I just heard a voicemail from the radiologist left for me at home at 1:30 pm saying she has information for me about my test. I didn't expect a call from the radiologist (the MRI office made it seem they would communicate the results to my OB and my OB would talk to me) and I didn't expect results on the same day. I'm so sick that I missed that call. I won't be able to sleep tonight. Any insight? Is the fast turnaround and the call from the radiologist direct to me a bad sign? If the result was negative would she have said so in her voicemail? I'm trying to feel hopeful but feel a lot of pessimism trying to squeeze in. What should I expect to hear tomorrow? If it matters, I live in Washington DC and the test took place at Washington Radiology Associates. Thanks for reading. Log in to post a reply",
