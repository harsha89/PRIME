I can use all the advice I can get. thanks.",

My oncotype score is 18,  right in the middle of the gray zone, but I choose to err on the side of caution.  This will not be the most fun summer on record. I am to have 4 treatments 3 weeks apart.  I plan to work as much as possible.  I am a dental hygienist (the only one in a small town).  We can all help and lift each other up.",
