      "Content": "Jan 7, 2009 11:29PM - edited Jan 7, 2009 11:33PM by living4today Hi to everyone!  Have been reading all your posts and although it saddens me greatly that we are all here, the support that is shown is just remarkable. I was dx on 12/7, had bilateral mast w/expanders on 12/24 (merry xmas) and will meet my onco next week w/chemo to follow.  When I first met my breast surgeon she had recommended lump w/radiation for mass in L)breast for IDC, she later called me and we discussed doing a bilat mast w/reconstruction, due to triple negative status.  Boy, did we make the right decision.  After surgery, found out that the left breast had 2 masses (one was 2 cm, one was 1cm)...all reports (ultrasound, etc) had only shown the 1 mass(these were triple negative)....and the right breast had  4cm DCIS (this was a complete surprise), didn't show up mammogram in October (this mass was ER+PR-HER2??)....so two different subtypes.  I keep thinking, you got to be kidding me...I am only 40, no risk factors and had truely tried to live a healthy lifestyle.  Well, enough about me...to my best guess, I will be joining the January group.  Thanks for all the great info.",
