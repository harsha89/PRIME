Now that I've found this board, I look at it every day...waiting to hear more and share my thoughts.  I was on the LE board and found you all plus more people.  How do I write on the LE board? I would love to have a Kindle.  You get them at Amazon.com.  Cost is 350, and then you have to buy everything you read for 9.99.  LE/BP is a very expensive hobby!!  I  swear by the lap \"elevator\" that I bought at Barnes and Noble for 39.99.  I found what I thought was the same thing on Amazon, for 29.99, but it lacked the extra pillow like things underneath that give it more of an angle.  I was lucky...my cleaning lady bought it from me, so I don't have to send it back. By the way, I am 63, and not only do I enjoy using my left hand for everything, I also have very thin hair, and am looking for new hairstyles for my 3 strands of hair!  I bought a hair dryer stand a couple years ago, and that is a big help.  But I can't do much with so little hair.  I have a good stylist and that helps.  I'd buy a wig, but then I wouldn't be able to put it on. By the way, my rad onc doc denies the rad did this to me. And my lymphedema PT tells me she hasn't seen my complication before.  By the way, I live in the Seattle area, where excellent cancer care is readily available.  So, duh!!! I am glad I'm alive, but what a way to have to live!!! Ronimom ",

Fasta Pasta:  cooks pasta in the microwave.  It is light and easy to handle with 1 hand.  The directions say to drain the pasta with the lid on.  I could not hold on to the lid tight enough to drain it, and wound up with a sink full of pasta!  So now I pour the pasta  into a colander.  I bought it on QVC. Garlic Zoom by chef'n.  Chops garlic in small quantities. Halve or quarter garlic first, depending on size.  The top is easy to open.  Then roll on wheels to chop it.  It took me a few tries, but it worked and I just rinsed it out in hot water and set it to drain.  bought at Fred Meyer. Bagel cutter by Ronco.  Excellent, and it even comes with a small bread knife.  I bought it at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Please let me know your new tricks, and please post this on the website, Binney.

      "Content": "Sep 2, 2009 12:29AM - edited Sep 2, 2009 12:50AM by ronimom Hi Everyone, Does anyone else have this issue?  My LE and RIBP hand turns outward, so my arm in a relaxed state, and walking forward, is palm up.  If I want it palm down, I have to hold it down with my good hand. BTW, I cannot swim anymore, not even tread water for a minute.  My wrist is unstable and I have no strength to stroke with my hand and wrist. And my shoulder flexibility is going...Maybe that's equally the problem.  I do get in the pool and move around in the shallow end.  The real kicker is that I cannot be alone at the pool supervising my grandkids. My energy healer is moving energy around and my hand, wrist and sometimes arm, flap around in response to her touch on my other side.  She moves energy through meditation and breath.  This woman is truly gifted. We don't know where this is going, and it is very interesting.  Can anyone relate?   Here's something to laugh at.  I have to put a transdermal thyroid cream in my cat's ear without being able to hold her with my other hand. Picture this: When I first had to do this to her, I would chase her around pointing at her with my index finger.  The first time I had to corner her in the bathroom.  I now speak softly to her and give it to her when she is asleep, if I am quick enough.  It's a good thing I can laugh about this. And she still loves me.  Keep on keeping on, Ralpha Ralpha",

The bad thing is I have difficulty working out in any gym by myself, because I need so much help adjusting the equipment, moving things out of my way etc.  And I hate to say it, but I am not even walking on a regular basis. The personal training thing was just too expensive, and I thought I would be able to go to just any fitness place and work out, once I knew what to do.  Bummer!! However, my arm and hand are getting smaller, still!!!  But the pan and electricity beat on!!! Believe it or not, I feel very normal and I go ahead and work at being nice-looking and sharply dressed in casual clothes, jeans and T shirts, sweaters.  It is still hard to find a jacket or blazer or even a blouse that fits my arm.  So I am mostly into sweaters, especially the short sleeve ones you wear a long sleeve t-shirt under.  I like these because when I wear a long sleeve sweater I have a hard time getting a coat on.  I live in the Pacific Northwest, and hate it when I have to struggle into and out of a coat.  Oh, and forget about zipping a jacket up. I laughed out loud when one of you came up with the answer \"it was a trapeze accident\"  That is hysterical!  I have tried saying \"it's not mine,\" or I'm carrying it for a friend.  I was the only one who thought this was funny.  I have found a couple things that help me around the house.  The best thing is to lay out the rubber shelf liner rolls that are soft and mesh like.  If you don't know what I mean, please let me know and I will go to the store and find out what they are called.  They stick to the counter and I can steady a plate or a piece of toast and use my left hand to spread the peanut butter. I am on my 2nd electric knife, and hold my right arm and hand behind my back.   I like my Black and Decker electric jar and can opener.  It sits out on my counter and most of the time, I can use it.  Anyway, it feels good to write to you all, my new friends.  My thumb hurts and I am going to get ready for bed.  Pleasant dreams, all.

I used to feel shoulder pain after driving my car with 1 hand.  A therapist recommended I get a Spinner Knob.  You have to buy it at a special place, and they professionally mount it on your steering wheel.  It cost me less than 100., and is well worth the expense.  Be prepared, you will need to re-take your driver test with the addaptation.  If you need more info, call Absolute Mobility Center at 425-481-6546.  They are very knowledgable and helpful, and could probably direct you to a place where you live.

Any advice is appreciated. Ralpha(Ronomom)",

I am being challenged by a bone spur-arthritis in my left thumb.  I am now wearing splints, hard and soft, on my thumb.  I cannot chop or cut anything on my plate.  My children and my friends cut things up for me.   My story goes on and on and on.  I had to retire early because of my disability.  I live a full, puroseful life and I have lots of support.  I have to ask 4 help more than I like. I see a great chiropractor, massage therapist, lymphedema pt, hand therapist and an energy healer, who is one of my friends. I am going to re read all your posts and take your info to my providers. I eagerly await more news from you.",

Lorelai's energy comes from her years of meditation and her energy training.  This week, she tried something new and wierd on me.  She told me my hand does not like being disconnected from my body.  She told me to tell my hand I love it instead of hate it.  Every time she works on my arm, my hand moves involuntarily.  This week, as she was working on me, my hand began to flap around, then my arm did.  I experienced this the whole hour she was working on me.  Neither of us could underrstand what was happening.  It took awhile till my arm and hand stopped twitching.  I am now conscious that my hand and arm want to move around, and I am holding everything tight.  My range of motion has decreased, and after this session with her, I got in the pool and moved my arm, breast stroking etc, and jumped around in the pool doing this.  (Last year I realized I cannot swim or even tread water anymore. My hand flaps back and forth and cannot pull the water through.)  I still cannot swim, but I was able to get in the pool and exercise my arm.  I put my compression garments on afterwards. I had fun!  I don't know where any of this is taking me, but I am open to it. Has anybody else tried energy work? My best to everyone, Ronimom",

My shoulders are alligned, and my head is much more centered.  I am learning to move my upper body by shifting weight on my feet, knees and pelvis, butt, and I am much more flexible and definitely more balanced and sure of myself. I am moving my right arm, guided and held by my shoulder.  Binney, please text or call me on my cell, 206-954-3670.  I live on the west coast, so Pacific time...I want to tell you more about my treatment.",

Every day takes real effort.  Even eating a cup of yogurt is difficult because I have to hold it and eat it wih the same hand. Thank God you guys are there for me.  I cannot find a medical person who can do anything to help me.I'm tired of medical people saying they can do nothing to help.  Blah, Blah, blah.   Ronimom",

My balance is troublesome and I work on it at the gym and around the house.  I have fallen twice this past year, once out of bed on my right side because I couldn't feel the edge.  I slid down, jammed my RIBP shoulder and hand, got brushburns on my knees.  Of course, this is not the kind of thing I tell my kids.  I DID tell my ex-husband at a family party, and I was laughing about how clutzy I am.  My daughter was horrified and wanted to know why I didn't call her.  It was 4:30 am and I got up!!! Victory for me. My sense of humor and love for my friends and family are what keep me going.  I read here once that saying \"I injured myself in a trapeze accident,\"  would get a laugh, but I find people are just too stunned  to respond. I signed up for the Lymphedema Guru's online letters.  He has some good info on his website and refers readers to step-upspeakout.org. Thanks Binney and everyone Ralpha (ronimom)",
