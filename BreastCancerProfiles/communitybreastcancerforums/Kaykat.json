I'm 41, never had any surgeries, and except for migraines, in good health until now. I went for a mammogram and ultrasound on 1/31/2018 because I found a lump. Afterward, when the technician brought in the radiologist to explain what was seen on the imaging, I knew that meant bad news. All I remember her saying is \u201cyou have a lot of stuff going on in both breasts.\" I was quickly scheduled for an MRI the next week, biopsy the following week, and appointment with a breast surgeon the week after that. I ended up having four biopsies. Two MRI guided biopsies and one Ultrasound guided biopsy in my right breast and one Ultrasound guided biopsy in my left breast. I got the call on 2/16/2018 with IDC in my right breast. (The lump I found was not the cancer spot.) The diagnosis came as a shock as there is no history of breast cancer in my family. After many appointments and decisions to make I decided on double mastectomy. So far it seems to be stage 1 grade 1. I've had good days and bad days. I've been so stressed that I've missed two menstrual cycles. Last week I had so much anxiety and was so depressed I stayed in bed for several days, slept my days away and missed work. Stress also brings on the migraines. Today was the first day that I could feel the stress falling away and I felt back to my normal self. I was even able to get back to my exercise routine, which helped a lot. What doesn't help is that I'm single, no boyfriend or partner to share with, help me make decisions, and go with me to appointments. (I had recently started dating after a nearly two decades relationship but I had to put dating on hold. This also added to my stress as I was finally happy with myself again and feeling better than ever.) I have family, they don't live near me but they can't really help with the decisions I need to make for myself. I feel like I'm going through this alone. I've also had thoughts that I'm making the wrong decisions, making decisions too hastily, and second guessing the surgeons I've chosen. It all seems to be happening too fast. I wish I would've pushed surgery out another month at least but then I'd worry about cancer spreading in that time. Anyway, my surgery is scheduled for March 30th. I'm having a bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy with tissue expanders and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Since this will be my first surgery ever I'm a little nervous about entering a surgery room and a hospital stay. My parents are coming for surgery and to help during my recovery and subsequent surgeries. I'm hoping no cancer is found in my lymph nodes. The BS does not think I will need radiation and I believe I will decline chemo if it's suggested. I also think I won't have to go on hormone therapy due to my triple negative receptors. My pathology will be repeated after surgery to confirm the initial results. What I find myself worrying about constantly is how I will look after, with implants. I haven't found any discussions about this or breast size choice. I'm a 32A (105lbs, 5'2) and although I'm small and not losing as much breast tissue as others, I am already mourning the breasts I will lose. This I am having a hard time with. Anyone else?? I have no desire to be bigger and want to stay the same size. When I'm all healed up I want to still fit into my A cup bras. Are the tissue expanders filled a little bit during surgery or are they left in deflated and filled up slowly over time? It would seem there wouldn't be much to fill up on me? I'm still not sure about the decision to get expanders. The PS said using expanders first will ensure I get the best outcome aesthetically. The implants will be placed in a second surgery and fat grafting will be a third surgery. Can anyone tell me more about tissue expanders and your experience with them? What size were you before and what size are you after? Thanks!",

I\u2019ll be going to my first yoga class tonight since surgery. I wasn\u2019t advanced or anything, basically a beginner, but I enjoyed it and hope to work on regaining strength and stamina. Besides the physical, I do sometimes have days when I feel down about my situation and my changed body. I guess that\u2019s normal. I have so much to be thankful for though. I hope everyone is doing as well!",

I was small chest size before, A cup, and I want to remain on the small side. I currently have 300 ml in each. I received 180 ml at surgery and 120 ml at the doctor\u2019s office. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be happy with my size after everything is done. I developed severe anemia from first surgery so expanders to implants surgery is postponed until my levels are back to normal. My primary said we\u2019d check bloodwork in 3-4 months. I\u2019m taking iron pills and vitamin C pills daily.",

I didn\u2019t need radiation or chemo and I didn't need to take any hormonal meds. I consider myself very lucky so I don't want to complain too much. I'm focusing on eating well and taking the vitamins so that I can have my surgery soon. I'm still in physical therapy for the range of motion issue. I can now extend my arms behind my head all the way to the floor when laying flat on my back. I sometimes have forgetfulness when speaking to someone, like I have trouble recalling a word or the word does not come to my mind fast enough.",

When I was at the plastic surgeon\u2019s office this morning I grabbed the handle to open the door and I felt a pull on my right breast. It\u2019s really hurting right now. My recovery is going well. Sleep is still a problem for me. I\u2019ve been on the couch since coming home, propped up by pillows. Range of motion is still limited. I can raise my arms straight out in front and today I managed to get into a loose sweater with long sleeves. I hope everyone is recovering well. I\u2019ll post more later.",
