I eneded up with a fibroadema with a spot of hyperplasia ( I can't remember which kind) in it. Everything benign but I had mine removed 2 weeks ago and feel so much better already. Whatever you have you need to have it removed. If its benign or not its pushing against nerves and your pectoral muscle and probably causing a lot of the pain you are feeling. I thought I was losing my mind with the pain I was feeling but within a week of having it removed I was feeling more like my old self. Good Luck",

At the same time I found a lump and was experiencing itching and pain under armpit. Mammo and ultrasound showed cysts. But I still wasn;t feeling right. The itching and pain was not going away and I was having a strange feeling in my breast (the ony way to describe it was a \"sensation\". I saw a breast surgeon and had an MRI. By that time the itching had stopped. The MRI showed a mass that I had biopsied and it came back as either a benign fibroadema or phyllodes tumor which I am having removed next week. I think the vein is caused by the tumor growing as well as maybe the itching. Regardless you should be checked out - I was very worried and am so thankful its benign but like the girls say the only good tumor is one in the jar.",
