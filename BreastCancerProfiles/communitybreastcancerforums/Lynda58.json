My first chemo treatment was uneventful in relation to the IV process. Each treatment that followed became increasingly difficult to the point where a port was suggested. The port was great for access for medications. Maintenance of the port minimal. I wish I had the port at the very beginning. So yes you can have chemo without a port but the port just makes it so much easier for the person taking chemo & care givers who administer the chemo. Thoughts are with you....",
