I had a pet scan and have new lesions in liver, many bones and in lymph nodes in my neck. I\u2019ve already been on the orals , has a very good run on xeloda for 2 1/2 years so hoping someone could tell me what chemo you moved to after others have failed. My onco is suggesting doxcil or navelbine. Has anyone gone back to orals at anytime ? Thanks for any advice.",
