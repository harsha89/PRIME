PatMom - I haven't had my hysterectomy yet.  I will wait until after treatment is completed. Would the cost of renting the cold cap be comparable to buying a wig?   I am married with 2 young boys (ages 5 and 3), which weighs on my decision, however I stay at home to care for my kids and my husband works full-time, so there is not much opportunity for down-time for me.   I'm concerned that with chemo I may not be able to function. My parents have offered to help me out, but they live 2 hours away so it's not super convenient. My mom really wants me to do chemo.  She feels that I should do it so that I could say that I have done everything I could to fight it, so I can be here to see my kids grow up.  I feel if I don't do chemo, I will have disappointed her, and that might be why I am putting pressure on myself to do it.  I think that of all my stats, even the onco type score, my age is the biggest concern and possible motivation for doing chemo.  I have been weighing the pros and cons a lot lately. I think the worst possible outcome for me is that I do chemo, get the really bad SE's, even long-term ones, and then find out 5-10 years later that the cancer came back anyway, and that I would have to go through all of it AGAIN!  That would be even worse to me than not getting chemo and having the cancer come back, because I would never know for sure if chemo would have stopped it.  Did I make the wrong decision?  Maybe, maybe not.  It is such a mind-screw!  Ugh!! I may be getting a second opinion.  I actually got my surgeon's take on it, and even though he's not an Onco, I really found it helpful.  Last thing - If I do get chemo, my MO said I would get Taxotere and Cytoxin.  Well, I just read a thread on this board about Taxotere causing PERMANENT hair loss/thinning in some women, as much as 3-6%, even more?  Is this still true, because if it is, then that is a deal-breaker!  If I am doing chemo, I will not be using Taxotere if that SE is still an issue.  Is Taxol a better choice?  I know it has an increased chance of neuropathy, but at least the hair would come back, right? Thanks for letting me vent.  I just need to get it all out there. I appreciate all the support!",

After a lot of research, second-guessing and crying my eyes out, I have made my final decision.  I have taken my pathology report into great consideration, and knowing what I know about my BC, I made the decision not to do chemo.  The details of my path report states that there is no evidence that my cancer has spread.  I know that there is a small percentage of chance that it may have, but I feel fairly confident that it did not.  The radiation and hormonal therapy will hopefully take care of whatever may be left.  This decision was very difficult to make because I was terrified of making the \"wrong\" choice.  It took me three agonizing weeks to decide, but in the end I have to do what is best for me and my situation.  The bottom line is, I don't believe that a 3% decrease of recurrence is worth me turning my life upside down for.  And I feel that chemo would turn my life upside down. There is just too much involved with chemo which would cause a major disruption in my life.  It takes a very big commitment that I am not willing to make given my circumstances.  If my path report had any red flags, if I had positive nodes, if my Onco score was higher, etc., then of course I would be doing chemo because there would be more benefit in doing it.  But that is not my case, so I feel like not doing the chemo is the best choice for me. My radiation simulation appointment is on Monday.  I feel much better that I have made my decision, and now I can focus on treatment. I know radiation and HT won't be easy, but I think I will be able to manage and get through it.  Thank you all for your support and guidance! ",
