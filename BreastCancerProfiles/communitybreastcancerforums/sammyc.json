Finished my chemo on 18 May (my 40th birthday) and have been taking it easy. Spending lots of time at the physio as i'm really unbalanced. Still planning prophylactic mastectomy of R breast in Dec (with implants). Sunbunnii take the time to look at surgeon's work, they will have before & after photos of patients. I was so excited with my surgeon's work - all examples looked better than what the girls had started with!!!  MaryAnn on splenectomy, i'm sure we all are having immunity issues. For me, I got Strep Bacteremia 6 years ago and it nearly took me out, went into renal decline and the strep went for my dodgy heart valve. The Heam & Infectious Diseases specialist put me on a lifetime course of Penicillin V. This effectively replaces your immune system (which lets face it is pretty crap anyway). Don't forget the recommended jabs for Pneumonia / Flu etc.  You might find this interesting: http://clinicalpharmacy.ucsf.edu/idmp/ucsf_specific/postsplenectomy.htm Much love to all, Sam x",

Seeing the surgeon tomorrow who has recommended mastectomy with sentinal node biopsy to get started. I'm 23yrs post Hodgkin's after 9 months ABVD chemo (no radio) and 8yrs post Cervical cancer after surgery only. Can't say i'm looking forward to this next lot of #%?* with two kids to chase. Your comments have made me realise it's our cross to bear. Amazing how we pick ourselves up and keep moving forward eh? God bless you all. I'm looking forward to more posts.",

Oh nearly forgot, thought my heart was up to its usual theatrics but it turned out to be my thyroid going on the fritz (hope you understand my Aussie)!  The Taxotere & Cyclophosphamide have also taken out my ovaries and I am now post-menopausal :o) Decided I didn't have enough on my plate this year so have decided to go study too - keeping it real.  Looking forward to my postponed 40th birthday celebrations in six weeks. Love to all, Sammy xx",

My surgeon didn't give me option to go straight to recon or expanders as I had 2 tumors & wasn't sure about rads. Who doesn't remember that lovely little op called 'splenectomy'? Step away from my tummy! I hope you keep getting stronger Lisette! I'm in Adelaide, wine country (wish I could chugg a few right now). See ur in BC, remember my 25th birthday @ the Empress! It's supposed to be my 40th next month but methinks I'll be 39 again this year & go for broke in 2013! Good luck with the bracy Deb, am interested in how this goes for you. Lifelover thanks for starting this, it's good to b informed. Sammy",

Only 1/7 micro lymph which was good. Neg for both hormone. Started chemo, lots side effects, think my body remembered the ABVD??? Major bummer yesterday, Picc developed a clot and had to come out, husband now giving me Clexane jabs to the belly for the next 3 months. On the positive, I got my silicone prosthesis yesterday and named her \"Polly\" she's awesome. I've got lots of heart issues from past chemo so reading other posts, never underestimate to go hand in hand through second treatment with a cardiologist in tow.  Also, I'm pretty sure I'll be opting for the removal of righty when I go the recon. Take care all, S x",
