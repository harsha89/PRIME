    "Content": "Shpensta wrote: hello all! I recently noticed skin thickening around my nipple and areola of my right breast. So I was sent for an ultrasound. It confirmed the skin thickening, but showed nothing else. I have not hurt my breast. What could cause the skin thickening? I did also have a reactive axillary lymph node under my armpit as well. The ultrasound tech measured the skin and said it was 4.4mm at least. I\u2019ve requested that I get a biopsy from my doctor, just to be safe. Of course I googled my symptoms, hah, big mistake. Just wanted to start a thread and I will update as I find out more. I\u2019m 29, incase that matters. Log in to post a reply",
