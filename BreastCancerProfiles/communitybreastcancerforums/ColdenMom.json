I am as well a Hodgkin's Disease Survivor.  I was diagnosed Stage IIB while pregnant with my second child December 17, 2002.  I underwent Chemo (ABVD) and Radiation and beat it (and had a beautiful healthy baby girl)...I recall clearly my Doctor saying that my chances for BC have increased having received mantle radiation.  I started going for regular mammograms when I turned 30.  I am 34 now, in June 2011 I went for my regular mamo and they found a 3mm unspecified tumor in my left breast - I was told it was too small to biopsy so they wanted me to return in 6 months for a follow-up ultrasound. I returned on 12/2 where a second tumor was found, same side. I was diagnosed on 12/6 with IDC. I had a bilateral mastectomy on 1/23/12, started chemo on 2/23/12 and have finished my 3/4 cycles. My last one being April 26. The side effects of TC have been manageable but not favorable. I recall ABVD being extremely difficult and TC does not feel as bad. I am also in the reconstruction phase following my surgery. I have had 5 fills (I have tissue expanders) and will be receiving my last fill next week. Then I'll have about a 4 month wait for the exchange surgery. I'm doing well over all... I have bad days and good. I saw some of you posting on issues with your heart and thyroid. My MO did say the 'A' in ABVD causes heart issues as well as the radiation, I haven't been seen by a cardiologist but am considering it just for a peace of mind. As for the thyroid, mine burnt out a year after my completion of radiation. I've been on synthroid since. I wish you all well and I am sending on positive vibes! It really stinks to have to go through cancer treatments again. I'm glad we have these boards to support each other along the way! ((hugs)) Kelly",

I have recently been diagnosed with a new cancer, Breast and am currently going through treatment. While I understand completely how scary this is for you I want to link you to a group that can provide support, education, and HOPE to you. It's called Hope for Two... The Pregnant with Cancer Network. We are on FaceBook and have a website at www.pregnantwithcancer.org. Go to the support link. We can connect you with a woman who had the same or similar diagnosis as you as well as provide you with a welcoming tote full of educational materials among many other things!

Where do you live? Are there any cancer institutes by you? Dr. Cardonick has reached out to OB's before. You can even speak with her yourself. We have a lot of useful articles on the website and survivor stories. You can do this! Be aggressive.",
