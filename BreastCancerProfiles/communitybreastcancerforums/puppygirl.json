It hurts when I wear a bra, hurts when I take it off. I'm just about out of pain meds. The only relief is when I lie down next to a strategically-placed pillow. Or when I hold it gently - not something I really want to do around two teenage sons! Or sleep, yeah, that helps. Â I hope there is relief in sight soon.",
