By God's grace the surgery went well and she was discharged that week sunday. Today we got the pathology report of both breasts. 1. Right Breast: No tumor in 5 lymph nodes, Size of DCIS-5% and observed only in nipple areola. Margins are uninvolved. Doctor feedback: Good news no spreading of cancer cell and no treatment required. But she has to take medicine for life long & keep regular check-ups. 2. Left Breast: Grade 1 (Low) observed.Low grade of DCIS. Doctor feedback: Pre-cancer stage. He will further consult with senior doctors whether to proceed for radiation or surgery only for left breast. I am happy that God showed us in starting stage and we got treated. Doubts, Will she be asked for any radiation for left breast? After this surgery she can live a normal life or she has to be more cautious in food, lifestyle and regular check-ups? Thanks",

For hormone therapy doctor has advised to take her Altraz 1mg daily morning and asked her to come for review after 1 month with blood test report for CBC, Urea, creatinine, serum bilirubin. I understood from internet there can be mild side affects. It is been almost 10days but no side effects by God's grace. My mom decided not to do BRCA test because if the result is positive then it will be stressful in family. So she decided not to do. But anyway myself and my sister will keep our health check-ups every year. For male (myself) what kind of health check up I need to do releated for breast cancer? Thanks",

Today she met the doctor for her left breast as it is precancerous. So after discussing with cancer board today doctor advised to remove the left breast + harmone therapy. The reason he mentioned was not to take risk because my grand mother had breast cancer. So next week she will be having her surgery. We thought surgery will be the end but could not understand why harmone therapy required? Will it cause any side effects? Is it like she is vulnerable for some other cancer in her body after few years is that the reason for harmone therapy? Sorry for asking but I did not expected doctor will suggest harmone therapy, maybe I am wrong with my assumptions and knowledge. Thanks",

Everything started just 3 weeks before when my mother observed red discharge sometimes white discharge in her left breast & very rarely in right breast.Discharge in the sense just a drop in her dress. As per doctor guidance we did Mammogram, Ultrasound scan & MRI scan. A lesion was observed in MRI scan in Right breast and dylation observed in left breast. Doctor advised for needle biopsy in right breast and today the result came as \"Consistent with invasive carcinoma of no special type (Ductal,NOS), Grade 1-2 (NMBRS) ; Right subareolar nodule.\" Doctor confirmed as cancer and advised to surgery and remove right breast to avoid any spread inside. We are just praying. Even after surgery my mother requires chemo or radiation treatments? Note: My grandmother passed away due to breast cancer in 1970s. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
