My PT specializes in cancer care rehabilitation. She's very matter of fact but the exercises she gave me really do help. Her name is Rachel Peters. She's in Palo Alto with Palo Alto Medical Foundation. 650-853-3355. I was recently referred to a massage therapist/acupuncturist who specializes in breast cancer rehab. I saw her yesterday for the first time. She is very nurturing and will do a massage with you totally lying on your back. She might be able to do cupping too since she's an acupuncturist. Her name is Kate Perkins. She's in Los Gatos and Santa Cruz. Her number is 831-331-6959. I don't know if this is an option for you but what's helped me most is swimming. Actually it started out just standing in the pool and moving my arms around. Then slowly I graduated to a gentle breast stroke. Just 10-20 minutes a day is enough. I go to the Y so that afterwards I can slather Bio Oil all over my breasts and scars and sit in the sauna for a few minutes and let it soak in. Good luck...",
