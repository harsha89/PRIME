My med onc. said the same thing as Lisa, tamoxifen after rads.  I am going to ask for a \"vacation\" between the two.  I just want some time for myself that does not involve dealing with new side effects.  I am curious to find out her opinion on that one.   I still get herceptin every 3 weeks till next year and honestly I dread my first dose post-chemo.  It's not the side effects (they are minimal I have heard), it is visiting the chemo ward!  I don't know if this is going to help at all, but I am prepping my rads area now with 100% pure coconut oil.  I had been using it for my scars for awhile and for, um....mojo reasons , it has worked well for that!  I figured it can't hurt, I am not sure if I can keep using it on that area during rads though.  I will probably switch to aloe and aquaphor then.",

Here is what I experienced: The port access was not a big deal for me.  I was surprised by how much pain I was in the night it was placed, so I assumed putting a needle in it a few days later was going to really hurt!  I got a script for lidocaine even though my onc said it was not necessary.  She was right.  I put the cream on in the waiting room, but by the time they were ready to access my port it wore off.  The area has to be sterile so putting more on was not an option.  I will say getting a good chemo nurse helps.  Mine had it accessed and ready to go before I could get nervous.  I remember saying \"Is that it?\".  A few rounds later I was letting trainees access it so that they could learn.  I don't recommend that for the first round. Getting sick.  Ladies, there is no reason to feel sick during this.  There are many drugs available to control nausea and pain.  When I first started a chemo vet told me write down everything the first 2 rounds (what I ate, how I felt, meds I took, a record of bathroom trips, etc...).  This helps you find a pattern and what works for you.  It also helped me communicate better with my onc and get meds that worked for me.  I was able to work full time.  Towards the end of chemo I did cut my hours from 37 to 30 due to fatigue.  I also organized my meds in labeled ziplocs.  I labeled them by symptom, it made it easier for me to manage the ever growing pile of medication. Losing my hair sucked.  There is no way around it, most lose theirs on days 14-16.  Two years out and I have a head of shiny, healthy hair but it was a long road to get here.  I had long hair before chemo and I wish I had cut it short before starting.  It would have given me time to get used to it.  I wore a wig to work and ripped it off in the car at the end of the day.  I found it to be very uncomfortable.  I wish I had not spent so much on wigs (I bought 3), because by round 3 I hated them.  I went topless at home and wore soft scarves and big earrings out. You will all get through this and you will find strength you never knew you had.  I wish you all the best and if you have any questions please pm me. ",

I remember last year I felt that the year ahead of me would never end, yet here I am, on the other side.  I feel great.  I have longed to say those 3 words for a very long time.    You will read over and over from other survivors that chemo is tough but doable. It is. I was able to work fulltime throughout treatment.  Chemo has a cumulative effect, so by the end I was tired and started to cutback my hours.  By the 3rd round, all of you will be experts in dealing with side effects.  I can't stress enough about drinking fluids.  Dehydration kicked my ass at one point.  I found the more I drank after treatment the better I felt.  I drank watered down orange Gatorade for 18 weeks (I absolutely hate the sight of it now).  You will have to experiment to find what works for you.   Losing my hair sucked, I won't lie.  It started to fall out on Day 16 after the 1st round.  It was gone by Christmas.  Once it started to fall out it was a relief.  I knew it was coming and was scared up to that point, but after it was over I was able to deal.  So will all of you.  I now have a full head of hair, and it seems to be growing more everyday.  I bought  a beautiful wig that I rarely wore during chemo.  It bothered my head.  I rocked scarves quite well with fabulous earrings!  I highly reccomend two things to making yourself feel better in prep for the bald days.  Go out and buy yourself gorgeous earrings, somehow putting those on made me feel pretty.  Next, signup for one of those Look Good Feel Better classes.  They will show you how to put on makeup (and you get freebies).  I had to completely change how I did mine.  i am now an expert on putting on false eyelashes. I wish you all the best, I know how scared you are.  Another sister on here has a quote in her signature that I love, \"You don't have to be brave, you just have to show up.\"   You will get through this.  When it is over, you will be stronger then ever before, because you are a SURVIVOR.  Much love to you all. Jennifer P.S.  If anyone is interested in a free wig PM me.  It is a short, strawberry blond bob.  I can PM you a pic of it.  ",
