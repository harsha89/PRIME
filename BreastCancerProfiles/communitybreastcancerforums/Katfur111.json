My CA-15-3 started off greater then 900 when I was DX with stage 4 invasive lobular breast cancer that spread to my omentum ( caking) which is \"resolved \" now. And a dark spot on my hip and tail bone. Few ribs and sternum. My major organs are free of any cancer at this time.said it was hormone fed cancer so put me in meta pause on lupron shots and xgeva shots both monthly. Take Armadidex my mouth fail 1 mg. Well my CA15-3 came down to 18 from 900's well this rest tue was up to 54.8 so I'm freaking out. Oncologist rechecked it yesterday and it's up more to 56. What does this mean? From the beginning my oncologist said as long as this level stays down and this treatment is working I'm good. When this treatment stops working there is nothing left to do but chemo. And then death. And keeps saying she has a patient that is on the same treatment and is 6 yrs out. Well I'm Dx 1 year now and if this stops working then that means I die sooner? I'm only 48 and still raising my children. To young to die now. I'm so scared and depressed. Should I get a second opinion? I feel so alone in this. Thanks for listening.
