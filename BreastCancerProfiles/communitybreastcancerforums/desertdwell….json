I know that the SN biopsy will get me more info about staging this, but what will the pathology of the tumor they remove be able to determine? Also, how long is a typical radiation treatment after lumpectomy? I am feeling anxious and nervous. Maybe I should have just had a mastectomy! I have er+pr+ her2- Invasive Lobular Melanoma BRCA mutation neg 1.6cm. 48 yrs. young. Thanks for your help.",
