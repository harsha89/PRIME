This morning is the first morning I truly feel bummed out, but I think it's the after effects of general anethesia. I always get this way after general. Then I'll have my lumpectomy on my right breast in about two weeks, unless this left breast proves more troublesome, in which case I have to decide whether or not I want to go straight to masectomy. I HATE MAKING DECISIONS. I've been fine with the knowledge that I have ADH and DCIS, and haven't freaked at all. Now, I'm depressed. So bummed.

Before, I could raise both of my arms, turn a bit, and see that my right side was just bigger. . However, I just checked because I'm so sore, and there is a visible \"mound\" around the scar. It's worse. Is this normal for eleven days? And what should I do to find some relief? Thursday, my surgeon said it looked fine for one week after surgery, but now it's definitely worse. The swelling isn't huge, but it's more defined. Does this make any sense? I had DCIS, and opted to keep my breast, so not very much tissue was even taken. Thanks for your help. This is my first time venturing to this board, but I thought you gals would be the most knowledgeable. Jo DCIS, grade 2-3, SNB 3/3 neg, ER+, PR+, surgery 9/20/07 Log in to post a reply",
