But, she did say i could be having a sonogram, almost like she knew I would.  I saw the large dark circle on my mammogram (the first one).  have no idea what i was looking at.  at the sonogram i saw a large dark oval that the gal was measuring, then i either looked away or she turned the machine.  she left and came back saying whoever reads these, said he didn't know what it was.  so i need a biopsy. the dr's office nurse called and she was going to schedule the biopsy, that was yesterday. this is all i know: 1st mammo:   area tissure thicker   density                        need a mammogram again to go at it from a different angle and a sono the phone call after the sono:   core nodule at 12 oclock  asymmitrical density                                                need to schedule a core biopsy with ultrasound ok, I have been crying now on and off since about 3 am this morning.  and now my breast is sore. and after the 2nd mammo/sono it hurt a little.  I felt around and can feel a small bump - pointy like a cone.  I don't know what to ask or who to talk to.  my kids are gone right now, but when they get home, i dont want to be crying again.  i have 2 young kids still.  I nursed my kids for almost a total of 10 years trying to not get heridetary cancer. thanks for letting me talk, i have no one to talk to.  and i am not wanting to do anymore internet searches as they all say i do have cancer.   i had elective-surgery a long time ago and my dr then tested me for cancer in my blood.  can't remember the exact number but it was single digit.   Log in to post a reply",
