I dont know what is going on but the post couple days I'm having intense pressure and significant discomfort--ok, pain!--inside my chest where the drain is, and it looks like tissue is being sucked out. I keep stripping the tubing but sometimes almost the entire length of tube is clogged with what seriously looks like an umbilical cord. Did anyone else have this? Log in to post a reply",

If you look at it as non-surgical reconstruction, the cost of $3,000 per breast vs tens of thousands of dollars for surgical reconstruction, I would just think that financially, it would make sense for insurance to cover it. My fitter called today to let me know that my insurance approved the purchase of two RI prostheses! They are going to cover them at a rate of 90%. I've thought about it, and have decided that I'm going to wait a few months, since I may even decide to go flat and not even wear prosthetic breasts at all. Or I may try smaller breast forms and see how it feels to be a comfortable B cup instead of being as top heavy as I am. I'm just going to give myself time and permission to explore some options before I commit to something as expensive as RI, even with the insurance coverage.",

I spoke to the lady at the mastectomy shop and she is going to try to get preauthorization for the custom prosthetics and get back to me. You would think they would cover that, since it is so much less expensive than reconstruction, and with no risk of complications! I guess I'll find out soon enough. Of course, my deductible for the year has been met but starts over Jan 1, so I probably would have to meet my deductible again before they cover any kind of prosthetics, right?",

I was able to get something that looks enough like swim wear that I won't be self conscious, but that doesn't have cups at all so I can go completely flat. (Since I have gone flat since my BMX 5 1/2 mos ago, I'd feel awkward showing up to a pool party wearing foobs. (Totally just my preference...no judgment at all toward women who rock the foobs full-time OR part-time!!!!)Aunt_Palua, I also have LE. High five! :/ lol",

How many of you were told one stage, only to find out post-mastectomy that the disease had actually progressed more than previously believed? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Nov 13, 2014 11:06PM - edited Nov 13, 2014 11:06PM by Mommy2Six I would imagine that the doctors have in fact treated many endurance athletes, just like you, and are probably used to it. I tend to pursue natural remedies first, had my babies naturally with midwives, don't vaccinate, eat organic and buy directly from farmers whenever possible....I'm not even getting reconstruction because I don't want a foreign substance in my body. But getting a breast cancer diagnosis at 29, I have to do more than what I was doing to stay healthy in the first place. Cancer doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care whether or not you deserve it (no one does). I've read a lot of your posts, and I understand why you feel the way you do, but you need to realize that even with your excellent diet and fitness routines, you have developed a very aggressive and dangerous cancer. Doing more of the same things that you have been doing is great, but it is not going to treat this cancer, just as it hasn't prevented it. I think you should definitely be proud of yourself and grateful you are in such great shape but realize that this may be the time to really commit to going the Western medicine route. Definitely keep eating right, keep exercising, keep seeing homeopaths or herbalists or whatever CAM specialists you want to see, but commit fully to a treatment plan that has been medically proven to work. Chemo is poison, I agree. But you have to do to something to kill the cancer before it kills you, and that is going to require more than just a raw organic diet. You are tiny, so you are going to need steroids. I'm not saying to comply blindly with whatever someone in a white coat tells you to do, but I'm saying if you wait to act until you have fully researched every angle of every issues, or if your initial reaction is to refuse everything as if you're constantly working from the assumption that you know better than your doctors, that they have sinister or self serving ulterior motives, then you are not going to get far in beating this disease. I understand why you keep saying that you know your body better than anyone---I've said that to many a doctor and midwife--but unless I've misunderstood something, you didn't know you had cancer until a medical test detected it. I'm not saying that you should have known, by any means...I'm saying that even when we treat our bodies exactly as we should, the reality is that they sometimes betray us. Whether from a genetic mutation, or pollution in the air, or flame retardants on our sofas--who knows why these things happen?! I guess what I'm trying to say is that everything you have done everything \"right\" and yet, cancer happened. So it's time to bring out the big guns. There are a lot of times that the best course of action is to wait until you are sure of things before acting. I think stage 3 cancer isn't one of them. Act now, continue to research, supplement your treatment with holistic care, and even modify your treatment plan down the road. But don't do nothing while you figure it out. I'm preaching to myself here too...I don't have invasive cancer, just DCIS, but I wanted to delay treatment til March when it would be more convenient for me! lol I hope none of this has come off as abrasive. Just concerned for you and understand what it's like to have to accept a treatment that goes against your very nature.",
