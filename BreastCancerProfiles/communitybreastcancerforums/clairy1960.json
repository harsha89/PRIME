However, by treatment 5, my head was smooth and shiny. I did not do wigs because cancer is part of my life journey and I don't really care who knows (and I had thick thick hair a mere three weeks before I started treatment). I am a teacher, so I let my primary students write my treatment dates on my head. I figured go big or go home. I even was a minion for halloween, thanks to a co teacher's artwork. this image is my student's rendering of me as a super hero, in November, 2015 (just before my third treatment). I envy you who have eyebrows and lashes, mine are taking so long to grow in. Someone suggested pommade and eyebrow mascara. I am using that but it is the leaky eyes that get to me most. I can count the eyelashes I have on two hands. Oh well, I shall hold out hope for a sudden flourishing....Keep sharing your stories and pictures, they inspire us new to this road. C. ",
