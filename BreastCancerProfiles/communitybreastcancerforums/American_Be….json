I really appreciate all the great feedback about Gemzar and other options.  I have lost track of all the chemo's I've been on over the years.  I remember I've had TAC, abraxane and Halaven with radiation and clinical trials in between.  My body does not respond best to chemo in regards to side effects.  Every chemo (except abraxane) put me in the hospital for a week or more.  In my case, Halaven was the worse in regards to SE. I will certainly keep everyone updated on what I am put on.",

What I was advised is that Gemcitabine is good at keeping the cancer at bay so as not to progress further but unlike other chemos, the cancer or counts are unlikely to go backwards. I've had terrible luck with chemos with all of them putting me in the hospital.  That's why my onc feels that Gemcitabine will be a good option for me; especially as there seem to be no clinical trials open in my general area that are suitable.",

I'm in Charlotte, NC and received the treatment for stereotactic radiation at Carolina's Medical Center, Levine Cancer Institute by Dr. Stuart Burri.",

I know that some family members simply do not know how to cope with a loved one who has been diagnosed with a terminal disease.  They are so fearful of losing you that they withdraw instead of drawing close.  My advice would be to let her know that you want, need and appreciate whatever support she is able to give.  Let her know how much she and the relationship between you mean to her.  In addition, reach out to your virtual sisters as well as local support groups.  You may find it easier to let out your fears and frustrations with other sisters who are walking in your shoes already. Virtual hugs, Carol",
