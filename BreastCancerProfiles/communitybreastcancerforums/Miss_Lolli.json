I also hear, from survivors, and have to trust that this will get better. There are lots of places you can get free counseling and/or join support groups. If you feel that this fear is interfering with you living your life, you should definitely contact someone. I know I can find you some links (american cancer society etc.) if you feel you need more support than what this board and friends/family can provide. Let me know.. If you are involved in a local church I'm sure they could steer you as well. Some women don't feel that support groups are right for them, but have found anti-depressants to be helpful at this difficult time, I'm sure your onc could help you with that. I truly believe that the period of adjustment after treatment may be the roughest part for me. When you're actively treating you're focused on something....fighting....often afterwards we wonder, \"now what\"? In the mean time, here is a link from this site on dealing with cancer fears. If you scroll down there's a few topics I found helpful. http://www.breastcancer.org/community/fears/index.jsp",

I can say that I didn't enjoy food enough to keep eating once I had eaten enough to make the hunger go away, so I ended up having many \"snacks\" throughout the day.

I will say my main tip is to drink flat ginger ale or hot tea with ginger. It settled my tummy enough to make me feel a bit hungry.",

And the fact that you end up being on the same thread, having chemo the same month....well WOW! To me that is further proof that everything happens for a reason. You were meant to be in each other's lives, and \"someone\" or at the very least fate, threw you together, knowing you'd need the extra support from an understanding friend. I'm sure you made her first trek to the chemo easier, and what a fantastic way to start you aqquaitance. God blessed you both. :D I have a friend that I literally just met last spring, mere months before I was diagnosed. We are like the same person in different shells. Difference being, she's about 100 more enthusiastic about everything (which was my draw to her), she's just a blast. I never dreamed in a millions years that it's partly because, years early she had been through something similar to myself, and understands, without me even finishing my sentences, everything I share with her about my feelings since dx in August. The fears, the rants and raves, even the positives. She totally gets it, and I maybe wouldn't have gone to my first chemo w/o her pep talk. She never tells me I ALWAYS have to be positive on bad days, but somehow makes me see that they are just that...and more importantly, I have a right to them.  I tell her every time we talk that she is my angel and God put her in my path. If I had any question about my spirituality, this beautiful soul, plus an amazing number of friends and family, banished any possibility of doubts. That is one of the siver linings I was babbling about before, and you just re-enforced that with your touching story. Thank you for telling it. Also good luck at the dentist...ugh...no fun you gotta do that at this time. Another great thing....day 2/tx 2 still no nausea! woohooo I'm flabbergasted. If there is a down-side to this day...I think I feel head tingles. So glad I got my crew cut after all, was starting to wonder. lol Which reminds me of a great tip I got from a book. Even when you don't have hair, it's great to use Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo (or some other tar based shampoo). It keeps your scalp very moisturized, therefore less itchy. I wanna keep those little pores healthy and happy for the regrowth. Anyone else hoping for some curly hair this time around? :D Have a good day everyone. I go for my shot this afternoon, and it's a gorgeous fall day, so I just can't wait to get out. My doggy is going to be happy to have as many walks as he can stand before it gets too cold for me. Hope everyone is feeling kinda normal today (never thought that would be something to shoot for huh?) lol Hugs and love to you all. Keep hanging in there.......",

When my oncologist explained how much it would cut my chance of recurrance and explained that I could \"opt out\" if I ever felt like I just couldn't handle it (yes I was that apprehenesive) I decided to go ahead. It's not even close to as horrible as you imagine, I can almost guarantee. Yes, I felt crappy (kind of like pregnant with a hint of flu) for about six days the first treatment, but they really have so many good drugs these days, and have come such a long way. Almost any complaint you have with side-effects can be helped. I had my second treatment last Friday, and have been lucky enough, this time, to have no problem with nausea at all.....only some tiredness....go figure. So, it can be different for everyone, or individual each time. The actual infusion is nothing at all. You sit there and get an IV and for all I could tell, they might have been giving me saline water. I don't have a port because I'm only receiving four treatments, and didn't want another small surgery, but after eight tries to get a good vein last time, if I had more, I'd rethink that decision too. lol  Please come back and let us know how you are, and if you have any more questions.

There is a section on this site that explains in detail what your pathology report means. However, I would mostly advise you this. Write down every question you can think of between now and your next meeting with your oncologist and have him explain things to you until you feel satisfied that you know everything you need and want to know.  But the one thing I would say you should ignore is statistics. You are not a number but a person...and none of these \"percentages\" matter when it comes to our lives. If only one person out of 100 has a good prognosis you could be that one, but who wants to start out knowing the odds are against us? I'm not saying they are against you at all of course, as there were some things in your report worded differently than mine (probably because of the difference in country), so I don't quite understand everything in your post. I do know one thing....if your doctor isn't willing to talk to you until you understand, then you need to talk to another one and another until you find one who will. The good news is, it sounds like they got all the tumor out with clear margins, and the fact that you're estrogen positive is also good, in that there is medicine they can give you for years after your chemo to help prevent recurrance. I guess we've all had moments we've feared for our lives...it's like being slapped in the face with your own mortality,and it's scary. But the good news, they've made incredible strides in the past ten years. They've come so far, and we have an amazing amount of options for treatment. If I were you, I'd plan on being at your beautiful daughter's graduation. Please come back often and let us know how you're doing.",

I was thinking you're a Wed. but I can't quite remember.... I have mine on Friday, and then the last one two weeks after that, if all goes according to plan. Way to go on one more down Karen and Kara. Do you just have one more A/C as well Kara? Never had the protonics but I do get terrific heartburn, and definitely need something more than the Rolaids I've been eating. Good luck tomorrow Linda and whoever else is going ...Lori G maybe? I know at least one more is on the same day. Maybe everyone could post the rest of their chemo schedule so we could all save it? Take care sistahs.......",

Four men in a four-wheel drive pickup truck with a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them, just stay out of their way. This is what they live for.             Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store.... do not buy food at this store.             Remember, \"Y'all\" is singular, \"all y'all\" is plural, and \"all y'all's\" is plural possessive.             Get used to hearing \"You ain't from round here, are ya?\"             Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed later on how to use it.             Don't be worried at not understanding what people are saying. They can't understand you either. The first Southern statement to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective \"big'ol,\" truck or \"big'ol\" boy. Most Northerners begin their Southern-influenced dialect this way. All of them are in denial about it.             The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.             Be advised that \"He needed killin.\" is a valid defense here.              If you hear a Southerner exclaim, \"Hey, y'all watch this,\" you should stay out of the way. These are likely to be the last words he'll ever say.             If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the smallest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It doesn't matter whether you need anything or not. You just have to go there.             Do not be surprised to find that 10-year olds own their own shotguns, they are proficient marksmen, and their mammas taught them how to aim.             In the South, we have found that the best way to grow a lush green lawn is to pour gravel on it and call it a driveway.              AND REMEMBER: If you do settle in the South and have  children, don't think we will accept them as Southerners.

I feel the brain f*rts too. I really think it's just lack of estrogen....or sometimes for me I wonder if it's just paranoia and I've always been this absent-minded. lol Hope everyone is having a good weekend.  I was away from home for 8 hours on Fri. and 10 on Sat., and never once felt like I needed a nap, so I'm pretty pumped. lol Of course I then slept like a log last night. Well...off to do some housework ugh ugh. Happy Sunday girls!",

The social worker at my radiation clinic was great help with some financial issues I was having. I also highly recommend that you ask at your clinic/hospital/treatment all the places that you go, if they have a social worker...they can be so great at helping you find resources. I'm guessing that on the most basic level they could at least help you get someone to care for your children while you get your treatment. That should be one time whne you don't have to worry. Like Karen said, please also pm me if you can't find help locally, I'm pretty good at researching things on the net. Hugs to you honey, you're in my thoughts and prayers.",

I swear, this whole winter has either been brutally cold or dumping snow. wah What is it with the fillings anyway? I lost one at some point too. I JUST went to the dentist the week before I started chemo, but I guess I'll have to break down and go again. It's not hurting, but just feels strange. I've been so careful about taking care of my mouth....it takes way too much time and money to have dental probs. yeesh Deb, congrats on a week under your belt. Take it easy and rest a lot, a cold on top of rads can really wear you down. Karen, I loved your idea of hair pics...I just got a new cell yesterday with a camera (they're super cheap on the tmobile website if anyone needs one), so when I figure it out I'll do it. lol Basically, mine looks like Kara's too...maybe a bit longer as I finished up chemo on the last day of Nov. I'm also using biotin and nioxin and I've gotten lots of comments on the thickness... I always have so dunno if it's that, but I was SO scared it would come back thin. It returned much darker and twice as much gray.  I'm getting ready to put some temp color in it today so I can go wigless at work. I now go back full time starting next Monday and it's just too hot with hair AND wig. lol  I've been cranky the last couple of days, so I called up my zaniest most fun girlfriend for a movie tonight. lol  Hope everyone has a weekend full of all that you need.

If I hadn't been driving, there would have been a full-blown happy dance taking place. I was so ecstatic I was laughing! Btw Karen R....I don't see ANY gray in your hair. I think the color is lovely.

I'm sure and will pray that it will be the same in your case. Hugs and love sent your way. Ulla, I hope your se's continue to get weaker as your body adjusts. And I will pray soooo very hard that you will have many babies when this is all over. You will be a wonderful mommy. Well ladies, yesterday was the warmest day since last Oct. 7th!!! FINALLY we have spring and it's just glorious here. No bugs and mosquitos out yet since it's been so cold. We had a bonfire last night and tonight I'm supposed to go to the drive-in. So I'm soaking it up while it lasts. lol I want to share some good news with my sisters. You probably remember last Jan. when my sister got very sick with pneumonia and very low oxygen levels supposedly caused by a sleep disorder and other health issues. She was in the ICU and almost didn't make it through the first night, and has been on oxygen every since. They told her she may never be free of it. WELL...she quit smoking, lost quite a bit of weight, and worked very very hard exercising and doing pulmonary rehab and this week she got to get rid of her oxygen for good!!!!!!! yay yay yay!  The doctor told her it was nothing short of miraculous and her oxygen levels are almost that of someone who'd never even had supplemental oxygen!!! OMG we were just bawling and I'm so proud of her! So, that's why the bonfire...we had some champagne before we ate our roasted weenies. lol  So, thank you all for your kind words of support throughout that time. I didn't say much about it, because they never really knew what was going on besides that she was very sick. But, just having all your love and support helped me tremendously. Thank you!",

It's next to impossible to avoid it entirely. I'm down to settling for things where it's not in one of the first few listed ingredients, if at all. If I feel I must eat something with high content such as soy sauce, it's a rare treat. I just try to hope that the tamoxifen is doing it's job and they haven't underplayed the role soy has in our cancer. Right now it seems they don't know exactly to what extent it is bad for us. I don't know...I've done so much research and get so many conflicting theories, just like everything else regarding nutrition. Sue and Ulla, I think the website you may be looking for is adjuvantonline? It's not so much that you plug in what you've done for treatment, but you enter info from your pathology and it gives you tx recommendations along with percentages regarding prognosis. You have to sign in as a doctor (I just used false info) but my own onc even said I can go in there and \"play around\" at home to see what I find. It's supposed to be a diagnostic aid for oncs, but I'll be it's used my just as many curious patients. Have a lovely weekend sisters! Big hugs and lotsa love.....",

As you said, the list of things I presently consider better than sex grows with each passing year. And the list has gotten crazily larger since chemo...never dreamed \"food that tastes like food\" or \"a good number two\" would be on that list though. ;-)  Linda....welcome, that's quite a story! Sorry for what you've had to go through, but glad to see you post. Regarding your question...I'm only one treatment into it too, but my oncology nurse seems to think that nothing should get worse or be cumulative except for the fatigue. I hope she's right, but I'm not going to count on it.  I'm guessing if you had an easy time the first time, it won't get too bad for you if you do end up having se's. Myself, I'm hoping to do better the second time because I plan on starting the first day of treatment with Colace and antacid right off. I honestly think I wouldn't have felt badly (beyond unbelievably tired) if it wasn't for those miserable se's. I'd never dealt with either of those problems in my life, and I think I didn't even realize what was making me feel badly! Are you every two or three weeks for your tx? Funny, I was totally wiped out a few days after my treatment like you said also. I wondered if it coincided with the end of your steroids? Paxton brought that up on the chemo tip thread and said that was her experience, so it's got me wondering. Makes some sense too.... Anyone else feel like you crash when your steroids are gone? Of course I'm not going to stop taking anything w/o talking to the onc, but it's worth asking about. I felt like I could hardly move the two days after my prescription was done....hmmmm....",

Being a nurse I'm sure you understand all that anyway but just try to focus on others and how much they love and need you if you ever start thinking like that again. I know it's hard, and I've been bored literally to tears many times...so I sympathize truly.  I have had more crying jags from being bored than anything else since dx. But it always got better and it always turned out to be my emotions and hormones more than anything. I go from reading to tv to puzzles to the computer and back again. I've even consider xmas crafts (if you knew my patience level you'd cringe at the possibility of what I would turn out lol). It's even been too cold for me to walk much this week. And if all else fails, and you still feel that down, just pm me (private message) with your phone number and I'll call you. Heck, I've got nothing but time and am rarely too busy for a phone chat. I just try to focus on a some month in the future when things will be a bit more \"normal\" or if that seems too overwhelming, then I just focus on holding it together just for today. Whatever you need to get through. This winter will suck big-time, but time will march on, and soon you'll be back to feeling productive and needed again. I think it's so important to us women and one of the things that's so hard. I'm sorry you're having such a bad time, and I'll say an extra prayer for you.

It's gotta be hard to stick yourself. I'm guessing having it broken down will be better for you than one big dose *crossing fingers*.  For those of you having pain with the neulasta shots, \"they\" say it does usually lessen with each shot..so hang onto that hope. I'm SO excited! We're gettting temps in the 50's tomorrow, so I get to take my puppy to the park!

Just wanted to keep my promise and report about my mapping for my rads yesterday. For those of you that will follow me on that path, I can honestly say it was nothing. The CT was very quick and not claustraphobic. They made a few marks and gave me four tattoos, which honestly felt like mosquito bites. I did have to lay with my arms above my head, but it was only about half an hour and they kept me covered and warm every second that they weren't actually marking me. I do have a \"dry run\" the day before I actually start...I'm wondering if sometimes they combine those two appts. into one, as I've heard people say that they had to lie on the table for over an hour. Anyway....still loving all the sweet people I've met at that office, although I know by the end of seven weeks I won't be so happy to see them every day. lol",

I'm just getting to the point where I'm feeling comfortable in mine and have worn it out a couple of times. It is a synthetic wig and I don't know a thing about them and really have lots of questions. Do I brush/comb it or will that make it fall apart? If so, do I need a special brush made for wigs? Do I need special shampoo and how do I wash it? After I wash it do I have to take it to be styled, can I style it myself, or will it fall back into place? It's got a really cute style to it, so I hate to wreck it, and am hoping to make it last until I don't need it any more. I didn't have to do a thing to it to start with, as it fit me perfectly and looked better then my own hair. lol Sorry for my ignorance, but thanks in advance for your help. HUGS",

The positive attitudes, openness....so willing to share of yourself to help others. I'm glad you are able to concentrate on your obviously beautiful souls and huge hearts. The kind of attitude you have is what I'm striving for, but I feel so far away from where you are. I'll keep striving. I always used to see the positive in things and laugh a lot....I guess at this time it's just a lot harder and may take me some time and effort to get there. Hotmedic...all I can say is, if you were \"hot\" before treatment, you will be once again. So no need to mourn your lost beauty. It's just on a little vacation, and probably not as far away as you think. It will be back. We're all bound to look a little tired and sick with what we're going through, but it's temporary, and I'm guessing more than anything, we're our own worst critic. Ulla....I don't have much good advice for you, as I am not lucky enough to have someone like you have. I will guess that what you're feeling has more to do with how you're feeling inside than how you look outside. You are very pretty and looking at your most recent picture, you look better during chemo than most people look normally. lol  I do sympathize, and can't say I understand what it means to lose a breast, but I will just say you have a gorgeous face and your confidence will come back, I'm sure of it. You will enjoy things again. You have been through SO much, just give yourself time to adjust to everything. You're thinking some very deep thoughts, but in my opinion (sorry) men are pretty simple. He loved you before all this, and he still does. He obviously doesn't see the changes as being drastic enough to change his feelings, and is obviously wise enough to know that the moods you are having are only temporary, and he'll have \"his Ulla\" back soon. Believe me, I do have doubts about this myself sometimes.....but then I go and read chemo threads from years past, and I see that life does get back to normal for women who have been where we are, and are now months and years out of chemo. True we may never TOTALLY be the same, we've lost our innocence and been slapped in the face with our own mortality, BUT I'm hoping in the future that fragility will be replaced with a deeper appreciation of life. By the way...what you have to offer your husband is love and a lifetime of togetherness, trust and faithfulness. It is okay to doubt how you would handle things in his place. It's natural, and has to do with your depression. But no...you are not a bad person. Just a confused and scared one who needs time to heal. Please don't be hard on yourself. Karen R. Hi girlfriend! I feel blessed to have \"met\" you too. Hope your holiday season is special and filled with love. Nicki, Happy New Year and hope you're well. Natalie...I rarely got a good night's sleep throughout my whole chemo regimen. Even if I could have slept through the night my bladder wouldn't have let me. Had to stay hydrated to make sure those IV's went smoothly. lol  Make sure to let them know about your finger tips. Sometimes, they change or decrease tx right away to try to ensure that neuropathy is temporary.",

I'm guessing every one of us has been/is there, and I wanted to tell you that I felt that way through my whole chemo experience. I think I was very lucky as far as se's physically, and like you said, I knew that in my mind, but mentally it was hard on me. No matter how much I joked or pretended to talk about other things, my health and that big C monster never left my mind. It was always there lurking and like an endless tape playing over and over in my head. Even my laughs and interest in anything else felt fake. Sorry to be so dramatic, but I just wanted you to realize that I was in a pretty deep dark hole and I did make my way out, once I had chemo behind me. Once the chemo fatigue went away it got better and it will for you too. I'm about halfway done with rads now and even though I go every single week day I actually do have moments where I forget I'm in treatment. I'm hoping when I'm done with radiation, those times will just keep growing and growing until they choke out those gloomy thoughts. Anyway, never feel you shouldn't post as you did...that's what we're here for remember? Support! If the feeling overwhelms you, you may want to ask for help in the way of meds. I know many with our dx finds it helpful, and I had promised myself it if things didn't get better after chemo I would not have hesitated to jump on board with that.  No one should have to feel that way constantly. Hope you got a good nap girl. Karen....well the 70 makes me soooo green with envy! I would adore sipping lemonade with you in the sun, and while we're at it we could say a ferverent prayer for Julie. I'm so sorry to hear about that, please let us know how the surgery goes. Isn't someone's last chemo today?",

I just want to say that you have all made me laugh, cry, worry, rejoice and be brave at times when that wasn't easy...you're witty, wonderful, and real....so if I MUST join a chemo group I am honored to be a part of this one. Your words of wisdom definitely kept me from freaking out my first time in \"the chair\". lol I'll try not to ramble too much in introducing myself.....I have two amazing wonderful people I was lucky enough to raise, my son is 18 and the kindest hearted, sweetest person I know, my girl is 20, my best friend and doing amazing in college, shooting for a physician assistant or nurse practitioner. I'm 44 and my name is Lori, although my dear Grandpa rarely called me anything but \"lolli\" (hence the screen name), and my sister always adds the lil in front. My job is not a desk one, so I'm on leave until after the holidays...am lucky enough to share a house with my big sis and her hubby, so she won't kick me out for not having any money. My tx is 4 dd A/C every two weeks.....my second infusion will be this coming Friday. I felt pretty poorly for six days after my first one, but I hope I have learned some things that may help the next time. Nothing was too severe, it just seemed to wear on me with each day. The October girls seem to be doing very well...so I'm thankful and happy for that. (Ulla, praying for you to find some answers and have an easier time of it next treatment). You've all had some wonderful advice that has helped, the only thing I can add is that I'm in love with ginger.....some peach ginger tea saved my life and I drink a lot of flat ginger ale and munch on some ginger snaps when I feel like a sweet. The stuff is a miracle for upset tummies. Also, I noticed some talked about their hair hurting when it was coming out. I did see on another thread that some women had used the lint brushes with the sticky tape to get rid of the hair stubbles on their head, that seemed to bring some relief from the irritating feeling. I'm sorry that in the middle of the night I can't remember individual schedules...but I do remember that \"Mrs.\" starts chemo today. Good vibes and prayers sent your way today hon. All I can say is...even though I've whined about my se's, it still wasn't even close to as bad as my wild imaginings. The actual infusion was NOTHING and I felt very good and energetic for hours afterwards....although like someone said....I almost felt like I had taken something illegal...I was a bit hyper and talked non-stop for a couple of hours. Yeah...I know...not too much diff than the usual as you can see. ;)  I'm blaming it on the steroids. lol Okay....now that I have the picture in my head of us all answering our doors tonight hatless and shirtless I'm going to be laughing while I'm trying to sleep now....my dog will think I'm nuts. lol  But thanks for giving me pleasant thoughts to drift off on....I think we all need that more often. I have my second treatment this Friday and my best friend is coming to chop my hair off on Thursday, so I'll try to check in at least once before then, and see how it's going for everyone. Peace and be well.....",

Before soccer and after baseball and all they had was scouts. Wow...that seems like another lifetime. I know it's hard work but I sure do miss them being little sometimes. Well, I should get ready for company. We were heading for the drive-in, but there's storm warnings all around us, so I guess it'll be movies in tonight. *sigh* I was hoping to go out...but oh well...if it's nice in the morning I might go to the beach with my sis before the sun gets strong.

Which means I'm exhausted all the time. But NOT complaining. This season is too short in this state for me to not take advantage. The drive-in and the beach are my favorite places, and my honey's band has actually been getting some gigs..sometimes far enough away that I'm out of town overnight. It's funny to think what a homebody I used to be...and now I can't stand to be here long. I guess that's what happens when you barely leave the house for the winter except to see docs.  Karen, what an adorable puppy!!!!  Linda, so good to hear from you! Congrats on the new nips. lol Sue, hope you're feeling better..big hugs. Texas Karen, lovin' the avi! You sound super busy! I get tons of compliments on my bracelet too! It really is gorgeous, and I think of you each time I look at it. Kara, can't wait to see pics of the pond. Evy, been praying for you all day. Hope the surgery was quick and easy. Check in when you're up to it honey. Cheryl, what did you do for your birthday? I'm so bummed I didn't realize...... Ulla, special prayers going your way constantly. Miss you sweetie. On the subject of hair...mine is crazy-thick! It's about halfway down my forehead, ears, and neck, (if it were straight it would probably cover all of the above).. but it's so BIG. It's like a fro and I have to put a relaxing gel in it or it's just a big fuzz ball. LOL I'm so curious as to how long it will stay. I'll try to take a pic soon...it's rather hysterical, but people seem to genuinely like it. I keep grabbing it to see how long before I'll have a little ponytail.  So...I don't know if I'm more obsessed with my health or my hair. lol I'm at a family reunion until Sunday so everyone have a good week/end. Much love to you all!",

LOL Warning, this is au naturale with no product or smoothing gel in it for styling purposes, so it's a bit scary!

It's amazing how much that helps.

So today I just hope I can get out and back for my Neulasta shot before the NINE INCHES of snow we're supposed to get finishes coming down. :P If it gets too bad they said I could come in Monday, but I'd sure like to get it done. I've practically been a hermit for the past six weeks, (everyone made me so paranoid, and we've had some really terrible flus going around to commence the beggining of our cold weather), so I told my chemo nurse yesterday that in two weeks, I'm going to go find the loudest, most crowded place in the city and stand in the middle of it and just soak up all the acitivity. I almost cried at the thought of browsing around Target. LOL  I guess I may have gone a bit overboard with the caution, but I figured if it helps, small price to pay. Luckily, I had some wonderful company here and there, and all my loved ones had their flu shots. So...I guess next step for me...rads...but I'm hoping I can start after Christmas. Is anyone else coming close to no mo chemo? I'm going to stay in this thread until I see every last one of you cross that finish line. I hope nobody gets offended that I don't include myself in the Christmas card exchange. I love you all very much, but I'm a bit overwhelmed with the 100 thank you notes I'm still trying to write....Okay I tend to overstate things a bit, but it feels like a hundred. lol  Maybe I can send Valentine cards as we're all coming to the end of rads? lol Come to think of it....how many in here are going onto rads? I guess I'll just have to visit two threads after the New Year's to visit those of you who don't have to take that step. Love to all, and have a loverly weekend.",

I can tell you that this is the first day I feel almost fully me (mentally) since the Nov 30th., but you will come out of this fog and things will look brighter. At that point you will be better equipped to push yourself physically, and those two aspects will just feed off of themselves and snowball. So please take heart...even a few days ago I couldn't post because I couldn't grasp one little positive thought. lol It'll rebound for you too, and suddenly you'll wake up and go \"HEY! I see a light at the end of this tunnell!\" Karyll...glad things are abating, if only a bit...hopefully it will improve now in leaps and bounds. Kristina and Deb....I said a prayer and demanded that you'd had enough. lol Seriously...I'm begging the powers that be for you to feel better for the Holidays. Welcome back Karen, hopefully that new regimen will prove to be just what was promised...MINIMAL side effects. Cheryl, glad your cold's clearing up....phew. Ulla, Lori G., Penny, Karen R., Lisa, Coach...ummm I call CHEMO BRAIN...LOL ..I'm stuck now, but to each and every Oct. girl, be well and take care. Love ya!",

My sis (the one I share a house with, and who nursed me through chemo) ended up in the hospital last Sunday, so needless to say, it's been the week from hell. It was quite serious for a couple of days and I'm pretty sure I've never been that scared.  I can only thank heavens that she is home tomorrow and should be fine. So, that's why I've been mia. If I'm not at radiation this past week, I'm at her hospital (not the same place of course lol), and when home it's pretty much just enough time to catch about half the sleep I really need.

I had previously smoked though so it was okay, but any lower and I would have been worried. Haven't had it taken since my last chemo (end of Nov) so not sure what it is now. Someone asked about moisturizer, sorry..I think it was PC...well I've just used anything that doesn't have perfume or alcohol. No special brand, just whatever's cheap and pure. I know there's a beauty/make-up thread on the boards here that has a lot of good advice about that kind of thing..healthy skin care products etc. I think they recommend Burt's Bees products as being good as far as non-toxic chemicals and no animal testing, and they name a website where you can check out products you do use for that (as there is a supposed *or maybe proven* cancer causing agent in many of the brand name skin care products we buy). Sorry....when I have more time I'll go get better info and try to post a link. Hate to post such a vague bit of information, but for some reason I'm tired a lot and my memory's a bit short. LOL Ulla! Glad to see you posting again my dear. I'm very thrilled to hear about the high survival rates in your country. With the reconstruction, just like everything else, you will search your heart and soul and discover what YOU need. Hang in there! Theresa, are you feeling better now? Hope your tummy symptoms have resolved themselves and you're back on track. Check in when you can. Kara...love the new avatar. So nice to see your smiling face! I'm guessing that's hubby with you? Karen R., have fun in Leavenworth this weekend girl! Sue...steroids always kept me awake too. Ativan helped as well as benadryl. Congrats on getting one more treatment out of the way. Linda, good luck with pt on Monday. Let us know how it is. About the weight loss question, I lost about ten pounds during dx/surgery time (which was perfect because that's the amount I had been shooting for when I joined the gym a few months before. During chemo ...just like Karen...I lost and gained the same bit of weight back and forth. Now that my fat to muscle ratio is probably pretty lousy from inactivity I wouldn't mind taking off another five. It's below zero here this weekend and to be honest, I just can't make myself spend any time outside when it's below freezing, so the minute I get back to work I'm getting one of those rebounders. Being a couch potato from Nov. to Feb. or later is just not going to work for me any more. The only thing that saved me was my active job, and since I don't know if I should risk the occasional lifting I end up doing there I'm undecided about going back. Well darn, sorry for all the babbling. I guess I missed you guys. lol",

I'm just starting to wade through tons of things and so much of it seems to be personal choice or opinion (unfortunately, there's not much funding for research on the benefits of herbs/natural supplements because there's no big money to be made by anyone). I would make sure you're getting enough calcium for your bones and taking it with vitamin D  and magnesium, which will help you absorb the calcium. As for me, if I eat enough calories to get all the vitamins I need in a day I would be huge! So, I take a good multi-vitamin. I'm just too short with a too slow metabolism (too many years of unhealthy dieting) to take in all that food. I now feel like I am at a perfectly healthy weight and want to stay that way. I have some herbs and supplements I'm considering. You may want to look at the alternative/complimentary medicine thread. Tons of good info there about diet etc. http://www.breastcancer.org/tips/nutrition/ask_expert/2007_07/question_01.jsp",

I'm sure the emtions you're having are mostly to do with the weddings, but being tired also always makes me weepy. I'm sure that and the fact that it sounds like you're over-doing isn't helping.",

I know you're not asking for my advice, but you are my sister and I care for you. If I can have an opinion on this, I would say to you, could you try it for one week? Sometimes we have se's that start out strong but fade with each day. I really don't blame you about the injections, they're not really necessary with tamoxifen (then again your doc may have had a good reason for you to have the lupron that I don't understand). I know you are very educated and intelligent. In the end this does have to be your decision. You know we will stand by you whatever you decide to do after you think it through.

Did you get your parents calmed down? Now that it's out in the open do you feel the slightest sense of relief? I know it's hard to reassure everyone else that you are going to be just fine, when you're feeling the way you were. I'm sure waiting until Monday is no big deal at all...or even waiting until your hubby is home and giving yourself some time to think. I know I didn't start taking my tamoxifen immediately after radiation. We wanted to make sure that if I had se's I would know which it came from. So, just try to enjoy some treatment-free time knowing that taking a few days off is no big deal in the grand scheme of things. You may even be one of those people who, if you decide to take it, have to work your way gradually up to your dose. As always, keep us posted and keep talking things out with us. It helps for sure.",

Even if it is an impossible idea, I totally understand thinking something like that too.  It is so amazing what we dredge up from our subconcious sometimes. Seems like this could be helpful, you figuring out that irrational fear. So not \"nitwitty\"...... we all have them. You're just in touch enough to figure it out. Also, I think you're very right on and your two cents is worth way more. I did some thinking too and I think I was feeling that if he tries to brush the whole conversation off, or shows signs that he's uncomfortable, I would have a hard time with that. I suppose I could examine it more deeply and figure out why, but it seems secondary. (Maybe I would think it is a sign of weakness or that he doesn't love me enough?) That's silly, and I know it.   Like you said, I just need to keep in mind that he loves me, and we're not perfect. I should understand that he would be nervous about hurting me, and that my scars would bother him because it was a sign of my illness. To think that months after radiation, I would just like to pretend this \"whole thing\" doesn't exist, is just not going to happen. Obviously, every time he touches me we both think about it. I'm sure he has to stop for a second to figure out which one he doesn't have to be careful with, which in turns reminds me that he has to be careful. UGH....I didn't realize I had such an issue with this! I guess next weekend I'll just lay it out there, and hope that makes things better for me. I really think I'm the one with the problem. It's just so funny how we've talked about the emotional aspect of this in depth, but the physical...nada...just pretended like business as usual. Anyway, thanks so much again for the advice. I hope I didn't make anyone uncomfortable, or give TMI, it just really hit me the other day that I left this conversation go for so long I didn't know how to bring it up. I should have just done it right off. Happy Memorial Day. My prayers and thanks to anyone who have loved ones serving our country, or are doing so themselves. Thank you!",

I just realized today that my cancerversary is Saturday! That was the date of my surgery, so I consider myself cancer free for ONE FULL YEAR! woohooo!  I just wanted to thank you all, my wonderful sisters, for being here every step of the way. I can't imagine going through this past year without you all in my corner. I'm so thankful, for so many things, but my dears, you are very high on that list. You helped to make it bearable, and who'd have thought....sometimes even fun. You've made me laugh, cry and everything in between.

I've never had such a full calender in my life! What will we do with all of our time when we're done with treatment? Kristina....I told my sister the exact same thing!  I have to admit that after day six I wondered if I was dying too. Not because I felt that physically sick, but more because I felt that fatigued. I wonder if some of it isn't partly emotional too? I had to laugh at how many times I found myself tearing up. I would literally be laughing as my eyes filled with tears because I knew I was being so ridiculous. It's all very strange as I usually only cry when I'm happy, and really only cried once the months between dx and my first chemo. Anyone else experience this? Maybe it's the chemo-pause I've heard about. Well, I have one more tip today.

I truly think having this place to come to has made everything more tolerable, just knowing I have some wonderful people to share with who understand. I am HUGE on the Biotene program as well as ice during infusion. I bought the biggest bottle of the mouthwash I could find and rinse every time I eat, and brush with the toothpaste as often as I can stand it..even though it's not delicious, it keeps my mouth moist. I got mine at Walgreens, but I've heard Target's have them or maybe for those of you that have Walmart's I think they might as well. One thing I have heard someone who already had mouth sores mention, she broke open vitamin D capsules and applied directly to sores for immediate relief...but of course please ask you onc. Also, have you heard of the \"magic mouthwash\" you can get a script from your dentist for? Supposed to help so much, I believe a mix of benadryl, antacid, and I think lidocaine? Anyway, a couple things I hope might help you. So sad how many of us have lost our mothers. Especially, when it's not old age, but diseases that affect their quality of life...how very hard. Mine had emphysema... I too think of her daily. It was amazing to me how many months it took for me to stop reaching for the phone daily to tell her something funny, or just to hear her reassuring voice. But on a very wonderful note...she lives many years beyond expected and I got to live with her for about five years before she insisted on going into a nursing home right near the end. I got to know her as a friend as well as a mother at that time, and I thank god for that. Day 16 must be the magic number...I'm having some slight shedding. :(  Ah well....at least I have reason to be glad I went ahead with the crew cut. lol It was kinda fun while it lasted. Kristina...I know that tx 2 was tough, but I have to say something about that. My # 1 was really rough right from the first night...luckily for everyone I hadn't signed on to be able to whine yet...but I had six days of just feeling like a limp dish rag, didn't want to eat and couldn't taste anything. Now mind you it was \"doable\" but just more-so made me apprehensive about the next one being worse ya know? Well tx number two was Friday and besides some sleepiness from short sleep sessions (steroids) I feel very near 100%!! Nothing has really been tasting or smelling bad!  Pretty much like I felt the week before my last infusion. So, I know people who've had good luck hope they'll all be the same (I hope that for them too), I'm just amazed that my two have been exactly opposite. I just know that is going to happen to you too. I haven't really changed my meds (I did add one extra \"as needed\" in between doses during the day, and one ativan for the first few overnights which were the worst for me), but mostly the only difference is some automatic antacid the first few days. So....I'm saying extra loud prayers for you between now and #3. Don't forget something ginger. Sheesh I think that shoulda been my screen name the way I love that stuff. lol Cheryl....rest rest rest! I found if I push when I'm too tired it can go downhill fast. Take care. Debbie, thank you for the well-wishes back...I hope it continues too, I'm just so thankful. I hope your sons illness is totally non-contagious, we don't need any extra things to deal with do we? Keep us posted. ULLA, please check in when you can. I hope you're just feeling so good finally, and enjoying some time with hubby now, and just got busy. We do worry though. I have a poll.....how many of us are 44 in here? Seems like I've read this number a lot! I only have a few months to change numbers but I'm holding fast. heh heh Well..the Vikings are starting to come to life, I'd better go cheer them on. :D Hugs lovely October sweeties!",

I extend mine to you to Kara, hope the weather doesn't cause you any problems. It is so good to be done with this phase. I didn't make it through the snowstorm to get to my shot the next day...luckily since it was my last, they said I could put it off a day. We are supposed to get snow a few more times this week!   Karyll, I'm so sorry to hear you've had a delay. Of course you've found some positives in it, and that doesn't surprise me with your attitude, but it still bites. Ulla...I'm sorry I can't really advise on what you're going through right now because of the difference in our surgeries and I have no prosthesis. I can say that after my tx my lumpectomy scar and node dissection area do get pains. I don't really have any swelling besides a little bit of fluid build up I get occasionally where my drain was. It comes and goes and gets less each time, but deosn't seem to follow any pattern as far as treatment goes. I hope you get some answers though honey and that this all gets better with time. Evy, thinking of you and and sending so many positive vibes to you this week. Cheryl, glad you're feeling better and rested. Have a nice visit with your mom...I'm with you guys, I'd love to transport my entire family somewhere warm...but I could never leave them, so here I'll stay. Well...I'm off to take my meds. One I'm supposed to take with food, but who has room with all these pills? I'm full by the time I take them. lol Hugs and love....",

Ah well....the newest studies are saying good things about extra rads and I'm trying to say, what's another week? The good news, I loved everyone at the office I'm going to, it's a very nice and homey place compared to my infusion center, and my rad onc was surprisingly personable. Okay...truthfully, she was very serious when I met her but I made her laugh a couple of times and.... phew she seemed pretty human after that. lol  I'll let you know how I REALLY feel about them all after next tues when I lay there half nekkid and cold while they line me up, scrutinize and poke me for what could seem like forever.LOL  Happily, I get to wait until after the New Year to start. Wooohooo that will be ALMOST two weeks w/o a doc visit. Take care and hugs everyone.",

I wonder if the steroids would have totally eliminated all that hell you went through? Let us know what they decide to do with your treatments and keep us posted how you're feeling. Thanks so much for the detailed instructions on the wig care. That was excactly what I needed! Synthetic wig for dummies. lol  Linda, you're right, I probably should talk to someone about getting on Effexor or something. I don't think this feeling will just go away. Especially like Cheryl says, when the days are so short, and sunshine so rare. Texas Karen...how right you are, guilt is just a worthless emotion. I think every one of us should make a pact not to feel guilty about one single thing between now and NEXT Christmas. We all honestly deserve a break and to cut ourselves some slack. This past year has been a tough one, I say we are gentle with ourselves for this coming one. For some reason I've gotten good at beating up on myself and when you think about it, in our situations it's quite ridiculous. Love to all",

Although I may have felt a bit more tired during boosts. Please ask your doctor about this, I'm sure she/he can explain better and put your mind at ease.",

I'm a dork. I did, however want to be Pat Benatar, she was short (like me) and tough (like I pretended to be). hah Donna, I can't imagine going through divorce, cancer AND more schooling in the same time frame but, WOW! You are a stellar example for your children. You really are strong! I love all you girls too.... Barbie, I'm so sorry, but for once I don't have an opinion on something! Shocking I know...The first question I cant answer because, as I said before, I'm scared to touch them. I've NEVER buried my head in the sand since this whole thing started, but for a couple of months after radiation, I must pretend like there's no chance anything further could be wrong with me. I just need to not feel like a cancer patient for a little while. I had a follow-up with my onc yesterday and he felt me up, nodes and all...that's good enough for me. lol  When I go in for a mammo in four months I will do a self-exam so I know what they're supposed to feel like these days. (I also see my rads doc next week too, and she's always very thorough, so I'm not being totally irresponsible). The second question, well I was blessed and lucky to just have a \"sunburn\" to heal from. So, I know with your situation, it will take much longer and someone who had more skin problems could maybe help you with that. I am hoping the best for you. I can say I did have the itchies at one point during healing and cortisone seemed to help.",

It kind of worried me at first until I realized it doesn't seem like symptoms I need to worry over. We all have every right to have our whiny moments. We ALL usually have such great attitudes, but sometimes we deserve to feel angry and whiny about this crap we didn't ask for. So no apologies when you vent to your sisters. That's why we're here. I also lost a filling that I need to go see about. Apparently chemo tx changes our saliva PH forever! I never did get the details on what that meant..I wasn't exactly wild about my dentist's new assistant so I'm finding a different one after over ten years. I know our teeth are weakened during chemo and we can lose fillings. I hope it's temporary! Anyway...I'm overdue for my six month so I'll let you know what I find out about that.",

      "Content": "May 25, 2008 12:37PM - edited May 25, 2008 01:06PM by Miss_Lolli Kara, how did you get the curl to stop popping? I try not to complain, as I've always wanted curly hair, but it's verging on 'fro-ish. I can't style or control the curl at all! And gel, well..I may as well be using water. LOL But like you said, least of my worries, and kind of a fun change. Karen R, I've had the same experience with my hair. My sister and  some friends have tried to make me promise I won't grow it out long again. I just tell them I don't like my ears...no way I'm making that promise! Who knows how I'll feel about it when it gets there, but right now I want a ponytail! Sue, just wanted to let you know, I have had barely any probs with the tamoxifen. I just got my third bottle, so I'm hoping that's long enough to know. At first I got mild hot flashes at night, and occasional bits of dizziness when I'd flip over during the night (it would last about a second). But even those seem to be less and less. They may never go completely, but nothing I can't deal with very easily. Ulla, I'm SO very happy you can go visit Erik! I knew something was up when you hadn't mentioned him, but now just may not be the right time for any kind of changes. Or at least as far as your hubby is concerned. Men are just very competitive in nature, and while it may not be rational, and is somewhat silly, I can also sympathize with him a bit. He wants to be selfish with your love right now and have it all to himself. As time goes on and on, he will feel more comfortable that you're not going anywhere. Linda, I had a long-time (15 year) friend who pulled away emotionally as well....promised to fix my Jeep and then I didn't see him for six months while I'm off work and going through treatment. He told me I had to call him, because he didn't ever want to wake me, as sleep is so important. I think he didn't want to chance catching me not up to par. He still doesn't want me to talk about my cancer experience (he says \"well it's over and now you can just forget about it\") HAH that's a joke. But Linda, thank you, you just helped me to see that it was most likely because he felt helpless. He was like a big brother, and always \"fixed\" whatever was wrong, so that would explain that. I've never let him know that I felt so betrayed, now maybe I can let go of the tiny bit of anger I felt. Although I doubt we'll ever be as close. A TON of people that I didn't expect to, came through for me and were such great emotional support, and I can say that no one else really let me down, so I feel VERY blessed. I know a lot of relationships can get strained from such trauma. When I saw how a couple of my life-long friends were affected, I was worried they may not make it through this, more than I was worried about myself. lol   I think as I look healthier and stronger (i.e. more hair lol) they can maybe let it go a bit. But knowing how I felt about my sister, and how that was harder for me than my own diagnosis, I do empathize. It is so very hard to see someone you love struggle with health issues. I know I've rambled so much already, but this brings to mind another question. My boyfriend (the one I got back together with in March after he was such an incredible friend to me during tx and before), has never mentioned my surgery or the fact that my body is different than the first time we dated. Now honestly, my surgeon was terrific, so it's pretty hard to notice anything different, but I do have a small scar/tiny dent and a bit bigger scar with a tiny bit of swelling where the node surgery was. He basically never touches my surgery area, just occasionally the \"other one\". We are very open with each other, but that's just one subject neither of us has broached. I have thanked him for being there when I expected him to run the other way (after all I had been trying to \"get rid\" of him for three years and telling him to move on anyway\".  I have explained in detail to him the percentage risk of recurrance and I did ask him once, very casually \"Do you have any questions about what I went through?\" But none of that led any further than him telling me he loves me and will be here no matter what. I'm not complaining, but I just feel like there's this one thing hanging between us that makes me feel uncomfortable for a rare second or two. For example, jumping when his hand gets near radiated-tender boob, or I noticed today he looked away when I change shirts (could totally be paranoia on my part). He's obviously been great in every other way. Do I wait for him to say something or just tackle it head on and explain to him that it's a bit sore for now, explain the scars etc.... I'm usually so blunt, but for some reason I feel fearful to bring this up. I guess it's possible that I'll feel badly if he acts uncomfortable? Suggestions anyone? I think there's a thread like this regarding new boyfriend's, but this is a unique situation (new old boyfriend) and I trust your girls. Okay..phew..thanks for all your time. Happy Memorial Day and I love you all!",

I saw a hint somewhere that says if you suck on a lemon drop before you eat, it will mellow out the salt flavor and your food will taste better. Angie, for the dry nose I used to get a little spray bottle at the drug store just for that...I believe it has a saline/water type of solution in it, and it helped when my son used to get nose bleeds from the dry winter air. There's no meds or chemicals in it...just helps with moisture. I agree with Karen R....a good dose of Benadryl is usually enough to help me nod off at bedtime. Of course when you're full of steroids I can't guarantee you'll stay asleep...but it sure does relax me.

I've never been a winter person, so I ended up in the wrong state.  On the other hand, I think as long as I'm feeling good and healthy I'll be a winter/summer/spring/fall person from now on. haha  Wish I could slip into a tanning booth once a week, but that's a no-no in my \"new\" life too. Would probably set off hot flashes anyhow. LOL Julie, I work with the public and therefore not working, just to be safe. I'm lucky enough to have the option (although I'll have bills to catch up on piling up).I just decided not to chance it. For me this time of year is just too risky, plus holiday season is SO busy. I have seen some who continue to work and say it's best for them mentally, so I beg you to do what YOU feel is best for you. I would put my health before money, but mental health is also part of that. I would probably be so paranoid about every cough and sneeze, but I also know that when I do go back, mentally and physically I will feel sooo much better. It's such a balancing act huh?

I was also born premature (three months) and at under three pounds I had to stay in an incubator for a month before I could leave the hospital! What a nightmare for my poor mom.  I'm so glad you get to take Lennon home. What a wonderful name for a beautiful baby! Congrats! Ulla and Kristina, was so relieved and happy to see you finally post. Kristina, I'm so sorry for all the bs you're having to deal with. Nice to see it didn't sap your sense of humor..I admire your spunk. Ulla, I hope you enjoy your new home. Welcome back to the group and of course we don't expect you to catch up, we're just happy to hear you sounding upbeat. Mrsfriz....my doggy is a smart and well-trained black poodle mix. I can't really take credit as he was abandoned in the cold Minnesota Feb outdoors a few years back, and probably wouldn't have made it much longer. :-(  My niece happened upon him and after searching and calling for weeks, could never find his home. I was lucky enough to be the one \"talked into\" taking him in and it was one of the best decisions ever. I love collie's too...if I had chosen I might have gone that way, they have such pretty coats. My \"baby's\" name is Asher, what about your border collie? Varasri, you sound like you're doing great. Thanks for coming back and letting us know that you feel healthy, you sound wonderful today. I hope the chemo is not too rough on you.  My daughter does well in school too..doesn't that make you feel so good? :D  She's in pre-med and works in a nursing home, so it's good to see her feeling so happy and fullfilled by that. Lisa..I'm with you, I SO miss having babies around. :( Mine are 18 and 20, and both passed me up in height years ago. However, every once in awhile my daughter will still crawl up on my lap and pretend I'm holding her like a baby. Actually she's more on the couch than me, so I'm sure it's a hysterical sight. LOL  I sing her a bit of a song, give her a smack on the forehead and we have a good laugh... I actually slept through the whole night last night and long enough to feel rested! Woohoo! That feels so great I'm going to go get some housework done while I still have lotsa steam. Have a wonderful day October ladies.   Hugs n love.....",

Like someone said before, right now I'm just eating whatever doesn't sound horrid. lol  When I'm through with chemo I'll get a bit more picky and healthy. I'm sorry I have no clue if anyone has any more tx's this week, but hopefully everyone will check in soon to let us know. I think Kristina was yesterday? Here's hoping that went on as planned.

Thank you so much for those of you who posted about the heart-racing. I had no trouble breathing, but felt like my heart was palpitating right outta my chest the first two days after tx last time. I'm sorry others are having this, but I guess relieved that it must be common, and from what I've read, I'm guessing it's the steriods. Why all of a sudden now I'm not sure. Well after last Friday 3 down and 1 to go. wooohooo Evy, you sure do have your hands full honey. Take it easy on yourself about being emotional. You have every right to be and add post-partum hormones to all of that...well wow! Besides which, now that little Lennon is safe, you're bound to concentrate a little more with your own body now. It's totally understandable that now that he's here you're focused on being around for you beautiful babies...and you will be. Ulla...so glad you're port is still fine, but sorry it had to get hurt. Still praying for your nauseau to get lost. Karen omg way to rock that bald look! I admire you... And yes to both Karen's I have been extra tired this time around. I especially hit a will around the evening time, but I feel like I did nothing for the whole entire weekend. Guess I can't complain, since I still haven't had the nausea since tx1 (knocking wood). Karen R. I too have sore hands from sanitizing...wish I could quit being paranoid about illness, but I guess it's our job for now. I believe yahoo is pretty simple to d/l (after all I did it hehe) but I'll send you my email addy so you can add me if you'd like. I'm on yahoo more, but will try to check into msn too. Cheryl, how wonderful you got to spend time with your family. I can't wait to have both my kids with me on Thanksgiving...just wishing so hard that everyone stays healthy until then. My ex-husband is actually coming over from the other side of town too (we've stayed friends) so the kids are extra excited. My sister is cooking for us and she is the BEST cook ever, I'm hoping my fatigue is gone soon so I can \"assist\". lol Kristina, the only thing I heard about helping the \"metal mouth\" besides mints is lemon drops and using plastic untensils. Hope you find some relief sweets. I'm sending you my yahoo. I can sign into mine about half the time (need an upgrade), but it sure would be fun to kill some time with an Ocotober ladies chat. Feel free to send my contact info to any of the wonderful girls here in our thread. Hope I didn't miss answering anything... Love n hugs all.....",

It sounds really simple, and I have no clue if it actually works, but I've heard it more than once and I guess there's no harm in trying either way. Evy, glad you're home and the surgery went well. You're in my thoughts often. Deb and Kristina, I'm so very sad that you're having such a hard time...I'm keeping you in my prayers and adding Vince..how tragic. I just wanted to take the time to say something in case anyone ends up having the same problem I did, it won't come as such a surprise and maybe make things easier for someone....When I was done with chemo (Nov. 30th) I expected to feel nothing but celebratory. I had these big ideas about outings and happiness and energy. LOL Well, I have to say that for some reason, and I'm still not sure why, I sunk into the deepest depression I've had since this whole ride started. I could barely get out of bed each day, and when I did I felt like there was no point in doing it. It took me over a week to realize that these weren't \"true\" feelings, but just sheer exhaustion, fatigue, maybe a little bit of a let down after trying so hard to tough it through chemo. Maybe a bit of isolation/feeling unneeded...not totally sure.  I'm wondering if I had some ridiculous notion that the moment they pulled that last IV outta me I would be \"done\" and everything would just fall into place. I would be immediately grateful and feel like I won a battle. And even more ridiculous I think I almost expected my energy to be back and my life to be close to what it was before. Mind you, I know this doesn't make sense and technically I knew better, but I just wanted to warn you girls for when your \"no mo chemo\" time comes. You may think that you'll feel like celebrating, but please don't be discouraged and scared if you don't. If I can save one person from beating themselves up over not just feeling grateful and elated then it was worth all the typing. I had to spill my guts to my sis and have her give me the \"you've been through a lot\" speech and let me know it was okay to be sad, scared, and depressed, along with my relief at being done. It's not totally gone, but I'm just trying to let myself have my feelings. It's hard, when you know some have it so much worse, to not kick yourself for having a pity party, but every little once in awhile, it's okay to mourn what we've lost too. I truly believe that. I just try not to wallow in it too much. lol Thanks for letting me ramble. I love you guys and hope you're well.",

The week after tx food tasted like cardboard, so I had very few things I cared to eat and lost weight. Second week was a celebration of that fact that I could taste again, and I'd pretty much gain what I'd lost.  So...except for the original ten I lost between dx and surgery (which I wanted to lose anyway) it was all a wash. I truly don't think chemo weight would stay, as Karen said, it's steroids and water weight mostly. I think that most of us found that we were so picky during chemo that it was more a matter of what our body would allow us to eat, rather than what we chose to eat. Seems that most pretty much eat either what doesn't taste funny, or one of the few things that sounds good. Be prepared to enjoy, and maybe even crave some foods you wouldn't previously consider and vice-versa. The hardest thing for me was steering clear of fresh fruits and veggies (nothing you can't either cook or peel). It's hard for me to eat healthy when I can't have my greens. I will say this...I wish I had gotten a rebounder to use indoors while it's below freezing....I just can't handle that weather. I think I would have lost if not for so much inactivity. Besides which, bouncing is so very good for cell rejuvination, and boosts your immune system, and gets your lymph fluids going. These all sound like good things for those with our dx, so I'm going to splurge on one after Christmas. Excuse the babbling...it happens to the extreme when I'm over-tired. lol If I'm not back before hand, hope those of you that celebrate have a wonderful and lovely holiday with lots of love and family. I love you sweeties.",

I actually fall asleep pretty easily, as I'm so tired by bedtime....the problem is staying asleep. A lot of times I just end up taking some benadryl, melatonin, or if I feel extra stressed out, an ativan. The benadryl is just the same active ingredient that is in Tylenol PM, so if I feel headachey at all I take that instead. Funny...before this whole thing I didn't take anything besides some ibuprofen for cramps, now I feel like a pro pill popper. lol Ulla...big hugs for you. I've lost two people I care about in the last month and it sure doesn't help with the depression does it? Just please try to count your blessings and focus on what you have good in your life. You have a lot of love and support from your husband. We all need to find a bright spot and concentrate on that when we feel down. One thing I would suggest in dealing with your situation is to look at it this way....you don't have cancer, you HAD cancer. They removed it through surgery, and now you're having PREVENTATIVE treatment so it won't come back. With each day you are getting closer to your old healthy self. I know we all feel more vulnerable now with this diagnosis and fear of recurrance, but I'm trying so very hard to think of myself as recovering instead of a patient. Not so easy with a bald head, but it'll come back. Just think how cute you'll look with your short spiky new \"do\".  Also, as others have suggested, you need to talk to somebody about getting on some anti-depressants, or if you are taking some they need to be adjusted. You should not have to go on feeling stuck in such a dark place. Cheryl, hope that icky goo is gone soon. Those days where it's dark before you can even get home from work are such a bummer. We don't have many days with sunshine for about four or five months here in Minnesota either. If tanning booths were healthy I'd be there every day. lol Linda, great advice....we all need to be kind to ourselves. Kristina??? Sure would love to hear from you. Love and hugs to everyone...",

I am just starting to research supplements and nutrition, so I'll let you know if I find out anything that impresses me. I know for recurrence they really don't test you much unless you have symptoms? Since some recurrences don't have symptoms that also makes me nervous, but maybe your onc can inform you better on that. Back to the play-offs....have a great Sunday everyone! HUGS",

And you're far from pathetic. This is exactly what we're here for. Those times and moods when you have a hundred things bothering you. Usually it's not the one big thing, but the tons of little things that get to you. I can relate to so much of what you expressed. I never even had to remind to straight A daughter to do her homework in her entire life. With my son it was a constant struggle. I not only had to tell him but stand over him and make sure it got done. He did get horrible grades and would tell me he didn't have homework when he had tons! Thank God he even graduated, but I think it was more work for me than him. lol  I never understood it, because he's actually very smart. I think he could've aced school with very little effort, but he put in less than that. I wish I had some words of wisdom for you there, but I never really found a good solution. As far as hubby, I'm sorry he's having to work so much. Hopefully the drinking thing is just a phase. I know that, even though I don't, I feel like drinking more often these days. Like it's an escape from my worries and what I've been through. If it wasn't so bad for my health I might imbibe more than I do. And I think when someone you love is sick it's even more stressful and much harder than when it's you (at least that's how I felt when my sis fell so ill over winter). So....I guess I wouldn't put up with more than what your tolerance level is, but I hope as things get closer to normal dh will feel more in control, and less like drinking. As far as the wedding ..ugh. I have no words of wisdom, as I would have to kill anyone who tried to take my daughter out of this area. LOL  Totally kidding, but I do admire your positive attitude there. It sounds like your daughter may have a difficult man on her hands, and it would be so hard to keep your mouth shut. But like you said, what would that accomplish? Maybe it doesn't bother her, or maybe she'll learn to put her foot down. I know my family disliked my husband at first, but he grew a lot over the years, and they began to see that underneath it all is a good person with a good heart. 15 years post-divorce he's still invited to all family events that include my kids. I digress, but what I'm saying is....he may have a lot of growing up to do, and he may grow on you. It's just wonderful of you to support your daughter regardless. Hope everyone is having a good weekend. It's cold and rainy here. But no snow, so all good. lol Dbf has a show out of town....so I'll be out celebrating tonight! Check back after the weekend. Hugs!",

If the risk of me developing leukemia, or some other major complication is 2% and the chemo only ups my survival rate by 1%, I would probably go with the odds. That said, I sure would never want to steer anyone in this either way. It's still a hard decision...fighting against something you have had, versus avoiding something you MIGHT have. I would still have to think about it and like you I would still want plenty of oncs opinions. I used to feel sorry that I had to have chemo, but now realize it's probably good that I didn't have to make a decision. How do you not throw everything in the book at it, even if that's maybe not the right decision? It would take a very brave person, and a lot of soul-searching. Anyway, I'm sorry I probably haven't been much help, but I mostly wanted to say that your wife is not a statistic. She has to do what she feels is right for herself and then stick by that decision. Not second-guess herself or live with regrets. I hope you come to a decision and have peace with it very soon. Keep us posted if you can.",

I can't say whether it will cause problems in the future for my veins in my only available arm, I have had only one blood draw since. I've never had great veins, but my advice if you go for it....TONS of water the previous day and a hot towel or running your arm under very warm water for a few minutes before your infusion.

I lay on a table and they put a cushion under my knees and take about ten seconds to make sure my tatts are lined up right (that's the only time they have to pull down the gown, which this freeze-baby was worried about lol).  They then leave the room, the machine buzzes for about ten seconds, slowly moves to the other side of my body for another ten seconds, and I'm done! There is nothing claustraphobic about it. From the time I lay down until the time I get up is less than a minute! I don't even have time to relax...sheesh.  I know once a week they take an xray to make sure everything is still lined up correctly...I imagine that will add another minute or so on there. Enjoy your weekend everyone!",

I definitely had a bad attitude about being there at first, but everyone from the nurses and receptionists, to the techs were so incredibly warm, helpful and kind that I was won over. Of course some of the techs are nicer than others, but I just adore most everyone in that place. On the other hand, I would not be sad to never see them again. lol Methusala, you probably will get that red. It adds up pretty quickly the last couple of weeks, but as I keep saying....mine is SO red but it never hurts, only rarely itches. It actually is getting less red as my boosts go on (except for that one small area). Now go eat some pie with your ice cream and hang in there hon. Pax, so sorry you have to stop so close to the finish line. How frustrating! Donna....the three H's? GASP!

Actually when they left the room for a minute and came back and said ...okay you can sit up...I was like \"WAH?\" I thought they were still lining me up and didn't even realize that was my first session! Talk about anit-climactic. LOL  I know the whole thing will get old, and I'm sure I'll have some side effects, but how nice to have a tx where I don't have to worry about vomitting for the next week. Remind me of that statement in a month will ya? Hey chemomom, I'm sure they know what they're doing. Maybe the angle you get your chemo at won't \"nick\" your lungs and ribs like most do. To be sure I'd ask the rad onc. though and not just the tech who's zapping you. They may tell you that it's a possibility but not a sure thing for every one. I'm guessing the people who give you your radiation may not know as much about the se's as the doctor who should be the one to verify all possible effects with you. Although it seems the rad docs sometimes blame everything on chemo, and the oncs blame everything on rads. LOL As far as the creams....some places suggest applying from the beginning while some say wait until you have signs of damage (maybe they think it's better for your breast to be kept dry?). I don't think either way would harm you, but I think no matter which way you do it, from what I've read on these boards and my literature, you shouldn't put ANY creams, deodorants, lotions, etc. on in the morning before you have your radiation. I'm not sure, but I think when I put my lotion on this afternoon, my \"lady lump\" felt warm. Then again, I had just gotten home and it's freeeezing...so my hand could have just been cold too. lol Take care girls!",

I can't say about the fatigue, because last Sunday my sister (who nursed me through chemo) ended up in the ICU. When I've not been at rads I've been at her hospital. Good news is, she's in a regular room today and may get to come home this weekend. YAY! Just wanted my glow buddies to know I didn't jump ship. Lizyeh...I know for a pap that chemo can affect the results for awhile, so they may not be accurate. As far as the dentist, I think you're safe unless your rads are lowering your wbc count, which can happen. I asked my office to test my blood occasionally for that, just so I know how careful I need to be about crowds. I had enough \"hermitage\" during chemo.",

It started when she was fairly young, and really used to freak her out at first. She's finally gotten to a place where they're normal now and has never had further problems with that. I can understand why it would worry you though. I think after what we've been through we'd worry about freakin' hang nail. lol I guess we all need to find out how long it takes before chemo or rads won't affect the pap.

You might want to ask their opinion on that. Or if you feel you'd like a bit more recovery time, maybe ask if there would be a harm. Of course there may be reasons they want to get on it, or the time frame I've read is outdated?  Maybe they just figure you want to get started to get it over with that much sooner. MJ....I read about many on here who lost lashes and brows a couple of weeks after last chemo. Seems to be the norm. Sadly, I hear the lashes can go two or three times, but on a happy note, they grow back quickly. To answer your question, I believe that chemo keeps \"working\" one month after tx (Being 28 days out I can say that's pretty accurate). I'm sure that physically radiation should be easier....I'm not really sure how I'll handle having to be somewhere every single day for SEVEN weeks! I don't even watch many movies because I have a hard time commiting ahead two hours. LOL",

One summer, I was visiting my grandparents, who lived in a tiny town where I had previously lived. One of my more \"adventurous\" friends and I were hanging out at the courthouse (there was a swing-set in the huge yard, and my Grandfather worked inside as the county-clerk). Well, the womens bathroom was in the basement. My friend decided we should \"try a smoke\" while we were hidden down there. (Not many women worked back then, in that town). Well....while she lit up, I decided to make myself comfy and jumped up to sit on the sink and....you guessed it....the whole thing came CRASHING down and water was just gushing from the pipe. YIKES!!!  My grandfather had already given us money for the soda machine (OMG the kind with glass bottles where you had to weave the soda around the curves to get it out!), so he knew we were there, but we just panicked and ran all the way home. Of course when the noon whistle started blowing (he he) and we gathered at the table for lunch, he walked through the door with the most disappointed look on his face. I got a talking-to that would have put Ward Cleaver to shame. Sheesh ...I would have beat me! LOL  I actually have a more embarrassing one, but that whole flood story just brought that one back. Just for fun and distraction, maybe ya'll could share your most embarrassing/not-too-bright childhood mistake?

First off I noticed that with the dry scaly symptom you described the info says those spots are usually found on the limbs if they're something to worry about. The other thing, it didn't say anything about itching. So of course I think we should just automatically assume it's \"nothing\". BUT even if it were to be \"something\", it wouldn't be the most serious type of something and would be easily treatable (according to mayo clinic). I've never had a biopsy, but I know I've had mysterious skin things before...some never solved, but almost always things that turned out to be involved in stress. Most importantly, I think if your doc was leaning towards thinking it was skin cancer he would not be waiting to biopsy. Don't feel silly worrying about your tattoo. Those things are expensive, and usually a lot of thought and part of who you are goes into them. If I had one I know I'd be emotionally attached to it. Next step, get in there and get it biopsied so you can quit worrying. You have enough on your plate and no time for distractions sister! I'll pm you my number just in case you need to talk as well as type. Otherwise, please keep posting, keep us informed and let us be here for you.",

Thanks Binney for all the extra info and advice. I REALLY need it, and you're always so helpful and thorough. Much appreciated! I didn't even know there was a difference between a glove and a gauntlet.  I hate to think she's giving out harmful advice to those who may not have other sources of info. Again, thank you, and have a not so swell day yourself.",

I mean obviously I need to work my way up gradually, and be watchful for signs,  but I assume with the protection the ten pound limit doesn't apply? Is there a limit with the sleeve and glove? Wow...I guess I didn't get all my questions answered even though we spent an hour. lol  Then again, not so sure I trust her to answer them now.",

      "Content": "Miss_Lolli wrote: I had my very first visit today at an LE clinic, located in the hospital where I finished my rads last week. This was a strictly preventative measure and I thought the specialist seemed great. She measured, showed me how to keep my AND scar tissue soft with massage, gave me a lot of info, printed out some position papers for me, and told me about all of the things I could do to protect myself (which I mostly knew thanks to you lovely ladies), thank you!  She just seemed so informed and intelligent. My question is this....I have some 10 to 15 pound items I need to lift about five times a day at my job. I told her I planned to learn to do this lifting with my non-surgery arm. She told me that another option would be to wear a sleeve at work WITHOUT the glove. That just doesn't seem right to me. Haven't I heard somewhere that it is worse to do that than wearing no compression garments?  Just because I don't have symptoms doesn't mean I want to be careless about it.

      "Content": "Feb 29, 2008 01:08AM - edited Feb 29, 2008 01:08AM by Miss_Lolli Thanks again for the input you two! I have lurked quite often on the LE convos, and now that I'm done with chemo and rads I'll have more time to continue my education here and other areas. Currently going crazy deciding what supplements to take. lol Binney, I'm glad you have such an experienced therapist. I go to get fitted for a sleeve and either a gauntlet or glove today (can't quite remember which), but we decided I would call her if I have any symptoms or any questions. Maybe I will think of a tactful way to bring up the sleeve w/o the glove issue and give her a call. It's very nice of you to cut her some slack, considering this is how your LE  started. I am very excited to see what the experts have to say in April. I have read about the exciting study they did at the  UofM regarding the weight-training. But also know that some remain skeptical about long term because they only followed those women for six months. Bobbie, I think you're smart, not paranoid, to listen to what your body is telling you. Yes, do keep us posted. Binney, you are truly a God-send for all the time you spend answering questions here. For all our sakes, I wish they'd discover some kind of miracle, so you didn't have to deal with this crud any longer. My best to you both.",

I have to tell you, I was off work at the time of my chemo, and a single mom to boot...Most insurance plans don't cover this drug because it's newer and not available in generic form. Well the wonderful drug company has a program and will send you Emend free if there is financial need! Just go to the Emend website and look for info on the \"ACT program\". The best thing.....not a ton of paperwork, just a paper for your onc to sign saying how many treatments you need it for, and one for you to sign and date. It was a God send as I would have spent 1400 dollars out of pocket for that one drug alone! Good luck with your tx's and feel free to drop into the October thread should you have any questions. Lotsa smart and empathetic ladies over there.",
