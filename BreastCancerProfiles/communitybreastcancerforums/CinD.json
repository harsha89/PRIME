Please let us know how it goes. I'm sending good thoughts your way! Cindy ",

I have no history of heart disease, no factors that would make a doctor say, \"we need to avoid anything specifically that might cause heart damage for this patient.\" I had two oncologists make this recommendation, one who is a personal friend who specializes in breast oncology, but unfortunately lives 1,000 miles away.  I was lucky and found the side effects with TC fairly easy to tolerate. It stopped my periods, which now at age 50 may or may not return. There was no nausea or vomiting, only some intestinal discomfort at the time of my last treatment. Mostly, I had the general tiredness and weakness, metal mouth, and major hot flashes due to the chemopause. There is also hair loss.  Now at six months since my last chemo, I feel great! Again, I may just be lucky. I know that a few people have a serious allergic-type reaction to Taxotere, and the nurses are always careful to begin running it in slowly. The steroids given the day before, of, and after may help keep that away. They watch you closely when administering Taxotere. There are so many ways to treat breast cancer, and these decisions are so difficult. Sometimes I wish there was only one tried-and-true treatment so we would know we were doing the right thing.",

My oncologist recommended TC x 4.  So far, TC has not shown problems with heart damage. Something interesting about the OncotypeDX test is that it is based on the benefit received from CMF chemo. It seems as if this combination isn't prescribed as often anymore and, from what I read, is a slightly weaker form of chemo. I hope the right decision becomes clear to you soon.",

As of my last appointment with my oncologist just last week, everything seems good. My mammogram was clear and my tumor marker test (CA27-29) was low, in fact, the lowest it has ever been. As far as I know, I am healthy. My doctor is happy and so am I. When I first began having pain in my upper right quadrant, I was scared of liver mets too. I finally went to the doctor who sent me for an ultrasound. I was never so happy as when the tech told me she found some big gallstones. We got to laughing about it because it is rare for a patient to be thrilled when finding out she has a gallbladder problem. A doctor at the imaging center called my family doctor right away to say I needed my gallbladder out quickly. They sent the removed gallbladder to pathology, and there were no other problems found. I'm assuming you had an ultrasound or CT scan? If so, that should detect any other problems besides the gallbladder. I took a copy of my ultrasound report to my oncologist to let him know that area had been scanned and he was happy to see everything was good. I know the gallbladder is in the same area as the liver, but that doesn't mean that having surgery in that general area will cause cancer to move to the liver. I don't think anyone really knows why cancer decides it wants to travel to the liver. Please try to think of your gallbladder problem as only that -- a gallbladder problem. Other parts of the body have problems and we have to realize that it's not always going to be cancer related. I know, easy to say but harder to do. I hope I've calmed your fears some. Good luck with the surgery. ",

It appears as if the surgeon is jumping ahead too quickly.  You still have to wait for the results of the needle biopsy and then, maybe, another biopsy.  Although mastectomy may be needed, it seems a little premature to talk about it before these results are in.  I am discovering with breast cancer that you can only take things one step at a time.  You can't really jump ahead too quickly because everything depends on that last test you took. What helped me after speaking with a surgeon was to speak with an oncologist who specializes in breast cancer.  She put things in perspective for me and even went so far as to say she would recommend trying lumpectomy before mastectomy in my case.  If there is a cancer center in your town, would you consider speaking with an oncologist before rushing into a mastectomy?",
