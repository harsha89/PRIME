About the bleeding nipple, it is best to consult a breast specialist, just to be sure. From what I read, nipple discharge does not always mean a bad thing. This can happen due to sexual activity, manipulation (such as during mammogram), trauma, and some changes in our body. Try to recall any activity that may have caused this. Have you had a mammogram recently? I asked because I also noticed bloody discharge after I went not too long ago. Just relax, go see the doctor immediately and let us know how everything goes. You're in my prayers. God bless!",

Sad so say, he also recommended mastectomy because the affected area is more than 1/3 of my breast. Sigh. Right now, I'm trying to find a plastic surgeon who will work with him. So there's a big chance that we'll go with this bs, who I heard is very technical. Meaning, he's precise and willing to spend more time to cut as little as necessary.

Then at choir practice in church, I asked for prayers that God will bless me and restore my health. My friends cried with me and prayed over me. I cut my hair short. I lost a few pounds. I still need to go shopping though :->  We don't have relatives here but our church family has been my source of strength, plus my wonderful husband, who is God-given.  My doctor recommends mastectomy, which I would not want to go through.

I have multifocal DCIS and skin-sparing mastectomy with lat flap is the recommendation. I talked to 2 bs, and 3 ps because I needed to make sure. They have the same recommendations. I chose the ps who we felt was the most competent, compassionate and caring. Since I will be under his care for a long time, I wanted to be certain that we're comfortable with him.

My PET scan is clear, meaning no other organs are affected. The MRI will also help confirm other suspicious tumors. Make sure you get copies of all the test results.

So, I thought i'd share my experience this way---  Day 1 - first TC of 4 rounds, through IV (no port) for 2.5 hours Night 1 - Major headache Day 2 - Neulasta shot on my stomach (no pain!) instead of arm Night 2 - Minor headache, fatigue Day 3 - No problems Day 4 - Fatigue, stayed home Day 5 - Stiff neck and throat, gigantic headache, puffy face Day 6-7 - Bones started to hurt bad; took 2 hydrocodone every 6 hours (helped a lot!), but made me nauseous, so I took anti-nausea pill -- asked doc/nurse to make sure it's ok Day 8 - bloodwork showed good blood stats, but very very high white blood count!!! Doc will reduce Neulasta dose next time, since I don't need that much. This will reduce the bone pains. Each day, I drank 8-10 glasses of fluids, lots of fruits and veggies, boost drinks, and vitamin supplements -- which helped my immune system. I stopped taking stool softener (Senna) on Day 4 because I was having cramps. I've used Miracle Fiber (powder) from VitaminShoppe which is more gentle. I'm ready for my next treatment. Just want this over with, so we can move on. Ladies, we will survive this!!! God bless, Aurora",

I noticed though, that I didn't have cramps like I used to. It was more free flowing. About the tumor in your pelvis, what doctor would you see for that? Hopefully the chemo will shrink that thing, and you won't have to deal with that later. Krista, great to hear you're feeling better! You might want to consider wearing a mask while unpacking. The dust/dustmites can cause irritation. The last thing you'd like to have is allergies and infection. Nolana/Grannie/Candy, sometimes deep breathing helps me go to sleep. There are nights when I lay in bed wide awake, listening to my hubby and 2 dogs snore. Drives me nuts! So I'd breathe in, hold it, exhale - repeat until completely relaxed. Or I'll warm up half cup of milk (45 sec in microwave), drink it with crackers and go back to sleep. Works all the time for me.  Gnyt ladies... God bless us all, Aurora",

Which means to me, what they did to you is clearly a violation of that Act. That's discrimination!!! Artsee, did you know there is a contest sponsored by a breast cancer organization (can't remember), and you can use any medium. Topic is breast cancer. I have an idea in mind, but not sure how to draw it. Prize is $10k to the organization of your choice and tickets for 2 to NY for the awarding. I just thought I'd mention it because it's something you might want to do. Are you in US or Germany? Can I buy one of your artwork (not the expensive ones)? Just for souvenir hehe. You got a fans club going here. I hear you, Laura. I just want to get my normal life back again!!! GuitarGirl, I play the guitar too!!! I have an old acoustic guitar that I got from a pawnshop (has a good sound), and I got sucked in by the infomercial a couple years ago, and bought one of Esteban's blue guitars hehe. Silly me!!!

My skin is still a problem though. It will itch, I'll rub, then I'll get red bumps. Lotion helps, but it is very annoying. The palm of my hand also itches like crazy. Susan -- I can definitely relate to tummy problems. As you know, I've been eating like a champ during chemo, so consti is never an issue for me hehe. It's the other way around. I have no fear when it comes to food -- I'll eat anything. And doctor said I'm making my tummy work too hard. Artsee -- Amen to positive attitude!!! That, and of course my faith in the Lord is what got me through this journey. When I wake up every morning I lift up my health to God and give Him thanks. It helps me get through the day.

Blah-blah-blah, you know what I mean. Boy, am I feeling the blues today! Snap out of it, Aurora!!! I'll be checking in, and will probably be in the American Idol and Hormone Treatment threads. I will pm you all my cell number. If you ever need a prayer, word of cheer, jokes, anything, I'm just a phone call away . I truly appreciate you all.  There's a verse I'd like to share - Jeremiah 29:11 \"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.\" God bless, Aurora",

Hydrate yourself beginning the day before chemo. Lots of liquids. And bring mittens to keep your hands warm, a favorite blanket and maybe a travel pillow. Picked up a nice wig today, and got some freebies from the Cancer Resource Center at the hospital. They gave me a free wig, scarf, turban, etc. They also give out surgibras for free. So if you don't feel like spending (they can be pricey), make sure you ask your breast surgeon where to get them. The only part that wasn't too good -- I was on my period!!! Really suxx. I also had my period on the day of my surgery. But other than that, everything's ok. Praying for quick recovery for all. Stay healthy dear friends! God bless, Aurora    ",

That helped with my neck soreness and back pains. Doctor said it's ok, and the nurse said it's easier on the liver. You might want to ask your doctor if that will work better for your pains. Laurel, do you know why you're taking 7 shots (neupogen) instead of just one (neulasta)? I think I'll pass out with 7 shots. You're so brave! Bridget, scarves are cool. You'll look wonderful with your new style!!! Check out www.tlcdirect.org  Krista, Donna, how are you ladies doing? Grannie, hang in there. I like your quote.

I went to see my bs today for followup, and she was so surprised that I can stretch/move my arm 100%. I had 8 lymph nodes removed, and she didn't expect that I'd be able to move it freely so soon. Also, the stitches on my back are healing wonderfully, and my expander is symmetrical with my good breast. So I'm happy! I'm so thankful that my appetite is still good, so I eat as much as I can. I eat small portions, but it makes me hungry so easily, so I'm in the pantry all the time. I can't get anything done. Arrgh. Oh, my scalp was so sensitive today. Ouch. Anybody had that feeling?  Rachel, I also got free scarves, wig, etc from ACS. They're cute, and don't cost a thing hehe. That's a great resource. I would really like to volunteer in those places when I'm fully recovered. Can't wait! Patricia, i enjoyed your list. There are really a lot of things to be thankful for.

Artsee, I'll find it tomorrow and will let you know. I thought we brought the brochures home...aargh, chemo brain!!! Rose, my hubby gave me a crew cut (1\") before my hair started to fall in clumps. I really didn't want to clog the shower drains, plus I knew it will be depressing to see them all go.

Ran a bunch of errands today, and started working on our taxes - and boy, I felt queazzzyyy!!! Not sure if the cause was TC or the Taxes we owe! Ouch! It was nice in Dallas today in the 70s, sunny and a little breezy, but we may have frost on Monday. We got the twisters in certain parts of Dallas and Fort Worth on Thursday. Tornado sirens at 3:45 am. It was crazy! We had some minor damages, but not that bad. Thank God we're ok. Patty and Grannie, hope you're both feeling better. Do some shopping, it always helps!!! I had a couple days after my 3rd TC when I felt low. Sunday at church while singing with the choir, I couldn't stop crying. Mostly from joy that the homestretch is within reach. I kept looking forward and seeing that light. I pray that your paths are brighter. Just remember each day is one step closer to our goal. I'll be cheering you on!!! Pam, you've got a great sense of humor!!! I can just imagine the reaction from your onc and nurses. Artsee, yey on the laptop!!! Now you have no more excuses to be off-line hehe. Btw, anybody going to the Relay for Life in your areas? I'm definitely signing up!!! Good night and sleep well. As always, I'll be praying that the days ahead are better and brighter for all us. Love and blessings, Aurora",

Now, because of all the fluids, I have to get up sometimes 3x. And it's been so hard to get back to sleep. So I'd pop a sleepmd or ambien, but had to stop taking them for fear of drug dependence or overdose (remember that young actor who just died?). So far, all side effects are gone and I'm sleeping better. My next chemo is on Feb 28, and I'm sooo ready! My doctor said it should be easier than the first one. But yet I've heard from others that it is cumulative. We'll see how this will go. Welp, I better get back to work :-> Have a wonderful afternoon!!! God bless, Aurora",

Wow, amazing how little things like that made a difference in my moods hehe. I wore it to church Sunday am -- looked great! We have a concert that evening so I was planning on wearing it again. I don't know what happened - it shrank!!! I put it on and I looked like a tadpole. Shoooot!!! Guess I gotta go shopping again hehe. Can't wait to get out of this bloatedness. Patty, I'll definitely tear up the tennis court with my moves!!! NOT! The only tennis I play is the WII game . Donna, I felt that way too. I kept telling my hubby - Sorry and thank you. Our poor hubbies have to deal with pretty much everything that we're going through, and then some. God bless their hearts. Evie, hope everything the rads go smoothly for you. I've heard about tattoos/earrings needed for rads? Sounds like a cult to me hehe. Just kiddin' :-> Dj, pretty please, show us the quilt when it's done!!! I wanna see!!! How's everyone else doing today? God bless, Aurora",

I really pray it stays this way -- this is almost a miracle. Kim, looks like you've been busy hehe. Yep, cramping on lower back is most likely caused by neulasta. Remember to take your pain pills before it gets unbearable. Donna, i'm not sure either :-> But one thing for sure, I cannot handle both. Well, today another church friend brought us chicken pot pie with ceasar salad. Our fridge is full :-> I love this part of the chemo treatment hehe. We get spoiled!

Crazypam, good for you taking the week off, but sorry that your taste buds are not working too well. That suxx. You know I've never had any problems eating or drinking during chemo. From where I came from (Pluto hehe), we eat a lot of weird stuff, like bittermellon, etc., so my tongue is probably numb to normal food. As you can see from this thread, all I talk about is food and pigging out. The doctor said weight gain is a side effect too :->. Oh well, I'm just glad to hear that you're feeling better today. Artsee, my hope is in the Lord. He has helped me get through this, and I know He will do the same for you.  Pls let us know how your treatment goes. Hopefully, you've been drinking enough fluids today. Rest well :-> Feb Fighters, may we all sleep good tonight, and may we all wake up tomorrow feeling gooood!!! God bless, Aurora ",

Hem it, fold into a triangle, tie the 2 ends over the pointed side of triangle, then pouff it a little at the back/top so it's not too flat. I love the rectangular too, because you can make it long enough to hang on your back, or over one shoulder. Wear them just a little above the eyebrows for drama :-> Chris, I've also cut hubby's old tee-shirts into bandanas. They're bigger so you can make 2 pieces from each shirt. They're so soft, I use them at home, to bed, under straw hat while gardening. Bridget, I think you should switch back and forth depending on the temp - surprise them with your new styles!!! Remember the make-up too. A little color does make a lot of difference. I noticed that my eyes always look tired, and face color just looks blah - so I make sure I put makeup on.  Have fun ladies!!!!",

I managed to go to the gym yesterday and I was wiped out after Laurel, hope you get the mouth sores cleared. I bit my lip the other night, and I stuck half an orajel to the sore overnight. Gone when I woke up. Donna, wow, you have good coverage! $15 is a lot better than what I'm paying for, and I'm only getting half dose! Artsee, just want to let you know I appreciate you!!!!

Anyone having the same problem? Night ladies! I'll be praying for you tonight. God bless,  Aurora",

I had the latissimus dorsi flap with expanders/implants because it has the quickest recovery time, from what I've heard and read. Ps said, I didn't have enough tummy fat to work with anyway - so for my size/build, lat flap was the way to go. I was back in the gym on my 3rd-4th week. You play tennis right? I have heard women who went back to tennis without problems. But again, that varies by individual. I talked to 3 ps before deciding, and the night before surg I still wasn't sure hehe. But I did it, and very happy with the results.",

This is where you put your arms straight out at chest level, your feet about 12-inches apart, then you make a circle infront you with your arms, while the hips sway. Are you feeling it? It's official, I am D-O-N-E!!!! I think I'm going to consider myself an alumnus of this thread, which means I will keep in touch and hopefully we'll get a reunion in person someday. Thank you all for the congrats!!!! I don't think I would never have made it without you guys. This is the only graduation where cheating is allowed hehe. I copy and cheat from your comments, and it's ok. I love it! Chris, the nerves went away when I got there. BP 115/62, Heartbeat 80, blood counts were low, but good enough for the chemo. They had to give me a rbc boost, because my count was .6 below. Got my neulasta today and gave my nurse a candle holder that says \"To A Wonderful Nurse\". We just about cried as we hugged :-<  I'll meet with the onc after 3 weeks to talk about the hormone treatment, which he says, will be easy . Hmm, guess I'll find out. Love you guys, and I always pray that you'll get through this with as little discomfort as possible and that we never have to go through this again, EVERRR!!! God bless us all, Aurora",
