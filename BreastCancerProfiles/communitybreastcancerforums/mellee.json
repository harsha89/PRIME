Juven is widely used in wound centers for people who are having trouble healing, and it is also used for radiation wounds. Unfortunately, it's a little pricey (insurance doesn't usually cover it, although Medicare sometimes does). You take it twice a day. I like the Orange flavor best. I mix it with water and it tastes kind of like Tang. You can buy it on Amazon. Its main ingredients are a blend of amino acids (glutamine, arginine, and CaHMB) that promote and support the formation of new tissue and collagen. It was also recently reformulated to include zinc, vitamin C, and collagen protein\u2014all of which also support wound healing. I highly recommend it! Here is more info from the manufacturer: https://abbottnutrition.com/juven",

That doesn't sound right to me that you should bruise as lymphatic massage is extremely gentle. But maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're getting treated for. I'm hoping you feel okay today. My LE therapist told me that both lymphedema and cording must be treated very delicately, as they are more like a nerve problem than a muscle problem. Go too rough, and the inflammation can get worse. The lymphatic massage itself should be relaxing (I always get sleepy) and the stretching for the cording should only go until you feel discomfort (don't try to push past the pain).",

I've read some women on these boards talking about developing cording after breast surgery even without sentinel biopsy, so I think it is possible to get it on the side where you didn't have lymph nodes removed. If it feels like a guitar string, that sounds like cording to me. I felt severe tightness and pain before I could see the cords, so if you weren't already experiencing that, I bet the aggressive manipulation did set it off. A friend of mine who is a physical therapist really warned me to be gentle with cording. She said don't push yourself too much with stretches and back off when it hurts. Apparently, cording is related to inflammation. It's not like muscle tightness or something that you just power through. The PT should be treating it like they treat a nerve problem, not a muscle problem. Supposedly, many cases of cording spontaneously resolve, and I know that my Frankenarm (as I not-so-affectionately call it) has gotten a lot better pretty much on it's own (I've only been to 1 PT session due to the holidays & other wound complications). And my cording, pain, and range of motion was REALLY bad. I couldn't even straighten my arm for over a month. And I seriously considered throwing a party when I could actually shave my underarm on that side. So even if it's bad now, it can get better. I think the key is to give your body a rest and allow the inflammation to heal.",

At 3 weeks post-op you could clearly see the cords in my armpit, but the cord running down my arm was not as obvious. By 4 weeks, the cord on my arm was much bigger and easy to see. But for whatever reason, the cording started getting better on its own after that point. By 4.5 weeks, the cords were less prominent, I had much greater range of motion, and less pain. I still went to the physical therapist in post-op week 5. She did lymphatic massage and then worked on the cords. Like others have said, I heard a pop as the cord in my elbow area released. It didn't hurt and I experienced an immediate increase in range of motion. So feeling positive about resolving all the cording issues! However, I am worried about lymphedema. My right arm is 2 cm larger than the left. I'm hoping this could still be residual swelling from surgery.",

She does blood work to check my calcium levels (which can be abnormal if you get bone mets), but doesn't think that testing for tumor markers is reliable. Wondering what others are doing to screen. Is there anything I should be asking for? Also, there's nothing being done to screen for local recurrence (aside from breast exams), even though that is my biggest risk in the near-term. My oncologist doesn't recommend mammograms (even though I had nipple-sparing MX so there is a small amount of tissue left), and I don't think insurance will cover MRI screening unless I have problematic symptoms. So my question is: in the event of a local recurrence, how are we supposed to catch it early? I asked about a recurrence to the chest wall, and the possibility that this could develop under my implants, and my oncologist said that eventually, such a recurrence would get big enough that you would be able to tell it was there even under the implant. Obviously, that means you wouldn't catch it when it was small, so that doesn't seem like a good solution. Does anyone here get annual MRIs or any other types of scans to check for local recurrence?

It's funny, though, because even though sleepiness is only listed as an uncommon side effect, when I called my RO to ask about it, they were like, \"Oh yeah, lots of women feel horrible on it! They're totally exhausted, body aches...\" I kind of feel like that would be good info to have up front! Santabarbarian - do you notice any side effects at all?",

When my \"Frankenarm\" came back online, I definitely had the tingling you describe, along with some aching and a feeling like my upper arm was tired no matter how I rested it. I'm now 3 months out from surgery and it's much better. No more tingling and much less aching. There's still numbness, but it's less. SpecialK, has all you numbness gone away?",

But if you get a low-risk result back from Mammaprint, I would be pretty confident in foregoing chemo. If you come back as low-risk on Mammaprint, you can also infer that you are almost certainly Luminal A (this according to the Mammaprint physician I talked to today), which has a good prognosis and is not very responsive to chemo. As to the your oncologist who doesn't believe in the Mammaprint, you can point him to The MINDACT trial results recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. It validates the use of Mammaprint to guide early-stage breast cancer treatment decisions. The first two links summarize the results, and the last link is the actual study: http://www.ascopost.com/issues/november-25-2016/an... http://www.agendia.com/new-england-journal-of-medi... http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602253 My oncologist believes the Mammaprint is superior to the Oncotype DX, and it certainly tests many more biomarkers (70 as opposed to 16). On a side note, your insurance is unlikely to pay for another genomic test, but the max that a patient will be billed is $500. Also, Agendia (the company that does Mammaprint) will waive fees in cases of financial hardship.",
