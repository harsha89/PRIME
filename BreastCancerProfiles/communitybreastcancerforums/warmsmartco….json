It has done wonders on the really stubborn adhesions (I had one on my leg that was 13\" by 4\"). I found a practitioner at GrastonTechnique.com. It was covered by insurance and my Graston practitioner is a chiropractor. She works on scar adhesions (and boy, do I have alot of them from a failed TUG flap surgery), and it quickly softened the scars AND resolved my lymphedema. I am meeting with my plastic surgeon tomorrow to ask him if we can combine my scar revision surgery on my legs with graston technique post op to ensure I don't get them back again. Supposedly once the scar tissue is broken down it is reabsorbed by the body and does not reform the adhesion. You probably already know that most adhesions that are removed surgically quickly reform, and I've been struggling on how to get rid of all my adhesions without surgery. One thing I noticed which is amazing, is that I've been doing Graston on my breasts the last three weeks. I am only doing Graston in the areas where there are adhesions. Anyway, the scars when I've been doing Graston have totally faded, and the areas where I didn't do Graston are still red. Weird huh? I'll tell you how it goes tomorrow with the PS.Â ",
