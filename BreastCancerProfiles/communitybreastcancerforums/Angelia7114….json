She said it could be hormones or neuropathy, she has never heard of anyone having this burning only in one breast. Even thought possibly shingles or it was only in my head. Once she Googled it said she understands it can happen but will wait for my mammogram results and probably put me on Gabapentin. It is driving me crazy! I literally feel like a hot water filled balloon is gushing inside my right breast most of the day. Any suggestions as to what could help it go away??",

She tried gabapentin but for some reason all it did was make me hypoglycemic every morning and took away my appetite completely. It did not affect the burning feeling. So onto whatever they want to try next!",

Extremely busy and stressed, husband out of work going on 3 years now and I am in graduate school, working full time, and have 3 kids ages 10-17 with very busy schedules and 1 who is in college.  Just had a mammogram last Monday due to my symptoms and they said it takes 2-4 weeks to have it read.  Went to my dr with complaint of increasing fatigue and memory issues, swollen lymph nodes under right arm, shooting pain in right breast, and a sensation between the let down reflex or someone pouring hot water inside my right breast. No outward changes except for some small red bumps that look like bug bites but will not go away. Dr thinks could be hormonal,  hyst 11 years ago, both ovaries removed 2 years ago,  was on oral then implanted hormones until 1 year ago and nothing since then. Occasional hot flashes are my only menopausal symptom.  No history of breast cancer in my family, late menarche at 15, breastfed all 4 kids for at least 1 year each, slightly overweight, and do not feel I am at high risk for breast cancer but still cannot help but worry!

I was on bioidentical hormones for 6 months starting last july and had last ones implanted almost a year ago. Has anyone experienced the burning or milk let down reflex feeling after taking bhrt? 2. When I get upset or emotional I notice the burning sensation is much stronger or more painful. Any similar experiences? Just worried that I might have some kind of infection that is being overlooked because my fnp is not well versed in gyn issues, thinking I should schedule with the ob gyn that removed my ovaries & uterus if not any better by Christmas.",
