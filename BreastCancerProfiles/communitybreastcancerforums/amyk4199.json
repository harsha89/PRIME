I'm trying not to get ahead of myself - but does it really matter - pre/cancer or cancer  - aren't they eventually going to say mastectomy anyway?  again - 2nd time / in 3 years under age 40...  i'm just trying to get prepared - I know docs cant say - but really - i feel that's what they will tell me regardless of \"surgical biopsy\"  anybody have thoughts?
