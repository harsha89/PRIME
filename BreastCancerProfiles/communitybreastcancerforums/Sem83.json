I have a lot to prepare for my son's birthday party so that definitely is keeping me busy. But of course I'm still catching myself analyzing every little \"change\" I feel or I should say I think I feel. My initial pain is literally almost gone now that I stopped lifting weights and now I feel this pressure right above my breast. It feels like it's sore but no pain. I'm just glad tomorrow is the day even though I'm nervous. I will update as soon as I'm done with my appointment. Thank you again!",

I basically stopped lifting weights starting this past Tuesday and I'm trying to only use my right arm for anything that I need to pick up or stretch. And it's interesting that i have not felt the pain Tuesday and Wednesday.",

The pain has slowed down a lot so I was thinking to just wait a couple of days and see if the pain comes back. And then schedule an appointment with my primary doctor and see what she suggests. The MRI part I think the breast clinic where I was at today has to order the referral. That's what my doctor said. I am being seen at a military hospital so not sure how different it is from other civilian clinics",

When I first got there the lady at the front desk informed that the radiologist wanted to have a mammogram done with the scheduled ultrasound. First they did the mammogram and then had me in the waiting area to wait for the ultrasound. About 30 min later the lady from mammogram comes back and says the radiologist wants more pictures. I'm not going to lie but I got really scared at that point. So went ahead and did more imaging. I asked her why he wanted more imaging and then she pointed at one of the images and pointed to an area. She said he wanted to check that area. Next was the ultrasound. The ultrasound tech informed me that the radiologist wanted to do the ultrasound himself. That was different. At that point I was pretty sure something is wrong. He then came in and said that the mammogram was ok. And that he will do the ultrasound on the area that is painful. He checked and even went on the area that I was feeling sore. And the only thing that was visible was the same cyst from last time-same size 3mm! So he doesn't think it is the tiny cyst that's causing the pain. He says it could be my dense tissue?! And that I could check with my doctor to see if the pain is coming from a muscle or my shoulder?! I do feel relieved that he didn't find no abnormalities. But still not sure what to think of it.",
