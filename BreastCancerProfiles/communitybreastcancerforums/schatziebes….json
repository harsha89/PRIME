Anyway, went back Thursday for mammos and then they did an ultrasound.  Received call Friday from my doctor saying I will have to have a biopsy and I expect a call Monday from my surgeon to get this scheduled. I am sure that you can imagine where my mind has been. Everyone's saying \"don't worry you are fine\" but I can't help but think about all of the women who were told that by heir families only to find out the everything is not fine. *sigh*.  I will be happy when this is over and I have my answer.  I recently had major surgery to remove a portion of my colon (not cancerous, thank God) and was thinking that the worst was behind me, and now this.  Seriously??? You will be in my thoughts and prayers as you wait for your results and also, now, hoping that your sweet dog will be okay. I have a dog and I know that pets are important family members just like the human ones are.  Hang in there, girl.",
