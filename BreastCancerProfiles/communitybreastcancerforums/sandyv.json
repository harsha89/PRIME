I know this may not help but I am just trying to say that apparently bone scans are not always right in some situations you may need to move up to a pet scan they are more sensitive  or were in my case. They did call my bone cancer innumerable microscopic lesions which apparently meant that I have them everywhere but are very small largest was 8mm but still all combined enough to cause severe back and bone pain. So if your not 100% convinced of your bone scan results ask for pet scan. ",

Now I trust no Dr and the new guidelines are totally ridiculous in my opinion. now I know I should have had an ultrasound after 1st mamo. When I was trying to find about back pain my tumor markers were elevated and never had been in all those years so I wnt to 2 different oncos although one ordered  PET SCAN THAT WAS PROMTLY DENIED BY MY INSURANCE both told me not to worry about them .I was then sent to rhuematolgist and cardiologist. My bone mets was an incidental finding fom a ct a pulmonary dr who thought back pain might be due to lungs. sorrr for the rambling answer to your simple question.",

NO DR. should judge why they are there to treat. If patients decide not to follow a treatment plan should the Dr refuse to treat and if so how do they really know which patients were the ones that that smoke drink eat poorly etc. Sometimes people get terminal illnesses without any reason. Just my opinion. How many of us know someone who never smoked or drank alcohol but died because of lung cancer or liver failure and how many of us know people that do both to excess and live a long and healthy life till old age gets them?",

So if you have a problem with Zometa try Xgeva and as someone else said it is just a shot but does the same thing as Zometa as far as I know.  Good luck cape Town",

If you are that upset you can surely get an appointment with some Dr sooner than 30 days.Good luck hope it turns out to be nothing as serious as you must be thinking. Of course your insurance co. will ask for records from all your DR's to see if it is pre existing that is always a constant problem before they pay us espesially for any newly insured patient.",
