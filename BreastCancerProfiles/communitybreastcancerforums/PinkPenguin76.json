Instantly they diagnosed it as Birads II, which I've read online is the standard instant diagnosis when mass is intramammary node (and has fat still). Mine is 3cm from nipple in lower outer quadrant around 8 o'clock. They are clearly not pushing biopsy, because their standard protocol claims it's benign - no matter what. HOWEVER, I am not a \"standard\" person and do not like being so easily dismissed LOL (Haha it makes me think of the breath-mint commercial with the girl and the unicorn)... Therefore, I research and ask questions... In my research, I tend to NOT read standard articles everyone copies and pastes to their websites, rather I look for actual doctor reports and medical reports written by doctors/pathologists regarding STUDIES done. In the information I found, it said that of all the intramammary nodes found (that were at first diagnosed as the average, benign, Birads II), upon actual biopsy for study, 23% of those intramammary nodes proved to be positive/malignant... In their study of over 60 people that has \"benign\" intramammary node, 20 of them were actually malignant! 23% is not so easily dismissable, if you ask me... It's not like reading malignancy was found in only 1-5%. I pushed my doctor asking for biopsy anyway, regardless of standard Birad II being the diagnosis... And while my doctor didn't say ok, he did put in referral for MRI of both breasts. So, at least I'm not being completely dismissed at this point (perhaps he knows my insurance requires all imaging testing possible before actual biopsy? Who knows?). I am currently waiting for my period to schedule that appt, because I guess they have to schedule it so many days after you start your period... So... Why I am here posting this: has anyone experienced being told their intramammary node was Birads II after mammogram/ultrasound, only to find out later it was actually malignant??? With 23% being such a high number, I think it's an important issue that SHOULD BE discussed more, to bring about awareness. Thank you for any feedback/time! <3 Log in to post a reply",
