But my worries started quite a while ago. I'd say 2 years ago both my breasts started itching, the undersides of them. Then the itching moved to both nipples, then to just one nipple. That right nipple was the same breast I just had biopsied. I saw a dermatologist who of course took one minute to look at it and say, \" Not Paget's\" and she gave me a steroid cream. My only symptoms are/were moderate itching and a slightly pinker hue to that nipple compared to the left one. If I fiddle with it it gets more inflamed looking. Also, the right nipple has a slightly more pronounced indent in the middle than the left one, and sometimes looks a tiny bit flatter than the left one. Right now it only itches if I touch it. Otherwise it just tingles on and off. So the cream worked right away. No more itching or irritation. That was 3 months ago. I thought the problem was gone for good and so didn't think to mention it to the radiologist the first time I saw him. I just had a mammogram and ultrasound to check on some lumps my gyno found, and I had them biopsied. But I've been telling nurses and doctors about my Paget's concern and no one is doing anything. The nurse told me the radiologist was unconcerned and would have referred me out had he thought I had Paget's.Â  After the imaging and biopsy my nipple started to flare up again. The breast that was biopsied is very sensitive and itchy right now so I guess it makes sense the nipple is too but I'm calling my gyno tomorrow to see if I can see her ASAP. Having dense breasts means a mass related to Paget's might not have been found, and of course only a biopsy can confirm Paget's. My question to you experienced ladies is, should I demand an MRI and punch biopsy? Or just see the dermatologist first for a biopsy and move from there? See a breast specialist who may be able to do it all at once? I live in a city where there's a large teaching hospital so even though Paget's is rare, I should be able to find someone with knowledge about it. Thanks for reading. Log in to post a reply",
