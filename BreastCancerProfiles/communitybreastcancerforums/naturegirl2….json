If your calcium is too low, they cannot give you the Xgeva shot. Well y'all, good news! I had my 7th monthly Xgeva shot yesterday. My oncol. has changed the time frame for me in getting Xgeva to every other month! Yay!!! And I will continue to see my oncol. every other month as well. I asked him why cutting back Xgeva to every other month and he said since I am stable and everything looks good at this point, getting an Xgeva shot every month may bring on complications I do not need.",

I suffered with this pain for one year prior to learning what it was. By November of 2014, I began blowing my nose with a horrific smell coming out.  After that, with blood/mucus.  When I saw my oncologist, he said I had a sinus infection.  WRONG.  He put me on a regimen of antibiotics and after one week, it did not improve.  I then went to my oral surgeon once again. Turns out, my oral surgeon had to remove part of rotting, dead bone in the roof of my mouth under my torus pallatisis (ph).  He said had I waited a little longer, I would have had an infection of my entire face which would also have gone to my brain.  He said he was 99.9 percent sure it was due to taking Xgeva shots.  What a terrible experience.  So heads up y'all.  And, no more Xgeva shots for me.",

I'm glad to hear things are improving for you on your supplement and herbal regimen. I had been taking three 500 mil. high potency vitamin Cs daily but decided to cut back to two and rather than take the two together, take one in the morning and the other in the evening.I also have nodules etc. in my lungs so I thought the Vit C would help that. I was also taking Calcium/vit D vitamins for which I am going to cut back on as well. I want to try to protect my liver and if it has to absorb the Megace(is what my oncol has me on at this time) then that is what my liver has to contend with. Luckily, I do not take pain relievers daily, but every now and then, I take an ibuprofen(400 mil) but I think that may have to change as well. Will talk to my oncol. on that. Yes, I want to revamp what I'm putting in my mouth, both in supplements and in food with the idea of helping my liver. Now I did read recently that cappage and broccoli can be hard on the liver. and, not to drink caffeine or soft drinks and of course stay away from alcohol. I may look into the milk thistle thing, is it a liquid? I'll ask my oncol. as well about that. Thanks zarovka JFL, thanks for your information as well. I too used to take a multi-vit but quit that many years ago. Yes, one has to think twice and now consider their liver before she swallows food and/or vitimins. Thanks ShetlandPony on your input too. I incorporated a baby aspirin in my regimen daily as the Megace, or a potential side effect in taking Megace is blood clotting. I asked my oncol. first and he said he thought that was a good idea for me. MsTee, thanks for your input. That is great the mets are not showing on your scans due to a trial you were on! Guess you are having lots of pain since you use fentanyl patch? Others, please join in and tell us what you eat and what you stay away from since you have liver mets, as well as supplements, taking or discontinuing use. Thanks everyone!",

I took Xgeva shots with my first shot May 2013, then monthly thru November 2013. Then again getting Xgeva shots in January 2014, March, 2014, and May 2014. I had ONJ of the roof of my mouth in November of 2014. I would like to know if I am still at risk for ONJ if I get a moler pulled soon. I want to make an appt. with my dentist for tomorrow, and also have Faslodex shots scheduled for this Thursday. Any help for information would be greatly appreciated asap.

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2016 09:35AM - edited Jun 30, 2016 09:40AM by naturegirl2 Thanks GatorGal! I'm glad you are feeling better. I haven't heard of Ixempra before and, in combination with Megace but hope it does the trick for you for a long, long, time. As you know, that is what I am now on as of three weeks ago(Megace only), prior to this last cat scan due to my oncol. going on vacation, He did the cart before the horse thing, as he wanted me on something since he dismissed Ibrance/Letrozole three weeks ago and scheduled the cat scans after I began taking Megace. It is some kind of shock to say the least with this liver diagnosis. Last cat scan was two months ago, the day before my mom passed on, and the news was not good, but, nothing near this bad news on the latest cat scan. I am scared to death with many lesions and small new nodules in my liver. I also have additional lesions on left 2nd and 4th ribs, vertebral bodies T5, T12,L2,L3, and the right iliac bone. I'm so disgusted. Hi babs! Thanks for the warm welcome! Sorry the clinical trial did not work for you but Xeloda sounds like it really is doing well for you. My oncol. did not mention which chemo drug next, but I have a hunch it will be Xeloda. I made it loud and clear to him I did not want to be on anything for which I would loose my hair. Sorry y'all, I do draw the line somewhere. No one knows about my stage 4 diagnosis and that would certainly be a dead giveaway, hair loss, and besides, I don't want to loose my hair. It's enough I lost one breast back in 2007 and could not have reconstruction due to whole radiation I received back in 1991. Thanks holinone. Hi artist, we meet again! Yes, a terrible gut blow, I just don't think I'll be receiving any more 'good' cat scans as I feel the cancer will go from here to there each time from now on. I probably have it in my brain as well and I will NOT have an MRI for that, went thru that once before and cannot tolerate that. It's just so depressing for me right now. Sorry I'm venting on everyone but I do really appreciate everyone's help. Just a real bummer. Is anyone following a certain diet with these liver mets? And I'm sure and hint of alcohol is out right? Anyone taking any particular supplements for bc related liver mets? Thanks everyone! One thing good is the cat scan said my liver is normal in size, and, according to the latest blood work, my liver blood work showed normal.",

I'd like to know how long you have had liver mets from BC, which drug/drugs are you taking due to liver mets, if they are helping and how long, thus far, have they helped, and, if you have lost your hair due to meds from liver mets. Sorry for all the questions but this is the place to ask. Thanking y'all in advance.",

If so, how did they determine Letrozole quit working? Cat scans, cancer antigen tests? Sorry for all the questions. Where had your cancer spread to? I did a search here on 'biotin' and read a small bit. I went out today and bought biotin (500 mcg) tablets as well as biotin shampoo and conditioner from Whole Foods Grocery. Hopefully, this may help. With me, my hair strands started soon after taking Letrozole but wasn't very much, actually, just recently the hair loss shown from my brush/andor comb has considerably increased, and I'm thinking from the combination of Letrozole and Xgeva shots that I started 6 months ago. Letrozole usesage(ph) began 11 months ago. Urrrrgh",

I have an afternoon appt. with my dentist today to see which tooth/teeth are affected by a possible fracture. It least I will know what the problem is. In the meantime, I do have an appt. with my oncologist tomorrow before I get my Faslodex shots which are also scheduled for tomorrow. It has been one year and 3 months since my last Xgeva shot. It would be so much easier & cheaper to just have it pulled rather than going thru a possible root canal and crown. We'll see. I'm sure hoping for the best. I was wanting to know what my risks would be for ONJ since it has been well over one year since I had my last Xgeva shot.",

Bestbirdand sandilee, I'm really not sure why my oncol. did not put me on Faslodex after Letrozole has failed.  I'm sure he knows what he is doing.  I'm thinking he wants to nip this thing in the bud and pulling out the 'big guns'. :) sunny210, wow, Aromasin keeping you NED for five years, that is great!  Interesting that your oncol. put you on Afinitor/Letrozole combo.   You said TMs, do you mean cancer antigen tests levels?",
