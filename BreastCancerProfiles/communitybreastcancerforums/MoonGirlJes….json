For me on DD AC, prior to chemo (about 5 days out) a super clean diet\u2014 Fruit, veg, seeds, nuts, water, water, and more water. Whole wheat toast with avo seemed to hold me in the morning. I don't do dairy or meat. But some do. First day, 1100 cal. then the remaining days up to chemo 800 cal. I hydrate myself like I never have before. Then after chemo, same low cal through the rough days (another 3 days depending on SE) then you should feel great on the other side. Or 3 days of just water prior to chemo. If you don't want to fast a week. Amazon has a documentary that's free with Prime. The beginning is rough but the end gets into the science of fasting. Our normal cells stop dividing when they are stressed (fasting) and go into protection mode. Suspended animation, if you will. Our mutated CA cells don't have the ability to protect themselves and keep on dividing. What's chemo target? Dividing cells. So when our healthy cells are fasting (and protected) the chemo flys right on by to the mutated cells that are dividing. Our healthy cells are spared. Why do people not eat when their sick? It's an evolutionary protection for the body. Food is not necessarily our friend under times of stress. Additionally, some CA cells just die off with fasting. So even without treatment, fasting itself kills off mutated cells. My oncologist and NP just shake their heads at me\u2014 they think it's junk science. I don't care. I'm the one dry heaving at the kitchen sink. Crying on the bathroom floor feeling like I'm being crushed. If they went through what I did. They might rethink their opinion on it. However, I'm a pain in the ass. I have a BS in molecular biology and I am a RN by trade. I understand cell biology and doctors. Many onc will just tell you eat what you want during chemo. Keep the calories coming in. Meh. That methodology has not worked for me. Jess",

Our healthy cells go into self protection mode and the malignant cells (don\u2019t have that ability) are left exposed to die when the chemo hits. With weekly Taxol I have to modify it a bit and I go low cal Friday and Saturday (less than 800 kcal/day) with lots of hydration. Sunday a virtual fast with lots of hydration. Monday chemo, with lots of hydration and no food until Monday night. But low cal then also. Low cal with hydration Tuesday. Wednesday I\u2019m virtually SE free. I eat and drink what I please Wednesday and Thursday and start all over with low cal Friday. From what I\u2019ve learned (my memory might have failed me) it\u2019s 5 days at 800 kcal/day then chemo. Or you can go 3 days with just water prior to chemo. It\u2019s a strange idea to starve yourself well but I\u2019m not even having any body aching from Taxol today. The fast signals your healthy cells to \u2018hibernate\u2019 and not be as susceptible to the chemo. Thus, eliminating SE. Yes, I\u2019m thin #115 5\u20197\u201d BMI below 19 but I\u2019m not sick. My last 2 ACs went so much better than my first 2 due to the fasting. I wish I had known abt it for my first 2 ACs. The better I stick with the fast the better I feel. I don\u2019t eat but twice a day during the fast, morning and late afternoon but that gives my body like 16-19 hours with no food so it\u2019s been effective to mimic a fast. It might sounds counterintuitive to fast but I\u2019m convinced. Saved my butt time.",

I felt shattered. That treatment was ridiculous. I completely developed some kind of generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and PTSD. I bawled during infusions. Bawled. You are not alone. That treatment is VILE. One of the most aggressive chemotherapy protocols there is anywhere. I'm so sorry it's awful for you. My MO tried to turf me to rads mid-AC. Completely skipping Taxol alltogether. One oncology nurse thought I might die. I was unable to breathe and having cardiac arrhythmias. I can't believe I finished AC. At 41 years old I figured I would push until I finished or die trying. I made it out alive. Weekly Taxol was a cakewalk. I was supposed to do DD Taxol but they took that option off the table due to my AC DD experiences. We are all so different. I had to stop working as an RN as I couldn't drive anymore. I crashed my new car too many times to count if I had to drive. My daughter had to do online school because of my treatments as I couldn't literally move out of bed for 11 days straight. We only get AC because we're young and strong enough to handle it. They don't give that shit to just anybody. It's an ass-kicker. I ended up with a Sancuso patch for 7 days and olanzipine 10 mg once a day for N/V for AC treatments 2-4. That's it. I burned through everyother antiemetic. However, I've never heard of anyone here on those antiemetics. That regime was better than zofran, compazine, inapsine, promethazine, or another med. I\u2019m 2 weeks out of Taxolchemo tomorrow. I feel stronger everyday. I am running everyday again, although much shorter distances. There is a light. I promise, even if you don\u2019t do anymore AC. this too shall pass (I kept repeating it over and over and over like a meditation) Big gentle Hug to you",
