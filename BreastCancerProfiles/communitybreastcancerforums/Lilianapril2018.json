I am diagnosed with fibroadenomatoid hyperplasia with foci of adenosis and radical scarlike lesion, which is recommended to be surgical excised. I'm just so grateful that it's not cancer, although I need a surgery soon. I'm only 30, and I have a one year old baby. The waiting part for the biopsy result was so suffering. There were so many times that I thought I got breast cancer and didn't know how to keep my life going. During those days I either sat before my computer google any information about breast cancer or watched tv shows that could distract me a little from thinking about my illness. Although I didn't post anything, I got so much help and love from this forum when I waited for my biopsy result. Thus, I want to spread the love and good luck for those women who are waiting for their results currently and who are diagnosed with breast cancer. Trust your doctor especially the radiologist and the doctor who performed biopsy. Both of them told me that with my age, the chance of getting breast cancer is low, but it's still possible; try to think more positively (I know it's hard...), it would be better to be diagnosed when breast cancer is still in an early stage, because breast cancer is highly treatable and survivable when found early; last but not least, try our best to live a healthy life both physically and mentally.
