I am not worried about raising them, I have a very responsible and loving husband that will take care of them when I am gone.   Be careful as well on what you read here as sometimes they can give you worries, ignore those post that doesnt make sense or will do you no good :-)  Prayers for all of you.

May your servant trust in your goodness and hope in your faithfulness, even in the middle of this suffering. Let her be filled with patience and joy in your presence as she waits for your healing touch. Please restore your servant to full health, dear Father. Remove all fear and doubt from her heart by the power of your Holy Spirit, and may you, Lord, be glorified through her life. As you heal and renew your servant, Lord, may she bless and praise you.

My 2nd bone scan result since diagnosis shocked me....the tumor somehow spread every part of my bones....sudden flare up of tumor which my onco couldn't explain. She said she will get a second opinion for the bone scan reading....somehow she is suspecting that the reading could be wrong or inaccurate? She is convincing me that if the chemo is working in my liver then it is supposed to work on my bones as well....could she be right? I need your opinion about this. I am so new with dealing this...she insisted that we should stick to my chemo regimen which is FEC. I need your advice Pls.... I am not sure what to do....or is there something I should do.....
