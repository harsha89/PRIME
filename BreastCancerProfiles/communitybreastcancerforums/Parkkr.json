I travel tomorrow to get my biopsy results. This has been the longest weekend of my life for sure. I've told only my husband (who has been exceptionally supportive) and gently warned my 3 college age kids that \"I have a lump that Drs are \"very concerned\" about. They will be devastated tomorrow with the bad news. I really hope this doesn't derail their college studies. I'm so glad you're sharing your story. Although reading everyone's horrific posts with 1cm tumors is making things worse. Mine is 2 cm so my treatment will be twice as bad I imagine! Please keep posting as I'm anxiously following and learning! This whole process makes me physically sick to my stomach. So many brave and courageous persons are here",
