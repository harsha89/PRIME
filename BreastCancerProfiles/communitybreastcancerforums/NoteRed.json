So far the SE that I 've had was: hair loss, joint pain (not severe), fatigue, a feeling that I'm tired but I could not rest, twitching before going to sleep,constipation or diarrhea, hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding (which sorted out with a cream my onc gave me) visual migraines, and some ocular disturbances (like flashes, floaters etc). Also after 9th infusion I have a pain at the start of my nails which is getting better when applying hand cream on them... what I have to tell you is to be patient and its doable. also be in touch with your onc for every little thing you notice...there are solutions for almost everything. Did you have any of the above so far? I also believe that some of the above was due to my anxiety... I'm now waiting with some anxiety the FEC treatment...",

I still feel a little fatigue, I have also an anal fissure from constipation (my onc told me so because I have a lot of pain when I go to the bathroom and I saw a little blood so you know..) and trying to get rid of it with some cream. I have pains here and there and I'm trying not to panic every time. I did all the scans and blood work and they were fine and clear and at 10 September I've started my radiation treatment. I'm scheduled for 25..you know I feel a little tired of all that and sometimes hopeless ..... I know I have to have some help from a psychologist at least...

Here is a quick update: as you know I had finished 12 weekly taxol at 15th June. Then I had a 2 week break and on friday I've started FEC. As I wrote my onc offered me 2 ways: 4 doses every 15 days or 8 weekly doses (with less SE as we cut the dose in 2). I prefered the second one, so I've started last Friday the 1st weekly dose of FEC (as my onc told me that the outcome is the same) my experience so far. Taxol is not a breeze. I wrote before all the SE I've had. Now so far for FEC: 1st and 2nd days had a little nausea well managed by meds andI went for long walks both days. My appetite was on and off and had little constipation. Third day passed almost sleeping and little bone pain but that was all. It wasnt at all the restless feeling I had with taxol. Today (day 4) I had my white cells shot and didnt go to work so I could have more rest. oh I forgot to tell you that my urine was red only 2 times from the FEC because I drink lots and lots of water. I hope FEC goes that way for the next 7 treatments. Anyone who has questions about taxol or anything I could help feel free to ask and of course anyone who had FEC feel free to give me any advise Hope that you all had a nice weekend and wishing us all to have a nice week  p.s. I hopemy english make sense (as you know there are not my mother language)",
