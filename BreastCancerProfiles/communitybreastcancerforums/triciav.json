I was diagnosed with stage 3 right breast cancer her2 + Estrogen+ and they say its in my lymph system and in my rib cage and chestwall. I am looking at 1 and half years of chemo and I have a radical Mastectomy in May 2007. Then I guess we see where the chips fall then. I am only 31 so they are really going to hammer me with the high doses of chemo. I am married to a wonderful man and we have three children 2 eight year olds and a 2 year old. Anyone else out there with stage 3 her2neu + and beating it or beat it??? I would love someone to chat with about all this.",
