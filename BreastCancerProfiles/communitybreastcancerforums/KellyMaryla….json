So sorry for your stress.  I wanted to respond because I had a similar experience.  When I was about 10 weeks pregnant with my last child, I found not exactly a lump but a thickening.  This was my fourth child so I had been pregnant and had nursed the others so it seemed that my breasts were always changing.  My gyno referrred me to a breast surgeon and though she thought it was a benign area (she was right), she did perform a core needle biopsy there in the office.  I was followed for this lump during the pregnancy, after the pregnancy while nursing and after I stopped nursing- physical exams, ultrasounds, mammos.  Though the spot didn't grow over time, it didn't go away as the docs thought it would after pregnancy and nursing stopped so I opted to get the area surgically removed.  The pathology result from that was PLCIS (not exactly cancer...a very grey area and much debated breast disease).  I was really lucky to have time to make decisions before I was forced to, something I am profoundly grateful for.  I tell you all this not to further stress you only to encourage you to follow your gut.  A call to the breast clinic about your concerns may be in order.  My best advice to you is not to panic but don't belittle your feelings that something is not right.  Keep us posted.

I'll be thinking of you tomorrow, hoping for happy results.  So the MRI biopsy: in my experience you get the IV for the contrast dye and lie down on the MRI table.  A grid-like plate is placed beside each breast, holding it in place and making it easier for the doctor to find the right spot.  Then they send you into the machine for a short bit to get the images and bring you back out when they're ready to do the biopsy.  The doctor gives you lidocaine (I had to ask for lots more than she originally gave so don't be silent if you need more pain meds.) and biopsies the spots.  For me, the whole thing took about an hour.  Afterwards they give you a little ice pack, though I really didn't need it long.  I recently had preventative bilateral mastectomies- no family history but personal history of PLCIS and other benign but funky stuff.  I'm happy to talk to you about my experience if you like.  For the meantime, just breathe, get through tomorrow.  Sending you lots of strength.

I'm thinking of all of you and though I've had my surgery over a week ago (Jan. 26th), I haven't been able to write.  I thought I'd feel immense relief but really I just feel kind of blank. Not sad exactly, almost lonely, though I'm surrounded by caring people.  And frankly, I've felt guilty writing because my surgery was a prophylactic one so I don't even have to deal with the many of the rotten things you all are dealing with.  My surgery was nipple sparing bilateral with TEs. Took about 7 hours. No complications, though they had a hard time finding a good pain control combination so I did stay an extra day so they could get a handle on that.  Both the PS and BS say all looks good and they expect that the skin and nips will survive.  Got a preliminary path report which looked really good- lots of atypia but no cancer. They have one small bit (my original lumpectomy site) that they want to take a closer look at, slice it thinner,etc. to make sure they aren't missing something.  I'll find that out early next week. Was sent home with four drains, two came out Tuesday, another out yesterday and the fourth they expect to come out early next week. I think I've been lucky that the drains don't seem to be an issue for me, just weird. Sending hugs to you all. -Kelly",
