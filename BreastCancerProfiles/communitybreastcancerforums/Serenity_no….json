Being under 40 (35 years actually), the doctor recommended an intense treatment, at 2 weeks instead of 3 as usual. So I will have 4 months of chemo at 2 weeks apart (first 2 months a combination of meds I don't remember now, the other 2 I will also take Herceptin) and than surgery. Is any other of you having chemo at 2 weeks? Good luck all!",
