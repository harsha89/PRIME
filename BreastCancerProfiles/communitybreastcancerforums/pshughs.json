The hyper sensitive skin is the worst. I'm pretty sure it's nerve damage and I hope it fades soon. In the meantime I found that compression helps, tight fitting shirts so that the clothing doesn't brush my skin. I would have thought the lumpectomy would have been more painful but that was a breeze compared to the sentinel node biopsy.",
