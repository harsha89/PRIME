Today the doctor herself called me with the results and told me that there were abnormal cells and that we would need to remove the lump (would set up time and date tomorrow) biospsy it and would have the results within hours and basically go from there. What does abnormal mean?? I'm freaking out!! Should I be? My mother unfortunately had breast cancer but due to a heart condition it was inoperable, and later passed a year or so later in unrelated health reasons. Any input would be greatly apprecaited!!
