    "Content": "midmichiganmommmy wrote: I am 34 and found a lump in my left breast. So OBGYN ordered a mammo, which said the lump had no abnormality. But it states \"The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense bilaterally, which may lower the sensitivity of mammography. Small lymph nodes are seen within both axilla. There are 2 well circumscribed nodular foci within the upper outer quadrant of the posterior right breast. These are less than 5mm and one has a lucent center suggestive of small intrammary lymph nodes.\" Doe anyone know what that means? It says there is no radiographic signs of maligancy, but that short term interval followup with repeat physical exam is advised. Biopsy of a clinically suspicious mass should not be dissuaded on the basis of a negative mammogram.Â My Dr. referred me to a breast surgeon, which is frightening just by the sound of it, the appointment is a week or so away, but I am worried and can't seem to find answers.
