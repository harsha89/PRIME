So the adivan and phingren (? sp) only make me sleep for 8-10 hours and I'm taking half the dose suggested. I am going to ask my onoc about the test many of you are talking about. I did not get that test but would like to know where my numbers are. All of the MRI's and cat scan show the tumor in one breast and no hot spots anywhere else in the body. If that test came back with a low number then maybe we need to look at a different plan. The tumor has shrunk so i believe I could have surgery now.

Ladies if someone offers to help you by bringing meals or cleaning or watching your children, take them up on it. Unfortunately the chemo is a cumulative effect and by the end of the teatments you will probably feel really, really tired. But you will get thru it and move on to the next phase.

I have not bounced back from this treatment yet and suppose to have another one on Thursday. I have an appointment to see the doctor first. This second treatment has hit so hard I hate to think what the 3rd tx does. Hope everyone has a S/E free weekend!",

Going to bed at 6:30 each night, still cannot eat or drink, horrible taste in my mouth so nothing taste good. Didn't get to work at all last week and that's the first time. Part of it was because I didn't have a weekend to recoup but even a weekend wouldn't have helped this time. I just want to quit this NOW! My tumor has shrunk and it is hormone driven. So to me if it has shrunk then take out the breast and let's move on. I'm a very happy person except going thru this and I hate the way this makes me feel emotionally. I want to hide now from everyone and just stay in bed. If I get up I feel lousy but if I sleep I don't feel so bad. Sorry ladies, it has been a really bad week. Suppose to go to church this morning and work tomorrow. Hope I can get there. Thanks for letting me vent.",

My mom is totally gray and she too looks great but she is 75 and I just turned 51. I'm not sure what I'm going to do but it is coming back dark and gray.

Originally was going to have 4 treatments but since the reaction I will now have a/c. Felt really bad the first go around but I am sure that was because of the reaction. Now I have to do 4 rounds with the a/c then 3 rounds of taxol and cytoxan. What can I expect with the a/c combo? The onoc nurse said this would only be 1.5 hours compared to the 3.5 I had first. Just very nervous starting a new drug. Has anyone else started this combo and how are you feeling. I will have a treatment on Thursday.  ",

But looking back at the intensity of the normal side effects I think my body was reacting right after treatment. On the 3rd day I started with sharp stabbing pains in the upper thigh and then I was in bed for 3 days. Started feeling better on the 4th day after treatment, went to work on the 5th day post treatment and while I was at work broke out into a raised rash on neck, hands, arms. Then I started swelling. Called the doctor. They had me come in, took pictures of the rash and put me on presidone (steroids) plus take allegra twice a day. That did the trick and took a few days for the rash to go away but the itching stopped very quickly. Since that happened, I am nervous about the a/c combo and hopefully will not have any reaction to it.",

Unfortunately it is a cumulative effect and the last one was the worse. But I got through it and you will too. I was able to work through most of the treatments, the last 2 treatments my days were scheduled differently so I ended up missing a week of work.

If you go to inspire.com there are some ladies there who have the same mets to the peritoneum. Lots of good advice and helpful information. Very hard to find information for these mets.
