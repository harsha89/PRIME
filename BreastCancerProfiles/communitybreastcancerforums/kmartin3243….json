I am on a 6 month wait and see plan with the fibroadenoma that they did not biopsy in the left breast for the next couple of years.

Honestly, it does seem VERY positive that they didn't recommend a biopsy or see anything that concerned them.

You may want to contact a nurse at the breast center and ask if they can explain the results and what the right area is...Perhaps mention that you're still very concerned about the area on the right side and it has gotten painful.
