I cannot tell you how thankful I am to have all this support and information from this forum. I am awaiting the results of the onca dx to see if chemotherapy will be necessary. My tumor was 2.7 cm. I will have the 6 weeks of radiation and then the hormone therapy. My Dr. Was very pleased that my nodes were clear as he had prepared me for a different outcome. I know that this consumes you and your thoughts, but know that you will get through it and it makes you become aware of what is really important. You have made a good decision having the lumpectomy. I am sure we will speak again!",
