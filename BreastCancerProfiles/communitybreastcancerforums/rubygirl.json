Anyone know how you come home from surgery?  a bra or not. a compression bandage or not?  Will I be wearing a bra immediately after surgery?  Will my regular bra fit?  How deformed will I look? My malignant tumor is at 7 o\"clock.  I am 71 years old but still like to look fashionable. I know this is rambling; I have handled this very well so far emotionally. Log in to post a reply",
