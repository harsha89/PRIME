Perhaps it was call from god as the article caught me was yours. 2 years ago exactly today my Mom was diagnosed with BC. She was 75 then. Everything crumbled and was mind less. Mom lives with me and hubby and 2 kids. Similarly we are besties and enjoy each others company. I took the news bad. But after a week i picked up myself and fought it with mom. I fought it as if it was my journey. She underwent a mastectomy and treatment. Mom survived and it has been a good 2 years as of today. My advise to you. Expect the worst and pray for the best. If you are going to face this...be strong and that will make your mom stronger. BC is not a life sentence. People outlive for many years. I have read enough and have 4 in the family who is kicking it strong . Keep in touch if need be. My email can be located as well.",
