It's okay to be scared, this is all very new and unknown.  Don't worry more than you have to, and remember to breathe.  Hang in there and let us know how it goes. ",

But, here's a couple of things to think about and perhaps talk about at your appointment tomorrow.  You should do some research and thinking about the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and lymphedema. SNB is not indicated for DCIS, only invasive cancer (and not always then).  The \"pro\" of doing it right away with the lumpectomy is that you only have one surgery, one recovery period, and depending on your insurance it may be less expensive.  The \"con\" is that the SNB exposes you to the risk of lymphedema.  So an alternative plan would be do the lumpectomy, then do the SNB later if it's indicated by the results of the lumpectomy.  Two surgeries, but less risk.  My perception from reading other posts here is that many surgeons underestimate the risk or the impact of lymphedema -- it happens to patients after they've left the surgeon's care.  In my case, the surgeon presented it as an option in a very neutral way; when I said I didn't want the SNB at this time, he said \"Yes, I agree with that\", but I wouldn't have known to say that if I hadn't already been researching here and elsewhere. The other thing is that reading the pathology of DCIS is a very fine art. See this NYTimes article: www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/hea...   It sounds like the pathologist on your case is already getting outside help, if not a formal second opinion; but you can also request a second opinion.  Usually this is done after the lumpectomy when you have the whole cancer to look at and not just the biopsy sample, but you could do it now if you think the results would change your surgical plan.  If you search here under \"DCIS\" and \"second opinion\" I think you'll find a number of people who've had different results with a second pathologist. This is still not an emergency and you don't need to rush into a decision, so take the time you need. All the best.  ",

My HMO prints out a reminder on every co-pay receipt of any upcoming appointments, tests you're supposed to have, immunizations due etc.  The receptionist pulled mine off the computer and said \"Oh, something screwed up here....it says you have all these appointments at the same time every day for weeks, and it isn't even with a doctor, it's with a machine!\"   ",

I just made those numbers up, so don't quote them, but the point is the number of cancers that will be detected because of a mammogram is much higher than the numbers caused.  But that's also why routine mammograms aren't recommended for 25-year-olds, even though there are a few 25-year-old women on this board with breast cancer -- the number of cancers that will be detected is much lower, so it doesn't seem worth the risk to give every 25-year-old the extra bit of radiation.  Does that make sense?  It's good that people are cautious about radiation now -- when my mom was a teenager she got X-rays for mild acne, and even when my older sisters were kids there was an X-ray machine at the shoe store they used to see how well the kids' feet fit the shoes.  Those were totally unnecessary exposures where the risk was much higher than the benefit.  Mammograms and dental X-rays are worth it for most of us. ",

First one of the dosimetricians showed us around the building, took us into the CT room, one of the treatment suites, and then brought us into a conference room for a PowerPoint presentation about the theory of radiation, showing samples of CT scans overlaid with how the dose was being targeted, etc.  When he got to showing us the scans he told us the prostate cancer we were looking at was his own -- which he had been treated for a few months ago.  Then one of the nurses came in and told us to stop by the nursing station any time if we had questions -- \"we're always busy, but we're never too busy to talk to patients\".  The nutritionist came by and said if any of us had questions about food, feel free to stop in, and the social worker gave us the rundown on what she could do to find us rides if we needed them, put through disability and medical leave paperwork, etc.  Really nice and took care of a lot of the minor procedural questions -- I'd had a little bit of health education from the nurses the day I came in for my consultation with the oncologist, but at that point I was convinced that I wasn't getting rads and was just here to confirm it was unnecessary....so I didn't pay as much attention as I should. ",

I've decided to go ahead with radiation but declined the offer of tamoxifen.  It may be overtreating for a very small cancer, but I think I'll have more peace of mind with it.  Very glad to have all the shared information and experience here!  I might also be participating in a clinical trial for herceptin for DCIS, if it turns out that my cancer was HER2+. ",

Some people think the liquid is more effective, especially the kind that comes in an eyedropper to be taken under the tongue. It's also supposed to be important for sleep disturbance that when you go to bed, lie down and shut your eyes; don't sit up, read, watch TV, or listen to the radio in bed, and keep your room as dark as possible.  I don't practice any of this, mind you!  I don't have a TV in my bedroom, but I've been reading in bed every night since I learned to read, and can't get to sleep without the radio on. I never had sleep issues before I got assigned to the shift I have now, though. I had great results with Ambien for about two weeks and then I had a freaky amnesia attack one morning after taking it, which put me off it.  Sleep is really important to healing, so don't neglect it.  I'm already on leave from work even though I'm only on #7 of rads, mostly because I don't sleep well when I'm working my usual shift.  ",

Is there anything else I can do for you?\".  They have a health library where I could check out books and videos, and online education before the biopsy and surgery. As I think I mentioned earlier in the thread, they had a Radiation 101 session before treatment started; I got a tour of the facilities, explanations of how the machine worked, what the different techs did, etc. and got introduced to everyone who would be on my team.  Kaiser has an online component that allows me to make or change my own appointments and email any of my doctors, and I've always had replies by the next day.  There've been a couple of small things -- my surgeon didn't offer me a copy of my pathology report, I had to ask for it; the medical oncology nurse-practitioner who gave me the pitch for tamoxifen didn't have statistics about how much risk it would reduce, and it took her a couple of weeks to get back to me -- but overall I've been really pleased.  And my out-of-pocket costs for all of my treatment are going to total about $200. ",

When I had my exit interview with the nurse yesterday, she told me to step up the lubing (as if that were possible!), put a cool damp towel or cloth over the boob in question, and take both Tylenol and Advil at the same time, plus Benadryl for the itching.  It would never occur to me to take two different pain meds together, but she said they're metabolized differently and the combination would help.  In general, she seemed to be telling me I was going to feel a lot worse over the next few weeks than I am right now.  Awesome.  I may be canceling or shortening the vacation I had planned for two weeks from now -- partly because of this, partly because of the sick cat who I don't feel good about leaving with just her catsitter once a day.  Onward and upward! ",

There will probably be a brief physical exam and a health history. At this initial meeting you might also meet a nurse who will tell you about what kind of skin protocols this doctor recommends, or they might leave this for a later appointment. It would certainly be okay to bring a friend, I'd think, they'd only have to step out for the physical exam. I didn't, but I saw other patients at my rads clinic who had friends or family with them at various times. This is the meeting at which you'll get the most amount of information, and also a stage where you need to decide whether you want to do the radiation at all -- so if it's helpful for you to have a second pair of ears/someone you can talk things over with later, that's a good reason to bring someone. If you've already had that meeting, then this planning session will be measurements, tattoos, and so on, and I think anyone who came with you would have to stay in the waiting room.",

How long would recovery time be?  (It varies from person to person and also depending on what the \"normal activities\" are that you're trying to return to....get a good idea of what restrictions there might be.  Will you be able to shower, drive, lift things more than 5 pounds the day after surgery?  If you can't do any of those things (and my discharge instructions said not to) can you still go to work or do whatever else you need to do?)",

The first one hurt a bit when they took some of the samples, and I did cry for a little while; it wasn't a problem.  The second one didn't hurt at all, although the overall experience was more uncomfortable because I'd had a neck and shoulder injury a few months before.   I used an iPod for the first one, at the facility's suggestion, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.  I had chosen very slow music since I didn't want to be wiggling and jiggling to the beat....but unfortunately most of the songs I had that were slow enough were sad songs; maybe that was why I started crying. For the second one, I'd loaded my iPod with a book on tape, but I forgot to charge up the battery, so no go.  I think I'd rather be listening and responding to the doctor and the techs anyway.  I talked through the whole procedure both times.   The most helpful thing was at the second facility, one of the mammo techs gave me a squeeze ball to hold (in the hand on the opposite side -- far enough away that the movement didn't translate).  That really helped a lot -- it gave me something else physical to focus on.  Maybe see if you can find one, in case your facility doesn't have them.

DON'T wear a lot of perfume, because the next person to be treated in your room might be having problems with smells and nausea.  I don't think you have to go all out with unscented products, just don't add anything you don't have to.  DO wear cute shoes or socks if you have them, because it'll give the techs something to talk to you about. DO bring along a hoodie or cardigan if you want, especially on doctor day when you'll be going beyond the dressing room-treatment room corridor.  Both for modesty and warmth, it's nice to have it to put it on over your exam gown as you walk over to the doctor's office.  If you don't have one, the techs will usually give you a blanket or you can take a second gown and wear it back to front.  What am I forgetting here? chime in!",

I was uncomfortable -- particularly because the breast center had given me a large-size ice pack and it looked pretty weird stuffed down the front of my bra -- but it was certainly doable.  For my second one, I was on a work schedule where I had already worked a whole shift before my biopsy.  For me, the post-procedure breast pain was not so much an issue as the stiffness from having to lie still in an uncomfortable position.   The ideal bra is something that compresses your breasts snugly, a sports bra that smushes them together is excellent, but I don't think you need to go out and get one just for this.  If you do, though, a front-closing cotton bra is a useful thing to have if you need some additional procedures.   Another thing that you might look for is a squeeze ball -- the staff at my second biopsy gave me one to hold, and it was amazing how much the desire to move my neck or stretch my back (which I couldn't do) was relieved by being able to move just the hand on the other side from the biopsy. My first clinic told me to bring an iPod if I wanted, my second one didn't, but at that one the doctor and one of the techs made a point of talking to me throughout so I wouldn't have wanted the distraction of music. Good luck, and I hope your results are benign! ",

The area is sensitive, especially when I bend over, but nothing terrible -- not as bad as bad dental pain or menstrual cramps for me. I was able to drive in my neighborhood yesterday and took a shower today.  If I'd absolutely had to go to work or cook a family dinner or something like that today, I could have probably managed it, but I didn't so I stayed in bed or puttered around the house.  Jen is right about the sports bras, I'm double-teaming it with cotton shelf-bra camisoles from J. Jill and adding during the day a zip-front sports bra from Sears for extra compression.   Putting a pillow over the breast in question is also a good idea at night, particularly if you share your bed with anyone like my cat who's inclined to pounce on sleeping people.  Best of luck and hang in there!",

Now I'm two weeks + 1 day.  I haven't needed any pain meds since probably the third or fourth day after surgery -- still have odd little sensations from time to time which I understand may be nerves healing back -- but not painful.  The incision is healed over, has occasionally been a little itchy, but no big deal.  I am finding it more comfortable to wear my light shelf-bra camisoles at night still, but I've gone without a couple of nights and it's fine.  I can sleep on that side now if I want, I couldn't the first week or so. I've gone back to normal daily activities, although I'm pretty sedentary, but have gone to the gym a couple of times, lifted weights and ridden bike, etc. with no problems.  My breast wasn't very bruised at first, and now it really looks like someone punched me, but my surgeon said that was normal.   The wire localization didn't hurt at all -- even putting in the needle for the local anesthetic was not painful.  The radiologist and tech were very adamant about telling me not to look down while they were doing it -- i.e. don't look at the wire sticking out of you.  They had a picture on the opposite side of the room and told me to focus on that.  The process was way more comfortable than the stereotactic core biopsy because I was sitting in a chair.  It was a little weird only because my hospital has a satellite office where they do all the ob-gyn and thus all the mammography and radiology -- so I had to go there for the wire loc, then -- wearing two hospital gowns and a blanket, plus my street shoes -- get transferred in a wheelchair and ambulance about a mile down the road to the main hospital, and go through the whole admitting process there before going to the pre-op room.  But it was fine....fortunately it was a sunny Northern California day so I didn't catch cold! It is really nerve-wracking to go through all of these unknowns, but hang in there!  It's great that your docs think you've found this at the stage of being a precursor to malignancy rather than an actual cancer.  Even though I did have DCIS, I didn't have to have any further treatment after the excision, so hoping your luck is as good as mine. ",

The appointment after that will be the longest one -- you'll get a CT scan and the process of mapping out the radiation will begin.  You'll probably get tattoos at this one, unless your center does non-permanent markers.  Mine didn't hurt; they're three small dots, the one that's between my breasts is visually annoying and I might get it removed or covered with something else after I'm done, the other two are on my sides and I can't see them unless I'm really looking.  The CT scan won't hurt but you will need to lie still for several minutes at a time.  You may also get further instruction from the nurse about skin care at this appointment or the next one. At appointment #3, probably a week or so later, the team will look at the plan that the doctor and the team have worked out, do an X-ray or two, take more measurements.  Time-consuming, but nothing hard for you.  Either at this appointment or at #2, they'll talk to you about what schedule you prefer for the regular treatment.  At my clinic this appointment is combined with the first treatment but that isn't always the case. Then your treatment begins. Usually they'll schedule you for the same time every day, or close to the same time.  If things are running well, you'll be in and out in less than 15 minutes.  Come in, strip to the waist and stow your stuff in a locker, put on a gown, the tech takes you back to your treatment room. I have the same three techs every day and they're sweet.  They'll help you lie down on the table and take your arms out of your sleeves and pull the gown down to your waist, you'll put your arms over your head in a padded cradle with a ring to hold on to -- quite comfortable.  My techs offer warm blankets for my legs and abdomen. They will take a few minutes to nudge and tug you around on the table to the precise point where all the tattoos and the marks on the table line up where they should be.  This is what I find hardest: learning to let them move my body and not try to help -- just be dead weight -- and if the third tech comes in the room after I'm lying down, to remember not to put my head up to make eye contact when he says hello to the bottom of my feet!  When you're in position, they'll cover up the breast on the side that isn't being treated (they need to expose that side at first in order to get the marks to line up). Then the techs will leave the room and go into the control room.  They'll be able to see, hear, and talk to you.  The machine will turn on, whir, move around, while a sequence of beeps and buzzers reminds everyone else not to go in the room.  It's not loud -- reminds me of a fax/copier sound.  You need to lie very still, but you can breathe normally.  Some places let you choose music (mine doesn't), some have special artwork on the ceiling to focus on (my room is named Sequoia, so there are lots of tree and leaf images). I don't feel anything, although some people report feeling a slight warmth.  This actual radiation sequence is maybe about three minutes long.  Then they'll come back, help you off the table, walk you back to the changing room, and you're done.  Once a week you'll meet with your doc afterwards for a quick exam and chance to ask questions.  I don't think radiation should add to any pain you're having now.  It shouldn't affect what you can eat or what you want to eat, and in fact the docs don't want you to change your diet during radiation -- not to stress your body further, and also so you stay the same size and the measurements don't get thrown off.   It will give you fatigue, more so as the treatments go on and for a month or so afterward, possibly more.  Your skin will be affected, and you'll need to put creams on several times a day -- each doctor or clinic seems to have their own regimen, but basically they're all moisturizers.  The skin will probably be red, possibly itchy and may peel like a sunburn. Most of us have been advised to avoid underwires and very constricting bras while the skin is healing and to go for camisoles, soft sports bras, or go without when possible. Undershirts or tanks are good to stop the rest of your clothes getting gooped up from the creams.  The nurse at my clinic had me buy a yard of white fleece to cut into strips and put next to my skin, though I haven't needed it yet. Hope some of that helps!  I'm only on day 11 so I haven't had much in the way of side effects. ",

I'm just using that on the bits where I'm noticing reddening, which are under the breast and the nipple. It's very goopy and messy....I'm putting it on before bedtime and first thing in the AM (my rad appt is at 3 pm).  On the whole rlght front side of my upper torso I'm using Cetaphil moisturizing cream from the drugstore, which is what my RO's nurse recommended, 3-5 times a day but not within 2 hours of radiation. It's the cream which comes in a jar, not the lotion.  I have some pure aloe too, but haven't really used it. My doc said to add in hydrocortisone 1% when it starts to itch. Day 11, and my hands are getting nice and soft with all the leftover products! I started to compose new lyrics to \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\"....who wants to add on? Lube, lube, lube your boob, Use a ton of cream, Stickily, stickily, stickily, stickily, Rads is but a dream.  ",

As it turned out, I'm HER2- so I didn't go into the study.  Anyway, my radiation oncologist said that total interval of 11 weeks between surgery and radiation was longer than he liked in general, but he felt it was okay in my case since I had such a small area of DCIS.  It was really my decision as to whether to do rads at all; my Van Nuys score puts me in the surgery-only category, but I have a lot of family history of various cancers early in life. ",

S., the hormone results will come from this tissue sample, but from looking at my report, it was done by a different lab tech after the initial diagnosis. With mine the timeline was: Mon 10/18: I have the biopsy Wed 10/20: Path lab report diagnoses DCIS Thurs 10/21: Radiologist calls to inform me of that and sets up surgeon appt Tues 10/26: Path lab details ER+/PR+ and produces report in the morning, I meet with surgeon in the afternoon and get report.   I did have to ask my surgeon for a printout of the report, he didn't offer it -- but had no objection. I think many docs don't realize how much information is available to patients online and elsewhere, they're still in the mindset of thinking they need to interpret these mysterious numbers and letters to us.   I didn't have an invasive cancer so I can't help with the first part of your question, except to suggest that the surgery recommendation for multiple tumors may also depend on your breast size and where the tumors are -- it might not be possible to get a good result with lumpectomy if they're taking two chunks out of different sides of a small breast. Best of luck! ",
