My \"bruise\" hasn't really changed at all - the center part has always been just a bit dry/scaly, and that is still the case. It definitely hasn't grown or changed though. I'm trying to stay calm as this clearly isn't presenting like IBC. I'm now wondering if it isn't something dermatological...it just doesn't seem like a bruise. Thanks again for the kind words.",

      "Content": "JaymieLeigh wrote: hello there, I'm hoping to get some opinions, and hopefully a little bit of comfort. I am a 36-year-old woman with two children an eight-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl. Close to five weeks ago I noticed I had a small like 1 cm bruise on my right breast. It didn't strike me as odd so for the first three weeks or so I didn't really pay any attention to it, which I'm killing myself for now. It is also important to note that I have always struggled with severe anxiety, usually as a result of health triggers. Anyways, after about three weeks or so I started wondering why it wasn't going away. Then, about a week ago a small red mark appeared in the center which scared me and then I started googling and everything came up IBC. The small red mark has now faded to a darker brown and the whole thing really just looks like a bruise it hasn't otherwise to change shape it definitely hasn't grown, but it still hasn't gone away. I have no other symptoms whatsoever of Ibc but of course I'm terrified. I had an appointment with my GP this morning, only my second one ever my doctor of 25 years just recently retired. I really wanted her to tell me it was just a bruise and not to worry about it, which for the most part she did however but she did say that if it hasn't gone away in two weeks that she was going to send me for an ultrasound. My mind instantly jumps to I have Ibcand I'm going to die, which I know was ridiculous. I'm just so scared and I'm hoping to get some reassurance. Log in to post a reply",
