My primary Dr. is optimistic that shrinkage will occur and wants to save as much of my breast as possible.  Honestly I have already had shrinkage and I am about 10 days out from 1st chemo, and yes i can feel it-it is like someone is using my breast as a pin cushin.  But that is still better than how it felt before!  Okay, wandering, my OBGYN is telling me I should just have a BMX.  That I have many years ahead of me and shouldn't have to worry about reoccurance.  My primary doesn't like this attitude and they are kinda fighting about it.  OBGYN tells me basically it is my choice.  Any advice from those of you that have been through this?  Oh, I did have a needle biopsy on lymph nodes and pt scan which show positive for at least 6 nodes. ",
