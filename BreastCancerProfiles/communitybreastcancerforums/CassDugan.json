My 5/17 surgery that this thread prompted was not a lumpectomy but a partial mastectomy. Apparently, the difference is the amount of tissue resected. I had a second surgery in mid-June (SLNB) and have now been off narcotics long enough that I feel coherent again. What I learned from people's posts: Extra big button up shirts are essential, as are front opening sports bras and multiple ice packs. I lived in these for weeks after surgery. A larger fitting bra is also helpful. I got sent home in a surgical bra which fit easily over a sports bra. It helped immensely in holding ice packs in place. The SLNB came 3 weeks after the partial mx. Bras were trickier since they were closer to or even crossed over the incision. What I learned and would like to pass along: Bras with seamless areas over the breast are a must. I received two Amoena bras from the hospital. Super-comfy, but the seam and puckering from the front gathering were problematic. I developed some red splotches that went away a few days after I stopped wearing them. The seams are good for judging swelling, though. If you have someone who is helping you to dress, give clear instructions before the process starts, including what to do if it goes badly. My partner was helping me to manage pullover sports bras and some camis with built in sports bras. We had a few incidents dissolve into frustration and tears because he didn't know how to manage them and I was stuck, partway in, in an uncomfortable position, desperately trying to hold the rolled up tight part off and away from the parts of me that hurt.",

Sounds like it's definitely worthwhile to get a couple of front-opening high-impact sports bras.  As a runner, I have many sports bras, but being on the small side, none that open in front. As a whole-foodsy vegan, constipation is a non-issue, but that's a great tip (pain meds & constipation) and one I've heard before. I cook a lot & have a freezer filled with leftovers, so meals are covered even though it's depleted over the semester.  I made sure to make bread last weekend since I won't know when I'll be up to kneading again - my kneading arm & lumpectomy breast are on the same side.  Excellent tip for people who don't tend to keep food on hand. Exercise:  as an athletic person, my problem will be resting rather than getting moving.  Great link to exercises ruthbru - I'll try to use some of those until I can get back to my regular routines. Big button up shirt for the ride home.  Check.  I'll raid my partner's closet since he's got some ratty old shirts.  I was thinking an oversized T, but this makes more sense. Keep the tips coming!",

I paid careful attention to the warnings about not lifting or jostling during the first couple of weeks, but I did so slow and careful ROM exercises. Although there were times I found bearing weight to be uncomfortable, at no point did I find my range of motion limited very much. In the past several days I am picking back up with running and my usual light upper body weights routine and having no trouble with either. I'm careful to start conservatively, knowing I can work back up to what I was doing. The upper body stretches pull, but in a good way. I had feeling almost all the way back. My partial mastectomy removed a cone of tissue pretty much central in the breast. The incision forms an approximately 4\" scar across my breast. If you picture the nipple as the center of a clock, and straight up as noon, my scar centers on the center and runs 3 to 9. Resection of the aerolar complex is a requirement with Paget's. I had some numbness early on. My partner and I have been doing blind tests where he touches various spots in different way while I try to detect where and how he is touching without looking. My numb area was starting to experience ticklish feelings about a week ago. It again seems numb. The SLNB caused no numbness and continues to have feeling.",

The treated breast has been swelling some which I'd guess must be contributing to the pain. For me, I haven't had skin pain at all. I ache in one spot, much like the ache after a too strenuous workout. That's not too bad. The oxy helps less with the rest of it. I'm also having some shooting pains inside the remains of the breast, mostly right in the middle. Less frequently I'm having some worse pain - sharp, sudden, and over quickly - it's like a white hot wire getting pulled through. Overall, I'm not in a lot of pain, but it wears you down, y'know? During the day I can distract myself pretty easily. Plus, it seems to get worse as the day wears on. Ive been taking the oxy only at night but there are still nights I can't sleep because I just can't get comfortable or because the shooting pains just won't quit. Only three more weeks!

I've got the ro's blessing on the Shea butter, the original aloe gel, and the new one my friend recommended. Anyhoo, I used the new gel for the first time last night. Within 30 minutes it was easy to see where it had been applied because the skin was very red, like a sunburn. Needless to say, I jumped right back in the shower and washed it off. I couldn't get back to sleep for being nervous that it might've damaged my skin. It didn't hurt or itch or anything. Luckily, the skin was back to its usual state in about two hours.

I now have a line of skin that is tight, shiny, and smooth across my PM scar that is beginning to crack. I expect it will peel soon. The sunburned appearance is rapidly fading. Still using Aloe Life Skin Gel 3x daily and Shea butter across the scars after showering. I start school again next week, which means that not only will I have to wear real clothes, I'll have to wear a top at all! We live in a rural location so I've been mainly going topless all summer. I can't tolerate a bra yet but am a bit self-conscious about going braless in public (b cup). I've gotten some scarves to help disguise things. Any other tips? Also, I could've sworn someone started a post-rads thread for us summer alums. Anyone know where that is?",

As I understand it, and perhaps sciencegal can clarify, cancer cells have a shorter cell cycle (I.e. grow and divide at a more rapid pace than healthy somatic cells) and therefore the rads affect the cancer cells to a greater extent. That said, for me, the benefits (lowered recurrence rate) far outweighs the costs (slowed healing). My post surgical inflammation had gone down but is now back, if not as much. My RO says this is normal. My guess is that it's an inflammation response as the tissues try to repair the daily onslaught of rads. I think that's why the general achiness - much like PMS swelling used to be. I've no idea why the shooting pains or why the numbness has returned. Oh yah - the lump feeling in my throat. Turns out the Prilosec was helping, at least somewhat. I stopped taking it and it returned with a vengeance and abated when I restarted taking it. I also find DGL (deglyc... Licorice) very helpful, more than simethicone or mylanta.",
