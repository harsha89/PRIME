Today is actually my 3-year chemoversary (I started in August, but connected with the September ladies better), and I'm happy to be one of the lucky ones who get to look at the chemo monster in my rear-view mirror. You are all so strong, so able to do this. And you have an absolute army of survivors blowing wind at your back. Much love and strength to you all <3",
