      "Content": "woeisme wrote: okay, question time! What exactly is a \"mobile lump,\" and how did yours interact/move about inside of the breast? I found a lump 2 months ago near the surface of my \"breast\" by the nipple. The doctor said it was mobile, however, when I feel it more in depth I now realize that the top and sides are not adhered to anything, but the bottom (facing my chest wall) seems to be; though it's not adhered to the chest wall itself it feels as though it's connected to breast tissue maybe. I can run my finger along the top of the lump and around the perimeter of it, which is round/oval in shape, however, I can not get to the bottom of the lump. I can feel where the lump ends and the tissue starts. Shouldn't I be able to lift the lump up and run my finger beneath it? Getting a hold of the lump is difficult because it jumps from my fingers like a fish out of water, but if this lump were truly \"mobile\" wouldn't it be detached on all sides?

I am in the middle of reading a brand-new study that claims something like half of women dx'd with breast cancer are actually misdiagnosed. Haven't finished all of the literature yet, but this will be an interesting read. Edit. Finished reading it. Misleading title.  Judging from OP's signature it appears she was diagnosed. ",
