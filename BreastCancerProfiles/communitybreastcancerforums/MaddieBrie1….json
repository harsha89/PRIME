I echo the book suggestion from SJacobs146, it has been helpful for my husband. Another suggestion, maybe look at a local breast cancer caregiver support group? This site has been a wonderful source of information as I have been traveling on my own tx journey. Also, don't be adverse to talking with your primary care doctor about your anxiety. I recently started some meditation and breathing excercises that have helped me as well. The anxiety will ebb and flow as you get more information from the various tests and formulate a treatment plan. Don't forget to live in the now either, celebrate the good things - Thanksgiving, birthdays, school accomplishments of the kids, poinsettias for the holidays, setting up the traditions that are in your family for the upcoming holidays. Some others on this site have also approached their school counselor resources and teachers available just to let them be aware of the significant health crisis going on in the family. You don't have to be strong all the time, neither does your wife. Cancer sucks, treatment and surgeries suck, financial worries suck. There are a number of threads that talk about finances, if you haven't already, check some of them out, but later. It's Thanksgiving and family time awaits! Prayers and cyber pat's to you for reaching out to BCO. Everyone I have interacted with here has been tremendously supportive. MB1",

Surgery in Oct of port placement for chemo. It does all get better. Limit yourself moving for a few days for sure. A bed wedge helped in bed. I certainly had difficulty with getting out of bed and transitioning from a laying down to sitting position for about 2 weeks. It got better as time went along. I had PT scheduled about 3 weeks after each surgery to help with tightness, mobility and range of motion. I was able to arrange telework after surgeries. The drains were the worst both times. I was ok'd to shower after with the drains day after surgery. I slept almost 2 weeks in supportive surgical bra and still sleep often in a bra of some sort. I feel mostly back to a new normal now. Chemo then another 2 surgeries then radiation and hormone therapy. Long road, great support here. Best of luck and I hope you all had a good Thanksgiving. ",

Hair loss - I was between a failed Chia pet and the Crypt Keeper just before my 3rd every 2 week A/C treatment. I ran my fingers thru my hair and loosened everything, then hubs used the trimmer w about a 1/8 inch guard all over. Personally, I was disturbed a lot when it was coming out in the shower and I was constantly picking strands (clumps) off my clothes and just needed it to be gone and my choice of when. I haven't noticed any eye brow or eye lashes loss yet (I'm done w A/C now and have had 1 taco tx so far).  MB1",

Worked like a charm, post MX and post ALND I had surgical bra I was discharged with, but quickly moved back to the ace bandages. Wore them 24/7 for about a week except when I was cleared to shower. Then switched to the front hook Hanes sports bras like another posted.... I still wear a bra of some sort most nights (but I am able to wear my soft no underwire Warner's ones comfortably now as well as the Hanes front close sports ones). The small round ice packs fit beautiful under or over the bra to help w swelling. My skin is extra special sensitive, I have had discoloration pop up periodically and changing after all the biopsies and other procedures. Have had a bruise over my port scar since first chemo tx. Weird rashes due to medical tape they use sometimes. Doesn't hurt to mention ANY of your concerns to your care team. Good luck and I hope for the best for all of you..... Remember to breathe, the not knowing is always more anxiety ridden than knowing and establishing the plan forward. HeatherJS - I hope you got some answers. MB1",

My onco didn't want any wait time. Blood work same day before infusion and no Neulasta for the taxol part. I was told it's not supposed to tank your WBCs and neutrophils like A/C does. Most common SE w the Taxol is that darn peripheral neuropathy, different fatigue and aches than w the Neulasta/Claritin stuff and sometimes the nails go.... I plan on icing hands and feet for it and will prob check out/join the Taxol group.... My 2 cents. MB1 (Edited to add that the A/C regimen was e/o week, with blood work in the \"off\" week; Taxol regimen is weekly for me w blood work analysis just before infusion) (Edited at 6pm 12/10 - again to read e/o instead of email/o week - stupid fingers, autocorrect or chemo brain)",
