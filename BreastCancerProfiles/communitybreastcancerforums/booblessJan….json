I am so thankful of the research and technology today that is saving lives. So now I want to live life with a purpose.  Each one of us has played a part in helping to find a cure, and one day it will happen!",

I am so comfortable going boobless, just wear layers. Even sports bras ride up in front, so I prefer a tank under shirts and blouses. You can find them with lace at the top to fit close to your chest. Walmart has oodles in different colors for just $4-$5 this year. I stock up and match them with every outfit. Go for it!",

I want people to be reminded of how easy it could be them and how important it is to keep up-to-date with their doctor appointments. They wouldn't have found mine if they didn't have a decade worth of films to compare! I have no problem going boobless, and I do not care if people are uncomfortable around me. I am proud to have gone through this with a strong spirit. It will never be over. You always have it in your mind if it will return, but it has made me stronger. Every day I live the best I can and often put too much on my plate. But I just want to enjoy every minute of every day and that means not worrying about what other people think! I can't imagine wearing fake breasts! Just proud to be me!",
