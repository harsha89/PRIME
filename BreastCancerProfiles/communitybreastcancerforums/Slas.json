      "Content": "Slas wrote: I received results from a FNA on a lump in my breast. The results came back inconclusive due to rare atypical epithelial cells in the background of the fluid they tested. I informed the doctor that the lump disappeared two days after he performed the fine needle aspiration. He felt again, and could no longer locate it. He ordered a diagnostic mammogram to be done next week, followed by meeting with a surgeon for a biopsy. Anyone else have experience with atypical cells? Log in to post a reply",

No marker was placed at the site of aspiration. I went in because I felt the lump and wanted it checked out despite having a clear mammogram just 5 months ago. The doctor and I both could easily feel the lump as it was a good size. He felt it was a cyst, and the aspiration was done in the office. It didn't yield much fluid, and didn't deflate like he had wanted, so he sent the fluid off for testing. A few days after the aspiration, I could not feel the lump anymore and neither could the doctor. He was going to send me to the surgeon, but now wants the diagnostic mammogram done first and surgeon appointment to follow.",
