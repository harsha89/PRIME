I went for a mammo yesterday and they took me in for an ultrasound shortly after. The radiologist said I have a cluster of something he's concerned about and that I should schedule a biopsy ASAP. That's all he said and then walked out of the room, leaving me sitting on the table in my cape,more scared than I've ever been in my life. I don't know what this \"cluster\" means. Could I have cancer? I'm so scared and confused and feel like I'm going crazy. I have to wait until Monday to talk to my doctor and don't know when this needle biopsy is going to take place. Hopefully someone here will read this and maybe be able to give me some insight. Thank you, Ladies :)",
