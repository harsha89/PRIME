    "Content": "Carly101 wrote: I'm 14 years old and about 3 weeks ago I discovered this weird scab looking mark on my right breast, lower than the nipple. It is hard to describe but it's brown and has a tiny edge of redness around it. The shape of it inside almost looks like a twig approximately 0.2mm long. It doesn't hurt that much when I push it, not itchy nor scratchable, squeezing isn't a problem either. It kind of looks like a mole but from looking at it for a long time, I'm not convinced now. Also it looks the same as it did 3 weeks ago and it doesn't look like anything is changing anytime soon! I don't have any of the symptoms for breast cancer and my breasts don't usually hurt. I don't want to tell my mum or go to a doctor because it's a bit embarrassing.. Plus me and my mum don't really have a strong relationship, same with cousin, auntie, grandma etc. Please help me be more sure of what this is! I would be very grateful :) Log in to post a reply",
