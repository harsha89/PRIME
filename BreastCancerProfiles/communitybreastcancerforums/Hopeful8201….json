If you're not familiar with these, they are light weight, breathable fabric that is highly sun protective (and fast-drying, too). Dive shops, bathing suit shops and other outdoor stores tend to carry them - look on line as well. You may also find them in Costa Rica at better prices. Otherwise, wearing an old t-shirt over your sunscreened body is always a good idea when snorkeling, etc. I try to take a couple of them along, since they don't dry particularly fast. Enjoy your vacation! You've definitely earned it.",

They are paid to take care of patients and that includes clarifying issues such as you've posed. You certainly could pose the question through your portal. I would also check within the system to see if you have an appointment scheduled. You need to call the clinic first thing Monday to clarify this even if you ask the question through your health care portal. Whether either of you think that nothing much is going on, you have two lumps that need to be accounted for. Don't worry about being \"pushy/stupid.\" There's no need to feel foolish - just inexperienced. OK? Take good care of yourself. It may require getting used to being a bit more assertive than you're used to. PS - I would not consider a mammogram to be invasive treatment. A biopsy is invasive. A mammogram or ultrasound is not.

Their job is to MAKE TIME FOR YOU, so if you have questions, doubts, need someone to bounce things off of, etc., they are there to do that. The center I'm using also has a big library of materials to borrow as well as support groups and fitting and wig specialists who also understand the ins and outs of insurance coverage, etc.  I spent 40 minutes on the phone with the social worker today, who, in my case,  is a great sounding board, has helped me understand how to approach issues/questions with my physicians, helps me navigate the roller coaster we're on, etc. She is not at all what I would have expected from her title.  Ask your center what they have to offer you in terms of support and use what you need of it.

It's possible that having a couple of consults would help clarify what risk radiation might present in your case. Because of the location of my tumor (and nodal involvement) I knew from day one that I would need radiation, no matter which surgical approach I chose. I was NOT happy about that and really dreaded it, although 2 ROs told me that I would do well. In the end, although radiation was not easy, I got through it in better shape than I expected and my skin did very, very well. I do still have some fibrosis - my PT tells me that radiated tissue needs 'tune ups' from time to time but, although it gets tiresome, it's nothing I can't deal with. I am glad that I still have my breast(s) and that I made the choice I did. I am aware that there may be other issues down the road - but that's a risk with any type of treatment. I think the most important thing is to get the information YOU need and then listen to your heart as well as your head and do what YOU feel best with. Good luck as you sort it out.",

My skin never burned to the point of peeling, for example, and I didn't need any RX pain relievers or ointments. I did develop radiation fibrosis, which PT and drugs have resolved. My RO told me before hand that I would do well, and she was right! This may not be your experience, but I want you to know that not everyone has awful side effects.

And I think much of that is due to the fact that the ROs are so busy downplaying the SEs that they have come to believe those SEs are minimal and therefor not worth the effort to avoid. (They're also very dismissive of the psychological effects of permanent changes to the body, such as hardening of the breast, random pains that persist for years, even the negative connotations of the tattoos. I think most of them have a pretty severe case of tunnel vision.) I have read, very recently, that statin drugs tend to sensitize to radiation; that may be part of it but it clearly cannot account for all of the differences in response.",

When I was first diagnosed several women told me that they had been told the same thing (one month) but found that it took quite a bit longer - six months was a common comment. Some women said 4 months but NO ONE said just one month! I felt pretty good soon after radiation (maybe after 6 weeks or so?) but then crashed a few months later. That was probably due to a number of factors including not taking enough time to really recover AND having to push through and be Wonder Woman for the rest of the family too soon. Radiation takes a toll on your body (as you know) and it's not very consistent or predictable. Combine that with depression and it's a really tough way to go through life. Please take it as easy as you can, do things that make you feel good (maybe get outdoors whenever you can) and put some time into finding yet another new psychiatrist. You need and deserve support to get back to feeling like yourself. Lizzie, cut yourself some slack! You're dealing with a major life change (despite your good prognosis) and it takes more than a couple of months to recover your equilibrium. And that's not considering the physical effects of treatment. If your hospital/treatment center has an oncology social worker you may find it very helpful to talk with her. Usually these services are free and some of the social workers are EXCELLENT. A support group can be helpful. If your hospital offers any other services for those in recovery check into those. Locally we have, for survivors, yoga, tai chi, Nia, meditation, and Pilates, all of which are free. I've found some of these wonderfully healing and supportive. Not everyone's lucky enough to have these but it's worth asking. Your local YWCA or American Cancer Society may also offer something helpful. Good luck to both of you. Sometimes healing from the invisible injuries is the hardest part of cancer.",

I've not had surgery yet but since I have a positive node, I know that I'll be dealing with ARM sooner or later in an effort to avoid too much trauma to that area.  One of the side issues that's made all this even harder than it already is, has been the expectation of a lot of professionals in the breast center that I will 'grow through this journey, and come out of all this a better person' than I went in. The surgeons as well have had this attitude of, 'well, what's more important - lymphedema or your life?'  I don't buy all that garbage about this being a growth experience - I am a healthy, fit, previously happy, generous, fairly enlightened woman and I really don't need to 'learn the lessons your body is trying to teach you through cancer' (a direct quote). Furthermore, if treatment is going to turn me into an invalid or a deprive me of my abilities, I'm not entirely positive I want treatment.  I really resent the notion that we should all just accept whatever it takes - because I think that allows the medical establishment to shirk its need to find more humane ways of treating this disease.  It's too bad that Komen and the like aren't focusing on better treatments, since those seem a lot more likely to be found than a cure.  At any rate, I do hear your pain and frustration and want you to know that you're not alone. I think it's healthy to be angry about this. Oh, and for what it's worth - the LCSW who leads the support group nearest me is one of the worst offenders in terms of 'this is all happening for a reason. Embrace the journey, smile and accept it, blah blah blah.' No one would say that to people with melanoma or brain cancer.",

Otherwise, you may indeed find yourself (needlessly) being called back for additional imaging because they will see the scar tissue, etc., and need to investigate it further. In addition, CTs expose you to much more radiation than a mammogram; you can't go on doing them in lieu of mammograms! Do yourself a favor, just have the mammogram, and save yourself trouble and grief later. No mammograms should be done until six months after completion of RT in ordinary circumstances. If you're beyond that time frame and still very sore, have a talk with your NP about means of minimizing discomfort before and after the mammogram.",

There is an awful lot of waiting involved, at many points along the way when dealing with breast health, whether cancer, cysts, or whatever. It is hard. Angelia's advice to try to stay busy is very good advice - I found that staying busy with physical activities was much easier than trying to focus on more cerebral projects. I got a lot of cleaning and gardening done while waiting for my first few sets of results. I've not had a stereotactic biopsy but there are many women on this board who have. There is a fairly complete description of the process also on this site under the section on diagnosis. Biopsies aren't fun but they are not necessarily painful. One big issue is to avoid anything that increases bleeding for at least 5-7 days prior. This includes aspirin, Advil, Aleve, etc. It also, surprisingly, includes fish oil supplements. You'll want to ask about your breast density, if you don't already have that info. It's important to know, as it can affect both your risk and the ability to obtain a legible mammogram. Obtain copies of ALL of your reports and films; the clinic should be able to put the films on a disc for you, generally at no charge. Good luck with everything. We know what it's like and we all sympathize and support you.",

By shadowing, I mean that my bs is involved in the trial and offered me a chance to participate but since it would have required jumping through a lot of hoops with my insurer, we're simply following the treatment protocol without actually going outside my network. The protocol has been used fairly extensively in Europe and the UK but not in the US. In my case my bs thought it would be a good option because of my positive node and high Ki-67 rate. These factors tend to suggest the likelihood of an intermediate Oncotype score (or high) after surgery and frequently dictate ALND, which I was very concerned about. A re-biopsy after 1 month on Femara demonstrated a strong response in that the Ki-67 dropped from 43% to 4%. The tumor, which wasn't large to begin with, has shrunk and the node both looks better on US and was barely palpable.This is extremely useful to know (as opposed to starting after surgery and simply hoping for a good response). I'll have surgery after 6 full months on Femara, at which time we hope that the node will show a pCR. I think it's a very useful approach, although the waiting to learn the outcome is very difficult. If it means I get a pass on chemo, however, it will all be worth it. Even if I don't avoid chemo, we will have valuable in vivo information about my tumor's response and that will be helpful. If anyone has questions please don't hesitate to ask. It's an approach I think we'll see more of in the future and I'm glad to share my experience. ",

The alternative is Axillary Reverse Mapping, (ARM) which is a newer technique that spares the nodes draining the arm and thus reduces likelihood of lymph edema. I haven't had any real side effects from Femara. Occasionally my down moods will be darker and I think my hair might be a bit drier. It's hard to tell for sure with the hair, given seasonal drying effects and the dehydration resulting from some very long flights. So, on the whole, I'd say no side effects.

Many insurers do NOT cover experimental treatments. I am in a clinical trial at this time. My insurer has refused coverage (through 3 appeals, which was wearing and discouraging) so we do have on-going out of pocket expenses. I'd LOVE to see groups such as the ACA or Komen help cover expenses for women in clinical trials but am not holding my breath! PS - I'm not stage III so apologize for intruding on your forum but the topic is one I have (too much) experience with and feel strongly about.",

It's not like a fracture that pretty much heals up and goes away, with just the occasional twinge to remind one of where the break was. It's the destructive quality of the treatment that I'm really, deeply concerned about. I don't want to just 'survive' this - I want to look forward to a normal, healthy, vigorous life again and so far nothing I've read is very convincing. Maybe I'll see a different aspect of this after I have a chance to meet with the support group at the Breast Center. I hope so.  By the way, I've read some of your posts regarding cold caps and wondered if there was anything similar to protect eyebrows and eyelashes?  I'm curious, too, about icing fingers and toes - if I have to do chemo I'll definitely have to follow up with that. Right now, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and all that.  PS - I don't want anyone to think that I'm being unduly pessimistic or defeatist. It's just that so far few of the reassurances I've received have been borne out by test results. I figure I might as well know the worst that could happen and make informed decisions based on that rather than being let down repeatedly.  Thanks again for all your info and insight, Hortense.

I've just taken a closer look at the path report on the node, which describes it as \"metastatic carcinoma spanning 7mm in greatest dimension as sampled, involving lymph node tissue.  Clearly, I'm going to need to have an in-depth discussion with BS. I realize that I am \"lucky\" in that she's talking about removing \"only\" 6-10 nodes and she says all her slender patients do well in terms of avoiding LE, but the procedure does create yet another area that has to heal and that involves plenty of other side effects. If I could avoid any of that it would be a relief.  Did you have any issues w/ LE?",

At this point it definitely looks as though a lumpectomy and 'modest' lymph node dissection will be the way to go. There's still a chance I may not have to do chemo and a possibility of accelerated radiation. The former would be especially good news, of course.  The scans did find one minimal nodule on one lung that will have to be followed up on in 3 months.

Fortunately, my dad's still in great shape and lives independently so no care is required from us. We're very fortunate to have his example of how to live well into old age. I'm really ticked that this dx and the ensuing treatment may impinge on my intent to do so.  My brothers are hopeless - truly. One of them has already survived a very nasty cancer, and tends to be very prickly by nature, so I just stay away from him as much as possible.  I will have the Oncotype testing - it will be one of the final determining factors in treatment, of course. There's a lot more to get through before then, however. So many questions and the answers come with agonizing slowness.... Back to housecleaning already in progress :) At least the cake is ordered and the errands are done. Hope you're enjoying your weekend. Thanks again for sharing your insights.",

I found it worse towards the beginning - go figure. I worked about 3/4 time during radiation but I have a desk job and primarily telecommuted during that time. A 12-hour shift in a busy unit PLUS a commute sounds like an awful lot to take on, frankly. I hope you will have some flexibility in how you ease back into it and the option of adjusting as needed.

I hope the smaller dose of A. helps; I think I've only taken a full mg. once or twice as it does tend to linger, despite its description as a short-acting drug. (Oh, the things you learn w/ BC) As to your path. report - Yes! You are entitled to it and it's criminal how stingy some MDs are. You probably can't do much over the weekend but I would call your MD on Monday; they will have the complete report, if it's finished. Mine faxed it to me at home. I found out she had out and out lied to me about not having any information other than the bare bones 'your biopsies were malignant'. If yours will fax, or scan and email, great. Otherwise, 1) Stop by the office and tell them you're there to pick up a copy 2) Call the Imaging Center and ask for the easiest way to get a copy. My original path report didn't have all the fine points - it had the Nottingham score (really depressing) but not the hormone receptor status info, which was somewhat more encouraging. My surgeon had a copy of the addendum waiting for me when I met her for the first time a few days later. As a rule of thumb, just tell your MDs that you need copies of everything. Most of them are happy to give them to you but won't necessarily volunteer them. If any provider gives you push back you might want to think carefully about that relationship. Start a file now, before your desk is hidden under all the paper. There's a good discussion of organizing all of it under a thread titled something along the lines of \"Just Diagnosed - get ready\" I make copies of all my new patient paperwork, too. That way if there's an error in the records I can track down its origination, keep track of what MDs have asked for what information, etc. I also record all of my consults and download to CDs which I download to my iPod. You might read my note to Bridgegal, up the page. You can record on your phone but I'm not sure how easy it is to save that to another medium. You've just stepped onto a really nasty roller coaster, green. The waiting is excruciating and you will NOT get all of the answers at once. You get a little bit of hope and then you get another piece of info that isn't so encouraging. You will hear lots of rot about how it's an opportunity to grow and reexamine your life. You will mourn, you'll be afraid, you'll rage at the limited choices, all nasty, for treatment. Those are good, healthy responses to this and don't let anyone else tell you how to feel. Go with it. Early on in planning my appointments I made a list of my concerns and priorities. Anytime I felt that an MD was dismissive of any of my priorities I tried to explore that further with them. If they persisted, I re-evaluated whether I should work with them. I changed surgeons twice. All of that was truly painful but as I look at my list now, I KNOW it was all for the best and that the choices I made in Sept./October were all in my best interests and that some of those providers I saw early on did NOT have my best interests at heart. Listen to your own voice. Give yourself time to explore your needs. Don't be rushed into anything. Sorry to go on so long but I hope some of this helps. Let me know if you have other questions I can answer at somewhat lesser length. Take care. ",

I was counting down the days until my insurance would cover it. I was ctually more concerned this time last year about contracting shingles than breast cancer, after seeing so many truly miserable cases among family & friends. After dx., my BS told me to get it before we started any treatment and it was a relief to finally do so. I was warned that some people do have a mild reaction at the injection site. My reaction was intermittent and certainly NOT enough to put me off the vaccine. Since the CDC has lowered the recommended age from 60 to 50 some insurers are (wisely) covering it starting at age 50.",

It will get better but the waiting is horrible - and it always seems as though you get one answer or set of answers but then additional questions arise and you're back on the waiting roller coaster again. I don't know your specifics but in most cases you don't have to make a decision about surgery right away. I know many women just want it out a.s.a.p. but it pays to take a few deep breaths, gather your thoughts and LOTS of information and make a decision that works for you. Do get a 2nd or 3rd opinion - you may gain useful information and find someone you feel very comfortable with or it may simply confirm your first choice. Your insurance should cover that. You'll also want to get a copy of your pathology report and all subsequent reports. I know it hurts to see those words on paper but the info will be useful. For now, try to breathe and try to spend time only with people who will really honor your needs at this very vulnerable and painful time. Feel free to PM me if you need to.",

I'm slender and did a lot of free weights prior to treatment; she guided me through returning to that as well as the use of resistance bands. I attend an adaptive yoga group for cancer survivors, which was helpful in regaining range of motion, etc. At this point, 18 mo. post rt, I'm not nearly as paranoid although I am careful. I've done extremely long flights using my sleeve/gauntlet and had no issues. I play tennis, work in my garden, shovel snow. I do avoid bp and needle sticks on that side and have been lucky on the mosquito and cut issue - but I still tense up if I think I'm about to splash hot water on the hand, etc. In time you'll probably feel more relaxed about the possibility and won't feel as much that it's just another constraint on your life as a result of cancer.

It's also important to confirm that your MO is basing your treatment under the newly revised (2018) staging system for breast cancer. One very important point to keep in mind is that micromets in a sentinel node are NOT considered \"node positive.\" ONLY macromets are considered in that category. It does look as though your radiation plan is based on the newer protocol (20 rounds vs. 35) which is a good sign. However, unless you're young or have other compelling risk factors the chemo regimen seems pretty aggressive to me but that's just me. I don't know the facts of your diagnosis.

You do have a tough road ahead of you as that will almost certainly mean chemo and quite possibly some radiation. That's a lot to handle when you have your hands full with three little ones.

If you don't have to do that you could be through treatment pretty quickly, depending on the length of radiation. I, too, lost my appetite completely after dx. I found it helpful to make a blender full of a green protein smoothie and keep a glass of it on my desk to sip on. It was about the only thing I could choke down for quite a while and, while I did lose weight I was able to keep up protein and veggie consumption. I still rely on that a lot, even in the middle of winter. (The upside it that clean up is minimal and so is shopping. It's a good thing my husband doesn't mind scrounging for his own dinner.)",

In my case I was heels toward the machine so even when the table moved into the machine I was pretty close to the entrance so I did not feel as enclosed as I had on a previous MRI. It helps if they give you earplugs or a headset for music. I really didn't mind the experience and did not take any ativan, etc., before hand although I was told that I could. It also didn't take as long as they had said to allow; much of it was set up time. Good luck - and most of all, good results. By the way, regarding smoothies - nutribullets are great from what I hear but I have also had very, very good results simply using my 20+ year old Osterizer blender. Once you figure out the best order for layering the greens, etc., it works out very well. I add this because many of us don't realize that a special machine is NOT necessarily needed in order to do protein drinks or smoothies. I think I could even juice from that machine if I wanted to. At any rate, enjoy your smoothies, Green.",

I have read, however, that studies have shown that as long as no tumor cells are present on the inked margin that is sufficient. I can't find the bookmark for the article but there was a professional discussion of the issue within the past few months that you might find if you google enough. I don't recall whether that applied to Stage III, either. I think a long, thorough discussion with all of your doctors is probably the best place to start, armed with your own research of course, and hopefully their statements will be supported by research, not just their preferences.

Even given the MD's lack of comment otherwise, until you get the path report there's still a chance it's not malignant.

However, please do yourself a huge favor and bear in mind that the statistics you see are generally from studies published at least a year ago. Which means the patients were treated starting a good 5-8 years ago, in most cases. Using treatment modalities and techniques that were available THEN. No matter what the characteristics of anyone's cancer diagnosed today, it's a safe bet that there are better, more targeted, more successful and probably less toxic approaches available now than five years ago, to say nothing of 8, 10 or 12 years ago. In short, try to think of the statistics as historical data, NOT predictive data. OK? It's hard to keep that front of mind but that's just as much a part of facing reality as accepting that you had a biopsy today. Now, go do something pleasant for a while. You deserve it. Try not to jiggle your breast too much. I was told no vacuuming. It broke my heart - not. :)",

Then a break of 3-4 weeks, radiation simulation, a week or two for computations and then 4-6 weeks of radiation. If you don't have to do chemo, just deduct those weeks. If you're a candidate for intraoperative radiation, brachytherapy or a shortened course of radiation you could be done sooner. If you're just looking at a lumpectomy without sentinel node or ALND the recovery's usually pretty fast, especially if you're fit (as you are). The SNB adds some healing time and the ALND is kind of a major pain, relatively speaking. If you're fit and don't have to heft your bike too much you'll probably be able to participate in events pretty shortly. However, radiation does induce its own type of fatigue, particularly towards the end. Again, current advice is that staying active seems to decrease the fatigue, so that could be a great excuse to participate in rides as long as you listen carefully to your body. It's definitely a pain not knowing how the year will play out; I struggle with that myself just about every day.",

IF this is bad news, there will be plenty of time for them to support you in the coming months. If it's not, you have shared a great concern with them that will cast a pall over the ends of the pregnancies and the births of the children. And for what? They can't really do much at this point; you won't have enough information to discuss your treatment plan, your outlook, your needs, etc., just because you get your biopsy results. Information comes trickling in over the course of a week or more, maddeningly. You (or your husband) will be reduced to telling them that no, you don't have any more info, that you're waiting for test results/to see the surgeon/to talk with this MD or that. Frankly, the adult kids have a LOT on their plates right now and their ability to provide support and comfort is probably pretty limited. Let them have this time and then tell them when the time is right, when you can organize your thoughts and deal as well with their shock and concern - IF indeed, it is cancer. If it's not (which I certainly hope) you can tell them later. Sorry to step on anyone's toes - Faithoftheheart, I truly believe your instincts are spot on.

If I had known at your age (or even in my 20s or 30s) what I now know about my genetic risks I could have taken steps to protect myself. As it is, I did not learn until after I was diagnosed with invasive cancer that I had been at high risk for many years. Yes, it's sobering to learn of any mutations and heightened risks that may apply but in my case, there are steps I can take to screen for future cancers, so I am glad to have the information. Your genetic counselor may tell you to wait a while to test. If that's the case, be sure to ask just HOW long to wait - and then do follow up. You're smart to be thinking about this at your age. Good luck with your efforts. I hope they help you to stay healthy and avoid the cancers that have hit your family so hard.",

The other one is at roughly the 3 o'clock position so it should be easy enough to avoid seams in that area. ",

It's usually not an issue although I've noticed that my lung capacity seems to be affected by colder weather and irritants such as wood smoke. None of these treatments are without drawbacks, unfortunately. In my case, RT would have been required no matter what due to location of the tumor; given how close to the chest wall it was, I was glad RT was available and tolerable. Again, I'd strongly encourage you to explore your concerns with your RO - and get a 2nd opinion if needed.",

I would think that someone who's familiar with Padget's could be very helpful. Or go on the Padget's thread on this site. I don't know enough about P's to understand what you're facing but I know you're shell-shocked, in need of someone to talk things over with, and seeing your life change before your eyes.

I know that generally the party line is that no one can be positive it's cancer without biopsy confirmation but that there are several indications in most imaging that would very strongly point towards the probability of cancer. Just a thought - does your breast center have a nurse navigator? If so, she may be able to answer a lot of both technical AND practical questions for you. When I was about where you are I found it very helpful to have someone I could sit down with, or pick up the phone and call OR reach by email who had a lot of expertise and insight into the situation. Not that you won't get a lot of good info/support here but I found it helpful to have a human to talk to, and one who knew how things worked at that specific institution. At this point you probably need all the tools you can gather in order to deal with this. They may also have a social worker who is dedicated to the breast center and experienced in this early phase of diagnosis and treatment. Once again - if you don't hear from the breast center about scheduling by, say, 3PM today, consider picking up the phone and calling. You don't want to have to wait over the weekend to even get it on the books. You should also get a copy of your MRI report; the institution should provide a copy to you at no charge. All of these reports will be important to collect no matter what the result of your biopsy. I hope the results of the biopsy will be benign, despite predictions by your PCP, etc., but am so sorry you're going through this. Take care.",

You add in yet more new information with the PTEN - and the fact that there's a lot that's NOT understood about it, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel like \"cutting off both boobs and reconstructing and cutting out all my female junk.\" I recently learned that I have some genetic 'challenges' too, and since I haven't been through surgery yet I feel as though I'm back to square one in terms of deciding whether to go ahead with the lx. or bilateral mx. My mind changes about 18 times a day! I found it very helpful to have a good talk with my surgeon (since she's the one I have the best rapport with). Then I sat down and made a list of pros and cons for both approaches. Just seeing it in black and white made it easier to sort out. (I still go back and forth, though!) I think at this point you probably need to heal, have some down time, and let things percolate a bit. It is a LOT to sort out. And it is saddening to think that you have this genetic change that you can't control. Most people around you aren't going to understand how you feel and may not even see the significance, which makes it harder. The good news is that knowing you have this mutation, you WILL be screened much more closely. Anything else that does come up is likely to be caught much earlier and your MDs will have to take it more seriously. So your outlook is, in a way, probably better than if you didn't know about the mutation. Plus it gives you some idea of what contributed to your breast cancer. I found that rather comforting, once I got my mind around it. You don't have to feel the same way but maybe something in all this verbiage will help. I hope it helps to know that you're not alone. Hang in there. Go have some chocolate!",

I'd never agree to chemo without that information, particularly for micro metastases. You need to know the projected benefit of chemo before getting on board with it. In my case it would have offered minimal benefit, despite the positive node. I'd definitely put the brakes on any plans for ALND - I posted a recent study on another, similar thread that confirms what Smurfette's surgeon has said. I had one positive node and one with micromets and neither my BS nor the tumor board recommended ALND. As to radiation, well, I knew I was going to need it from the get go (lumpectomy, tumor very near chest wall, positive node) but still fought it (emotionally). In the end, I had one positive node and one with ITC and very narrow margins near the chest wall so it would have been, for me, stupid not to do it. I did get a 2nd opinion from an RO from another center and discussed the approach and the radiation fields extensively with both ROs and my BS. Their input was very, very helpful. In the end, I did quite well with radiation and I'm good with my decision. Chemo would have offered minimal benefit - RT offered more benefit, although more localized of course. It wasn't fun and it wasn't easy but I'd do it again in the same situation. I've had other friends who had positive nodes after bilateral mastectomies who opted for radiation and, from what I've read, that seems like a good decision. Since you only had micromets it might be more of a toss up, however. Can you get a couple of opinions before you make a decision? Even if you have to pay for one out of pocket it might be worthwhile. Good luck with all of this - the decisions seem to be unending, don't they?",

What rot!  Nobody expects that of AIDS patients, or diabetics or people diagnosed with heart failure! It's ok to cry, until you get to the point where you're just tired of your eyes being red and sore and your nose matching.

I don't like to cry as it messes up my eyes too much - but I sure practice a lot of patterned breathing! I also exercise every afternoon, which helps, and I read escapist (i.e., NOT books on breast cancer) books in bed at night. It gives my mind a break from dealing with reality.  You'll find your own way and you'll claw your way through this eventually. In the meantime, don't worry about crying.

What your doctor probably was telling you is that you have invasive (infiltrating) ductal carcinoma - a.k.a. IDC, which is probably the most common type of breast cancer, by the way. You can read up on it, if you want, on the main site here, which is linked at the top of the page. When you meet with your doctor be sure to ask for copies of your pathology reports and results of any other tests - you probably know already how helpful these will be in the coming months. If you don't already have someone to go with you to appointments, that's very important. I also found it extremely helpful to record my visits (you can do this on your phone usually or with a small recording device). Lots of times it was critical to be able to go back and review a conversation in detail. But right now I know you're scared and shell-shocked. Please be very gentle with yourself during this time.

Before enrolling in a clinical trial it's extremely important to know what aspects will be covered by the trial and what you or your insurance will need to pay. It's equally important to know whether your particular plan will cover any of those expenses. Many times insurers will NOT, citing the research as investigational and therefore excluded from coverage. And while the ACA does include some protections for enrollees in trials, there are MANY loopholes, so don't let anyone tell you off hand that exclusions no longer apply. Talk with your insurer directly, keep detailed notes and get any/all authorizations in writing. It's also wise to ask your MO how participation in this trial might affect your eligibility for any other trials at any point in time. Sometimes there's one coming down the pike that might have been a better option but you're no longer able to consider due to current or past treatment. Go to clinicaltrials.gov and check out both the trial you're being recruited for AND any others that you might be eligible for. Ask your MO to explain why this one is recommended for you over other trials. You're welcome to PM me if you have questions, etc. Good luck!",

S/he can also order any other tests that might be needed in order to get the bigger picture, such as a breast MRI. A surgeon is NOT there just to \"cut into\" you (and you will, let's face it, need surgery no matter what). Your surgeon should be a member of a team dedicated to helping you achieve the best outcome in the way that best meets your needs. The same holds, of course, for your medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. You can certainly consult with a medical oncologist at any point but they will be speaking in much more general terms until your surgery provides the complete picture. As for seeing a surgeon prior to biopsy - that's frequently the case, but not always. Different providers have different preferences in this regard.",

Many times it was found that only the single node was positive, yet women had to deal with the addition morbidity caused by the removal of so many node - as was your aunt's case. More forward looking surgeons are moving towards removing only the sentinel nodes and advising nodal radiation (or/or chemo) if the sentinel node is positive. Studies have shown equivalent overall survival, with less morbidity. You can discuss this with your surgeon. By the way, it's possible to have more than one sentinel node. I had five and they were scattered well beyond the axilla. A close friend had a similar situation.",

Since they are small and hidden in fatty tissue they can be hard to feel/see and counts can vary.) Some women have only 0/1, for example, or 1/3 because they had a sentinel node biopsy rather than a full lymph node dissection (ALND). (It sounds like you had the latter.) In the case of the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) the surgeon removes only those that are demonstrated to drain from the tumor. There's more info on both the SNB and the ALND in the articles in the main portion of this site. Long story short - welcome to the site, Marie. I'm sorry that you, too, find yourself needing this site but hope we can all help. Don't ever hesitate to ask questions or ask for support. Take care. ",

In my case the goals are pCR, which would have the advantage of probably allowing just SNB rather than ALND, and trying to lower the proliferation rate. So far we're seeing very good results - the rate dropped in 5.5 weeks from 43% to 4%, which is a very strong response. I'll have 4 more mo. on Femara before surgery. If any cancer's left in the node at that point we'll have a conversation about chemo, but BS is pretty optimistic that won't be the case, based on my early results. What is particularly great about this approach is that we KNOW how my body and this cancer are responding to Femara - there's no guesswork or crossing our fingers and hoping it helps. Even if I weren't responding strongly to it, this would be useful info to have.",

Secondly, it is also very common for the first couple of mammograms after treatment to be treated as \"diagnostic mammograms\" (e.g., you wait while the radiologist reads the images and are immediately available if additional views are needed). Again, this is because there are so many changes to the tissues after surgery/radiation that clarification is frequently needed. After the first few \"diagnostic mammograms\" future imaging will probably revert to the previous screening protocol. This is actually a good thing as screening mammograms are mandated to be covered in full under the ACA (no out of pocket expenses) whereas diagnostic mammograms are not. All of the above is based on information provided by my BS's office. I hope it helps.",

I'm sorry you've had to drop your classes for this semester. You might find it helpful if you can find one on-line course (maybe pass/no pass) in an area that's interesting and easy. Sometimes it really helps to have something to take your mind off of the cancer and it helps if there's no pressure involved. Good luck as you wait for further details of your pathology and fine tune your treatment plan. Hang in there.",

I'm adding this issue to those I need to settle with whatever RO I end up working with. Although I was told the SC nodes would be treated, no one had mentioned this possible effect. Having seen esophageal cancer first hand I'm really wary of anything that might contribute to it. And yes, I did have a friend who died of it years after being treated for bc, and now I wonder if radiation didn't contribute to that.",

I asked if she had the biopsy report to which she did. I asked her to fax it to me, which she argued about. When I picked it up later that day it was clear that she had had a great more information that she had let on. Not all of the pathology was complete, but enough that I could spend the weekend reading up on the information I did have. (As I learned later, I could also have picked up a copy from the imaging center at the hospital, and I now do that routinely.) I think some MDs, especially PCPs, are reluctant to share information. That doesn't mean I cut them any slack on it, however. I'm sorry your biopsy was positive, Nonetheless, and hope you'll find encouraging information when you do finally receive your report.",

You are, however, entitled to copies of ALL reports from any/all imaging - as well as copies of the films. You may need an excision in order to biopsy all of the area but for a tech to present that as a foregone conclusion is extremely unprofessional. If I were you I would agree to NOTHING except core needle biopsies of the suspicious areas, including the nodes. Once you have the results of biopsies you can take your time in deciding on next steps. In addition, I would insist on seeing a breast specialist and treatment in a breast care center, no matter how far it may be necessary to go. This is YOUR body and you need specialized, competent treatment. Don't let anyone bulldoze you into substandard, cookie-cutter care. By the way, many, many women have lumpectomies once cancer has been confirmed and, statistically, do as well as those who have mastectomies. Good luck!",

My own RO was completely fine with using it, too. I hesitated to purchase it because, frankly, I didn't want to use an animal oil. However, they are processed for meat and the oil is refined as a by-product of that use, so it's not as though they are being killed solely on our behalf. I like the Emu oil. I started using it on my skin about 2-3 weeks prior to RT and will continue for at least a month afterwords. I use pure aloe vena and the Emu oil. After 12 tx. I have some \"pinkening\" (as opposed to reddening) along the outside of my breast and nipple region. My back could have used more lotion - I wasn't given accurate information as to where the effect would be and couldn't see it until this Friday. So it's a bit tan - not red, not pink. However, my clavicle is doing fine (knock on wood) and that's one are I was really concerned about. My axilla is fine, too. Like you, cweber, I'm doing 35 tx. so am watching very carefully for problems. There are several brands of the oil available; I use one from New Zealand that I bought through Amazon - I think it's called New Zealand Naturals. There's also a company in Montana that produces Emu oil that's organic fed., etc. Some coops and health food stores carry it as well. Calendula's nice and great for many people; I got a rash from it, which I later learned could be due to ragweed allergies. With any product, be sure to A) Shake Well before using and B) Do a Patch Test First!!! cweber - good luck as you start today. If you'd like to join the Summer Radiation group we'd welcome you and be happy to support you through the process. ",
