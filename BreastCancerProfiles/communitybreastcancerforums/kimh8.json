      "Content": "kimh8 wrote: Hello, My mom has been diagnosed with metastatic recurrence breast cancer in 2014 and since then she has been trying a lot of chemotherapy. Taxol, Afinitor+exemastane, anastrazole, faslodex, ibrance, xeloda, and currently she is getting navelbine + avastin (I may forgot some). Her cancer only reacted to afinitor+exemastane and navelbine + avastin and it seems though that the current medication has stopped working. Her cancer is located at her left abdomen skin and lymph node on her neck and her other organs are clean. The cancer is estrogen positive with HER2 negative. I am worrying that we are running out of treatment options... Are there any other alternative chemotherapy that she can try? If her only options were trials, could anyone recommend any good trial in Arizona, Tucson? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
