I start weekly Taxol treatments tomorrow. As for the A/C treatments, I feel like and my doctor also said I had done really well through them so I will share with you what I did and hopefully this will help someone along the way. First of all, I drank four 16.9 oz. bottles of water each day on day 1, 2 and 3 of treatment. After that I drank 3 bottles a day. They say to drink \"lots of water\" but most don't tell you how much exactly you need. But this helps flush the chemo out of your body and I feel it reduced side effects for me. However, on treatments 3 and 4 this did become a bigger job for me as I am not usually a big water drinker and the bad taste in my mouth made water not so good but I tried and when I couldn't drink water I tried to substitute enough of decaffeinated liquids (juice, decaf soda, milk and even jello) to keep hydrated. Another thing I did which was told to me by a friend was I ate 2 eggs each day in some form or fashion (scrambled, fried, deviled, pickled, etc.). This helped provide protein and helped with energy. On days I felt weaker, I would drink a bottle of Ensure Max Protein or eat a Protein bar. I ate minimal red meat, mostly chicken and fish. My doctor said red meat is harder for the body to digest. Constipation is a side effect which I also had. I took a stool softener daily (or most days) and I tried to eat one Activia yogurt each day. This helps with constipation. I learned this on some of the boards I read here. On days I felt like I needed an extra boost I would have oatmeal for breakfast which also helped. My first and second A/C treatment were fairly easy. The day after treatment I was normal with no side effects. On the third day I would start to feel more tired and weak but I was still able to function at home although spent a lot of time on the couch watching TV that day. But each time I got up for bathroom or whatever I would try to walk a little extra around the house before sitting back down. Don't give in to the fatigue. This also helps with energy. On day 4 I was still weak/tired but felt improvement little by little and on day 5 was usually back to my normal by the end of the day. However, my 3rd treatment hit me harder and also fell over Thanksgiving which I think may have been the reason. I may have overdid myself with travel and cooking although I didn't do a lot but I guess after a treatment it was a little too much. This one took me an extra day or two to get through the weak/tiredness. I was expecting #4 to be worse then #3 but it was about the same. It did take a little longer to get back to my baseline. Throughout all four of these I NEVER had one minute of nausea, which was my greatest fear of chemo. I told my doctor my concerns at the beginning and asked if I could have a prescription for Scopolamine patches (which is what they give for motion sickness/nausea) which had worked well during my surgery. She gave me the patches and I also took the Zofran 8 mg starting the night of chemo and took around the clock until usually day 5. The patches lasted 3 days each and I used 2 each treatment (a little pricy but worth it for me). I hope this helps someone as it did me. Always stay positive! They say attitude is half the battle. You can do this! Best of luck to you all!",
