I may give my midwife a call (or I will just wait until I see the surgeon on the 13th) but i am going to call my family dr for a copy of my report when it is avaiable (he will give it to me no questions asked) The surgeon is away this coming week but his nurse (who I adore) will call or I can call her for the report findings - yes even if bad she will tell me over the phone since I am waiting until the 13th otherwise to hear from him and she understands that would be unacceptable.",
