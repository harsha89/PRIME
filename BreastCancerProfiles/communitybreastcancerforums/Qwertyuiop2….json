Although I was told that I would inexplicably have to wait 2 weeks and nothing less for the results (and I had to change my appointment with the clinic as a result), I decided to call them today to follow up anyway. And they discovered the report had already been sent to the clinic, but no one had bothered to inform me. So I've changed my appointment to see the doc this week. Since no one called me to tell me to go for any follow-up tests, I'm assuming everything came out fine (I'm guessing?). But this forum has been a great help. Best wishes to everyone else who is going through the same thing.",

I asked them a couple of times if I could get the results any earlier, and they said, nope- it has to be two weeks. Honestly not sure why, cutting down the waiting time would go a long way in giving peace of mind to their clients! I guess since it's a public health institute, that's their protocol for whatever reason. Just hoping no news is good news and it's just another case of fibrocystic stuff going on...",

I can feel the lump, it's hard and firm and feels different from my already very lumpy breast tissue. But I didn't want to insist that it was there since the ultrasound didn't pick it up.",
