I thought it was so irresponsible, I am waiting for the test results and in the interim, seeking another medical oncologist... When I asked her why on earth there was no mention of such a test, she backpeddled into some defense that ' it wasn't that important '.  It is such an important test and if you are fortunate enough to qualify ( Node \"0\", ER+PR+) you should insist upon it. ",

I have done a lot of research and only 5000/100,000 women with our results benefit from chemo, this will give you a score which will help you and the doctor conclude whether or not this horrible assault to the body is worth it... it is a new test and is covered by most insurance policies.  My onco didn't bother to mention it to me.. I am with a new onco now.  Good luck! ",
