Three weeks ago I opened my car door into my upper rib bone (the 2nd rib, 2 inches below my collar bone) and it is still tender. I noticed a small tender pea sized lump over the bone and decided to have my primary care doc check it out. She thought it was a bone tumor attached to the rib and I had to point out to her that the lump moved to a spot between my first and second rib when I lie down. She sent me for an ultrasound. The results showed a mass that had minor internal vascularity and they said, \"while this may be a lymph node this does not rule out a necrotic etiology.\" The doc says this means it could be either a benign tumor, a cancerous tumor, or a lymph node that's agitated because if a cancer elsewhere in the body. I asked it the node could be bothered from the car door incident and me pressing on it and she said no. Then she said I need a mammogram. But there are no palpable lumps in my breast and the mammogram will be too far down to further evaluate the lump and if the mammo is clear there will still be no answer as to the origins of this lump. Next step will be a CT scan to see if it's from lung cancer or lymphoma. All that scan radiation and we might still have no answers. I don't understand why we can't just biopsy the node. And why do they seem so certain this is a breast cancer-related node. I guess the node is axillary level three and all the level one nodes near the breast and armpit feel fine. Is there a chance they are wrong and this node is injury-related? Does breast cancer often start this high up in the chest? Why aren't they studying the lump itself? I've refused the mammo for now and am getting a bilateral breast ultrasound tomorrow. I have an appointment for a second opinion with a surgeon next week. But honestly, I'm going crazy in the meantime. This feels so out of left firld. No cancer of any kind on either side of my family and I'm 37 years old. Ever since I got the call from my doc I haven't been myself. I can't eat or sleep and I snapped at my child today for no good reason. The fear is really tearing me up. I'm not myself at all. I'm just terrified. Log in to post a reply",
