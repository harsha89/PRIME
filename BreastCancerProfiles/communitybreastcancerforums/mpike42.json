After a week in hospital with severe infection then 10 days twice a day visits for IV antibiotics I finally got back to chemo regimen. However it was the taxol weekly instead. Much milder impact on wbc and rbc counts. Still achy but nothing like the other chemo. Give taxol a try. Its milder because dose is smaller. Please. I'm in week 6 now So I know you can do this too.",
