      "Content": "Lemonslemons16 wrote: I just had a 3D mammogram and ultrasound due to breast pain (everywhere from sharp pains at nipple to pain in the outer area near under arm.) The radiologist said my mammogram looked fine and they didn\u2019t see anything in the area of my pain on the ultrasound. I know she wanted to be reassuring but she was kind of dismissive when I brought up how it even hurt when she was doing the ultrasound. She didn\u2019t mention anything about dense tissue as my MD had noted. I asked her about my breast density and she said \u201cnot super dense\u201d \u201csomewhere between dense and not dense at all\u201d. She said my density is pretty much average. I should be reassured but why the pain?! No cysts were seen or anything. I have a meeting with a NP in the breast surgery/oncology dept tomorrow and I\u2019m keeping the appointment. The radiologist said \u201ccome back at 40\u201d (I\u2019m 35). Should I ask for an MRI? Should I ask for another radiologist to take a look at my mammogram? Am I being neurotic? What is this pain? It\u2019s not cyclic and it\u2019s unilateral. And it\u2019s persisted for maybe a year. What do I do now now Log in to post a reply",

All they told me was not to wear deodorant and to wear comfy clothes. I\u2019m coming from work... what does comfy clothes mean? Easy to undress? I have an US after. I have had one of those before. My anxiety is rough... not eating, not sleeping. Log in to post a reply",
