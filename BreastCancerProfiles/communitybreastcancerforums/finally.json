I realize this is for confirmed stage iv so if i am out of line, please disregard.  I was at my pcp yesterday for a totally unrelated issue. I have claw toes and he had me get xrays so he could decide which referral to make. While at the radiology dept, I also got the lung xray my onc orders routinely every year. I am nearly 4 years out from triple neg, node neg bc. Anyway, the xray shows a 1.5 cm abnormality that wasn't there last year. i have emailed my onc, but it's the weekend, of course, so I get to be a wreck til at least monday. My pcp said they would do a ct scan and possibly a biopsy. Can anyone fill me in on lung mets treatment and prognosis?  If I am out of line, just ignore me.  thanks. Log in to post a reply",
