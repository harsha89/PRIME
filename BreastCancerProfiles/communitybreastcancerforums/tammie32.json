I am only 32 but my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 44 years old. So I called to schedule and they wouldn't do it without a dr's referral for a diagnostic mammo. So I got the Dr's confirmation that in deed it is a lump. I started googling all the different types of lump, hard soft, does it move and trying to compare. I became obsessed. I went for the mammo, and ultra sound. I thought it would end there. They said nothing to me. Other than to schedule an MRI, and a biopsy. It was than I began to worry, but I just told myself it is just them freaking out cause my mom had it. So I had the MRI Saturday. I go in for the biopsy(needle ultra sound) today. Today I feel fine, just have to say I feeling a wide variety of thoughts and feelings. Sometimes I have my self convinced I have cancer, and what I may do when that news becomes reality. Than I tell myself it isn't and I will get my results and continue on with life as usual. I know this sounds completly insane, but to continue on life as ussual after this type of a scare seems almost impossible. So what will I do diffrently with good news? What will I do with bad news? Oh my god, I want to know something now. I don't know what to do myself while waiting, this is completely on my mind, and stressing me out.Â  Why can't they tell me right away. Like today. I have 3 children that were wondering why I am going to the Dr's so much, I didnt want to tell them, but I decided I would include them in the process since this is real life, and they are my life. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do while waiting...... Log in to post a reply",
