I took all the steroids they gave me to take before each treatment and I took lots of vitamins (turkey tail mushroom supplements), swear they helped.  Never had nausea, but sooooo tired.  Did the treatments on a Thursday and a neulasta shot on Friday.  Stayed in bed all weeked because I was so tired.  But fine by Monday morning.  Didn't do alot of housework but still able to take care of four year old.  Hope this helps!  You can do chemo, whichever kind you decide.  Take care! Ruthbru - you are my hero.  You are so positive and upbeat, I follow your posts alot!  Glad to see you are doing good and so far out from your treatment.  Take care as well! ",
