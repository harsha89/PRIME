More surgery to excise margins. MRI showed lesion on sternum. This and close by right side breast tissue was biopsied. Found HER2-, ER 100%+, PR 100%+ in breast. Lumpectomy done. DISC found. Had to take part of chest muscle. PET/CT scan showed metastatic cancer in sternum with same receptors as right breast and in both Iliac bones. I have just started 12 weeks of chemo with Herceptin and Taxol. I am 70 yrs old. My sister died of triple negative breast cancer. My mom died after her breast cancer went to her bones. 2 sisters have had lumpectomy and radiation and doing well. I did the genetic testing and came back negative. I am so scared. Is the treatment aggressive enough to attack the bone tumors? I know the Herceptin is the miracle drug for HER2+. Is the pill I will take later enough for the other types or is Taxol helping there, too? Anything to help my anxiety would be most appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
