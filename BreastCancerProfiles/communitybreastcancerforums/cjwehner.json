Mourn the loss of your breasts, but remember that the rascals tried to kill you. Try treating your cancer and treatment as just a huge inconvenience.  You're going the aggressive route, and you WILL recover and continue to be well for many, many years.   I was diagnosed in October and had a double matectomy on Hallowe'en last year.  A lot of lymph nodes were removed on the left side.  When I had healed up a bit I had 7 weeks on radiation every weekday,  Within a few weeks my skin had repaired itself and now shows no sign of damage. The most difficult things for me are the weight limit (five pounds) and the damage to my immune system, which WILL also repair itself..  (Before the cancer I had the immune system of a cockroach.) One thing I have noticed since the radiation is that I no longer have excessive undrarm sweating ( formerly it was so bad that I had to use Certain-Dri).  While it's logical that the sweat glands on the radiation side may have been fried and may or may not come back, the right side doesn't sweat either!  I think that my chemo (the estrogen-sucker Arimidex) may be to blame.  At any rate, this is really great for me and my clothes. Radiation tips:   Aloe gel is good for soothing the area until it begins to sting, then  ask your radiation doc for a cream recommendation.  Mine gave me Miaderm, but there are several others, and your doc would know what's best for you.  When you are nearing the end and your skin is extremely tender, get a jar of Aquaphor and just slather that on.  One caution: it can be difficult to get out of your clothing, but it will protect that delicate skin while it heals itself.  Only wear very soft things at the end.  I recommend Target's Merona brand tshirts (about $10 each). Keep laughing and eat a lot of dark chocolate!   ",
