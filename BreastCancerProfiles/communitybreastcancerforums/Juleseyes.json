My entire Christmas break I've been obsessively researching and feeling like I'm in a fog. Her tumor was 2cm (as per biopsy) and a biopsy took an even tinier (micromestases?) from a swollen lymph. I would assume she's in an \"earlier stage\" although he didn't say but he did brush off my questioning of Mets and stage 4. How often does the stage change after surgery? Like do they open you up and take some lymph's and just suddenly find it everywhere?!! Mammos aren't that perfectly accurate I would think. But, doctors know what they're doing and know how to stage. He practically did a feel-test on her breasts and pretty much stated that she was earlier stage. Oh she's also ER+PR+ and HER2- (also grade 2, moderately differentiated, invasive ductal carcinoma...) I mean, I would think if the surgeon and her doctor were worried about spread they'd have ordered tests by now. I know it might seem like I'm just looking for some reassurance but between dec 18 and now has just been torturous. My mother is my life. I've also researched the heck out of cancer staging and treatment guidelines. It seems pretty standard to start with surgery (unless it's metastasized everywhere) but I've seen a few ladies on this site talk about starting with chemo if it's in any lymph's??? Can anyone shed some light on that? Sorry I know this is a lot of questions. Here's the other weird thing regarding the size of her tumor: on her path report it says: Clinically: they say a mass of approx 17mm x 16mm was seen. Biopsy: a 9mm tumor was found in the sample. Gross sample: 4 cores of tissue measuring 5.4 cm total length and 0.1cm diameter. What does this mean? Is the tumor 2 cm or 1 cm??? Also clinically the node was seen with an \u201ceccentrically thickened cortex\u201d of 5.3mm SA. Yet in the core biopsy it was 2mm found of carcinoma in that lymph node. Log in to post a reply",

How can such a tiny thing change the prognosis so dramatically?? Without symptoms they don\u2019t seem too keen on scanning, I think they find it unnecessary in earlier stages and it could create false alarms. But..what if it\u2019s tiny. And it\u2019s just hiding out on the liver. How can anyone ever know early enough? Ihope there is a breath test one day to find all cancers early. No one deserves this.",

She\u2019s likely already had the cancer for a year or two, yet suddenly now my world falls apart. And yet, she was always dying. I was always dying. You just assume in your 20s that your mom will be there to walk you down the aisle and be a grandma and it seems shocking for anything else to be true. Yet many people ensure losses so suddenly. Life isn\u2019t fair in general. Hopefully the waiting is the worst part and there will be brighter days ahead",
