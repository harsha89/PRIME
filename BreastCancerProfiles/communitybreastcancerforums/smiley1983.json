What you can try to do is ask the hospital about getting a grant card. It is a card they give you to pay your medical bills. Basically you can get a hospital to grant your medical bills if you do not have the money and really need a test done. You should find a large hospital where you live and ask to speak with a social worker that works for the hospital. Once you met with a social worker, explain your situation to them and ask them if there is anyway the hospital can grant some of your medical bills. If by any chance you live in NY I know the numbers of the grant people of a hospital here.Â ",
