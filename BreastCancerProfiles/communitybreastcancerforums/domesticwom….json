SOMMER43- what do you mean when you say \"a biopsy is not to look for cancer but to rule out any malignancy?\" SPECIALK - I'm a bit confused cause you said the last ultrasound you had was clear.... that 2cm mass you had did not look fluid filled?? Six months ago i had two sister cysts, one was 4cm and the other 3cm but they told me visually they could not tell what it was till it was aspirated and sent to pathology. So, i got them both aspirated and both turned out benign (praise God) both were black in color but still benign. Now, 6 months later i went in for my 6 month ultrasound (which i had felt the lump a few weeks prior) and sure enough .... i have a 1cm mass again in the exact spot.  I have a appt. with the breast oncologist next week on the 19th to hear the readings and find out his plan of action. Although, i really think i want that whole area just to come out .... being proactive just may save my life. Remember, this is the third one in six months .... something isn't right!",

And yes, six months ago when they aspirated the two cyst, it was ultrasound guided and i saw the capsule collapse but now (last week) when i went in for my six month ultrasound .... it showed it has reappeared, only this time it's only 1cm in size. Question for you: Since it reappeared in the same spot does that mean it's automatically a cyst again or could it be a cancerous tumor?? Don't want to do another guided ultrasound aspiration. I just want the whole section gone with a lumpectomy so i don't have to be dealing with this and wondering each time if it could be cancer this time around. You know what i mean? Thanks for the reply and i pray your doing wonderful this day forward .... all you women who are caring this cross!",

If everything was fine... why are they sending me to Emory tomorrow? Everything could possibility NOT be malignant, but \" possibly not\" or \" chances are it's fine\" isn't very reassuring. As a matter of fact, it's almost demeaning to me, that once again you down play what could be indeed a serious problem and to mention YET AGAIN the word anxious to me, is nothing short of almost being rude.  What you just defined as \" multifocal\" might be correct in some aspect, but the oncologist nurse practitioner today, told me a lesion with multiple focal points means a abnormal area that doesn't belong there. It is either benign or cancerous, also that the lesion is the main tumor and it branches off or seeds other smaller tumors. That being said, she did tell me again it could be a benign case, but either way it needs to come out, to have the most accurate diagnosis.   I pray your right, that chances are it's fine and I'm being ANXIOUS for no reason.   ",

      "Content": "Feb 16, 2014 10:09PM domesticwomen wrote: MelissaDallas, yeap new findings. Since I was last on I've had several scares. I've had the same recurring cyst and countless others (19 total) plus a 5cm fibroadenoma. My doctor ordered a MRI in October to view what was possibly lurking behind these cyst. To our surprise they discovered a 5mm lesion with multiple focal points in a area no where close to any cyst. They highly recommended a second MRI to be done @ Emory breast cancer institute in Atlanta. I didn't go, because my husband had back surgery and wasn't allowed to be in a vehicle for three months and I wasn't about to drive a hour 1/2 by myself.  Since then, I have a large node under my armpit, swelling galore and it's very tender to the touch. I actually have pain that seems to not be located in one spot. I can't hug my husband, sleep on that side or have anything against it.i also have (sometimes) a Bengay heat feeling, that my husband can feel as well.   After I sent them the reports, referral and picture of my node/breast on Friday .....they made me an appointment right away.  I'm actually going this coming Wednesday.  Anyhow, I was thinking perhaps I have a infected cyst, if that's possible? I've always heard bc isn't painful, so I haven't been to worried about that part. My concern comes from this recommendation to this facility and not understanding what a lesion with multiple focal points is. It wasn't very clear to me when I tried reading up on it. Truthfully, there wasn't much information at all.  Any feedback would be appreciated.  TH",
