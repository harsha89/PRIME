Only did 2 treatments but even then ended up with a slight neuropathy in both feet and have had lower leg muscle issues since October(Achilles Tendinitis.) I have gone back to my climbing and am finding that my muscles get sore not the next day but only hours later. My feet hurt constantly, not terribly but these no longer feel like my feet. Also am noticing almost arthritic like pains in the hands. This could be related to the low estrogen as well so it is hard to know...there is no way I am doing any tamoxifen while things are like this. I want my old body back and am glad that you are no longer in pain. As a yoga person I know only too well how much hip pain sucks! ~climbergirl ",

Definitely try some yoga to get into that area. Keeping things stretched and moving on your treated side is key for those muscles to heal in a way that will not be as restrictive...and they will go into spasm and cause pain if they are not worked.

I am in the same boat you are on deciding if I want to do rads after my Mx on Jan 18th. I was talking to my acupuncturist about the long term toxicity with rads and the more I think about it the more I think I will not do it. A friend of mine has run into perm damage to the brachial plexus from rads. Scary stuff and it sucks. I think that with all of the breast tissue gone there is a greater chance of the field hitting the lung/heart but do not quote me. There are people here that can speak more on that. If you have nodes removed and then do the rads you do have a greater risk for lymphedema, but I do not know the percentage. Your question is a good one! ~climbergirl ",

Mind you another article countered that study but really did not tell me anything that changed my mind. Most likely pushed by the people that make Taxol. Joanne E~ Tell the bitchy nurse that she can comment on what you choose to do when either: A. She has Breast cancer. or B. Hell freezes over. Better yet, let me come with you and tell her myself! Doctors do indeed take orders from patients....at least the ones in my family! It is your body and your choice and the best you can do is listen to what they recommend and decide. I weary of the standard of care litany as we are seeing more and more that what is good for the majority may not be so for the individual. There was a time that docs handed out hysterectomies and cesareans to our mothers like candy. In many cases.....wrongly. If more women questioned their doctors we may eventually end up with treatments that are more geared towards quality of life. The fact that we STILL are treating BC with non specific chemo and surgery is mind boggling. ~climbergirl",

No recon for now. I have read that anything that buttons in the front is good....what kind of camisoles work for this straight out of the hospital?   What kind of breast form (I'm a small B)will work for wearing tank tops and what would work for climbing in the future?  I may opt to wear nothing during yoga and climbing and I will see if I can find any older threads on this as well.
