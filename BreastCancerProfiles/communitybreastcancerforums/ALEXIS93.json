I am now 24 years old at the time i was 23 when my boyfriend and I started dating about a year and a half ago he had found a lump in my left brest sort of where my milk duct is. Of course i initially freaked out and brought it up to my doctor who sent me to a breast specialist, the specialist examined it and came to the assumption i have lumpy breasts and it could be a fatty tumor but still gave me an ultrasound which came back to have no abnormalities. So at the time i felt okay with the answer hell i mean hes a breast specialist right? Probably almost a year give or take goes by and i would obsess about my lump like once a month usually around my period but could pass it by, even though it hurt. A couple weeks ago my boyfriend and i got the lovey news that I'm expecting! (Yayy) But my worriness quickly came when i noticed that my whole boob hurts in the left side and my armpit/nipple gets itchy....i have no breast leaking...but my growth or whatever you want to call it feels like the size of a ping pong ball now and i notice closer to my chest where the top begins feels lumpier than normal which has me freaked out its an abnormality. I make another appointment with my specialist who checks it out says i do notice a bit of changes, checks out my right breast and finds there's a small growth on that side that wasnt there before as well. He then sends me for another ultrasound which excuse my crudeness but are BS. The results then came back \"fine\" with no explanation of what these are. My specialist calls me and i explain to him that i am not going to be able to let this go can we do something else to ease my mind such as biopsy...He then laughs...yes laughs and says well biopsy what? Uhmm the obvious lump in my left breast that you gave me no explanation for. He goes on to say that he feels its very unnecessary the ultrasound would have caught something blah blah and I've been doing a lot of research about ultra sounds not being very accurate. I want the damn thing out completely and tested which i expressed to him, he made me feel very stupid and said he thinks all my reading is making me crazy uhmmm what kind of DR treats people that way, he then says even though he feels its unnecessary he will \"compromise\" and do a needle biopsy. This does not make me feel better because i want the whole lump out and tested to be sure idc if i have a scar idc about medical expenses at the moment and i feel that the patient should get to choose what they feel is right without being belittled. What should i do next? Am i being crazy or should i get another doctor? Log in to post a reply",
