They had scheduled a diagnostic mammogram for 1/31.  I was not going to wait that long, so called and got in on 1/23.  After the diagnostic, went directly to ultrasound.  After ultrasound I was told I needed an ultrasound guided vacuum assisted biopsy and my PCP office would call to schedule it.  I got nowhere trying to schedule it myself as they needed an order from my PCP.  So I scheduled an appointment with my PCP for my annual PAP for tomorrow since she had an opening.  Hopefully I can get more information from her during that appointment like what is my BIRADS score?  I have been kind of dull and depressed since this all happened.  I had myself convinced I would not even need the ultrasound as the stats say 10% get called back and only 8-10% of those have to go on from there for further testing. So now I am hanging on to the statistic that 80% of biopsy results are benign.  The mass being seen is new since last year, but I cannot feel anything, is that unusual?  Too many unknowns and as so many have said on this discussion board, the waiting is a form of torture all its own.  I feel 'stuck' like I can think of nothing else. I am not sure how I will function at work with this being so all-consuming in my thoughts.   I appreciate all the information on this site, all those who are willing to share their experiences help me feel not quite so alone.

Thank you everyone for your kind words of encouragement.  I will post tomorrow what my experience is with the biopsy.",

One of the mammogram reports states \"there is heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue.\" So now I know I have dense breasts... The waiting game continues...",
