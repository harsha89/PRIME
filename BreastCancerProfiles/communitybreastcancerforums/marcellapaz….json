At the beginning I was dying inside, all the confusion, all the questions, and the stress was killing me. Not knowing the outcome was the worse of all. It will be 4 years in January since the first time that they find something on my right breast. It was a solid mass and because it was bigger than 1 cm they did a Needle biopsy. This procedure was done 3 times because it was not clear the results, so finally they wrote on the report \"looks like\" but it was not precise, so I went to see the breast surgeon after that and she told me that we needed to wait and see if this grew bigger they would do a lumpectomy to really check on the inside of the mass, but for now it will be just a lymph node enlarge. Besides the stabbing pain that sometimes I felt, nothing new for a couple of months. My next appointme came ( 6 months after that) and this time they found out that it grew very little not enough for other procedure, no biopsy this time, just the mammogram and ultrasound and the visits to the surgeon, but this time she added something new to my file \"Dense Breast Tissue\" and she recommended advil and Primrose oil every night, and see you in six more months. I was very disappointed and angry and stressed. I looked for a second opinion and that took me another 3 months to get to that, but by that time they wanted to to all over again, so did it, and this time they told me that the mass was ok, no growing reported but I had grown 3 new cysts and they needed to be aspirated and scheduled the procedure for next day. Everything went fine, except for the part that they tell you see you in 6 months, because now I was a high risk, why??? Dense Breast Tissue, it becomes more difficult to actually find tumors or other alterations inside. In that time I was crying all the time and my husband was my best support. Time passed and my mom got sick and it was cancer, Ovarian cancer and it was really quick, only 6 months and she was gone. I missed my appointment and when I was really ready to go back to my life was basically 11 months since my last encounter with the doctor. I hope I'm not boring you with my story, but sometimes is the best way to learn from other, I did it too. This was April this year, the first week, I went to see my GP and he was very concern after he got the news of my mom's passing, so he practically beg me to go to the Breast center for a new mammogram. After I said yes he scheduled me for friday, it was the sooner. I had cried a lot and very disappointed with all the events in the last few month that this procedure was nothing to be scare, I new that they will do the regular mammogram and I will needed to wait and they they will call me to increase the RAD which they did, and I was prepare, I had constantly checked my breast to note any abnormality ( as they told me), but nothing everything seem to be ok, but NO, for my surprise and it was big one, they told me to wait after my third change of RAD, and they told me that the doctor needed to speak with me. At that point I was very nervous, and I was alone. This conversation was bad, the doctor told me that I had this new thing, a big mass in both breast, but bigger in the left side , I exclaim \" there was nothing on the left side!! how come now there is something there?\", he started talking about percentage and probabilities and a bunch of things that I didn't want to hear. I need to have a Core Biopsy right away to see what kind of tissue was this enormous mass. At that moment when I left the Breast center I was very concern, and sad and really worry and I took a bad decision NOT to tell my husband until I had result, it was bad enough that we have to be waiting every 6 months to see if there is any changes. I was being consumed inside, couldn't sleep, eat or speak, this was friday saturday and sunday, my appointment was for tuesday morning, I needed to have 5 days without my other meds, but sunday night, it was passed midnight, my husband turned on the light and told, I need to know what's going on!! NOW. He was mad at me, because I didn't tell him right away, we cried for awhile and then he told me that what ever this was, we will get though it. I had my core biopsy they took 4 samples and the pathology report came back negative for cancer, but the diagnosis was 4 different things, I have a small papilloma growing inside one of the ducts, and I have abnormal cells growing like crazy, but they don't have Atypia, which when is present is like a closer step for breast cancer, so my biggest concern was \"will my cells change to have atypia? and I was told that it was very possible, but there is no way to be sure just close watch, my next appointment including a core biopsy is in September, what a way to pass the summer, just waiting for good news. My message for you is share what ever it is with your family they will be your support, no matter what. Now try not to strees that much, at the moment I have several lymph nodes enlarged, and with some pain, Right side armpit, this one is the worse and then other two in the left side, less pain, one in my belly and one in my neck, they are all fine. I was told by my breast surgeon that lymph node get enlarge because they try to help in the area where is the issue going on, they are like filter so work more when something is not right in my case the abnormal growing of cells, even now is a benign condition they are swollen more that make me think all the time. Best of luck for you.",
