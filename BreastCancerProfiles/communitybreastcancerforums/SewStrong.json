There are lots of women who have gone through numerous things and they are willing to give advice. Someone there just might have experienced the same thing. God bless you and your two little boys. I have four boys and I'm a bit partial to boys. Sharon-GG",

My cancer was found with a mammogram but had already broken out of the duict and started invading the surrounding breast tissue. There is no known medication to take for 5 years to help keep this kind of cancer from metastesizing in the liver, lungs,  brain. I, too, cried and was in shock for about a week, then I began to pray and had other to pray in their churches. I received a peace on morning when I woke up. It was as if someone had taken this all away. I had surgery, a lumpectomy, and now I'm waiting until the 14th to begin radiation. I go the 9th of August to talk to a doctor at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center to be enrolled in a triple negative clinical study. Possibly, the experimental drugs just might have some effect. I am like you, a very healthy 68 year old, who has always exercised and eaten what I thought was a balanced diet. I was astonished when I was told that I had breast cancer. God bless you through this and may you find peace somewhere along the way.",
