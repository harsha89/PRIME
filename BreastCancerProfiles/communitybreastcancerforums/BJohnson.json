I had my uterus removed and within 1 1/2 yrs. later my tubes and ovaries had to come out to.  I have been faithful in going at 1st. every 6 mos. then yearly for my check-ups.  Unfortunatly I was placed on premerin therapy.  I was Dx with DCIS and LCIS breast cancer on Feb 16, 2010 and had a DBM with left node dissection and reconstruction started on March 26,2010.  I also had a skin lesion cancer removed in Nov.2004. I hope that this has been of some help to you. God Bless and Good Luck in you're research. ",
