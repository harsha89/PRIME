I first told my Oncologist about my shortness of breath a year ago, she said it was all in my head. 6 months later, with same symptoms, she sent me for pulmonary tests which came back clear. Now my primary care dr said I most likely have heart damage due to the chemo drugs. The heart harness test came back normal but when I did the cardiac treadmill stress test I was only able to walk for 2 minutes before my bp shot up to 185/150 and my heart rate skyrocketed to 187 and I was unable to breath. I was unable to finish the test and it takes 6 minutes on the treadmill to get a reading. I see my primary care on Monday but everything I've been reading points to major heart damage such as cardiomyopothy from the AC. I'm so scared, it's like I'm looking at a death sentence.

Im so sorry for you and all of us who fought so hard to beat cancer but then end up with heart issues we never had before. One of my disappointments came when my oncologist wouldn't acknowledge the possibility of a link between my shortness of breath and the chemo & radiation treatments. That being said, I now need a diagnosis so I don't have to live each day fearing that its my last.",

After fighting so hard to complete chemo & radiatio, and side effects of Arimidex, now to realize theres heart damage.....its disheartening. At this point, I'm just plane scared. I always said my goal is to live to 90, (I'm 64 now) or at least long enough to dance with my youngest grandson when he gets married, now condisering he's 3 years old, I still have a lot of life left to live. I'm so thankful to have the support of everyone here. God bless",
