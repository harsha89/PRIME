I just had a re-excision with a lymph node dissection (3/2) and can I just say that the armpit cut is not fun!!!  Any suggestions on how to get the feeling of rawness to go away?  My incision actually got a little bit infected and I have been on antibiotics. Anyway, I have not talked to the MO yet.  I have an appt on 3/19.  I am nervous about what they are going to say!  I am ER/PR negative and HER2 pos with a score of 5.45.  I have not seen anything good about HER2 over 3 so it has me a little nervous.  I am 44 with no family history of any cancers so still kind of in shock about this too!  Thanks for all your stories and encouragement!!",
