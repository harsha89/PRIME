It was a similar procedure for the seed placement as the stereotactic biopsy in using the mammogram to find the location except I was sitting and it was just the needle, there was no incision. They still did the numbing needle first. I hope any future procedures are less traumatic for you",

The surgeon commented about my bruising at my consult. I assumed everyone bruised but she said no not everyone",

Also did they run standardbasic bloodwork on you before the surgical biopsy or is my surgeon possibly doing this because of my medical history of autoimmune disease? Log in to post a reply",

She said it makes it so it can be done the day before rather than the day of surgery and that it's more accurate because the wire can move but the seed doesn't move. My area of concern is close to my chest wall I believe is what they told me I had the seed done Wednesday, the surgical biopsy Thursday and now im waiting for results. I should add... the location of mine made it a challenge for them to get the mammogram picture they needed while doing the stereotactic biopsy as well as the seed insertion. It was what too kind the longest time.",
