With FEC it was all temporary stuff like nausea, mouth problems, eyes watering etc. With Taxol it sounds like the problems are potentially long-term ie: neuropathy, bone pain and more likely to limit my ability to work over the next 12 weeks (I start Taxol/Herceptin on Friday this week).

I think I mentioned in an earlier post that the main reason for this is a personal history of multiple chest x-rays in adolescence which I have now discovered set me up for BC and other cancers in the chest area. So, I understand that for the average woman in my position both options come with the same stats, but my story is slightly different much like someone with the BRCA genes. In your position you need to go with what YOU feel the most comfortable with. Ignore the reconstruction or not options and just decide between lumpectomy and BMX/UMX. Then if you choose the MX worry about the options within that after the initial decision is made. Jenn",

That last one must feel so \"good\" (sort of...). Kam - I certainly don't mind you popping in and getting inspiration. I must admit I read the threads from other months myself and each group does seem so different. Other groups seem much more chatty in terms of social stuff. I wish I could provide more info on social stuff but my life right now doesn't seem to include anything much social. It's just hospital, home and work.  I did get to go to the movies 2 weeks ago which was my first outing (apart from the supermarket) in months. I normally wander up to the hospital on Thursdays to do my weekly bloods before chemo on Fridays but tomorrow I have an early appointment with my MO (9.15am) so in order for her to get my bloods results I wandered up there today. I emailed them yesterday to let them know that I am feeling very anaemic and am sure my lips are more blue than pink these days and I'm more breathless than I remember ever being. I'm worried that the Herceptin has already affected my heart function :-( So they added additional blood tests today and I had to fill something like 7 tubes! I think the MO might be organising for me to have my next MUGA a bit earlier than usual as well. It should be not for another 3 weeks but the nurse mentioned it to me today when I was up there and was talking about scheduling it. I am finding now that my energy levels flag very quickly and I'm trying to make sure that I eat something with protein in it every few hours. Just had a healthy egg salad sandwich on my way back from the hospital and have a chicken and vege soup ready to heat up this afternoon. If I don't eat I suddenly find myself feeling like I could slide onto the floor! I have 3 more Friday Taxol/Herceptin treatments to go including this coming Friday. I have told my boss that I will struggle through next week like I've been doing but then will take the whole of the following week before my last treatment off and half of the following week. I just can't see me being able to keep up even this reduced pace to the end. regards Jenn",

      "Content": "May 25, 2012 10:31PM - edited May 25, 2012 10:32PM by Jennt28 Over the past 4 years I had put on quite a bit of weight due to a couple of health problems (gallbladder stopped working was one of them), going back to work fulltime and taking on a part-time degree study load. After my diagnosis in early December and before I started chemo in mid January I worked really hard to lose weight because I knew with chemo I was likely to put it on. I managed to lose 22lbs! Then, sure enough, I put on 11lbs between start of chemo and 2 weeks ago. During my first 9 weeks of Taxol I was putting on 6.6lbs a week from the steroids and trying to get it off before the next treatment. It was horrible. I asked if the steroid could be cut back and it was halved 2 weeks ago. I've since lost 3lbs and am hopeful of being able to lose some of the rest of the gain before I start rads on the 18th of June. To lose I've been eating 3 small meals a day and trying to avoid snacks. I will admit to some chocolate having crept into the equation over the past weeks though and I really haven't been able to get out and exercise due to feeling so bad. We are coming into winter so it's easy for me to have a nice soup for lunch. At dinner I have some sort of meat (protein) and lots of veges with very little carbs ie: if we are having mashed potatos or rice I will only have a tablespoon helping of that. I'm hoping that if I can get rid of this horrible breathlessness problem I can get out and exercise (walk) again. The problem is that we think I have pneumonitis and the solution to that is STEROIDS. Vicious circle... I used to be an Area Coordinator and Leader for Weight Watchers - so I know what to do... At this point I'm still way down on where I was before diagnosis. Ideally I want to lose another 22lbs from where I currently am sitting. Hoping to get there by the end of the year... Jenn",

I have marker clips left in my breast by the BS to mark the tumour bed and I can actually feel needle like pain where they are. Oh, and I met with the RO today and finally got to see my plan. She said only 8% of my lung volume is in the field and she was really happy about that but on the picture it looked big to me - it wasn't till I was walking back to my car I realised that's because 8% of total lung volume actually means 16% of my right lung is being damaged!!!!!! So not happy... Went for 3 month ultrasound follow-up also today for a paraovarian cyst that showed up back in March. According to the report it hasn't gotten any bigger but the report now says that the 1.8mm nodule in the cyst is a mural nodule. Dr Google tells me that could be a significant indicator for ovarian cancer! My gynae was already favouring an oopherectomy (although my MO is NOT in favour) so I can just see that at my appt next Friday we will be talking timing for that. July and early August is written off with rads so I guess Sep/Oct... I have just enrolled back into my uni course for the July-Nov semester, and my mother lives in New Zealand and isn't well and I need to at least fly over there for a weekend after rads.

My arm has felt heavy and has been aching since Friday so today I have asked if they can organise a referral to the LE physio :-/ And last Friday I had a bit of a run in with the RO as follows: On Friday, after suspecting that after me not allowing the techs to tape my arm they were hitting my arm more than they should be ie: to 1/3 of the way down my arm towards my elbow on the underside (I could feel it burning...), I emailed the RO who actually phoned me and stated that I would either have to \"compromise\" and allow them to tape my arm each day or accept that my arm would be \"hit\". As you can imagine I was NOT happy with this and we had some terse words with me having to state that if the issue would need to be resolved and if it could not be resolved I would not be turning up for anymore treatments... So, she came along to the set-up on Friday afternoon and when I first arrived (before the RO got there) the tech very importantly told me that \"oh by the way, we have moved the arm rest for you\"... Then the RO came along and confirmed that my arm was no longer in the field. Such a simple \"fix\"! I was left wondering if the RO had been under the impression that the techs had tried everything possible to get my arm out of the way where they had in reality tried NOTHING because they don't like to move the arm rest because it takes longer for set-up... So my arm got 2 days of rads that it should not have had. And over the weekend my arm did not stop aching. I hate this... Jenn",

The clinic, where I had never been before, works on a \"last man standing\" system. Everyone is given morning appointments for mammos and then those that are clear get to leave and the others stay through each of the next steps. I was there at 9.30am for my mammo and was the LAST ONE TO LEAVE at nearly 5pm :-/. Looking back now, I can remember starting that day thinking it would be a quick appointment to confirm what my doctor had said was probably a cyst. I thought it was going to be interesting to see if mammos are as uncomfortable as everyone always said they were (which I didn't that it was). Little did I know how much more pain was to come that day and through this entire past year, and that one mammogram was the only one I will ever have in my life. It was close to Christmas and a new fancy mall had opened recently in the heart of Sydney. My hubby works in the city so I was supposed to meet him after he finished work and we were going to go Christmas shopping and for a nice dinner (date night!!!). Instead, he got a call from me at 3.30pm to leave work and come to the centre. He arrived to be whisked with me into the doctor's office - and the words BREAST CANCER. It wasn't the date night we planned... After we paid over the first of what would be, over this past year, many thousands of dollars in medical expenses, we walked over to the shiny new mall. First thing we did was find a shiny new trendy bar and order a drink each. Then we just sat in shock for a while before wandering aimlessly through the multiple levels of shops. We didn't buy anything at all for Christmas - we had no heart for it. We had dinner at a shiny new burger place. I remember the burger tasting good. Have suggested to hubby a few times over the past year that we go back there, but he hasn't been keen. Maybe it's psychological? So much has happened since that day, I could fill a book. Oh, hang on, maybe you could just read back over the past 82 pages of our conversations in here! There is only one thing I have loved that has been new this year - the meeting of all of you. Thanks for being here - and sorry that you had to be here... Love ya, Jenn",

      "Content": "Jan 22, 2012 01:11PM Jennt28 wrote: Hi everyone, I really haven't updated much after my first chemo back on the 12th so thought I would. In regard the what did I tell work - I'm in Australia so it's probably a little differrent to most of you and I work for a cancer clinical trials unit so I told them straight up. They have been very good. My  direct boss did go into panic mode the first week - I think she looked online at all the triple positive stuff and pretty much put me in the \"she's dying\" basket. Once I calmed HER down  and got her to concentrate more on what I will be doing NOW she has been better with no more talk  of major project handovers etc. As my workplace is part of a university I am lucky because I have an extraordinary amount of annual sick leave that I can take as well as them having a flexible workplace policy that allows for working from home (I don't teach classes or anything). So I've filled out the working from home application and had it approved and now can work from home pretty much any day that I want after checking with my boss (who, as I said is good now).  So, I took 3 days sick leave after my first tx (Fri/Mon/Tue), worked from home Wed/Thu last week and then went into the office for the day on Friday. Next tx I'm planning on 1 day sick leave (Friday) and work from home Mon/Tue and then back in the office. Anyway, I think I'm doing OK after this first FEC... The first few days were pretty bad. The Friday I think I was more emotionally sick than physically sick. Then I wrenched my brand new port Friday night and had to take a trip to emergency Saturday  morning to have it x-rayed and re-accessed to make sure it was OK. After the Emend and Kytril ran out after day 2 (which was Sunday) I hit a bad patch of nausea as they'd only given me Maxolon to cover from then on. But on Monday morning I went to my PCP who gave me a different drug that worked and I\"ve been good since then. I'm thinking that my mouth has reallly been the worst SE I've had. I did something stupid (had blue cheese) the first day as no-one had told me not to. Ended up with immediate thrush on my tongue that needed a visit to the PCP (again) and days of horrible tasting drops and rinses. It's all clear now and I've just got a dry mouth so am looking after that carefully. Went out to a party at a friends house on Friday night and had a couple of red wines which was great. Hubby and I worked out that \"everything\" still works in the intimacy dept that night too, so I'm a little relieved at that! (sorry if TMI...) ;-) Went out to the movies with hubby last night which was a bit scary in terms of being nervous of catching anything. But we went to the Gold Class session (small theatre with couples recliner seats far apart from the other people) and I used lots of anti-bacterial hand wipes after I touched anything. I've been walking pretty much everyday after tx which I'm really proud of. I'm determined to get this slack butt back into shape to fight this thing. Today is day 11 for me. I know that more hairs than usual are falling out each day, but nothing significant as yet and the other hairs in other places are still hanging in there too. I wish the underarm ones would hurry and go because I'm not supposed to use a razor and don't have an electric one - and it's summer here... I'm assuming I'm going to have to get hubby to buzz the head hair in the next few days... I've been reading everyone's stories - it's just hard to post usually because I'm on my iPad which is a pain to type on. It sounds like on the whole we are all going OK. Good luck to everyone this week. Lot of luv Jenn",

Technically these really both take the same amount of \"time\" ie: 12 weeks from first in the body to finally flushing out of the body entirely. The second lower dose more frequent regime is becoming more popular due to recent research that has shown less side effects with slightly better chance of not getting any more cancer occurring afterwards (progression free survival).

My port is on the other side from my affected breast. One thing I did was draw with a biro along the edges of my sports bra before I went for the port install. Then I showed the radiologist the lines and told him he wasn't allowed to put the port between the lines. He was surprised at how organised I was (and a little impressed I think) and was happy to work with me to determine exactly where the port was going. We agreed on a position and he drew a cross so he knew where to put it during the surgery. I had just a local and the twilight stuff which really didn't work but I didn't mind being aware. They left my port \"accessed\" so it didn't have to be needled again the next day. I went to work the next day as my tx wasn't until 3.00pm. It was fine. I had my stitches out a week agomand the two incisions are almost healed. I think it's taken a bit longer to heal because of the chemomeffects. Jenn",

I'm having my port placed on 11 January and then my first treatment on 12 January. I'm scheduled for 3 x FEC followed by 3 x Taxol with 12 months of concurrent Herceptin. I have an appt on 17 January with the radiologist to discuss radiotherapy after the 6 cycles of chemo... Joined up to 2 clinical trials which makes sense since I'm a trial coordinator. I felt really bad though because the study coordinator at the hospital is the same one running my two trials there - maybe I should have thought ahead and warned her before I turned up as her new trial patient :-/ regards Jenn",

I'm a former Weight Watchers leader and area coordinator but since moving into full-time work and studying part-time for a university degree I had put on quite a bit of weight in the past 4yrs. The time I used to have for exercise just disappeared :-( Since my diagnosis on 01 December I have lost 11lbs. The initial 6lbs loss was due to stress in those first couple of weeks and then the rest is because having read all about the risks of being overweight and reoccurence I am determined to get as much of these additional lbs off as I can. Especially since I've been reading about how our treatments tend to make us PUT ON weight. I'm also concerned about getting my heart as healthy as it can be because of the risks of heart side effects for Herceptin and my chemo (FEC + Taxol) so have been getting out and power walking to work my heart each day. The dog is really enjoying getting fit too! As well as the exercise I have cut out most sugars and starch from my diet in the past couple of weeks after reading some of the latest research about recurrence and diet... I did allow myself some dessert and wine on Christmas Day as a special treat :-) So, anyone else out there pounding the pavement and resisting the lure of potatos with me? regards Jennifer",

Mine is being done the day before at Concord and they will leave it accessed for the chemo the next day. Hoping it's not going to be a horror story... I think we are all scared, having gone from feeling fine, healthy and normal to tests, biopsies, scans, wires, needles, surgeries within days :-( It's all very shocking. I'm also doing FEC but don't start until the 12th. How many cycles are you doing and is anything following FEC? I'm doing 3 x FEC, 3 x Taxol, rads, 1yr of Herceptin then probably 5 yrs of hormone blockers. So much when I don't feel like there's anything wrong with me... I'm desperate to keep working. Not just because we have a Sydney sized mortgage but also because I LOVE my job and even got notification of my successful promotion on the same day as my surgery this month. I work for a university (my office is a short walk up to the hospital) so am lucky with sick leave benefits etc, but even though everyone says they will be supportive you just never know... Good luck for this week. Did you discuss supplements with your oncologist? I did and she is happy with the recommendations I got from here. PS:,I'm 46, married, three kids aged 20, 18, 16. The only plus side of all this is how many times I've been told how young I am in the past few weeks :-/ regards Jenn",

Sunday I was very nauseous and tired because had run out of everything except Maxolon that wasn't covering it. Monday finally got to my PCP who gave me two days supply of Zofran and once I took that I felt fine. Tuesday (today) - felt a little nausea this morning but managed a 1.8mile walk, shower, make-up and a trip to the hospital for an initial appt with RO. At home now and feeling fine. Definitely could have worked today if I hadn't taken sick leave.

In terms of staying \"regular\", I took a Coloxyl/Senna tablet every evening from the evening before treatment.

The reason why they don't use the less toxic Abraxane for everyone is, I understand, economic - Abraxane is far more expensive than Taxol. I wish I could get Abraxane... Jenn",

My concern though is that the pain and \"lumpiness\" is not in the same site as my lumpectomy. My lump was taken from the underneath of my breast and this pain is at the top and extends up my chest. Had my appt with the MO this morning. She is so lovely - always gives me a hug when I'm leaving. She had a good \"feel\" and couldn't feel any lumps however she is concerned enough about my symptoms to ask me to make an appt with my breast surgeon for asap. So, I have an appt next Wednesday and assume I'll end up having to have an ultrasound or something to take a look. My MO said she's NEVER had a patient who had local recurrance during FEC cycles (which I've just finished) and I sure do hope that I'm not her first because I know from reading on here that it's not unheard of . I'm hoping that even if it is local recurrance it will be tackled by the Taxol and Herceptin that starts tomorrow. Guess if it is though I'll be heading for a full mastectomy... My liver function tests were better this time. Two out of three of the labs are now either back down to normal levels or just sitting slightly above. My GGT however is still sitting at 175 which is only 10 units down from the 185 that it was 3 weeks ago. My MO didn't seem too concerned about it though and so I'm going to pretend to be not concerned either and just see what happens by the end of chemo and afterwards. Thanks for all your positive thoughts this morning (which was mostly your evening) everyone. Believe it or not I don't feel panicked about this and I'm sure I felt you all there with me. Jenn",

On top of everything I have liver function issues and it's causing me extra pain that's keeping me awake so my oncologist is having me get an ultrasound (next Thursday was earliest I could book) to make sure it's just a side-effect of the chemo and not something more sinister - we've already determined I don't have hepatitis... So pray/cross fingers etc that it turns out to be \"just\" another side-effect. I'm to phone and let the oncologist know when I've had my appointment and she will then go online and check the report and call me - so I should know if it's something, or nothing, by Friday afternoon next week. There's a couple of other things that are being weird/not normal at the moment too that are being checked or monitored closely over the next few weeks/couple of months - a paraovarian cyst with small solid 2mm solid spot on my right ovary so had a CA125 tumour marker blood test today to see if it's potentially a cancer, and continued soreness and lumpiness in my affected breast in a different area than the original tumour.

The thing is, because of that any further radiation for me now compounds the problem and I have a much higher risk of more cancers and heart problems than normal. I have emailed my updated info to my Rad Onc and am very interested in what she will say at our planning appt on the 22nd... I am pretty sure they will still think the benefits outweigh the risks but I just don't know on a personal level. I also have a follow-up appt with my BS next Monday and want to ask her whether with this new information she would now recommend a BMX :-( Jenn",

Just read my emails and got one from my gynae to let me know that my ca125 marker test has come back normal. This means that the cyst on my right ovary is not likely to be cancerous. Still have to go back in 2 months for a follow-up ultrasound to keep an eye on it - but good news for now!!!!!!!!  My gynae wants to whip out those pesky ovaries but I still have a few months to make that decision.

I love my job and don't want to give it up (just got a description/seniority promotion and pay rise on the same day as my surgery last week...) Also, we just did a huge renovation/modernisation on our house this year that we refinanced to do so we'll be in real trouble with maintaining the payments if I can't work this year. Typical bad timing... What do you do? I'm a cancer clinical trials coordinator running two renal cell cancer drug trials here in Australia. Mostly desk bound with an hours drive each way to work. One major problem I can forsee is that part of my job requires me to go and \"monitor\" about 4 of the hospital sites around Australia early in 2012. it's ust a day visiting the cancer centre and checking data and that everything is running ok, but this means hopping on a plane and back in a day (or with an overnight in a hotel). It's normally easy and fun but I'm thinking it's not going to be so easy now :-( regards Jenn",

She said that because they don't really know if the pneumonitis was from the Taxol or Herceptin we could choose to also stop the herceptin which would be erring on the side of caution however she was open to discussion if I felt strongly about it - which of course I did :-) So we are going the more \"gung ho\" route and choosing to keep the Herceptin going except instead of upping to the 3 weekly loading dose this Friday as planned we are continuing on weekly doses for a couple of weeks then reassessing in mid June. I really feel it's the combination of everything with the really bad cold I had for 3 weeks that brought this on. Certainly hope it doesn't prove to be the Herceptin... But, I'm now done with FEC and Taxol and looking forward to starting to feel better. The first Herceptin only dose this Friday should be interesting (and quick!). Jenn",

Today was supposed to be the last day but because of the pneumonitis I will only have done 11 of the 12 Taxol doses, just like I only did 2 of the 3 cyclophosphamide doses with FEC (I officially did 2 x FEC and 1 x FE). This week I have felt unwell from both the pneumonitis and the \"usual\" Taxol/Herceptin SEs and my hubby had an endoscopy (diagnosed hiatus hernia) and although we now know what his problem is he doesn't feel well and so there has been no celebration for my end of chemo... I'm not sure when we will celebrate since next Tuesday brings ny rads planning session and today brings my first Herceptin only infusion. It doesn't FEEL over for me... Jenn",

I got an appt with the physio dept yesterday for my ongoing shoulder, back and side pain. MO only did the referral the day before and they had a cancellation so I got a call. After a lot of testing the lovely physio found THE spot which turns out to be a rib/spinal joint. A bit of massage and then some strapping that I am supposed to leave on until my appt next week, and I left feeling so much better. I am starting rads on that side on Tuesday so I hope the rads dept won't object to the strapping on my back - they shouldn't since they are only interested in my front! I too am NOT happy about rads but everyone seems happy with my lung function after the pneumonitis and despite reading many many academic research papers I couldn't find a single one that disagreed with the fact that rads cuts the recurrance rate significantly for women like me with positive nodes. And every paper that addressed long term side effects stated that despite the risk the benefits were still significant. As a researcher myself I just have to accept that statistically I am doing the right thing even though it feels like the wrong thing.

If he is happy that I am suitable for implant recon I will have my BMX sometime between late August and the end of September :-) Since I finally decided that the risks of rads potentially outweighed the benefits for me I have been desperately trying to make this happen. This has been made difficult because my BS is pregnant and finishing up surgery in September to go on maternity leave. She is an amazing upcoming oncoplastic breast surgeon here in Australia. She specialises in mastectomies and also does implant recons but not flap surgeries. She was happy to do my surgery but because there is not enough time between now and when she finishes up to complete the fills and exchange for implants she is having to hand over the inplant process to a plastic surgeon. So now I have to meet the PS and find out if he is also happy to do the implant route despite me having had 12 days of radiotherapy before deciding not to continue. My BS was happy that I would be OK but the PS (one that is well regarded in Australia I gather) will of course have to make his own decision... If he says no my only option, since I want the BMX soon is to go ahead with the BMX and do recon later... Got to keep up my treadmill exercise and get as fit as possible between now and then! Jenn",

Called back for surgery at 3.45pm and was finished, dressed and back in the car on the way home at 6.30pm! The surgeon ended up not having any problems with the mesh in my abdomen from my recent free TRAM reconstruction, although because they knew it was there they planned my three incisions in different places than usual - upper left abdo (under my left breast), just above my belly button (normally they would go in right in it but because it has been transplanted upward during my previous surgery my PS was worried it would \"die\" so asked the gynae surgeon not to use it). The last incision was exactly along my free TRAM abdominal incision, so I only get two new scars out of this! The ovarian cyst ended up not attached to the ovary at all, but gently attached to the fallopian tube and the surgeon was able to remove the cyst without removing my ovary! The surgeon has said that due to its position he thinks there is \"almost zero\" chance of it being malignant, but I'll believe that when I see the final histology report. I'm not worrying much about it anyway. Managed to get out to the shops yesterday morning and out for dinner with some friends last night. Bit bruised and sore but this really has been amazingly not bad compared to so many things this past year. I think it would have been different if they had to take the ovary as well. The incision that is the most sore and bruised is, of course, the middle one that is right where waistbands hit :-/ Hope you are all having a good lead up to the holiday and New Year! Big hug from me! Jenn",

If there really is nothing showing up then we can all assume that this pain is a side-effect - most likely from the denosumab (bisphosphenate) as it does have \"abdominal pain radiating to the back\" listed as an SE. The problem was that we couldn't just assume that because it is a blinded trial and so I am either getting the drug or placebo and none of us knows which (although we all highly suspect I'm getting the drug based on some of the SEs, including blood anomalies, that I have been experiencing...

Better be safe and withold tx while they figure out the problem - especially since the Herceptin can cause heart probs which can cause SOB and edema. Have they scheduled a ventricular function test? Annie - congrats on the Spirit award. Sorry about the misinformation now out with your colleagues. Maybe you'll get some special treatment out of it though ;-) Barbie - sorry about all the funerals! It's a sign you have a big family and lots of friends though? I can still count on one hand the number of funerals I've been to in my whole life (very small family - now only my 84yr old mother and myself left from direct family - and she lives in another country). 6th Taxol/Herceptin yesterday afternoon - had edema in my hands before they'd even removed my port access. Nurse was a little concerned but I did tell her that I always put on 3kgs by the day after tx each week and then spend the whole week getting it back off again. Sooo tired yesterday so was a bit grumpy. Stopped to get food on the way home from tx and my husband taking the last chair and leaving me standing while we were waiting was the last straw in my grumpiness. We argued in the car on the way home :-/ Turns out he wasn't feeling well - but he didn't want to tell me. He's having stomach issues and is seeing a specialist next week. we're only 46 and 47 - way too young for all this health sh!t... Pain in my ankles and legs started not 3hrs later and it normally doesn't start until 2 days later. Also feel like I've got some balance issue happening. If this stuff is cumulative I'm going to be hardly functioning by the end of the next 7 weeks :-( Love to all! 🐨 Jenn",

I love seeing all your updates on Facebook. I still have health problems, from the treatments not the cancer, but am trying to slowly work through them all. And, I have a referral to a new oncologist since my original one and I are just sooooo not a good personality match. Hope you are all well? I've got a follow-up appt with my BS next month. Going to ask her to check a few lumps that have sprung up on my bad side. Hopefully they are just fat necrosis from the reconstruction. But you know, I'm actually not that panicked about it like I would have been a few months ago... Luv Jenn",

How did I find it? A spot in my right breast started hurting just after I finished my last period and I thought I could feel a lump. My doc said probably a cyst because \"breast cancer doesn't hurt\". The people at the beast clinic last Thursday started the day telling me that it was probably a cyst \"because breast cancer doesn't hurt\". I guess they now all know differently huh? So. Surgery this Friday and really no chance (or energy) to shop for anything much. I will have to get to a shop somewhere between prep tests for the surgery in the next two days because I don't own a SINGLE BUTTON UP SHIRT. Seriously, not even one in my wardrobe! Have done the research and would prefer to have full mastectomy with immediate recon but don't think that will be an option considering the speed of everything happening.. Will check back in later today and let you know after my appointment.

As I am Her2+ I am facing chemo, herceptin and radiotherapy and I made this decision based on recent research from Memorial Sloan Kettering (google for information) and from reading a couple of recent radiology papers that showed no difference in recurrance rates for women who had ALND with no axilla radiation and chemo and women who had positive nodes without ALND but with axilla radiation and chemo. The morbities from ALND are significantly more likely than with radiation. This view is quite new to the medical world and so many surgeons are nervous about potentially leaving some cancer in there. But if it's already in your nodes it's just as likely to be in other places too so that doesn't really make sense. Because I turned down the clearance I went and had a staging CT scan yesterday (not standard practice here in Australia) and it came back with no evidence of mets anywhere (brain, chest, abdo, pelvis and specifically no more seen in my axilla). For any micro-mets the rest of my treatment should wipe them out which will leave my main area of likely return to be my brain. Hopefully we've caught it before anything has sneaked on up there... I am a cancer clinical trials coordinator so may understand a whole lot more about odds ratios, survival curves and p-values but there is a whole lot of plain english information available that you should be able to find that should help you determine if you fit the criteria for non-clearance. regards Jenn",

HOWEVER there is a huge difference in the risk of getting lymphedema. With total ALND the risk is up around 30%. With SNB and rads the risk is between 7 and 10% (confirmed by both my MO and RO and according to a few research papers). I was in the same position as you a few months ago and have chosen rads. If I had chosen a BMX or SMX it was likely the RO would have still recommended some rads based on the size and LVI in the node anyway - and then therisk of LE would have been even higher. I've also looked at the stats (more research papers) on supra-clavicular rads and have determined that it only gives a 1-2% benefit share of the rads so have said no to it. Being an oncology clin trial coordinator myself means I'm very stats driven and am quite firm (and sensible) about personal risks vs benefits analysis for me... Jenn",

Short term: burns, swelling, rash, fatigue Long term definite: permanent loss of some lung function (varies based on your individual plan), permanent area of fibrosis in lung, rib damage that leaves your ribs likely to break. If on the left side there will be a small area of your heart damaged. Mid to Long term potential: pneumonitis, lymphedema, ongoing pain, shrinkage of the radiated breast, petechiae (broken blood vessels at skin level), fibrosis of cardiac veins, brachial plexopathy - damage to the brachial plexus causing permanent loss of arm function (more likely with rads to supraclavicular area), leukaemia, other cancers of the breast and chest area. Hope that helps. I am one that has forgone rads for early stage and am keeping it in my list for if I end up with recurrence or mets. You'll see in my sig though, that I am throwing everything else at it. Jenn",

She said that no matter how refined they can get the plan for someone there will always be a portion of lung hit with enough rads to cause permanent damage and fibrosis. The reality is that most of the lung will get hit with some level of rads, and because of the angles some will get hit with more. The acceptable % of total lung volume (both lungs) being affected is up to 20%. My rads plan (which she showed me) ended up having both of my lungs being completely hit to some level and 16% of my right lung being hit with enough to cause permanent fibrosis. As I said in my first message, you need to ask your RO to explain it all to you. Although I work in cancer research I am not a RO, and neither is anyone else here. What you can get on here are personal opinions based on mostly incomplete knowledge of the facts. regards Jenn",

These stray cancer cells can settle somewhere and either start growing straight away or just sit dormant for a period of time before starting to divide and grow again. Breast cancer cells like to set up camp in bones, liver and brain... If your original tumor was estrogen positive the stray cells will also likely be estrogen positive, which means they use estrogen as a trigger/food for growing. Research has shown that by blocking the amount of estrogen available the cancer cells may be prevented from growing again in those other parts of the body. This is why estrogen positive women are asked to use estrogen blockers and/or have their ovaries removed if they are premenopausal (your ovaries produce the majority of the estrogen circling your body). regards Jenn",

If something happens and you are not coping will you still be able to change your mind, or have your doctor change it for you? I worked through 3 x FEC and 9 x Taxol/Herceptin. In 5 months I had around 20 sick leave days (mostly 1/2 days) because the chemo hit me hard. I ended up taking the last 2.5 weeks of chemo off on doctor's orders when I got pneumonitis! My workplace is very flexible and I was able to work from home when I needed as well. I started chemo as a fit active 46yr old and finished as a sick exhausted 47yr old. I am 2 weeks past my last Taxol/Herceptin. I have travelled interstate this week for a work trip (part of my job is to go out to oncology clinics and check they are running my clinical trials correctly). I worked a full day at a site yesterday, was in bed by 7.30pm and cried at the thought of getting up this morning I am so tired... I start rads in just under 2 weeks so I had to fit this trip inbetween... Jenn",

I was diagnosed on 1st December 2011, had a wide local excision with 1 sentinal node removed on the 9th of December and am now due to meet the oncologist his coming Thursday to get \"the plan\" with all the dates for chemo. I already have an appt set-up with the radiologist on the 17th of January as well. My sentinal node was 5mm with extra-capsullar (0.6mm) extension however I declined ALND this week after doing some reading of the latest research. Since I'm ER+ PR+ Her2+ I'm up for the full gammut of chemo and radiation and herceptin and hormone therapy anyway. Feel very good about this decision since a CT scan (brain, chest, abdo, pelvis) this week showed no signs of residual disease in my axilla or anywhere else :-) regards Jenn",

I am still in the middle of my tx but have been able to remain working full time with accommodations. Since I am overseeing two oncological drug trials (one adjuvant therapy and one in advanced cancer) I am finding the hardest thing is having so many AE/SE reports coming past me every day. I now relate to them on a personal level where I didn't before... I can't imagine working directly in an oncological setting in a hospital. If I worked directly in a hospital I think I'd have to work in a different area... Jenn",
