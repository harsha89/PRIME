I am a 41 yr old who about 2 months ago found a lump on my left breast.I went in to my doctor about a month ago...and he felt what he called thickening on my breast.He sent me for a momogram and ultrasound and I had that and they said the mamo was normal but the ultrasound showed 2 spots at 1 showing a calcification ,they think, and at 6  showing a cluster of cysts,tthey think.They said they are sure it's not cancer,but they want to do a core biopsy. My question is why do they have to do this core biopsy if they think its nothing,and Im a big baby,so does it hurt??",
