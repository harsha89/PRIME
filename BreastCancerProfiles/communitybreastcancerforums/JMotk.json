I have to mention something really cool though- I was at the drug store, during my first trip out of the house, weeks ago.  CVS to be exact, and I was looking for some waterproof bandaids to cover up my drainage holes.  I spotted a package of C-section scar strips.  Hmmmm, I thought to myself.  Wouldn't C-section strips be the same shape/size as mastectomy scars?  I bought them and wow - they're awesome.  Super simple, silicone strips with gummy adhesive to keep them in place.  You wear them every day over the scar and wash them with soap and water to renew the adhesive.  Use them for 14 days straight and throw them away, replacing with new strips.  $15 for 8 strips.  My scars look awesome.  It's cool too since it protects the scars from any friction, so I don't even notice during the day like I did that first month. If you don't have a CVS near you, check it out online so you know what I'm talking about.  Online, I saw only the name brand version, but CVS carries their own brand which is identical, $7 cheaper and you get twice as many sheets. http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/ScarAway-Silicone-Scar-Sheets-for-C-Sections?skuId=854239 Also, I got my prosthetics last week and feel pretty good in public now.  Amazing how normal I look.  I get double takes from friends that know about my surgery since suddenly I have these bumps that \"aren't supposed to be there\".  Overall, my head is good and I'm looking forward to the next step (TEs), even though it means a lot of pain (so I hear).",

My first post began in a different section of the boards but feel like this is a more appropriate place to linger. Your stories are touching, heartfelt and moving. Thank you, all of you for sharing your stories. It helped me to make the right decision in the last few weeks. My other post and short story, prior to today, can be found here. community.breastcancer.org/for... If anyone is here, looking for insight on PBM, I would be happy to share. I am a patient with Kaiser Permanente in the east SF Bay area, CA.",
