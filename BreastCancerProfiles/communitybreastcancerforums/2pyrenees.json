These discussion boards have been such a huge help to me. I have a sense of 'survivors guilt' after reading what so many others are having to go through that I don't have to or won't have to go through myself. I had my port installed this past Wednesday and my first treatment the next day with the neulasta shot yesterday. All went very well and smooth and So far, I feel really well. I do feel like I'm a ticking SE bomb waiting to go off though. The anticipation of what might be is tough for me. I have a very supportive boss and work environment. My boss wants me to focus on my health first and foremost. Not everybody is so lucky to have such wonderful supportive employers. My advice is to take it one day at a time, listen to your body and don't over exert yourself. Work as much as you feel up to and don't worry about the days your not up to it. I'm sure there are others with experience that will comment as well, but wanted to share as a fellow newbie. Love, prayers and hugs to all, ❤️ Julie",
