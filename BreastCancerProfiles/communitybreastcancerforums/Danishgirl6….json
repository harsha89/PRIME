My TM's seem to be a pretty good indication of what is going on with the ILC in my abdomen. After about two months my TM's started going down and four months after that were in the normal range. A CT showed no evidence of disease. Yay! NED! MO stopped the Halaven. Then about 5 months later the TM's started going up again. The Halaven worked before so why not use it again. TM's went down again and I've been off Halaven since late October. CT in November showed something suspicious in thoracic and lumbar spine. PET showed NED. I asked my MO how he could be sure since ILC can be very hard to diagnose from scans. He said it showed very clearly 1 1/2 years ago. I'd love to say I feel great, but I still have some abdominal pain. Lots of pain from neuropathy and generally achy but no problem getting around. Both times I lost about 1/2 hair on Halaven, but it grew back in the six months off and is growing back again. I'm still feeling a lot of fatigue but not as much as when I'm on Halaven. Right now I'm on Faslodex and Aromasin but I'm pretty sure I will be back on Halaven when my TM's start to go up. I also take Protonix for acid reflux and Ursodiol for a \"sandy gallbladder\" I hope this was of help to somebody and that we all can find that magic that will give us a little more time. ",
