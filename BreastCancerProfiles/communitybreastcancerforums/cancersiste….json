It takes forever to get back test results, and everytime we do it's been bad news. This has been hard on us both. My heart cries for you all. I am terrified for my sister. Now, she has recently stared chemo, had her second treatment last Thursday. Has lost almost all of her hair, she's a hair dresser, has been for last thirty years. Now, she is getting black or purple dots on her head. I am sooo worried for her. So, I have never used the chat room before. Really I'm not very good with computers. But, I have to try to find answers for my sister.This has been devistating for her. And I have always been the stronger one of the two of us, and taken care or watched over my sister, all of our lives. Now I feel at a loss. This a toooo big for me, and I can't make it go away. Why didn't I get this instead of her, I'm the stronger one? Oh, sorry to go on like this. The last thing you need is someone putting more stress on you, I don't mean to.And I know you probably don't have any answers for me, just Never chatted to anyone before, am new to this, and found myself unleashing. Sorry, just realized I have been holding it all in, didn't mean to let it all start coming out. Triing to be strong for my sister. I'll let you go. Just know your not alone. God blesss you, cancersister",
