My wife has stage 4 breast cancer also. When she and I were given the news, I cried harder than I ever remember crying. I could barely drive us home and pulled over several times to try and regain my composure. That day is etched in my mind for all eternity. As we drove home I remember looking at all the other people in the cars around me going about their business. I couldn't believe that the world was not coming to a stop while we sat in shock. How could this be happening. My wife sat in her seat staring out the windshield. All I could think of is, what could be going through her mind at that moment? I thought of my son and two daughters growing up without their mother. I knew that there was no way that I could take the place of this beautiful person they know as mom. I was petrified at the thought of them not learning all the things that only a mother could teach them. That was 12 years ago. My son is out of the house with kids of his own, and my youngest daughter is away at college for her second year. We are now alone in our home trying to make the best of our lives. Please do not waste any of your life worrying about what will happen. This last week my wife and I found out the she has a spot of cancer on her sternum. My biggest fear was that she would waste her time thinking about things that will not matter once she was out of time. Who knows how long down the line that will be. I did not think she would last this long in the beginning. I kept my thoughts to myself so she could focus on living. We both had to learn to adapt. I have now learned to just love her and the time we share right now. Cancer is not an immediate death sentence unless you give up. We have decided to take a loan against her life insurance so we can have some fun. She would not take it against mine because she is convinced that she will still outlive me. It could happen. I think I worry more about her worry than she does. The furthest thing from your husbands mind is moving on. He loves you, he married you, and you will always be in his heart.",
