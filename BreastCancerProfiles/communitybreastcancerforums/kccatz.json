It took about a month for all the testing to be completed and the bad news to come - stage IV, grade 3, 5+ cm, ER+, HER2+. I was just put on femara and took my 4th pill last night. I have a lot of confidence in my doctor and am told he's one of the best in the area, but just taking 1 little pill doesn't give me any confidence that I'm really fighting this aggressively. I understand the process mentally but emotionally I want him to do mascectomy, radiation, chemo, the works. Could really use some words of support.

He did have a surgeon put a port in before all the test results were in, although I think he was initially thinking it wasn't going to be stage IV. I don't really know how long I should be patient with Fermara before I tell him I want to try something more. Hoping he knows best, but he does state whatever I want he will do.",

But connecting with others in this situation is so important to me. Hopefully, after I get over the shock, I can be a source of support for everyone else here.",
