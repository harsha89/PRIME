I consider myself a pretty rational and tough gal, but waiting for results & answers has really turned thrown me into an emotional tailspin! I was supposed to get my results on Monday but am still waiting. Hang in there girl! This site & gals/guy are very knowledgeable and supportive. Keep us posted & remember that little hummingbird visit when you're feeling down! -Terri",

It's very nerve wracking to put our lives and future on hold while we uncover what's going on. I was didiagnosed with LCIS 2 weeks ago & undergoing lumpectomy on Weds to be sure of no upgrade. So it's been 2 long months waiting for results. Hopefully by Friday I'll have answers. Love to you all! ðŸ’“",

It was more of a twinge feeling when they did the 4 cores. It definitely does sound like a staple gun though, so don't be alarmed. Plus no matter what, you are one step closer to answers!!! As far as work goes, I was a bit pooped from it so Itook that day off, but as long as you don't lift a bunch of things, you'll be be fine. Oh and good luck! Sending b9 wishes your way!",
