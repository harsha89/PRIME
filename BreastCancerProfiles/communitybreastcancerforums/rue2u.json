Had 4 month peroid during AC chemo and then stopped periods during rads. Haven't had a period for about 1 1/2 years and now spotting again. Have had two pelvic ultrasounds and now my second endometrial biopsy. Have stopped Tamoxifen for the moment. Hope to get results on Friday. Actually have a grandmother who died of uteran cancer so I was quite apprehensive about starting Tamoxifen. Hoping for B9. Thanks all! Rue Log in to post a reply",

Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. Rue",
