Several Dr.s have noted lumps, fibrosis, thickening etc. and the mammogram and ultrasound both came back normal. However, I still have a firm painful spot in the same place in my left breast for over 5 months now. And intermittent discharge. I am going to see a breatst surgeon this week and I want to ask for a biopsy. Furthermore, why aren't they testing my hormone levels? I am having anovulatory periods 2x a month, so tired I fall asleep as soon as I sit still, changes in my vision, light headedness and nausea. I just want to know what is going on. I am in the best shape of my life and this doesn't make sense. All I keep hearing is that I am too young to worry about menopause and breast cancer and that since the mammogram and ultrasound are normal, it \"must\" be nothing! I am not convinced it is cancer , I just want to know what is going on with my body. Should I insist on further testing or do I just wait it out some more and except that they are Dr.s and they know better than me? Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.

My hope is that the surgeon will have a real answer for me. I chose a Dr. with 30 years experience and rave reviews. I am concerned that something is being missed and will lead to a late stage diagnosis. The initial shock of the possiblity was pretty scary but, I am passed all of that now and have a fierce drive to find out \"what\" rather than worry about what if. Thank you for responding.",

      "Content": "May 20, 2012 10:03PM - edited May 20, 2012 10:05PM by dustyGreen What concerns me most is that of the 3 doctors I have seen, they all seem to focus on my age. 34. They have all found something worth looking into but say that since the radiologist says the imaging is \"normal\" they aren't willing to dig deeper. I do have new symptoms. I have discharge from the same breast as the pain. The pain is now in my armpit and it hurts when I raise my arm at times. While the pain is constant, it hurts more sometimes than others. Not to mention, I am having hot flashes and I can not get enough sleep. I don't know what this is all about but I know without a doubt that something needs to be figured out. I am not convinced I have cancer however, I am convinced that what is going on is not \"normal\" and I want to know the \"what\". I feel like they are missing something because they are focusing less on what I am feeling and the fact that this pain and discharge and lumps than they are on my age. The fact that I did not have health coverage was not a big seller either. I am now covered by BCCP to see this through.",

If the surgeon says there is nothing for me to be concerned with, I will accept that and move on. That is the position I have decided to take. I am only worried because for me, this has not been normal before 6 months ago. I am , however, prepared to accept this as a new normal. I couldn't agree more that there are many other options next to biopsy. The question, I should have posted was, \" What would be a logical next/last step?\" My PCP, GYN and a Naturopath all feel the area that I feel and all 3 are curious as to why it did not show up on the imaging. With the exception to the Naturopath, who felt 2 areas rather than 1. So, as I risk repeating myself, I am pushing forward to find out what is going on with ME and not what is \"normal\". I have not always had the best experiences with physicians and I don't trust them from the start. That is my problem. I , simply, will not stop until I have an answer. No matter what that answer may be, I will accept it after Tuesday. Thank you again for sharing your experience with me.",

LOL I have been trying not to pin all my hopes into today but, to no avail. I am nervous and anxious. Not excited but an equivalent. It has been a long road leading to today. I have felt so yucky lately too and having, what I suspect anyway are, hot flashes. Now that the day is here that could finally provide some answers, it feels a bit odd. Like when you are getting ready to sign papers on a house. It all seemed like a good idea in the beginning. Now that the day is here, I am second guessing my feelings. How bad is this pain, really? Would you really consider this a lump? Tired, everyone is tired. Nauseous, maybe not? I am so sure most of you know this thought process. I was telling my sister in law last night that I am more scared of NOT knowing anything again today. She said, \" So, do you WANT them to find cancer?\" She was serious! I told her in my most I know you are not that stupid, voice. Of course I don't WANT them to tell me this is fu&*^%$ cancer! I NEED to know what is wrong so I can begin to heal and move forward. I have been on virtual treadmill for nearly a year and I want off!! I am thinking of all of you today. $2000 later and hopefully, we will know. Â  Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.

I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted for me. We saw \"it\". I saw it. She showed it to me or them, rather. I saw one directly where I hurt and it was about the size of a nickel. The other was near my nipple and much smaller . I don't feel that one. Anyway, I am so okay with waiting now because we are FINALLY moving forward!!!!! Praise GOD!",

I also have this almost constant \"wet\" feeling on my nipple. My armpit hurts now too. I have been short of breath, even at night. Anxiety? Probably. I am so tired that I have been napping every day and I NEVER nap. I have always been good on 4-6 hours of sleep and now I just can't get enough. Could be depression. The pain is so terrible =( I can't hardly lay on my left side. So much change in about 5 days...They moved up my MRI to Monday because my symptoms have worsened. I am having to pay over $2000 out of pocket and I am scared that it will not show anything again. I am trying so hard to be brave and strong but all I want to do is go to bed and wake up Monday. This isn't a very positive message and I am sorry. I can't talk to anyone else right now because they are tired of hearing my concern. Everyone aroud me is convinced that nothing is wrong and I just need to move on because the mammogram and ultra sound were normal. I am even starting to wonder if I am completely nuts? Monday will be here soon enough and then I will either be one step closer or be stopped in my tracks because I have no more tests to do.Â  Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.

My left breast feels warmer in the area that hurts but no redness. Also, my left breast has always been my small breast and now it has caught up with the right. Sometimes the bottom of that same nipple, turns in. I haven't reported this as a symptom because it isn't constant so I believe it is just coincedence. The pain is the worst which is another reason, I feel, this is taking so long. I would like to add that I have seen 4 Drs and a Surgeon and ALL of them can feel \"it\" but they all have said it is \" probably \" nothing. I want to say \" I am not paying you for probably!
