I have a tremendous amount of support at home but finding a community like this where women are going through the exact thing I'm about to embark on makes the journey a little less scary. I'm 36 mother of 4 and I found a lump in my left breast in early March. I know my body and it just didn't feel right. Went in today for an Ultrasound and Mammogram and doctor said that the mass is \"highly suspicious\" and that my lymph nodes on left side are also highly suspicious. Overall Birad score of 5. They sent my report to surgeon and that office called me same day to schedule biopsy and consult. My appt is on Monday at 9am. I'm freaking out. How did you cope? Hugs and prayers my way please!
