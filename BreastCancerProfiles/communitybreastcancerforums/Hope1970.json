It's to be expected with all you have to process and a good cry can be very therapeutic too! I have an 11 year old daughter (as well as a 21 year old away at college in the US), who sees my chemo as an opportunity to give me a make-over. She envisioned me in a long, curly, blonde wig and false eyelashes! This coupled with my new fake breasts conjures up images of an aging drag queen......fortunately I was able to dissuade her and we left the wig shop with a short, sleek brown bob. It looked awesome in the store but when I tried to recreate the look at home it resembled an ill fitting toupee! A friend sent a link for yoga and meditation and I have been doing the meditation for children whose parents have breast cancer with my daughter. Although she initially dismissed the idea, we actually had fun with it and it helped open up a good dialogue. I find breathing exercises helpful to combat anxiety too. For anyone interested here is the info: This website has many resources on it: http://yogabeing.net. The yoga cd is downloadable for free. On Soundcloud.com, under Yoga Being; there are hours of meditation for patients as well as caregivers. Another good resource is: www.headcovers.com They have an inexpensive selection of head coverings, beauty products for people with cancer and wigs too. A friend who has been hairless for 8 years recommended their site and especially their eyebrow tattoos, which she found easier to use than drawing them on daily. Honestly, at the moment appearance is the least of my concerns, but my 11 year old daughter seems anxious about all the upcoming changes. I'm making the effort for her sake. She seems reassured if I can appear as \"normal\" as possible. I have mentioned The Cancer-Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz before, but as I devoured her chicken vegetable soup with ginger meatballs following my 1st infusion yesterday, I wanted to mention it again those of you who might be interested and missed it on my 1st post. I had my first AC yesterday and am feeling great! No nausea and a good appetite too! I was given a regime of medications to combat the side effects of chemo and have been following it closely. It's been much better than anticipated! I'd been advised to suck on pineapple juice ice-pops and to drink 3L of water the 1st day. I sucked on the pops and ice throughout my infusion. I am not sure if all the water helped flush out the toxins (only had 2 instances of red urine(lol) from the \"red devil\", but it's worth a try. I am in Germany and am being given G-CSF instead of Neulasta. I was surprised to see that my 1st shot is scheduled on day 5 following chemo and then for the next consecutive 5 days. I will be getting blood checked on a weekly basis. I had asked the Dr. if G-CSF was the same as Neulasta and about the off-label use of Claritin for combating side effects. She seemed confused about the Claritin but confirmed the drug serves the same purpose. I think there is a little bit of a language barrier because later the nurse came back with a prescription for Neulasta. However as I'd already spent over 600 Euro on the G-CSF, I didn't think my insurance would be happy:)! Maybe I'll use it for the next round. Is there any downside to using the Claritin? The Dr. here advised me to use Ibuprofen for the pain. Another tip I picked up in the waiting room is to wear dark colored nail polish to protect the nails from UV and prevent them from flaking. I believe there are natural products available. Good luck on your journeys! Be well!",

      "Content": "Jun 8, 2017 03:27AM - edited Jun 8, 2017 03:58PM by Hope1970 MomAngel- I too had been worried about starting Chemo and I have had no serious/debilitating side effects. The most pronounced SE I had was fatigue. I also had red cheeks and swelling from the Cortisone for a couple of days. Although it was way better than anticipated, I was not 100% myself for 7 days after the treatment. I had been told that day 2 and 3 would be the worst but I didn't didn't notice a difference in the 7 days following Chemo. Has anyone else had this experience? My typical day started with a 45 min walk in the morning followed by a scaled back version of my usual activities. After lunch the fatigue hit and couldn't be ignored.....I couldn't function and needed to nap!! By the time my daughter got home from school I was able to rouse myself and get through the afternoon/evening and take another walk. After day 7 energy levels and sleep patterns returned to normal. I have a few little side effects( dripping nose, last night I had a sore throat and mouth but it's gone today). The suggestion to drink lots of water is a good one- I was told to drink 3L on Chemo day and I ended up drinking more and like to think it helped because it's easy to do. Also, in Germany and fresh air and exercise are stressed during chemo. I was very careful about what I ate initially (eliminated sugar and alcohol, reduced caffeine and sodium, increased protein (cottage cheese, eggs, fish, chicken etc.) Then I had such an overwhelming craving for Indian food, which I pigged out on for 2 days! Now that I'm feeling good again, I wish I didn't have my second infusion in a few days. It seems silly to dread it given that my 1st treatment went better than expected, but that's how I feel. I want to cherish each moment of normalcy while it lasts! Also, I really admire the ladies who are continuing to work during treatment because I am not sure how I would be able to manage a full schedule with my afternoon fatigue. NCBeachGirl, Sorry to hear about your SE. I hope you wake up feeling better and don't need an emergency room visit. msrobin58, glad to hear you are feeling well! There had been mention of an alternative to Neulasta. I am taking it. It's G-CFS. My schedule started 5 days after the 1st EC (AC in the USA) infusion. It needed to be injected at approximately the same time for 5 days, which is not convenient. I'd looked up a comparison between the 2 drugs and the molecules in Neulasta have been modified ( I'm a little fuzzy on this now, but I believe enlarged for slow release). FYI-A comparison of SE's on a chart I found online showed less bone pain with G-CSF. I didn't have any bone pain, but got a slight rash on my upper arms. But who knows which drug caused this. Hair- My Dr. said I should expect it to fall out after the 1st treatment. On day 11 I am not seeing any signs of this happening. In fact I have gray roots showing through and hairy legs and armpits so it seems to be growing. Did others have this and then did it suddenly fall out? Emotions- I had my 1st melt down over the weekend (at least since my surgery,subsequent emergency surgery and 3rd surgery). It was brought on by something small....like my husband speaking in a slightly irritable tone . Clearly I needed an excuse to break down and cry and get it out of my system. Funny thing- my tears really burnt my eyes and face, which made me cry all the harder(lol). It was worth it because I felt better afterwards. Reconstructed breasts/ possible side effect- I had an immediate reconstruction using silicone implants following my double mastectomy. The lymph node involvement was not anticipated so going into surgery I didn't think I'd be needing chemo/radiation. Would have delayed reconstruction had I known. Does anyone else have reconstructed breasts? Have you noticed changes since starting chemo? I have noticed changes in the one breast over the last couple of days...2 small pea- sized bumps, lumpiness and discoloration. I have sent pics to Dr and am waiting to hear back. It's very frustrating to try and get in to see him! Wishing everyone the best moving forward. Something occurred to me yesterday and made me chuckle. One positive about going through Chemo is it sets the bar really low regarding people's expectations..... people say you look great just for showing up!",

I have been feeling very ambivalent about the chemo (honestly I have moments of pure unadulterated fear and am still questioning if it's the best decision). I am relatively young (46) and my youngest daughter is 11 so I am deciding to embrace whatever treatment is at my disposal to prevent recurrence (the challenge is getting my mind 100% on board). However, I have also known of people who have continued to work through chemo and have no long-term side effects from the treatment. On the difficult days I am going to focus on the idea \"this too will pass\" . On the ILC forum someone posted about fasting during chemo to reduce her side effects. She credited this with the fact that she had no long-term neuropathy. Has anyone heard of this? I'll be having an appointment for chemo tomorrow so hopefully will learn about ways to reduce side effects. I am an American (originally South African) living in Frankfurt. The center here has psychologists who specialize in oncology and will attend chemo appointments with you. I think I'll take advantage of this at least for the 1st time! My lymph node involvement was unexpected and before surgery chemo was not being recommended. I also needed an emergency surgery to stop excessive bleeding following reconstruction and a 3rd surgery to ensure clean margins. Because of this and personal factors (we were due to leave Germany on 7/14 and head to Qatar) I was experiencing a lot of anxiety in the hospital . Demetria, I can really empathize with your racing thoughts in the middle of the night. I hope you know you are not alone in this experience. As I am 6 hours ahead if you message me privately I'll give you my # and when you are struggling in the early hours of the morning and everyone is sleeping, I can be there so you are not alone. I met with the onco- psychologist when I was in hospital. Demetria if this option is available to you, I would recommend it. My session was very helpful and she was able to help me gain perspective and answer a lot of my questions regarding complementary therapies based on her other patients' experiences. She cautioned against taking supplements without consulting your medical team but said that many of her patients found acupuncture (only to be done by Dr trained in acupuncture) to be helpful. For me, I struggle with the thought that I am not in control in this situation but to regain some sense of power over this, I try and influence what I can i.e diet, exercise etc. I got a great book, \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen\", which has suggestions on recipes and foods that help during chemo. I am wishing you all the greatest success with your treatments; we'll get through this! ",

Re: UTI I am being given Uromitexan ( In Germany so I'm not sure if this is the name in the U.S) to be taken 2 hours and 4 hours after the Cyclophosophamid infusion to prevent UTI. I'm only into day 3 of 1st infusion so I'm not sure if it's successful. Maybe this is standard practice and you are already taking it. msrobin58, I hope you are successful in getting the nausea under control for your next treatment. It'll make a huge difference to how you feel! I seem to have a huge appetite at the moment....expect to gain 15 pounds by my next weigh in:). That's rough about the WBC count. With it so low, are you able to go out for walks? I have been advised by my center that walking and fresh air are good for building the immune system and combating fatigue. Of course, if you are feeling nauseous this is probably not appealing. cedarlake 17- Thanks for the tip re:icing. I'll keep it in mind for my Taxol treatments, which will follow EC. My Dr had told me about it, but I wasn't sure how it was done. I appreciate the tips! Just wanted to thank the ladies who are further into their journeys for sharing. It's very helpful to those of us who are just beginning!  ",

MsLin and Robin58, it's great to hear you are able to resume gardening. It is important to be able to reconnect and maintain those aspects of our lives that give us pleasure as we confront our treatments. Last Monday I had my 2nd EC infusion. Like the first time, the side effects were manageable and lasted for about 5 days. Something new I experienced, which I hadn't before, were dizzy spells and impaired concentration when it came to driving etc. Not sure if this is \"Chemo\"/ other drugs but I found it a little disconcerting and I was unable to collect my daughter from a trip....poor kid was stranded until my husband could pick her up 2 hours later. Thankfully the earth is once again stable and I'm able to function normally! Has anyone else experienced this? Clinic checked blood pressure etc. and all was normal. I have joined a \"Yoga for Menschen mit Krebs\" (yoga class for cancer patients) and am also practicing at home. I had practiced yoga 3 times/week for years, but needed to take a break because of surgery. It feels great to resume some of my old activities, even if they are scaled down and modified. I am learning the life lesson of patience but am encouraged to see my body strengthening and become more flexible every day. It's a reminder to me of how are bodies are able to regenerate. Even if these treatments knock us, over time we will regain our strength and resilience! My latest favorite resource that I'd like to share with those who are interested is : Yoga for Cancer: A Guide to Managing Side Effects, Boosting Immunity and Improving recovery for Cancer Survivors by Tara Prinster. This contains interesting scientific info that is readily accessible to a lay person. Thanks Notanisland for providing the food tips. On the subject of mouth sores and taste changes, so far I haven't experienced any but wanted to mention that The Cancer-Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz also has info re: foods that stimulate the taste buds, foods to avoid etc. She lists common ingredients and their benefits for cancer patients as well as providing menus to combat specific side effects, such as Leukopenia, fatigue, constipation, nausea and vomiting sore mouth and difficulty swallowing etc. Her info is also scientific and accessible. Her book contains many delicious and easy recipes too (although my 11 year old would disagree). Here are her suggestions for the following: Metallic tasting- sweetener (maple syrup), squeeze of lemon, fat (nut cream or butter) Too sweet tasting- 6 drops lemon/lime and increase amt in small increments until the sweet taste becomes muted Things taste too salty-1/4 teaspoon lemon juice Too bitter-maple syrup Everything tastes like Cardboard - more sea salt and spritz of lemon Hair- 21 days after 1st treatment, one week after 2nd treatment and a full head of mangy, unhealthy looking hair. Not sure if it was my husband reflexively covering his plate whenever I passed by to protect his food from an avalanche of hair/ the time I spent on the bathroom floor surrounded by hair and sobbing, but I headed out 1st thing this morning to get my head shaved. I was hoping to pull off a Sinead O'Connor look but I am stunned to realize I look like a convict ( Perhaps I have missed my true calling...... aha, maybe if I look scary enough, my kids will finally listen to me)!! What surprised me is how sensitive and intense the sensation in my scalp is. Anything tight-fitting ( those cute little turban type caps I'd invested in, the wig etc) is uncomfortable. I am hoping this intense feeling subsides. What is the most comfortable is the silk head scarf I bought ( think it'll be comfortable in the heat too) . For those interested headcovers.com has a great affordable collection as well as info on tying head scarves, other products/resources for cancer patients etc. Here's the link for tying headscarves: https://www.headcovers.com/resources/hats-scarves/... Wishing everyone a wonderful week! ",
