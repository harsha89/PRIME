      "Content": "HopeFaithCourage wrote: Hello ladies. I got pet scan results this morning. I cried all day. Got lots of love. Feel calm and better now but I need advice. I don't want my stage 4 handled like \"keeping me comfortable \" until the end. Some background: Nov 2012 dx with 5 cm lump. Triple negative. 1 left armpit node positive. 1 mamallary node positive. Given ACT. Double mastectomy. Residual tumor something like 0.9 cm. Radiation to left chest wall and armpit. Chronic pain. Left arm lymphedema. That took care of 2013. 2014 pain continued. Went back to work. No insurance. No cancercare. Finally at end of 2014 pain had progressed to unbearable in sternum. was in denial and beyond exhausted. February 2015 dx with cancer in sternum. Radiologist said too dangerous to biopsy. More radiation. Abraxane and carbo had allergic reaction to carbo. About 5 months ago took a chemo break for sons wedding and I w as exhausted. Pain well managed. Cat scan showed no progression and stable disease. I started exercising. Ride my bike now slow and steady up to an hour a day since beginning of august. I've had tissue changes. Complained to mo of neck discomfort. Chest pain. Swelling and tissue changes. Mo still said I w as on my way to remission when I asked him. Tumor markets times 3 showed an upward trend even though they were only slightly high. I went to mo mad. Took of my shirt. Mind you know one ever examines me anymore. Showed him the rash. Redness. Tight dimpling. Swelling. He was very worried over rash. Took almost a month to get to dermatologist for biopsy. It's cancer in my skin. Not enough tumir in tissue to get further pathology from the sample Pet scan yesterday. Today was chemo. I went to doc office to ask to speak to his nurse to get results. Doc comes out. And said it has spread. Discussed he will be adding avastan to abraxane next week. He said it will not increase the lemgth of my life but will keep the disease under control. I asked if we will be doing rads again. He said no. ????? Nodes in neck and throughout thoracic region from neck down to diaphragm. Multiple tumors. Sternum eneveloped. Tumor behind port. No evidence of bone destruction. Here's the short part of the report . The impression of the radiation doc. Metastatic disease in the right multiple level 4 nodes. Extensive disease in the neck 6 going to the area of around the manibrium and between the clavicle heads. Subpectorally nodes multiple. Positive Bilateral . Increased activity on or adjacent to left anterior rib image 90 without evidence of rib destruction. Could be in the pleura or the rib. Right axillary adenopathy. Then it talks about my sternum and at least 4 lesions in my liver. The report is pretty detailed here. Is it possible that I lit up in chest like a Christmas tree from inflammation from exercise or injury? I'm going to ask for biopsies too. Any advice on other things to request would be greatly appreciated. Besides the obvious pain , mostly discomfort in chest and beck I'm stronger then I've been in two years. I don't want to be treated palliatively. I want to be treated as though we believe remission can happen. Help! I looked up images and anatomy so I have a pretty good idea of the location of places mentioned. One place is deep in my face in a fossa in there. A fossa is like a naturally occurring hole.

My jean size is 22 but a little loose. I carry my weight in my srms and belly. My arms are heavy so I can't do sleeveless.

It worries me I've not on chemotherapy! It's taking sometime getting records transferred! But yay me! I was scared to make the change but I really needed too!

I just completed 4 weeks of radiation to my sternum where there was bone mets and significant pain. I see my mo Monday and I'm having difficulty creating a list of questions to ask about treatment options. I don't know what to ask for. His last visit he said there are no right or wrong answers but I can do chemo if I want. I'm getting a shot once a month to rebuild bone. I'm reading a lot but still not putting it all together. I do know I want to be proactive and fight. Waiting for the next met is not ok Thank you!
