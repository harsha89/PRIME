      "Content": "Dec 28, 2007 05:09PM - edited Dec 28, 2007 10:59PM by dkmaustx I don't see a GYN regularly, my Primary doc, a Family Practice Doctor, does all my check ups and PAP smears and such. I don't think I saw her at all during the diagnosis process after she sent me for my regular screening mammogram after my Annual check up last Dec. I had the mammo on Dec 5, an Ultra Sound on Dec 12, and a needle biopsy on Dec 19. The surgeon called me 2 days later and said we needed to talk the next morning and to bring someone with me. After the lumpectomy in early Jan 2007, the surgeon asked me which oncologist I wanted to go to. I found the closest cancer center to my house and picked one of those doctors. I liked him and everyone I met there. I think I went back to my Primary doc sometime in June when the cancer center found something they didn't handle in one of my tests.",

I went one step at a time, reading just what I needed to know for that day or week. Chemo wasn't too bad for me; I was able get help for every side effect that I had. I'm glad that my husband was able to take me and pick me up, though.  I'm sorry your husband can't be with you in person as you are going through this. I hope you have a friend or other relative to go to appointments with you, though. It helps to have another pair of ears. As cmb said sometimes you just have to cry before you can move on. There are many people here ready to offer help and advice. I usually had a list of questions for my doctors. They were patient with me and answered all of them.",

Luckily I had my teeth cleaned 2 days before my lumpectomy and wasn't due to for another until just after Chemo was done. All through Chemo my blood counts were at good levels and always back in the normal range before the next treatment. I scheduled my dental cleaning and check up 3 weeks after my last chemo, to make sure I'd be strong enough.",
