She was diagnosed right off with 3 different breast cancers at once. In her right breast was a large ER/PR+, 100% estrogen, Grade 1 tumor. Inside that was an ER/PR+ 30% grade 3 tumor. In 9 of her 19 lymph nodes removed was triple negative metaplastic breast cancer. Lifetime AC and radiation got rid of that mess. Some 18 months of various estrogen blockers failed to stop the cancers return. A biopsy was done on a metastasis to her hip which showed it 2% ER/PR+ and the rest TNBC. I'm leaving out some other things like operations on a huge ovarian cyst and a large benign tumor on her kidney. She was on capecitabine (Xeloda) for about 18 months and that kept her extensive spinal and hip metastasis in check. Eventually, it stopped working altogether. The Dr. said her spine lit up solid red from top to bottom. Next, her oncologist tried eribulin (Halaven). He related that it seemed to work well on TNBC when capecitabine failed. SE's on eribulin were hard for her, especially this roving pain; you know three days of painful forearms, then a knee, etc. Wow, did it work though! Her last PET scan from 3 months-ago showed she was completely clear of cancer. NED! She gets another scan in two weeks then, if that's clear 2 months off. ",

I writing this for my wife as she hates the internet (except Netflix, Amazon and oh yes a Sudoku site). She's a wonderful person and was diagnosed with ER/PR+ Her2- in Dec 2012. She had a large tumor in her right breast and a small metastasis on her spine. She had AC but no Taxol as her first infusion caused an almost fatal reaction. She was also given Nuelasta but had an almost fatal reaction to that as well. The AC worked for a time and reduced the main tumor and completely eradicated the met to her spine. She was given Afinitor/Aromasine but had a nasty reaction to them and was given tamoxifen. This worked for a little over a year but then the tumor in her breast sudden went crazy. She had an immediate mastectomy and lymph node removal. Results of the operation showed her main ER/PR+ tumor to be 100% estrogen and grade 1, there was a second tumor inside the main one and was ER/PR+ 30% estrogen, grade 3. In 9 of her 19 lymph nodes removed was found triple negative metaplastic cancer. Lifetime amount of AC and radiation seemed to take care of everything and was given tamoxifen. Everything was fine until, after about 14 months, tamoxifen failed with numerous mets to her spine. Also, her ER/PR+ turned to triple negative. Next she was given Halaven (erubilin) and it worked for her. After six months of it she was NED. She was then off all chemo for 3 months but a PET scan showed the TNBC was back (small amount though). She's back on Erubilin again and, like all of you, are waiting for a medical miracle. Weird but maybe a dog parasite medacine might be worth looking into. MikeW. ",

Eribulin's been out for general use some 6 years yet the article is dated 2019 so why are they just finding this out? It would be great. However, my wife was taking eribulin when she developed cancer to the dura brain lining. Yet my wife had done so well under eribulin she was given 3 months off no chemo so maybe that's when the cancer made it to her brain. Ally-Bee, I did understand enough \"Doctor speak\" to read that carboplatin does cross the BBB. I've been yapping away on this site lately, well I'm scared and maybe when I meet with the doctors I'll be able to ask some intelligent questions. I found this online and many other places also say the same thing: \"Eribulin does not cross the healthy blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), but could have the potential to do so after cranial radiation therapy.\"",

How effective is Xeloda against TNBC? The way the Dr. sounded it was like the worst possible biopsy determination. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Complex case as she has had 3 different types of BC: ER+ 100% estrogen grade 1, ER+ 30% estrogen grade 3 and triple negative Metaplastic BC. My wife, back in Dec of 2012 was diagnosed with Stage 4 ER+ PR+ HER2-breast cancer. One node and a small spot on the spine. After 3 infusions of AC she was clean except for the 6 cm tumor in her breast. The oncologist said since the cancer was responding well to estrogen blocker (aromasin) it was best to leave it be. Ops forgot to mention in the midst of all this cancer stuff she had to have removed a grapefruit sized and very painful non-cancerous ovarian cyst. A little over a year later, Nov 2014, the cancer morphed and went crazy. She had a radical mastectomy and breast removal. A biopsy showed it to be ER+ and the oncologist prescribed tamoxifen. 19 lymph nodes were removed and 9 of the 19 had triple negative Metaplastic keratinized squamous carcinoma. A PET scan done after the surgery showed some cancer still in her armpit, probably spill over from the nodes. She has three cancers, one ER+ PR+ HER2-, 100% estrogen, grade 1 and inside that was ER+PR+HER2- 30% estrogen grade 3 plus the triple negative. She went back on A-C (lifetime amount), no Taxol as she almost died from it earlier. Almost died from NeuLasta too. Also 7 weeks of radiation. After all that she had to have major surgery to remove a tumor from her kidney. Eighty five percent were cancerous but hers was benign.",

Hey, it came back a lighter color brown and all curly. Strange? Wife had PET scan Monday. Haven't heard from oncologist yet so it's a good sign. Progression with one spot on spine as of November 2016. Oncologist wants to wait a few months to let it grow big enough for a biopsy. Complex case as she has had 3 different types of BC: ER+ 100% estrogen grade 1, ER+ 30% estrogen grade 3 and triple negative Metaplastic BC. My wife's BC history. My wife refuses to use the internet, well except for Amazon and Ebay. My wife, back in Dec of 2012 was diagnosed with Stage 4 ER+ PR+ HER2-breast cancer. One node and a small spot on the spine. After 3 infusions of AC she was clean except for the 6 cm tumor in her breast. The oncologist said since the cancer was responding well to estrogen blocker (aromasin) it was best to leave it be. Ops forgot to mention in the midst of all this cancer stuff she had to have removed a grapefruit sized and very painful non-cancerous ovarian cyst. A little over a year later, Nov 2014, the cancer morphed and went crazy. She had a radical mastectomy and breast removal. A biopsy showed it to be ER+ and the oncologist prescribed tamoxifen. 19 lymph nodes were removed and 9 of the 19 had triple negative Metaplastic keratinized squamous carcinoma. A PET scan done after the surgery showed some cancer still in her armpit, probably spill over from the nodes. She has three cancers, one ER+ PR+ HER2-, 100% estrogen, grade 1 and inside that was ER+PR+HER2- 30% estrogen grade 3 plus the triple negative. She went back on A-C (lifetime amount), no Taxol as she almost died from it earlier. Almost died from NeuLasta too. Also 7 weeks of radiation. After all that she had to have major surgery to remove a tumor from her kidney. Eighty five percent were cancerous but hers was benign.",

Worst day of my life; the hurt is soooo unbearable. Live with someone for 48 years then it's suddenly all over. One point, I am not sucidal, I would never do such a thing. The radiation is just for palliative purposes and won't hold back the cancer. I'll post when she passes then leave this site forever, I hate everything about cancer! I delited some of the above - Too much of my yapping. I'm a nervous wreck lately with nothing to do as my wife sleeps all day. She's very weak and has a blood pressure of 102/?",
