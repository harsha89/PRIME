It is open to all women with lymphedema and is cost-free to the participants.  (They must put up a $100 deposit but get it back when they show up, just to make sure spaces are not left unused.)  Here is the link to more information:  www.nwlymphedemacenter. org/retreat.htm http://www.harmonyhill.org/node/26 Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "littlesista30 wrote: Lymphedema Treatment Act Update and Other Exciting Lymphedema-Realted News:  * Reintroduction of the Lymphedema Treatment Act is near! In the final days before Congress broke for recess, our bill sponsor, Rep Reichert (WA), approached three other members of the House, Rep Braley (IA), Rep Blumenauer (OR), and Rep Lance (NJ), to ask them to introduce the LTA bill with him as original \"co-leads.\" These three members were carefully selected based on their committee assignment, party affiliation and support for the issue. Our goal is to have bipartisan support in both \"committees of jurisdiction\" (through which the bill must first pass).  Thanks to our State Team members in Iowa and Oregon, Reps Braley and Blumenauer have already said \"yes\"!  Our NJ Team is still working to secure a \"yes\" from Rep Lance soon after Congress returns to work on Jan 6th. Once our final co-lead is secured we will be ready to introduce the bill. * NJ has introduced a state lymphedema treatment mandate! Our NJ Team has been busy, indeed, because, in addition to their work building support for the Lymphedema Treatment Act, they also succeeded in getting a NJ state lymphedema treatment mandate introduced in 2013. A copy of this bill can be read at ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20122013/A4500/4161_I1.PDF. If you live in NJ, please consider joining your State Team  because they could really use your help - http://lymphedematreatmentact.org/join-an-advocacy-team-in-your-state/.   * CA insurance \"Marketplace\" plans begin covering compression supplies January 1st! The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act stipulates that all new insurance policies offered in the \u201cMarketplace\u201d must cover certain \u201cessential benefits.\u201d In anticipation of the need to provide further guidelines to California insurers who would be selling plans through the exchange, the CA Department of Managed Health Care added a new section to Title 28 of the California Code of Regulations. In this new section it lists devices required to be covered, including \"lymphedema wraps and garments\"! You can read more detailed information about this new law, and how lymphedema supplies came to be included, here - http://www.lymphactivist.org/ca_garment_coverage.php. We would like to extend our thanks and congratulations to Bob Weiss, a long-time patient advocate in CA, whose efforts have made such a difference in CA and the nation.   * Join your state's advocacy team! This marks the first anniversary of our State Teams. We've reached 279 team members in 41 states, representing approximately 70 Congressional districts in the nation.  It's a great start, but we need at least one team member in each of the 435 Congressional districts. We still need to grow our teams to represent 365 more Congressional districts. Will you join and help us get there?  If you are not already a member of your state's team please consider joining this grassroots effort to give a voice in Congress to lymphedema patients and all who care about them. To join or learn more visit http://lymphedematreatmentact.org/join-an-advocacy-team-in-your-state/.   * Come to DC to take part in our 2014 advocacy days! We are just beginning to plan for this year's trip, which will be held September 7th-9th. We will announce additional information as it becomes available. To read what participants had to say about our last trip visit http://lymphedematreatmentact.org/join-us-in-dc-2011-lymphedema-lobby-days/.  Thank you in advance for helping us to accomplish more great things in 2014!   The Lymphedema Advocacy Group www.LymphedemaTreatmentAct.org info@LymphedemaTreatmentAct.org Log in to post a reply",

This is a great start, but we still have a long way to go!  If you haven't already, write your Rep today using the submission form on our website - http://www.capwiz.com/lymphedematreatmentact/home/. If you have already written, you\u2019ve probably received, or will receive, a \"form letter\" response that will read something like this: The letter will name the bill, then the committees it was referred to. It will go on to tell you a bit about lymphedema and about what the bill would do. And it will say something to the effect of keeping your thoughts in mind should the bill come to the floor for a vote. Do not be satisfied with a noncommittal form letter! We must have many more cosponsors for our bill to be moved forward. Please follow-up with a phone call. I cannot stress enough how important this is!  You can look up the number to your Representative's DC office here - www.house.gov/representatives/find. Ask to speak to the aide in charge of health legislation. It is unlikely that you will be transferred to him or her, so have a pre-planned and concise message ready, such as this one: \"My name is (your name). I am calling regarding HR 3877, the Lymphedema Treatment Act. I have written your office about this legislation, asking if Representative (name) would sign on as a cosponsor, and have not yet received an answer. This bill is very important to me and I would like to talk with the health aide about the merits of this bill. Could he or she please return my call? My phone number is (your number).\" Persistence is the key. Thank you for your continued support!

      "Content": "littlesista30 wrote: Lymphedema Treatment Act Update: The Lymphedema Advocacy Group's 2014 Lymphedema Lobby Days took place on September 8th and 9th. Eighty-five patient advocates participated from  the following 24 states, plus the District of Columbia: AZ, CA, FL, GA,  IA, IL, KS, KY, MA, MD, MI, MO, NC, NJ, NV, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA,  WA and WI. To educate Congress about lymphedema and raise support for the  Lymphedema Treatment Act, our advocates met with approximately 150  individual offices over the course of two days. These meetings had been  scheduled in advance, and included both Senate offices for each  participating state, plus all or some of the House offices from those  states. Participants also delivered information to all Senate and nearly all  House offices with which we did not have a scheduled meeting. At these  \"drop-ins\" our advocates were sometimes lucky to be granted an impromptu meeting, which are not included in the meeting total above. It's  incredible to think that we reached almost all 535 congressional offices on this, our biggest and best trip to date! One of the highlights of our two days on the Hill was our Congressional  Briefing on Tuesday the 9th. All of our nearly forty participating  patients, ranging in age from 9 to 71, took part in the briefing to  represent the \"face of lymphedema.\" The briefing was video taped, and once we have it edited we will share it with all of  you, as well as with congressional offices that were unable to attend. In the week following the close of our 2014  Lymphedema Lobby Days and we gained an additional 13  cosponsors as a direct result of our visit to DC! And there will likely be even more to come, as offices continue to deliberate over information  they have received. (You can see the current list of House cosponsors  here -  https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3877/cosponsors.)  We were delighted with the level of interest from Senate offices too.  Our bill has not yet been introduced in the Senate, and we are in  continuing communication with several of the offices we met with  regarding their interest in introducing our bill. This is a process that will take some time, but our goal is to have active bills in both the  House and Senate during the next Congress, which begins January 2015. This trip really underscored the importance of direct communication from constituents. I cannot stress enough how important personal  communication from you is! Please call your members of Congress at your  earliest convenience, to help us build on the momentum we have gained  from this trip. Better yet, ask for a meeting at their district office  while they are home campaigning during the month of October! Talking points and FAQ's are available on this concise two-page document  -  https://lymphedematreatmentact.capwiz.com/filemanager/file-mgr/lymphedematreatmentact/Meeting_Pointers___FAQ_s.pdf. The number to your Representative's office can be located here  (http://www.house.gov/representatives/) and to your Senators' offices  here  (http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). If attending a meeting, be sure to print and take them this Congressional  Information Packet -  http://lymphedematreatmentact.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lymphedema_Treatment_Act_HR3877.pdf.  We would like to thank our patient advocates who  participated in this year's Lymphedema Lobby Days - they did a  tremendous job! In the coming weeks we will be posting quotes and photos  from them on the Lobby Days page of our website. Some can already be  found on our Facebook page -  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lymphedema-Treatment-Act/186268221410801?created. We hope even more of you will be able to join us on our next trip. But  right now, remember that you can make a difference by contacting your  Congressional offices, and building on the foundation we have laid.  Please call them today and tell them how important to you the Lymphedema Treatment Act is!
