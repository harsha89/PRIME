I started my chemo this past Tuesday 6/20. 4 rounds of AC every two weeks followed by Taxol weekly x 12. I haven't made plans yet to cut my hair, although I did order 2 head scarves. I feel like today I am starting to turn the corner and feel a bit better. I was pretty queasy the first few days but still able to eat. I am taking Zofran for the nausea but have been getting headaches and dizzy from it. Has anyone else experienced this side effect? Also my mouth is quite dry which is most likely from the Cytoxan. Wishing everyone the best on this journey! We will get through. Lisa",
