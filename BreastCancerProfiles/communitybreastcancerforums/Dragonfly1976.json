The surgeon thought maybe my onc would like it left in for awhile. Then I talked to him yesterday and he said it's really up to me. Some people choose to leave them in for a bit, some want them out. I am torn now, I hate the thing, my right side always aches around it and it's hard to sleep on my right side. So if I have it out and I need it again any time soon which hopefully I won't, then I have to have it put back in. Should I leave it in, then have it taken out when the reconstruction process begins in the spring?

My question, is there a good and a bad way to have the BS do the incisions to get the best results from the reconstruction down the road? I am looking at DIEP not implants.

This part I understand. However I was told because of possible lymph node involvement I would most likely have to do radiation. My question that's been in the back of my mind this whole time is, why the rush on the mastectomy? I am NOT crazy at all about having the mastectomy, radiation, then waiting for 3-6 months or however long for reconstruction. I meet with the breast surgeon tomorrow for the pre-op and am just so unsure of the whole thing. Would it be a horrible decision, to do the radiation first, then wait however long (3-6 months?) and do the mastectomy and reconstruction in one surgery? I am trying to eliminate multiple surgeries for one, and am just sick to my stomach about not having any breasts for that long. Just looking for some suggestions, words of advice or whatever?

Now I'm being told I can't because I need to do rads for possible lymph node involvement. I have only had the lump removed, then started chemo. My last chemo is today! So I meet with the surgeon on the 24th to talk about the prophylactic mastectomy. I am also trying to explore my options and find a plastic surgeon as there are none in my state that do the DIEP. The lady at NOLA, told me that I can do the mastectomy and have expanders put in, do the radiation, then do the reconstruction. Is this possible? I don't know if my surgeon is able or willing to do this, or if I even qualify? Dx 3/20/2009, 4cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/22 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
