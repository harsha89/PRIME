You know, after so many slices of it taken out, I wonder the same thing...how the heck will they find it when they go to remove it. The thing was only half a cm!!!  In my case the radiologist had a harder time finding it...the US found it right away. Fun times Marie..us and our shrinking/MIA lumps!!!",

I had a CNB in July which came back B9..yeah for me! I had a 3 month follow up yesterday(which I thought was rather quick) after reviewing the new ultrasound, and MUCH to my surprise they sent me for another CNB. They said the pathology and the ultrasound didn't add up. The mass is only pea sized... 5mm with spiculated (sp) borders. I go back next week for the results and they are scheduling surgery to remove whatever it is, B9 or not. Has anyone ever had a similar situation? Did anyone ever have a B9 CNB and then find out it was malignant after all?  I oscillate between the positive..how lucky am I that they are taking it out anyways...to feeling rather depressed, sad and scared. Worse case scenario...it will be out of me, right? Thanks All! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2010 08:05AM - edited Dec 10, 2010 08:07AM by lolaUPhere Kintexas and Masrover... We are all in the same boat, waiting and trying to keep our minds from the negative. A brief synopsis of my situation...I had a cone needle biopsy at the end of July that came back B9 and was scheduled for a 3 month follow up. This occurred this past Monday and they sent me for another core needle biopsy the same day. Kintexas, this one way waaaaay better. After the first one I was sore and bruised. Nothing horrific but I certainly wouldn't want to back to work the same day! This time, barely a bruise and pain free. Yay!  Don't worry, you be fine... hugs. At our Breast Health Centre it is standard that everyone goes back a week after the procedure for their results. My appointment is on Monday morning. Either way they have decided to perform an excisional biopsy to remove the little sucker..my sister unfortunately passed away from BC at 34, so they are being very cautious. I am 40 btw. I want to thank you for posting and making me feel normal. I love how I can express my fears too, without freaking anyone else out... I know you both understand when I say that I am freaking out inside. xo",
