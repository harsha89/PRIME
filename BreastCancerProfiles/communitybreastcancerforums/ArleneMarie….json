They told me tha the drugs alleviate the muscle spasms since the expandrs are under the muscle and the morphine makes you sleep.  I just hate drugs but I had to listen so I got off morphine by Tueaday and am only taking valium and antibiotics.  I can raise my hands which is good and I even got up today, made my coffee and emaile my ell-wishers.  I hope you are all having similar reactions and are doing well.  My thoughts are with you all :)",
