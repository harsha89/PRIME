They aren't visible when I stand normally, but are visible when I lean forward with a mirror under them. I have now seen three different doctors over them and none of them are concerned yet I am terrified. All three doctors examined me and couldn't feel any lumps at all and have said its just the way my breasts are. I noticed them about 10 months ago and wasn't worried about them at the time but now I know they area sign of breast cancer. What are the chances of having it in both breasts at the same time, showing in the same way? Log in to post a reply",

I am reassured to hear that you get similar dimples / indents in your breasts and that they're not a warning sign for you. I have asked so many friends of mine and they don't have them. So the fact that they are showing in both of mine, should be a good sign? Not a sign of cancer in both?",
