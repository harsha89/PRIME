DH and I were planning on starting a family towards the end of this year, and this aspect of things has been harder than anything chemo or surgery has been, without question. We are tentatively discussing adoption after we get through this, but dealing with cancer right now makes it difficult to discuss too much. Gotta get through this part first. Treatment seems impossible but you WILL get through it. We all are or have! The first part, dealing with the diagnosis AND getting through endless tests, waiting for results, etc. is the worst.

For several weeks after being diagnosed, I could not understand how the women here could seem to have it all so together. The first several weeks were dark and scary...I still have moments like that now, and it's not easy, but it DEFINITELY gets easier, I promise you. Please know that we are here for you anytime. Chemo is not fun...but it is not the horror they portray on TV, in the movies, etc. I continued to work full time and go to school part time through it all. It is definitely doable. And now I am recovering myself from a rightside mastectomy, that I had this past Friday. No reconstruction for me until next year. Oh I'm having my pity party moments too...there's no shame in them. I don't think it's good to hold these feelings in, just let them out! So glad to hear you are blessed with a loving daughter. Don't fear that men will be scared or turned off by what you are going through now. A good man with a good heart will love you no matter what. I have been scared and sad that my DH has had to see me with no hair, swollen from steroids, and eventually missing a breast (I have not shown him yet). But I know he loves me, and he's not the only good one out there. You will find one too. Hang in there...come here to chat anytime. I think I would have gone insane if it were not for the chemo thread support group I was (and still am) in during chemo. It's so nice to talk with people who understand. shabby - thinking about you, praying for you! I hope you bounce right back after surgery. markat - heck yes, I always went to chemo with makeup and jewelry on, and dressed nicely. I went out and bought nice new comfy workout-type outfits just for chemo treatment days; they were nice for other medical appointments too. After I didn't have hair I would wear a nice scarf. And my experience was similar to Carrie's, I had plenty of good days in between treatments. Felt depressed all day yesterday and had a couple of long cries last night. Today I am feeling significantly better. *phew* Just relaxing this morning, and mom and I will run out to do errands this afternoon. I ordered another camisole from tcldirect. Figured I'll need more than one and my insurance only covered one, and to buy another was $65. TLC was about $35 with shipping.",

EliseÂ - sorry to hear about your nipple. Â You have such a great attitude. Got my drain out yesterday. It did hurt some but not as bad as I thought. But 20-30 minutes later, WOW did it hurt! Pulled out my hydrocodone from port surgery and used that for the rest of the day to keep it under control. I'm back to just tylenol today. The surgeon said he doesn't have my final pathology report in yet, but he spoke with the pathologist and they had found nothing so far, which was great news. The only downside of the visit was I brought up reconstruction to the surgeon. He is an older fellow, and a great surgeon, but apparently he is pro-implants. I am interested in having a DIEP and while he was respectful of that, he basically said he thinks to go through that big of a surgery for a new breast is risky. It kind of scared my DH and mom, who went with me to the visit. I appreciate that he was respectful but I was (and am) really annoyed. I guess he has every right to give his professional opinion (that's why I'm talking to him about it, after all) but it frustrated me that he alarmed them. I think implants are great, but just not the right choice for me.",

I don't take any special vitamins or anything and I am really not sure why I am not having any pain hardly from the UMX. I wonder if the nerves areÂ numb, but I don't feel numb. I made my appointment with the PS for a DIEP consult for November 26th, which was the first available, which is fine by me, I don't want to have reconstructive surgery until next spring/summer anyway. Can't wait to get this drain out on Friday. I was getting about 20mL out every 12 hours but this morning it was only 10 mL. Does anyone know what is normal, are these okay amounts? Just curious.",

I'm going to take a couple of tylenol now but I can't believe it's 10:30am and haven't needed anything before now. Trying to remember to stretch my arm frequently; it does feel a little stiff.

Pretty incredible really! :) So today was day #5 since UMX and I am still feeling well. Taking tylenol about 3x day. Last night after bathing I felt really dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseaous. This continued off and on until well into the night. It wasn't super bad but definitely alarming. Not sure where that came from. My mother worried that maybe I did too much during the day. Anyway I did not have any of that today. My biggest annoyance is the bandage over the drainage site. It is itchy. I pried the bandage open a bit to get some air in there, and I'm trying to not get too hot. I can't wait to get this darnÂ drain out on Friday.

You are right, a year from now the recovery time won't matter, and we will have gotten through this. shabby - I am irritable too...when I'm not weepy...when I'm not distracted...omg I am moody! lol I would want to slap anyone that thinks the surgery we have to have is something to be excited about! I'm thinking about getting a DIEP for reconstruction surgery, and no, it's not for the sheer \"pleasure\" of having a tummy tuck! Seriously I would much rather have my own breast! lisag - wow, august will be one serious month for you. That stinks about your insurance; is there anything that can be done? So nervous about the 10th but trying to do lots of fun things in between. Had dinner with a friend Thursday night. Last night went to dinner and the new Spiderman movie with DH and his brother. Flying out to see my pregnant sister for 2 nights next Saturday through Monday. Mom is coming out the following Thursday, the day before UMX surgery! Looking forward to seeing her, have not seen her (except on Skype) in a year (we live 1500 miles apart!). Still need to get some button down tops. I worry about something different every day. Was worried about whether I would have a private room or not but I spoke with the manager of med/surg at the hospital and got promised a private room (most of the room are private rooms anyway). She is a breast cancer survivor (going through recon right now!) and gave me lots of helpful info and tips. Very reassuring! I hope everyone has a great weekend!",

Very good point! I also think relocating for treatment is possibly not the best idea. If you can get good treatment locally, that is a good option as you will need follow up for a long time. Many of us did work through chemo, although not everyone does. Everyone reacts to it a little differently. I received intermittent FMLA leave at work and I needed to take off 3 days out of each chemo treatment cycle (I had six treatments). What I would suggest, if you have family/friends who are willing and able to have long visits with you, to see if they would be willing to visit for the first couple of weeks of treatment, to see how you feel and how it goes. But if your heart is not set in staying in CA, moving in with family is a good idea too. Having the security of that ongoing support is priceless. Physically and emotionally, going through cancer and treatment is hard!Â I would not stay with a newly married friend - your friend might be welcoming to the idea, but I would worry about the stress that could put on a new marriage. Relocating to HA, where you have no one, and expecting people to fly out to care for you, sounds rather risky to me.",

Calling her surgeon's office - most will have a weekend recording with a phone number you can call 24/7. Call that number and describe what is happening. 2. Call your onc - I'm sure he or she has an on-call number as well. 3. See if you have an urgent care clinic open in your area. The doctor there can get in touch with her surgeon or oncologist if necessary. Any of these options, you will be referred to the ER if it is truly necessary. No need to go there directly though if you can help it. My port incision got infected during chemo; I had to have antibiotics 2x. Certainly important to treat but IMO not worth an ER trip at all. If you are going to start out by calling her surgeon or the oncologist, be sure to take her temperature first. Knowing if she has a fever will be very helpful in determining the severity of what sounds like an infection.",

But you definitely want a port for chemo and herceptin, IMO. I hate IVs; the port is much easier.",

They cried; it broke my heart and still breaks my heart to think of it. Grandparents should not have to worry about the health of their grandchildren. The best advice I can give you is to take your time, and tell people when you feel ready. Talk to the ones who you believe can be most supportive for you, earliest. My dad can also not handle this well so I can only call him if I am feeling upbeat and strong. That gives him hope. If I called him when I was down, or scared, he'd be upset. In an ideal world, everyone would be able to be emotionally supportive of us, 100% of the time, but it seems like some days we have to give others support for being upset over what we are going through. I'm not criticizing them for being upset...it's just how it is.",

I had very mild nausea maybe once every treatment and would immediately take my medication for it, as the doctor told me to. It was very effective. My team was very firm with me to catch it early and not let it get out of control. Fatigue was rough about 4 days every treatment cycle for me. Fortunately each cycle was the same for me and so after a couple of treatments I could predict my \"bad\" days. I had about 4 bad days each cycle. Chemo isn't fun, but it is doable. Just stay in tune with your body, rest when you need to, and stay hydrated (easier said than done some days).",

I had a lot of the same side effects - black nails (my onc thought I would lose a bunch of them, but they stayed on and grew out over time), my taste buds were still messed up, had bone aches... not fun.That's the result of the cumulative side effects of multiple doses of chemo. Fortunately, I think you will start to see improvement soon. The bone achiness hung around for a LONG TIME... I finished chemo a year and a half ago and I think the bone achiness turned into more like stiffness over time, and only really went away in the last few months! The best advice I can give (for what my opinion is worth) is to make sure your oncologist and maybe a dietician have looked at your labs, and counseled you on what you can do to help yourself feel better, and see if there is anything going on that could be contributing to the dizziness (you may even want to see your primary care physician about this, just for a second opinion and a fresh set of eyes on the problem). If you need protein then the protein drinks are great! For me, I tended to run low on potassium so I needed to take a potassium supplement. Absolutely make sure you are staying hydrated. Towards the end of chemo I absolutely could not stand the taste of water; fortunately tangy drinks were more agreeable so I stayed relatively hydrated with them. Keep moving... try to keep active, that is good for your health and will help your system do what it needs to do to clean itself out, so to speak. The watery eyes are a common side effect too. There is light at the end of the tunnel... just based on my experience and what I have read here, I think you will start to see improvement over the next few weeks. Just do your best to take care of yourself right now. Oh and how are you sleeping? Chemo kind of goofed with my sleep cycle and it's hard to feel well if you are tired. So if you are not sleeping well, you might need to think about what will help with that as well. Best of luck to you!",

I know the wait time between having the tests and then getting an explaination of the results from your doctors can be so frustrating. But I think it is better to have a sit-down consult with them where you can ask all your questions, rather than become stressed with the expectation that you can have so many questions asked every day. Keep a log of your questions, so you don't forget them, and then ask the doctor about your concerns in person during your consults. That would be my advice. I reallyÂ hope you get to have a long, thorough consult with your onc today, followed by a long, thorough consult with your surgeon.

I think I spent the first three weeks crying or just in shock. My co-workers knew something was wrong because they said my face was basically white the week after I was diagnosed. Now is definitely a time to take care of yourself, pamper yourself as much as possible. As terrifying as it is, for many of us the beginning is the hardest part. The shock of the diagnosis, the multitude of tests and then waiting for test results, and the not knowing what is going on, can be much worse than actually treatment and recovery. I'm sensing that you are really worried about chemo. That's completely understandable! Chemo is not fun but I want to assure you that for most of us, chemo is very doable. It's not like in the movies for most of us. The chemo most of us get is not the super-duper rough stuff that some other types of cancer patients get, plus there are so many medications our oncologists give us to manage side effects. It's not easy but it is doable. Many of us managed to care for children and/or continue to work full time or even close to it during chemo! Obviously everyone is different but I want to give you hope that you can do this, you will get through it if you do end up needing chemo. Waiting until your BRCA test results come back is reasonable before deciding what surgery to do. Some women have the option of doing chemo first, then surgery, as this can shrink the tumor down and make a lumpectomy more doable. I would encourage any woman to carefully weight her options, and consider getting a second opinion, before deciding on what surgery to do. If you end up going the mastectomy route, that may mean researching reconstruction options. If you are thinking about mastectomy, I would also recommend getting a copy of The Breast Reconstruction Guidebook by Kathy Steligo. It was really helpful to me in understanding my options. Finally, regarding insurance... I would expect that you will definitely meet your deductible this year if you have to have chemo. So this may not be a barrier in choosing surgery options. It's late enough in the year that you may end up needing treatments/surgeries next year as well and meeting it next year too. I would encourage you to be cautious in letting this be a major determining factor in choosing your options. Many hospitals will be flexible in allowing you to make payments to them. It may be worthwhile to talk with either the hospital or cancer center social worker about assistance as well; he or she can see if you qualify for assistance, and their may be local groups like your local chapter of the American Cancer Assocation, Breast Cancer Association, etc. that can provide help as well. It's definitely worth asking about! I was surprised to learn that I qualified to have all my co-pays for the Herceptin I needed paid for, which was a huge help. Best of luck to you. Let us know how you are doing.",

Reconstruction options (for me, anyway) were complex and something I needed time to sort through. You may want to wait for the BRCA testing to come back before committing to any surgery date. If it comes back positive, are you going to want a double mastectomy? Is that what you want now, anyway? I would encourage you to get a copy of Dr. Susan Love's The Breast Book. I wish I'd read it early on. It does a great job of explaining cancer, cancer treatments, reconstruction, and coping with all of this in an easy-to-understand way.",

So don't automatically assume that you have to put your plans on hold. It's a very personal choice. I personally benefitted from having the work and school as a distraction. And while treatments are no walk in the park, I think it's much easier for us than for ladies who are significantly older, maybe not as active or in as good of shape, and may have other health issues too. I will give one bit of advice: now is the time to allow yourself to accept help from family and friends. If someone offers help with childcare, housework, driving you to medical appointments, accept it! Do what you have to do to get through this. Remember that it will not last forever. When I was first diagnosed, I was so overwhelmed with all that had to be done. But as with all things in life, it all comes to pass. Life is very sweet on the other side.",

I will also add that I think there is an emotion component to it.

I thought for sure I would wear wigs 24/7 but I actually wear a halo hairpiece + hat at work, a scarf when I go out otherwise, and nothing at home. I still have about 2/3 of my eyebrows and 1/2Â - 2/3 of my eyelashes. Side effects: I can honestly say it was not as horrible as I thought it would be. My onc, and the PA and FNP that work with him, have been very active in helping me control all my side effects. I have never vomited. I have had very minimal nausea. The nausea medications I have, are outstanding. I did have bad stomach pain and it took us a few treatments before we found the right cocktail of meds to control that. I get very severe fatigue for 4 days each cycle. I stay home those days. I have been able to work full time otherwise, although I might have a day or two additionally that I need to make a short day. (Keep in mind I do not have kids. I'm not so sure I could have had energy to work if I had children to care for!) My fingernails have been sore, andÂ at this point, six of them have some discoloration. I only had mouth sores one time, and they lasted for 48 hours. I do get a TERRIBLE taste in my mouth several days each cycle, and this has been progressively worse each treatment. Most food tastes fine, but fluids do not, plus there's just this terrible taste all the time. I have to work at getting enough fluids, and I still end up dehydrated and have to get IV fluids when I go in for my weekly treatment. I also get diarrhea each time. Unfortunately my first treatment it was worse than it needed to be. I read online that so many people get constipated, so I took stool softeners after my first treatment. DUMB DUMB DUMB! Lesson learned - don't be taking meds for side effects until you find out that you're going to have that side effect! lol I have a port, and I am grateful for it, although it hurt like the dickens for what seemed like forever. They put it on my left side since my cancer was on the right side (just so IVs would be out of the way during surgeries), and I have really regretted that, because I drive a lot and I hate when my seatbelt touches the port. It really hurt for the first several weeks especially; at this point it is just annoying. If I had it to do over I would have insisted on getting it on my right side and they can deal with the IVs. The biggest surprise to me was the menopausal symptoms. Did not really expect that, even though I think at some point it may have beenÂ mentioned to me. I get hot flashes, big time, especially at night. And my lady parts are dry like nothing I've known. Intimacy between my husband and I became impossible. This was very upsetting to me, we had only been married for a few months. Fortunately through research online, talking with my onc, and OTC products, we have been able to resume intimacy, in different but satisfying ways. I hope that is not TMI for people but I wish we had known before hand. It was very upsetting for me, I felt like a terrible wife. Fortunately my DH was 100% understanding, supportive and loving.Â  Best of luck to you! :)",

I was diagnosed in January at age 32. I think I cried for a solid week. The absolute, best advice I can give you is to not panic, and not rush into any decisions. I am a rush-type of person, let's do it now! But I made some decisions early on that I regret now; decisions I made because I did not fully understand all this. In most cases, there is no risk in taking a few weeks to think things through and gather information. I also encourage you to get second opinions before starting any course of treatment or deciding on surgery. I have really benefitted from hearing things explained twice. Different doctors just have different styles of explaining things. Also about halfway through this I read Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. What a fabulous source of information! I would recommend it to anyone going through breast cancer. My cancer center has let me borrow it for free from their lending library, which many cancer centers have.",

But I think it is better to have a sit-down consult with them where you can ask all your questions, rather than become stressed with the expectation that you can have so many questions asked every day. Keep a log of your questions, so you don't forget them, and then ask the doctor about your concerns in person during your consults. That would be my advice. I reallyÂ hope you get to have a long, thorough consult with your onc today, followed by a long, thorough consult with your surgeon.

I think it would be reasonable to expect to need some time off, but it is hard to say until you go through it and see how you react to it. Also, on one hand, some symptoms are \"cumulative\" and may get worse with each treatment, but on the other hand, as you learn to successfully manage symptoms, they may get better with each treatment or become a non-issue.

You can drive yourself crazy thinking those thoughts. All you can do is accept it, make a plan of action,Â and move forward.",

BUT it is much harder to get pain under control once it gets bad. And sitting in a hospital waiting room all day is uncomfortable for anyone, much less someone who just had surgery! Take it easy on yourself! Glad you are feeling better... you may want to at least routinely take over the counter pain medication for a day or two as you continue to heal. Getting good rest is so important for healing; don't feel shy about using the Vicodin at bedtime if it will help you sleep comfortably through the night. No you are not being a wimp. I get grossed out by surgical stuff too, especially my own. But I will say, it's usually not as bad as I make it out to be in my head. You may want to ask someone to help you if you are very nervous although I have been too shy most of the time to ask for help (unfortunately I have had several surgeries by this point in my journey!). Yes you want to wear a bra, it will help support things and allow things to heal. I would suggest wearing something very soft and comfortable, that you won't mind getting stained as you may have some drainage get on it. If the bra feels like it is rubbing, a piece of gauze placed between the incision and the bra can help. Emotional stuff - totally normal. You are coping with a recent diagnosis, and now also recovering from surgery. It's completely normal to have mood swings, feel sad, feel angry, feel any variety of emotions really! Now is the time for emotional self-care. Do things that help you relax and feel good, whatever they may be. Now is a time to try to pamper yourself. And you can always come here to vent or to chat! :)",

I would personally much rather pass away from cancer than suffer through end-stage dementia. Before seeking treatment,Â you may want to ask her oncologist for an estimated prognosis with no treatment, and then meet with her neurologist (or whoever is managing her dementia) and get that doctor's thoughts about treatment and her prognosis regarding her dementia. I will also say that many (but not all) dementia patients do not do well with anesthesia and for some it seems to cause a significant decline in their cognition. A dementia patient mayÂ pick at bandages and incisions, not understanding why they are there. A dementia patient will become more likely to fall and more confusedÂ when taking pain medication, which will be needed after surgery. I know this sounds pessimistic and I do not mean to be cruel,Â but this is what I have seen and they are things you might want to think about, and prepare for if she has surgery.

I've needed anti-anxiety medication from time to time during all this. Chemo is terrifying to think of, but I will tell you that it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. My consult went okay but the first time I went to chemo, I cried the whole way there and tried to convince my DH to turn the car around. I cried for off and on for about the first 30 minutes, too. Having said that, a person can adapt to just about anything. I won't say I enjoyed chemo, but I enjoyed the quiet time sitting in the chair. I enjoyed getting to know the staff and other patients. I enjoyed reading, which I never have time to do. I had about four days each cycle where I was very fatigued, and couldn't really get off the couch. I didn't enjoy feeling that way, but there was something peaceful about it, about taking time to relax against my will. Since going through this, I have learned that I need to make more time to do that. Anyway, the media portrays chemo as a horrific experience where you lie retching in a toilet all day and night, and wish you were dead. For most of us, chemo is not anything like that. I never threw up. I had mild nausea 2-3x that was well-controlled by medications my oncologist made sure I had. I had mouth sores for all of 48 hours. My biggest problems were fatigue, and stomach pain. I know it's hard, but look forward to meeting with the oncologist. Your oncologist is the leader of a team of skilled professionals who are going to help you literally fight for your life. They deeply care about your well-being, and want you to get through this. Do not hesitate to tell them every concern and ask every question you have through this process.",

Two of those days fell over the weekend so I only needed to take off two days every three weeks. So it was very doable for me. The best advice I can give anyone is: 1. Take care of yourself during all this: eat well, make a point to get good sleep, stay hydrated 2. Listen to your body - enjoy the good days, take it easy on the rough ones - don't overdo it 3. Communicate with your oncology team. For example, I had a lot of stomach troubles (not nausea, it was pain) and it took a few changes in medication before my doctor found the right combo of drugs that gave me relief.

Getting diagnosed is such a blow, and I think the fear and uncertainty while waiting for test results, and waiting for a definitive treatment plan, is worse than any treatment itself. Sounds like you have a lot going for you - small tumor, and otherwise good health. Definitely don't hold back when asking your doctors to not only explain what treatment they recommend, but why they recommend it. And don't hesitate to get a couple of different opinions, if you are still uncertain. I got two opinions before I decided to have radiation, and while I ended up going with the first radiation oncologist, I was very grateful for my consult with the second radiation oncologist, because she explained things a little differently, and it helped me understand. Even if you are wary of chemo, I'm glad you are going to meet with the oncologist and learn a bit more about it. If it is any reassurance, I finished chemo a year and a half ago... I have had no lasting effects from it. But of course,Â long term side effectsÂ do happen for some. Â You are correct in your concerns about healing during and after chemo, and this is why your doctors will probably have you wait a bit in between chemo and surgery, to make sure you do heal well. I also agree that if you are planning on a mastectomy, then shrinking your tumor is not as big of a concern as it would be if you were having a lumpectomy. But the chemo may be helpful if cancer cells have passed outside of the breast. I imagine your doctor may possibly want to test your lymph nodes for evidence of this, but even if that comes back negative, it is not a 100% guarantee that the cancer cells have not spread. You feel like you have no choices... cancer is sort of a series of one crappy choice after another IMO. Chemo or no chemo? Radiation or no radiation? Lumpectomy or mastectomy? Unilateral or bilateral mastectomy? What kind of reconstruction? Hormone therapy? Survival rates versus side effects... it's a bit of a maze. There is so much good information on this website, and hopeful the information here, plus good information from your physicians, will help you navigate it all. Best of luck to you!",
