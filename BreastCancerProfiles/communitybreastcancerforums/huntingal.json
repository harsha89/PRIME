I guess I wanted to share my experience; I had to have two surgeries several weeks apart, as the margins weren't clear the first time. The SAVI insertion was, well, kinda nasty. The nurses said it was one of the hardest they'd seen, as did the nurse who inserted the wire for the surgeon to follow for my lumpectomy. The pain was pretty horrible; no sedatives, just some lidocaine around the site. Lots of pushing, shoving and second attempts; NOT fun. I was a mess after all that. I have been told now that due to a breast reduction I had a long time ago, there was lots of scar tissue, and that stuff is not easy to penetrate. I would have THOUGHT my surgeon might have taken note of that and given me something to make insertion easier. Alas. Hmmmm. Made me want to stick a Sharpie pen into a delicate part of his anatomy and inflate it! Anyway, I'm getting used to it, I guess....but it hurts all the time, and now I also have a three day weekend to look forward to before I finish up next Wednesday. I'm debating what to tell my radiologist when removal time comes....if they just say hold your breath and kinda pull it out, I think I can handle that. But if it's drawn out and hesitant, well, ouch. I'm not a baby, but honestly, I could hear crunching as he pushed that thing in. The poor nurses were pretty upset too. Wonder why he didn't give me something...?  Sorry to whine....my radiology team and my oncologist are nice folks. Not crazy about my surgeon. Needs a bit of empathy training. But I'm grateful for this abbreviated radiation course, and glad I qualified. Having horrible night sweats now....any tips on that? ",

Patsy, I'm at St. Pats, right here in Missoula, altho I live in Hamilton, about an hour south. So I'm staying in their \"home\" for patients, very nice, have my own room within walking distance of the hospital. I'll go home this afternoon, and return on Tuesday for the last two days of treatment. Wish I coulda brought my dog, haha! And, I have to be honest, I almost look forward to seeing the radiation team twice a day; they are so bubbly and fun, we just chatter away the whole time. I'm a professional wildlife artist, I work and live at home alone, so it's kinda fun to hang with a few cool gals! Today they wrapped me up tight with a big ace bandage...my SAVI was the biggest they make, so we're trying to keep it from shifting around...you could set a table on my chest right now. I do plan on taking pain pills before removal, good tip you guys! I'm sure it will be easier than insertion.  Virginia, thanks for the tips on night sweats; I do have a fan going on me all night...it's not aimed at my head tho....I'll try that. They are really becoming a nuisance, keeping me up half the night.  Good luck to you, Patsy, enjoy your nice digs! And thanks for your encouraging words, Ceanna. What does it feel like when it's over? Does the weariness kick in right away? sigh....wish it took away your appetite. HA!",

And hard to believe I won't see those lovely folks at the radiation lab again. They must do that every day, see folks they've come to know, then say goodbye and welcome the next person. I will miss their energy and laughter. Not sure what my MO recommendations are....Tamoxifin perhaps....I don't see my oncologist until June 12. I don't have to have any chemo, thank goodness. My night sweats are truly horrid, and really affecting my sleep and energy, more so than the radiation, I think. I plan on checking with a homeopathist soon; I gotta do something. All my bandages get soaked off within hours, and my bedding is a mess every morning. Wasn't supposed to, but I had to shower this morning, after 9 days. Hopefully nothing will go awry. But---I'm grateful to be done, and feel very optimistic for the future!! I have my art show starting tomorrow here...but if I have to just sit and tell folks to wander around and ask questions if they have any, I will. Normally I follow them all over my home, which takes about an hour each time. Whew. Not this year!! Take care!",

Tampa, I too am sad for you....but be encouraged. I had a big delay in my procedure too; the surgeon did not get all of the tumor out, then went on vacation; there was almost a month between the two surgeries, and I had healed up pretty good. Then, back in again....sigh. And the insertion of the SAVI was really painful due to all the scar tissue from my breast reduction done years ago, and I had no meds to help (I got to hear those words too, \"it's never been that difficult for anyone before\". Yeah, great. I had treatment that involved a holiday weekend, so it took a little longer. But, I'm very glad I had it done, and you will be too; this delay means they will DEFINITELY do it right this time. I'm now 10 days post-removal; that went smoothly, and I have this little perfectly round hole now, which is sort of healing. No drugs or antibiotics needed. I've shown my SAVI to some friends and visitors coming to my gallery...all the men turn away, they can't entertain the notion...cracks me up. I had no skin reactions, was a little tired for a few days, otherwise, no ill effects. Hang in there, dear! This technology and treatment is an amazing advancement, and has now been confirmed by that huge study. July will be here before you know it. Cynthie",

They had towels at the ready on insertion day for fluid; they said a lot came out, but I was a bit distracted and didn't notice, plus it's way behind me so I can't see what's going on. Didn't know about the skin reaction; glad I'll be prepared for that now. I have a studio tour, the public coming to my home to see my art and studio two days after removal; do you think I'll be ok for that? Lots of chatting, touring my big house, questions, etc....I'm worried I'll be spaced out or exhausted....guess I'll find out, eh?! I guess if I feel crappy, I'll just sit there and tell them to bring their questions to me.  Thanks again! Hope all is well with you! Hard to bitch when it's so nice and lovely out (I'm in Montana)...",

Looking forward to getting it out....but the entire process has been a unique experience, to be sure. I'm happy the odds are very small for a repeat performance, at least in that breast. Had a minor fender bender yesterday, which didn't help things; the seatbelt smacked me good across the shoulder, and I returned to the hospital for another scan to make sure all was ok; it was. And my car was fine, brand new one, rats. The other guy had some fender repairs, and since I backed into him, my bad. sigh. first time. Always something exciting going on! Patsy, yours is coming out today too; good luck!! Not sure what I'm not supposed to do this weekend, i.e. lifting, exercising....guess I'll find out. ",
