You need to remain positive no matter the outcome, especially for your child. Take someone with you when you get results to be a second pair of ears. Someone that stays cool and can write everything down for you. Our mind does a wonderful thing and shuts off at unpleasant news. Medicine today has incredible treatments, and cures. Whatever happens, I'm praying for you and wish you the best of luck.",

The best advice I can give is to take someone with you to all your appointments that you trust will take notes for you and listen to what is being said. Our mind protects us from bad news and tunes out after the \"cancer\" word. You're going to be inundated with information and asked to make choices that are so hard. I hope this helps, a little Xanax might be good right about now too! Hugs and best wishes.",
