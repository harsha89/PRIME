Hurts when I press on it. I am not going to worry, like you guys said it could be a cyst and I have had those before. I am going to make an appointment with my doctor just to ease my mind and also if it is something then would want to know right away. Scary stuff.....",

I'm not afraid of death or anything like that but after reading all the posts it seems like people go through years and years of treatments -- pokes, prods, surgeries, chemos, radiation...etc. & then some get healed and it comes back - that's the shit that scares me, the actual treatment. I have kids and a career like so many here and both are already so draining and demanding I couldn't imagine throwing in some health battle. I am just going to try and not worry myself until I have a doctor look check it out cause I have had boils, cysts etc on my boobs (in same spot just other breast) in the past that ended up surfacing and coming to a head. I don't want to panic but keep mentally sound until a doctor tells me it's time to panic.",

Wouldn't IBC have other symptoms and not just a single hard lump at base of under breast --- truly at the base of my under breast? I don't have any other symptoms other than this thing that literally popped up over night. Round, hard, painful when touched. I'm about 1.5 weeks away from my next period so maybe it's hormonal.  I am going to get this thing checked --- so I don't worry about it.",
