      "Content": "Tzigon wrote: I noticed small blood spots in my left bra cup on Nov. 7, so I did a self-check. When I squeezed my left nipple, about a half teaspoon of rust-colored, sticky fluid came from what appeared to be one duct. My right breast appeared normal. I called my general practitioner the next day and had a mammogram (my first) on Friday. On Monday, I saw a specialist who said the mammogram was inconclusive. She found two lumps in my left breast, one near the affected duct, and said her office would schedule an ultrasound. The office called today and said they set the ultrasound for Nov. 28. I know there is probably a benign cause behind the issue, but I'm extremely concerned that waiting two weeks before taking the next step could have a huge impact on my health if it's malignant. Am I overreacting, or do I have a reason to be concerned? I live in a rural area, so there aren't many options. Should I try to get an appointment sooner at another hospital? Log in to post a reply",
