A dear friend of mine had a brain tumor and only lived 8 months after diagnosis.  Her newly married daughter in her brand new house moved her Mom, Dad and three younger sisters in with her and her new husband.  They made the living room into a beautiful room for her Mom and they would gather around her much of the time.  Teh youngest was only seven and she would sit on the bed and lay down with her Mom.  The father would have been hard pressed to do this on his own with having the younger children. He also took off from work for several months. Their fine example has meant so much to me.  And yours does too. I am so thankful there are people like you!",

I need something to remind myself of this precaution. A bracelet seems the answer. It would need to be fine and light as it is my right hand and I write alot. If it is the least bit uncomfortable I know I will take it off. Any ideas? Candyce Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Candyce wrote: My nodes were removed from right side. As I am right handed, of course, everything happens to that hand. I have burned, cut, scraped it many times. I clean it, put neopsorin on it and band aide if necessary. It has worked so far. Recently I was having a battle with a chicken (not a live one!) and got a small puncture wound from the tip of a knife in my right pinkie. Very small. I did my usual treatment. The next day it was painful and I thought I couldn't bend it because of the bandaide. When I was changing it I realized it was one and a half size of what it usually is--and was shiny. No drainage. I called primary right away (is that who one calls?) and she ordered Duracef. Is that the right treatment? It is still swollen today but is less read and less painful. I appreciate your advice on this. I was a wreck at work last evening and almost had my DH post for me. I know it is overreaction for one small pinky. Candyce Candyce Log in to post a reply",
