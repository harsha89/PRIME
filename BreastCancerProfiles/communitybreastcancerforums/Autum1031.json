I spent most of today at Yale Cancer Center, and it looks like my course of treatment will involve 20 weeks of chemo before surgery, so I can be part of a very promising clinical trial targeted towards TNBC. Here's the catch: Yale is about 40 miles, or 1+ hour drive from my house, each way. I am newish to the area, and have no family or friends I can call on for help. (I moved out here from the Midwest a few years ago). My husband works in an hourly, manufacturing type job for a small employer (FMLA will not apply). He'll be taking time off for the really important things but he cannot possibly drive me to chemo every week, for 20 weeks. I also have my 6 year old son to consider, who will thankfully be in summer camp or school most of the time. Am I crazy for thinking I *might* be well enough, at least part of the time, to drive myself? I did a tour of the chemo area and I did see a few people there by themselves. I really want to do this clinical trial, but short of a really expensive Uber ride I know of no other way to get myself there, short of driving myself. thanks!

I didn't realize how much of that there would be, but once I thought about it, it made sense. I am on a clinical study, so today I had the \"standard of care\" (Abraxane) followed by the study drug, and then an hour of observation time. My tummy feels a wee bit upset already, and my newly placed chemo port hurts like the dickens, but otherwise I feel OK. Apparently Abraxane doesn't usually cause nausea which was my biggest concern, but they prescribed me something anyway, and I picked it up on the way home. With my tummy already a little gurgley I'm glad I got it!",

My first chemo treatment is tomorrow - Aug 1. I don't have much of a choice when it comes to scheduling, my dr only does Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and starting in mid August, only Wednesdays - so, Wednesday it is. I haven't been given any kind of education or \"shopping list\" so I really don't know what to expect. The person who is supposed to do education with me can't seem to coordinate schedules so she's talking to me tomorrow. I already suffer from chronic constipation so I already take Miralax daily...hopefully, it won't get any worse! I also have some immodium in case things go in the opposite direction. I don't know what else I will need, and I hope I get the answers I need tomorrow.",

I have finished 8 weeks of Abraxane, 4 more to go, and then I switch to AC. I am doing surprisingly well. Some fatigue,(my worst days are Day 3 and 4), some bone pain. A little bit of neuropathy, but just pain in my hands and fingers-- no black nails or numbness. I am still working full time except for my treatment day. I drive myself to/ fro the treatments every week, and I haven't had any real issues (except for the fatigue). I've been warned the AC will be worse, which I start on October 24th. At that point, if I need to take short term leave it won't be so bad, since the AC is only 8 weeks (4 rounds). I'm glad I've been able to work - it would have driven me nuts to stay home all the time.",
