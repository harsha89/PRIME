Your experience is giving me more hope, so thank you for sharing :)",

I found a few flannel sets, so those are great too. You are not going to want any stiff or scratchy material touching your surgical site. I'm not sure if your wound will be covered or not, but mine was not and I was strictly forbidden from wearing anything more constricting than a camisole. I see you are in MA, so it's going to probably be chilly. Finding second hand long sleeve pajama tops should be really easy. For drain management I used a simple lanyard and big safety pin. Worked great until my doggo got his head under the drain tube somehow and pulled it out about a half an inch. That hurt. So, be super careful about the hanging tube(s). You do not want to accidentally yank on those. I also bought a U shaped pregnancy pillow and that is a godsend. Kind of pricey, but it is so comfortable for arm and knee support. I use a low wedge pillow and then put the U shaped giant pillow on top of it and sort of rest my arms on the sides and fold the bottoms under my knees. It creates like a little nest for you to sleep or chill out in. Without it I don't think I could comply with the sleeping on my back orders from PS. I tried to add a pic for you, but I am unable to do so. :( Good luck and stay strong!",

I have more strength and range of motion than I thought I would. He only filled them with 100cc each during surgery. It looks really weird and feels like a couple of bricks on my chest. Unfortunately, I was not given the option to go direct to implant. I think the immediate healing with that might be longer, but the upside is of course no expanders. I hope your surgery and recovery are smooth. It really does get easier every day. Yesterday I was able to maneuver myself up from a reclining position without hubby's help. I'm sure that makes him happy that I don't have to ask him to help me pee. He's on drain duty still. Thank goodness he is not squeamish. Those drains are extremely creepy to me. Good luck to all the 10thers. Stay strong!!",

My second drain was removed Thursday and that made me feel 400% better. The only real pain I get now is if I bend over too fast and my expanders move abruptly. I go back to plastic surgeon on Monday and he said he will probably be removing the staples that day. That sounds terrifying to me, so I put aside my last Norco to take that day before we leave the house. Its an hour drive to PS's office. My surgeon was super stingy with the pain meds. Only gave me 18 pills of 7.5/325 hydrocodone and 9 Flexeril pills. Good grief. Glad my husband had some left over tramadol and I used that at night with the Flexeril. I am thinking about all you ladies and wishing everyone a speedy recovery. Stay strong!!",

Two positive margin lumpectomies this summer, so I am now headed to mastectomy town. Doctor said my DCIS was wispy and apparently more widespread than showed on mammo and MRI. Second lumpectomy actually found a small area of invasive cancer that wasn't seen before, so I figured the time for being conservative was over and decided bilateral was the way to go. wlo02, yeah, I am definitely not dealing with the emotional side of tomorrow's surgery. I had no problem with the thought of doing the lumpectomies and possible radiation, but now I am just bitter that it came down to \"boob removal\". (That is a quote from my son. Kid's got my dumb humor) I'd be lying if I said I wasn't terrified. Sleep will probably be hard to come by tonight. The top thread here titled \"Shopping/packing/to-do list for surgery + recovery\" was extremely helpful for me. A huge thank you to everybody that put that together :) One more fun thing for me is according to my period tracker I am going to start on the 5th. Oh, joy! I will report back as soon as I am home and able to. PS said probably one night stay. Nurse navigator said most likely two. Hopefully only one. Sorry if this was rambling. Stay strong!! ",

The pressure and tightness I totally expected, but I was not ready for this awful sharp burning, stinging sensation I am having on my left side. Holy hell that hurts like a mother if I move wrong. I suspect its from the drain. The right side is doing great. Good range of motion and no stinging feeling. I actually have some strength on that side. Thank goodness I am right handed. It is getting easier every day. However, hands down this is the worst thing I have ever been through, emotionally and physically. wlo, the user name is because of my dogs. Not australian shepherds, though. I have two lab mix boys that have weaponized wiggle butts. Their tails are deadly when they are happy. I looked at my incisions at the surgeon's gentle persuading. LOL I told him I didn't want to look, but he said it wasn't as bad as I am thinking. They look absolutely nothing like any of the pics I have seen online. They removed all the breast tissue through round incisions where the nipple and areola used to be. I have weird bunched up round stitches that almost look like they will heal sort of raised. I cant believe they fit the expanders in through those. Thank you for all the well wishes :) I really appreciate it. Stay strong, you will get through this. I said to my nurse when I was having a bit of depression, \"Well, I guess this is my life now.\" And she said, \"Nope, just a chapter.\" For some reason that helped me snap out it.",
