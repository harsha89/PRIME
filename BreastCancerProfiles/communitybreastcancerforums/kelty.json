Seeing your picture reminded me that I need to have a good picture taken with me holding my baby Kyle before the surgery.  It's been so overwhleming in the last few months.  I had a C-section so my daughter knows to be gentle with me.  We told her I will have to go to the hospital to have a big \"boo-boo\" fixed next week.  She seems to be Ok with that so far.  But it's sad to see that she was doing pretend play with her cart and bear friends going to the hospital.  My husband told the daycare teachers my situation last Friday and they will help us to look after her if there's anything weird going on. I'm lucky that I found this place for her with those wonderful teachers she adores.",

I wonder if there's any other tests you've done. My oncologist doesn't think CT or PET scan is necessary.  I also asked him what follow up tests will be done to know if the chemo if effective or not and if there's recurrance. He basically told me that regular physical exam is all I need. Unless there're symptoms he won't even ask for additional CT/PET scans. Is that normal? I thought some doctors also check CA markers in blood. My doctor told me that those markers are not reliable for BC patients, they only increase my anxiety level.  I do like my oncologist a lot. He baiscally tells me that I need to try to live a normal life and leave the cancer problem to him.  But I still can't help worry that the cancer will sneak up again in some unexpected place in my body.",

I'm so tired of the surgical room and anesthesia.  It'll be my 4th surgery in the last 4 months (including the C-section).  Why don't they put it in during the mastectomy? I did ask my Onc and radiologist about the diet.  The radiologist said don't eat too much antioxidants during the radiation since it may remove the free radicals generated by the radiation and compomise the effect. Once I'm done with the treatment, everything is OK.  He also asked me to wait for 3-4 months before the breast reconstruction because it takes a while for the scar tissues from the radiation to \"settle down\"? I think I should not worry about the tests any more and try to live a normal life and leave the treatment to my doctors. My daughter's 3th birthday is coming up. It's much more fun to plan her birthday party than worrying about my treatment.",

She's been doing great and very careful not to hurt my \"boo-boo\".  We had a good time playing outside in the sandbox today, and she sang the pirate song for me and told me it was \"a little off key\" just like the real pirates did. It made me laugh so hard.  But apparently she's still thinking about my \"boo-boo\". I found the older they get and it's more and more difficult to deal with parents' sickness.  My 4 month old is growing quickly every day. He's laughing aloud nowadays.  I love kissing and smelling him and making him laugh.  He enjoys \"the wheels on the bus\" song alot. It always brings smile to him. The other funny thing about him, he's so used to look at the bears on the crib bumper and when I left him in the \"sleep and play\" downstairs this morning for a little tummy time, he had this confused look on his face and turned his head all directions like saying \"where's my bears friends\"?",

I got my port inserted yesterday morning, it's still really sore today. There's this big bump right under my collarbone probably because I'm quite skinny. It feels so weird. Tomorrow's supposed to be a nice day.  I plan to go wig shopping with a friend.  There's a local shop owned and staffed by cancer survivors.  They take insurance too, how nice.  Hopefully I can take my kids out for a walk on Sunday. I think there's some type of steroid given during chemo, the nurse warmed me of being restless but I can't remember with which drug and when. I'm still debating what to bring for lunch during the chemo. Did you have any apetite to eat anything during chemo? What do you do to kill time during chemo? I've got some books and bookstore gift cards from my coworkers and friends.  I wonder if I should bring some books with me. The muga scan is a bit strange that they took a small amount of my blood and mixed in radioactive material and injected it back to me then I was scanned by a machine for 30 mins like you did. I guess the procedure of injection can vary slightly depending on where it was done.  I was able to go back to work for two days this week and it felt so good (sort of having my normal life back).",

It was 1.8cm, not a cyst, but there's a bruise mark on it (I have low platelet problem, I get bruises easily). the doctor who reviewed ultrasound thought it may be a hematoma. THe OB decided to wait after the delivery.  SHe was pregnant at the time too, when I went back for the 4 weeks check up, she was on her maternity leave and the nurse who works with her did the exam, she didn't look at the lump at all, just told me to do another ultrasound to see if it's changing size.  I was nursing at the time. the second ultrasound was reviewed by another doctor, he told me it can't be hematoma, go ahead to order a surgical bisopy immediately.  I had the lump removed on Dec 23rd, the surgeon told me he was not sure what it is by looking at the lump.  But ti was big: 4.7 cm. Because of the holiday, didn't get the report back till Jan 6th.  I thought no news was good news, but the surgeon came in my exam room and told me that unfortunately it was cancer. I didn't feel much pain with the lump. it was close to the skin and sort of popped out eventually with blood vessels around it. It's glad you are planning to have the biopsy done. THe wait is the worst.  If you can, try not to think about that and enjoy the time with your baby.  Thinking about it won't change anything and it will make you feel much worse. I really hope you DO NOT have cancer. But remember it is not the end of the world even if it is cancer.  The cancer journey has changed my life greatly, but surprisingly a lot of the changes are very positive. ",

I love my dad , but he's just not the kind who can emotionally support others. All he can talk about is work. The way he deals with problems is to work more. Now I'm going through this and I wish I could have given my mom more support. I'm lucky my husband is very caring. But sometimes people who don't have cancer just don't understand. I'm learning to tell him exaxctly what I need from him and we try to spend some time discuss things every night after kids go to bed. Raising kids can be overwhelming too. Besides I'd rather exhaust myself with the kids sometimes so I don't have to think or talk about cancer. I'm sure our hubbies can be the same.  I can't imagine dealing with this and raising a child all by yourself. You have to worry about job security too- as a single mom you can't afford to lose health insurance. I really hope you can work it out with your husband! And always remember to take good care of yourself first.  I read somewhere BC patients are often women who like to take care of others. I found it's true with a lot of people I know. It's time to treat ourselves well. ",

My mom in law told me after my brother -in law was born, she got really sick and the doctors told her that there's nothing they can do to help. She was lying in the bed in the hospital and fell asleep. In her dream she went to this place it's so peaceful. All her pains went away. She would like to stay there forever, but then she thought about her kids and woke up instantly. After that she got better every day. Now she's almost 70 and very healthy.  We have to keep faith that we can beat this for our little ones. When my husband and I told our friends and coworkers about the DX, I was amazed to hear so many women we know are BC survivors, I would have never guessed.  ",

I have the genetic testing done yesterday, will do the right breast mastectomy tomorrow and also find out how many lump nodes are affected.  My oncologist recommended Adriamycin + cytoxan every 2 weeks for 4 times and then taxol every week for 12 times. Also he asked me to consider the Avastin clinical trial. If anybody has any comments on that treatment, I will really appreciate that.  There's nothing that gives me more courage to face this than my little ones. Looking at them playing is the best way to relieve my stress. Hugs!",

He gave the \"go\" and asked me to take Emend. And half an hour later I felt much more relax for no reason.  Anyone has similar experience? Lisa, did you mention you take quite a bit of antioxidants? I talked to my Onc today about taking grape seed extracts.  He said he's not strongly against it, but he personally doesn't support it either.  He said there's a study done looking at the effect of taking antioxidants and various vitamins during or after chemo. They didn't find any benefit for taking such supplements , in fact for certain supplements, they have a small negative effect. He thinks the best way to get antioxidants and vitamins is through food. Somehow it is much better absorbed when in the food form.  Have you talked to your doctor on this? I wonder what other doctors say about supplements.",

I remember the first year my daughter was in daycare.  She was sick ALL the time. But once their immune system is built up, it'll be much better. I guess it's the same for us with BC. We really need to take good care of ourselves and try to rebuild our immune system to fight with cancer. I read that the first 4 years after pregnancy, the risk for BC is high. There's no clear explanantion, but it can be the body has suppressed the immune system to support the pregancy.  I heard people can be caught of lymphdema years after the surgery. And flying can increase the risk.  I've been seeing a therapist for a few times to get baseline measurement and tips for recovery after mastectomy. She suggests me to get the compression garment if I need to get on an airplane. I've been doing fairly well, my white count was up to 7.4 this time, YEAH! But the platelet is still a bit low. Keep my finger crossed that my daughter won't get nasty bugs from her daycare!  My inlaws are staying with us during my treatment to help us with the baby and the housework.
