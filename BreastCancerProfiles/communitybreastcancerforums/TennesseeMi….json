Carol, nice to hear your daughter is at MTSU.  We love that school!  My Dad taught there until retirement, my sister-in-law teaches there now, and my husband did his graduate work there.  Our kids also attend the lab school associated with the university.  I'm glad you liked your radiation time at MTMC; I haven't gotten to that stage yet.  And I also like to hear about Adriomycin being dropped from the regimen; makes me feel more secure just receiving TC. Hope everyone's checkups go well.  I'll stop in later. Michele",

I've gone \"topless\" for 6 weeks now.  It was too hot to keep covering my head, and I was just ready to move on.  It was awkward at first going out in public, but got easier the more I did it.   Prior to chemo, I had full eyebrows and long, thick eyelashes.  The eyebrows have come back, although not as full, but my poor eyelashes are short, few in number, and growing in different directions.  I don't bother to wear mascara anymore, so at least it saves some time getting ready. I'll post some pictures of the hair growth journey as soon as I can take the time.  I do so enjoy seeing everyone's pictures. Michele",

I had Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1991 when I was 22, and was diagnosed with bc in Feb at age 39.  For the Hodgkin's I was treated with (chemo) MOPP and ABVD, but did not have radiation.  A few years ago my surgeon contacted me to tell me about the connection between Hl and bc but since I hadn't had radiation I wasn't concerned.  Ha!  Should have taken him more seriously!  From what I read, the women who had MOPP and radiation are the ones now getting bc.   I'm wondering if it's really the MOPP drugs that are the concern. Did your sister have any chemo for her Hodgkin's lymphoma or just radiation?  Hang in there! Michele",
