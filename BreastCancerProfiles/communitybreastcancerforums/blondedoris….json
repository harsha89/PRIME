I've been given tablet form chemo (which for me is better than the infusions) so am waiting to see how this pans out. They're not sure what the spots in the lung really are, but given that they weren't there 2 years ago on the previous scan they're being assumed as malignant. Had horrendous pain in my shins and was expecting that to be bone mets - turned out that was the femara but there is a met on my skull...go figure. How long do they wait when you start a new regimen to scan again and see if it's worked or not? I know this is only day 2 of treatment but patience has never been my strong point!

I was put on it whilst I had radiation to the skull for bone lesions. When cutting back on the drug, it needs to be done slowly - I ended up reducing the dose by 0.5mg a week. Whilst coming off the drug, I experienced nausea, insomnia, dizziness, fatigue and cramps. If the symptoms get too severe, the advice was to increase the dose again. It took about six weeks after the last dose for the symptoms to abate, and it also leaves your immune system more vulnerable to infections (my GP has told me that can last for around 3 months after the last dose). It's a complicated medication - your poor mum really needs to talk to her doctor about coming off and what she's experiencing. x",
