I thought I was going crazy. Having kept a pretty stiff upper lip through chemotherapy and lumpectomy, I was positive I would sail through rads--it just sounded so much easier than everything else I'd been through. I was even joking with the doctor and the technicians asÂ  I was getting tattooed and all the rest of the preparation. But then, today, when the time came for the real thing and I was lying on the table with my breasts bared, my hands above my head and my legs tethered and some inane 70's love song bouncing off the walls, something snapped. I'm not a particularly modest person, but as I lay there I was filled with all these images of all the joyous experiences I associated with bared breasts, from skinny dipping in a pond late at night, to making love, to nursing my daughter and now it had come to this. I suddenly felt so humiliated, and exposed, so fed up with everything, so violated by this machine, so angry for no apparent reason, that the tears just flowed down my cheeks. The technicians, who are very young and very sweet, looked a little baffled by my reaction, and I was sure I was the first person to feel this way. Thank you for helping me to see that I'm not. Thank you for being here.",
