He said whatever I feel is best and whatever I want is fine with him. He loves me for me. I hope you stay well too!! Ardy",

One of the things he would do was just hold me.  We would lay in bed and he would just snuggle me.  He would listen to me when I wanted to talk and he would leave me alone when I needed that too.  We both knew the severity of the situation and we took one day at a time as you can only do.  Just let her know how much you love her and how much she means to you.  You are going through this too, not just her. It affects the whole family.  It isn't just her fight it is yours too. We really got hit hard at one time.  On Nov 6th 2006 our house was flooded with over a foot of water.  The next morning about 10:00 am my surgeon called to tell me I had invasive breast cancer.  We lived in our 25' travel trailer at our son and daughter in law's house for 16 months while we rebuilt and I underwent chemo.  It was tough to live in a small trailer and me being sick so much of the time. The thing that pulled us through was our strong love for each other.  We never had one cross word and that is the truth.  Kevin,  I'm Ardy's husband Mike.  As she already said, you are both in this fight and it is something that neither of you should face alone.  Ardy was down at times and had to be reassured that I loved her even though she was lop-sided and bald.  That part was easy because gee, what's not to love?  Just be there for her through the ups and downs that are sure to follow.  Good Luck to both of you. Ardy and Mike ",
