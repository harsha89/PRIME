I had a left side mastectomy with reconstruction in Nov. 2018, pathology came back with bad margins so a complete mastectomy in December 2018. That time pathology was good so oncologist ordered 4 rounds of TC chemo. I am starting round 2 in a week. Lymph were cleared during pathology. I am a wife (married 2002), mother of 3 and fighter. Nice to meet you all.",

I think it's too early yet but I understand this waiting game drives you nuts. My oncologist had the best line.... this was it. Cancer has 3 steps. Step 1 is Diagnosis, that is tests and more tests. Step 2 is Surgery. This isnt for everyone but generally they cut it out if possible. Step 3 is treatment. That is radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy etc.. Good luck and kick ass. You are not alone and you got this!!!",
