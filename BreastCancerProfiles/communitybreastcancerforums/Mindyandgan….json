Is this normal? Or does it even matter, I guess it will all go back to path results.",

Also my best friend lives five hours away but called and offered to come also. I was so touched by that but told her that because I probably won't know anything I felt she didn't need to come. I can never say it enough that it means so much to me that you all take the time to give me details about your situations so I can kind of know what to expect! I will be on here as often as I can no matter what my results are just to let you all know that there are people that care and want everything to go well for you all also! It does not matter if we don't know the people we speak to on here personally but it is the fact that we all have the same worries in common. Strange how you never know how it feels until you are in the situation yourself. Much love and prayers to all that read this!",

If you don't mind me asking, how did they find your LCIS? Was it in an abnormal mammo? I know that it is not always easily detectable. Did you have to go through any treatment? I am just asking out of concern because I read that it is not a real cancer but it can cause cancer in the future. It must be hard wondering every time you go for a checkup will it be something worse:( I pray that you never have to go through anything more than what you have gone through already. If I am wrong on the info I have on LCIS feel free to correct me. There is so much I am learning about different breast conditions and am willing to listen to whatever anyone has to tell me!

It was not a very comfortable test but it is over now. They gave me a radioactive shot and sat me in a chair. It was similar to a mammo but I was able to sit in a chair. 4 photos were taken on each breast but you have to sit with your breast compressed (like mammo) for eight minutes for Each photo. Having your boobs squashed is uncomfortable enough but to sit like that for 8 mins for one photo was beyond uncomfortable. Well, after the first eight,the radiologist said he thought he saw a spot in my other breast and wanted a repeat of all of the photos UGH!!! So I figured out that my poor boobies were squashed for a total of 128 minutes!!! First the good thing is that the second lump he found did not show up on the repeat images very well,so there is not alot of blood flow to that lump. BUT, the original lump showed blood flow on all the images. Also, the node in the breast that has the mass was lit up with a lot of blood flow and the node in the breast without the lump was not. I asked the tech about it and she said maybe I have an infection somewhere that I don't know about. I know that it could be possible, but my gut feeling is that she told me that to make me feel better. It seems that it is more than just a coincidence that the node in the breast with the mass is showing something but the breast with no mass the nodes are clear. There is nothing I can do but wait until my lumpectomy Thursday, the Dr. may give me a hint as to what it looks like but I will have to wait until next week for confirmation from pathology. Again I send so much love and prayers to all of you who are going through these hard times with me. It is a great thing that we can have support from others in the same situation We are in and my heart goes out to those who are having even more worries than me. these message boards are a wonderful thing a person can have because we want to be strong for our family but here we can pour our hearts out and know that we all understand what each other are going through! God Bless all of you strong women out there! Together we WILL stand strong and be there for each other when we just need to vent, cry or just try to understand. Until next time,....Mindy!",

I can not tell all of you how much I am humbled to know that you all have been here for me and we know that we can be here for each other without even having to actually know each other( does that even make sense lmbo) it is actually hard for me to tell any of you something like \"I'm glad that you are healed and everything is all better\" because I feel that having gone through this experience we ALL will never be the same. It is so sad to know that people can't actually relate to others with breast issues until you are there yourself. It doesn't matter how much you hear about breast cancer awareness it just isn't the same until you,or another family member has to deal with the situation. I love you all from the bottom of my heart and I will NEVER forget the kindness you all have shown me. NOW, I can tell you my path results. I have not met with the Dr. For my follow-up but I read my path results and I did see B9! I don't quite understand all of what it says but from what I gather I think I will be OK. My path results say Phyllodes of breast,Benign with prominent myxoid stromal component. Adjacent breast tissue showing fibrocystic changes with periductal sclerosis,apocrine metaplasia,lobular sclerosis and early breast cyst formation. So, I understand benign phyllodes but the rest is Greek to me! I guess the surgeon will explain. But, from what I understand phyllodes are very rare, so if I can get that then why can't I win the lottery????",

I live two miles from Charlene's grave and I put prayers in the petition box at her grave for anyone who requests it or for people I feel need prayers. I know a lot of people feel funny about talking about religion, but I believe in this little girls miracles. My incision also is on my left breast, left side about 4-5 inches from my nipple so it is quite uncomfortable to try wearing any bra because of the straps. I do have a bra that I have been wearing sometimes though it's a stretch cotton but there are no shoulder straps I just step in it and pull it up no trying to put my arms in or any clips. Basically it's like a strapless sports bra. I am so glad there is nothing big going on right now because I am the type of person who wants to be there and do everything with my children also. My daughter had her last volleyball game of the season the night before surgery so I was able to attend and my 5 and seven year old only need help with homework in the afternoon but my daughter (15) has been helping with that and my husband and 19 year old son have been doing the errands and driving. It is driving me crazy not calling the pathologist to see if they have my results. I know i will cave in and call today but I am going to try my best to wait until this afternoon even though they told me to call Tuesday. All they can do is either say they have them or not.",

Even though we all know that in this situation it seems that our minds are thinking about what is going on in our bodies 24 hours a day. When I talked to the nurse practitioner at my OB office yesterday, she told me that even though my tumor is b9 I will have breast problems probably for the rest of my life and need biopsies because the growths I will probably get can't be determined non-cancerous by mammo or ultrasound without biopsy:( still wondering what the surgeon will say. Besides the phylloyd, I have lobular sclerosis, periductal sclerosis, and apocrine metaplasia in the adjacent breast tissue and my other breast basically from what I understand all of these things will cause growths that can only be ruled non cancerous by doing a biopsy. The funny thing is that except when I had my children, I have been a very small breasted woman it has just been since I turned 40 that my breast started to fill out. I always wished I could have more up there but now....well, I guess you've heard the expression be careful what you wish for?",

I am not feeling bad about surgery because I am terribly terrified of a needle going into my breast while I am awake! I know they will numb the area but it is just the idea of it. In fact the surgeon called this morning and told me that I have to have a ultrasound at 7am the morning of the surgery and they are going to put a needle in the breast to pinpoint the area the Dr. Will cut so he can cut the least amount of surrounding tissue as possible. Has anyone heard of this? Needle guided surgery??? The countdown begins. I just want this over with no matter the results, I want to know! Love to all of you strong women! P.S. I am keeping this from most of my family I told my husband,mother and mother-in-law. I know my 19 year old and my 14 yr. old will understand but what do I tell my 5 and 7 yr. old boys when they ask why I had surgery. Also I need to talk to my 14 yr. old daughter because she is large breasted. Not only do I have this scare but her great grandmother on her dads side had a mastectomy for breast cancer. She needs to learn to check her breasts. It's bad enough that she had a D cup at 13 years old before any of the other girls but now she will always have to be cautious:(",

Cup strange, but the nurse had already drawn a circle on my breast last Thursday.But the circle isn't around the lump the lump is actually on the outside line. I will have to make sure they know about that. I have to draw the circle if it starts to fade before this Thursday. I did tell my 19 and 15 year old children because I will need their help getting the little ones off to school Thursday when I have surgery. You brought a tear to my eye when you told me about telling your little one. My heart goes out to you. I am hoping that my path comes back B9 so I won't have to have that hard talk. I know I am rambling but I have two more comments for anyone who reads this first, do they put you to sleep for a lumpectomy? Second, I got a letter from the hospital about my mammo from last week and they want my to do a test I have never heard of called a miraluma scan on both breasts. I assume this is nuclear, and why would they want it on both breast. The paper gave them the option to chose left/right or both breast and they chose both. Should I assume that they saw something in my right breast also? So confused!",

The least amount of pain the better. It amazes me how sensitive the breast area is. I feel like I got in a fight today and that's just from the scan I did yesterday. I already have bruises showing up. Today's pre-op was the same as any typical surgery, blood test,EKG,sign a stack of papers,you know all that fun stuff,orders for tomorrow no solid food after 8pm,clear fluids til midnight and be at the hospital for 5:30am. I consider myself as a strong person that can tolerate pain well,but I am not so sure about this time considering how sore I am just from yesterday. I am no stranger to surgeries, I have been through a lot in my life, last year I had a hysterectomy, I had to have my gallbladder removed, two childbirths all natural, two c-sections(ten pound babies) and I have had 14 knee surgeries due to a motorcycle accident when I was 19 (I was a passenger, we were run off the road into a concrete barrier then my legs were run over by the truck behind us) my boyfriend at the time was killed instantly. Thus the reason I have been on and off Xanax for 20 years.PTSD. For some reason I think I am going to be a big baby about this surgery. I know that I read a lot from women on these discussion boards and they say that they had little pain after their lumpectomy, but I am so sore today it is unbelievable. I just don't understand it, and am not looking forward to tomorrow. Maybe I will surprise myself and it won't be as bad as I think. I have always told myself before surgery to think that I will be in the most amount of pain I can imagine and when I wake up I tell myself \"well, it's not as bad as I thought\" I know that sounds strange but it has become a coping mechanism for me and seems to work. Here is a thought, maybe Monday we will both get our B9 results! (thinking positive for both of us) BTW, I know everybody is different, and I shouldn't compare myself with anybody else, but do you know if it is common to leave the hospital with a drain for a lumpectomy, and a node removal?.....Mindy",

I am still praying your results come back B9. I talked to the Path lab Friday and was told that if I did not hear anything by Tuesday call back. I have my post-op checkup Thursday at 2:15, until then it's just the waiting game:( I still think it will be B9 but if not, I will stand tall,stand proud, and do whatever i have to do!

I hope that when I see the surgeon he tells me that all of the other things that were written on my path report are nothing to worry about either. I do know that my OB called today and told me that my surgeon will explain it all to me but my OB wants me to go in next week to make sure I understand everything and he also told me he want mammo's every six months. Not sure for how many years but I will find out next week. I just am anxious to get the visit with the surgeon over with. My OB wants me to ask surgeon a few questions because the path report does not tell us if the margins are clear are not. The most important thing about phyllodes they told me is clear margins clear margins clear margins if not clear I will have to go back for reexcision. Did any of you have discharge from the nipple after lumpectomy? Mine started leaking a clear-yellow discharge today and I am a bit more sore than I was. Also, I have reddening at the top of my breast. Is this normal?",
