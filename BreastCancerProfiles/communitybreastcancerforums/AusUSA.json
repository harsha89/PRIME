I just had my first chemo this past Wednesday, already had a low immune system because of a couple superbugs that got into my surgical wound. What do you guys do in this situation? We have no family here in Australia other than us so no place to ship them off to or me off to for that matter. LOL. Am I just being a bit paranoid? LOL I hope so! I do get an immunity booster shot again today (a 5 shot regimen that gives the same results as Neulasta), so hopefully that'll help. Thanks!

I think a lot of the area is healing now, but I'll probably have scarring. Well, you see my lumpectomy scar already, so more won't hurt.

Where is your treatment? So glad the weather stayed good for your treatment. I'm from St. Francis, so probably would have gone to the hospital in Cudahy, but as you can see, I'm in Melbourne now with my Swiss husband and 2 little Aussie born kids. LOL Don't ask! Most people I guess don't get as bad as Rainnyc, me and some others (I forget your names! forgive me!), but it really is quick to mend.

On Monday, my first day of rads, I also had a job interview which I got. YAY! Well, at least I'm looking forward to the future, instead of dwelling on the fact that I have no idea if my treatment is working, and won't until Aug or Sept next year. I hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew, with starting a new job and all. BUT, it is only 2 days a week teaching study skills and academic English to highly motivated international students before they start university here in Australia. Do many of you work too? Any teachers out there? I was also told to not take anything that could be an antioxidant and told not to lose any weight. That's a bummer! I was surprised as I have plenty to lose and will start hormone treatment immediately after. Grrr. Another completely new treatment to get used to. LOL",

Let me tell you, it was a relief when it turned back (I've been referring to my skin breaking down as \"turning over to the dark side\". Sorry, Start Wars. ;) We're in the thick of the start of summer here in Australia, so having to constantly cover up with scarves/shirts is not a fun thing for me. It was so hot yesterday for Christmas that we had to cut our traditional walk around Melbourne short--about 35C or 95F! And not a cloud in the sky. It's now a high of 20C/68F today and lots of rain overnight. LOL We live close to the beach, so we often went in the summer time (daughter is off until February), but this year I'll need my beach tent. We have to use high SPF anyway as skin cancer is so prevalent here (so different to my Milwaukee baby oil sun worshiping summers!) so that's no change. Just enjoy wherever you decide to go! :) We're off to a \"beach\" holiday and tour of the Great Ocean Road, a fantastic drive along the Southern Ocean in Victoria (yes 5 oceans now--only learned about 4 growing up!) for 5 nights over New Years Eve weekend. Hope you all had a great Christmas if you celebrate, and have a fantastic start to 2016! Let's all be healthy in the next year and years and years to come! :)",

It's working more or less, but the collarbone rads is horrible. I wake up scratching it. LOL Oh well, almost done. Anyway, I do have a concern. Did any of you get any swollen lymph nodes in the chest area above the breast but below the collarbone? As I was lotioning up on Friday night, I noticed a lump just above the radiation line. I didn't have an MX, so it's not scar tissue from surgery, but someone said it might be irritation from rads? I brought it up with the nurses, but they didn't want to say anything concrete, just to talk to the doc about it. I was supposed to have an appointment with my MO today, but that was pushed to next week. Anyone have this happen to them too? It's a bit concerning, and a bit scary. Thanks!",

It's gotten worse since I took the picture on Thursday--the weather here is insanely HOT and relatively humid (37-41C/100-106F) in Melbourne. My doctor even cringed when he saw me on Thursday and immediately asked if I wanted Oxycontin (paracetamol/tylenol with codeine wasn't working). So, yes!
