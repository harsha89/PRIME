( she just blurted out you need a lumpectomy, i almost fell off the table i wasen't prepared for that.)  then she told me the same thing as you heard that this could be the tip of the iceburg, or it could be hiding cancer, and that ADH likes to hang around with cancer. the second surgon was very nice and answered all my questions. ( which i leared from this sight, it was a godsend that i found this sight and learned so much abou B.C. from all these wonderful lady's.)              finally my surgery was on july 1st. 2010. the surgery wasen't bad i had a local also, but i told my surgon that i diden't want to hear anything over the phone so i had a apointment on july 14th 2010.                I was very fortunate that mine was not B.C. and also that they diden't even find any ADH. they explained that it might have been removed when i had my biopsy. so it took 3 months for all this. but when they did my MRI they found something in my other breast and i had to have a ultrasound for that, but the ultrasound diden't pick up anything so i have to go for another MRI on september 16th 2010, then a mamo in october.              I too did not realize what women with B.C. go through especially all the waiting for test results and waiting for that dam phone to ring.                i wish the best for you on your results and i will pray that you get B9 results. rcl4145",
