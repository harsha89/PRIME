We have already started her on Dexamethasone 8mg - because that will affect her blood sugar. Her insulin has also been increased. Have to keep tabs on not just one but two illnesses. Looking for support and anyone to answer a question that may crop up later... do wish us well. :)Â  (On behalf of Gaver, my mom) Harpreet Dx 10/11/2012, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 1/13 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Surgery 10/22/2012 Mastectomy: Left Targeted Therapy 11/15/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Chemotherapy 11/15/2012 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Taxotere (docetaxel) Hormonal Therapy Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",
