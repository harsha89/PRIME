Since I assume you're post-menopausal, you can go with AIs like Femara, Aromisin, Arimidex. Every drug has side effects, of course, so it might be a matter of experimenting a little until you find the one you're most comfortable with. Did your doctors give you any reason why they only wanted you to consider tamoxifen? Also, please note that everyone reacts differently, and there are most definitely differences in those reactions if you're pre-menopausal or post-menopausal. Some of the reactions you've read about might not be applicable to your case. Good luck to you, whatever you decide!",

Like every other HER2+ girl, I'll be dealing with Herceptin for the next year, so I'm already preparing myself for less-than-spectacular regrowth. Of course, if my hair decides to ignore that possibility and grow as fast as the weeds in my garden do, I'll be only too happy to welcome its rebel spirit! I thought I'd just pass along two or three thoughts in case anyone found them of interest. I worked in entertainment PR for most of my professional career; during that time, I routinely came into contact with models and celebrities whose livelihoods depend on their ability to look their best at all times. In particular, runway models have their hair beaten to a pulp due to extremely aggressive styling. Lots of them swear by a product called Viviscal - it's a non-medication pill featuring a compound of ingredients including the usual suspects like biotin along with a proprietary marine component. A month's supply of the stuff costs about $40, and you need to use it for at least several months before you can tell whether it's working for you or not. The second thought is that you don't necessarily need to choose between either dyeing your hair or living with salt and pepper. The third option is to use blue rinses to turn your hair silver, which I think is a nice compromise between the two other choices. It allows you to exert some control over the color of your hair without having to worry about looking \"fake\". You can vary the depth and intensity of the silver by using either blue or purple rinses. If you go to a salon, they can help the process along by putting in \"lowlights\" in your natural color to ease the transition.  The third and final thought is that Osmotics Cosmeceuticals makes a product that was specifically designed to encourage new hair growth in women who have undergone chemo treatment or who are struggling with hormonal hair loss. It's called FNS (Follicle Nutrient Serum). You apply it daily to a clean, damp scalp. Like the Viviscal, it contains no medication, and merely delivers key nutrients directly to the site of the follicles. If you're taking supplements to encourage growth, the FNS adds a kind of two-pronged attack to make sure your follicles are getting what they need to recover and start producing hair again. A four-ounce bottle of FNS costs about $60, and will last for two months. The company also makes a shampoo and conditioner, but I think those are probably redundant expenses if you're already springing for the serum. Of course, if a hair follicle is dead, it's just dead, and no supplement or serum will reanimate it. But if the follicle is merely sluggish, these treatments may help wake them back up and get them moving again. No product will work for everyone, but if you're looking for things to try, I thought I'd toss these into the mix as possible options!",

Another option is to get silver highlights with the lowlights, but I think the rinse is a cheaper way to go and if you've still got some natural pigment in your hair, it provides a more natural look because you won't get that \"stripey\" thing that sometimes happens with highlights.",

A temporary rinse won't lighten hair that's still loaded with pigment, so you'd still have your pepper, but your salt will be a clearer and prettier shade. If it were me, I'd start off with a minimum of the product, as you don't know how much of the product will be absorbed by your hair and if you use too much, you'll end up with a noticeable blue tint to your hair (of course, if you want to go punk or Dame Edna, this might not bother you, lol). Also, check the ingredients for drying agents like alcohol and make sure you keep your hair nicely moisturized to prevent any damage. Other temporary solutions to consider are Matrix Essentials So Silver shampoo and Aveda Blue Malva. When I had hair, it was highlighted, and I used Coppola's Blonde Bombshell shampoo and conditioner to keep it from looking brassy - the product was violet. It's important to note that using temp rinses or shampoos will result in a gradual fading of any yellow tones in your gray hair, as opposed to an overnight \"wow!\" thing. Give it a whirl and let us know what happens!",

With regard to Herceptin, it's generally given in conjunction with chemo because chemo increases the effectiveness of the Herceptin. There is a new protocol that's the result of a study between Dana Farber and Sloan which uses only Taxotere and Herceptin, and that seems to be yielding great results without having to add the additional toxicity of carboplatin, but be advised that it's only one study and the group was pretty small. Chemo sounds so overwhelming when you first get the news. And while it's no picnic, if you're HER2+ and your oncologist advises you that chemo is your best option, there's enormous comfort to be found in the fact that you have a real opportunity to kick the cancer to the curb for good.  Did they do FISH to determine your HER2 positivity, or was it immediately apparent during IHC? Definitely discuss your options, and go with whatever gives you the most peace of mind!",

We're BRCA-negative with no family history, so it's not as though anyone offered us any kind of Angelia Jolie advance warning. This disease doesn't separate the tough from the weak; it separates the lucky from the unlucky. And if Ms. Robach had spent her time on-air explaining how lucky she is, and how every dollar raised for BC needs to go toward finding out how it spreads and stopping it, she might have done a whole lot of good.  As for me, I KNOW how lucky I am. I'd lose my hair a thousand times over again and let them poison me with whatever they chose to use if it meant that my little sister wouldn't have to stare her diagnosis down every morning before she gets out of bed to go about the business of living her life without complaint, mothering her three children, and bringing a ridiculous amount of happiness to everyone who's privileged enough to know her.",
