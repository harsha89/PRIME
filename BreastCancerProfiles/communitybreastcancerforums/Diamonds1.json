Just having this scare is giving me a different feel on life. Making me realize how precious life is... and unfortunately how terrible our health care/insurance industry is. Shirlann, my husband said a similar thing. he said why dont you just give a fake name/ss#, so they dont track me. Its so rediculas how they do that! where is our privacy anymore? Thanks again and bless you all.",

As mentioned, Im going to wait since im a few days away from TOM. Since discovering the pain on the sides of my breasts (near armpit/bra wire area), my Mother, and best friend both said they had the same pain in the past. My best friend had it as early as last month. It was also just before her TOM, she is same age as me. Not to say we are all the same, and not to say this isnt more serious- but i have decided to wait until after TOM. However, i sort of remember this kind of pain happening before, on the sides, if i press hard. It makes me wonder if im not pressing down on a tender muscle, or wearing the wrong bra. I have size 36D bra. Thanks again for the information!",

I will be researching my options with your links and if this doesnt go away in about 2 weeks, I will definately be getting it checked. Quick question (maybe silly), is it possible for BC to get really bad in that short amount of time, if it were indeed cancer? Thanks!!",

I felt the left breast for the heck, in the same spot, on left side, near/in armpit/breast border, i have a small lump and pain there too!!?? I laid down and felt around the right side some more. It feels grainy, small and in a very lumpy area, of very small like a chain of fatty, small lumps or lymph nodes. i have less on left breast, but at least one similar sore tiny lump or node. on the right side, it is very painful. the pain radiates into my back/shoulder if i press hard. I dont know if this is a good sign or a bad sign. My husabnd thinks its muscle related, since i recently helped him bring a 100 lb TV down our spiral staircase. I dont know why it would be muscle related when there are small bumps im feeling pain on. Any insights on this? Thank you again.",

I havent had health insurance for 2 years, i am self employed and struggling to pay bills, never mind the insane cost of health insurance. my husband is afraid even for me to go and pay upfront, b/c they track your med. history now, and God forbid anything is wrong w/ me, its a pre-existing condition, and they wouldnt cover it even if i got insurance. Sheesh. i cant win. Needlessto say im hunting for a job w/ benefits. I am 27, F, no history of breast cancer that i know of, grand ma and Mom are still alive. Anyhow, 2 days ago i found a lump, like i do from time to time. It normally wouldnt freak me out, but this one is really painful. Its located on the out side of my right breast, almost in my armpit, pretty deep but i can feel. It is a stabbing pain that almost goes to my shoulder when i push hard. Its so hard to explain what im feeling since there are so many various lumps present in my breasts, but the general area hurts, and tends to really hurt if i push on a certain lump. It feels hard perhaps more hard then the others, but i am not sure if im imagining things. I have been touching a lot too maybe thats simply making things more painful. I am a week from my period. Do i ride this out and see if the pain goes away after my period? then it might be a cyst or other, according to my research. A few years ago i freaked out about a lump in my neck, the Drs said it was most likely a cyst, i saw a few specialists. FYI (if it is pertinant) the same breast w/ the painful lump, on that arm, my right side, broke out in a bad rash thats been present for 2 months. My mother in law is a nurse and gave me cortisone cream. its helping alittle - very itchy. my mom said its exzema, my mother in law though it could be what my husband had on his arm- shingles. Randomly, i saw shingles can cause breast pain! i have sores on my back and on my scalp also. Anyhow, any help of advice is appreciated. How can i see a DR. w/ my situation? Planned parenthood does breast screening but asks for ss#. Does anyone have any advice for me? Im all ears. Thank you kindly. Log in to post a reply",

I think its my bra, which i know does not fit me well. I am wearing a size too small, since i gained some weight. the back of the bra goes up and the front sags. i think my under-wire is digging into my breasts, which have gotten larger in the past few years. I will keep an eye out, but since it is in both breasts, rather then one, i thought that is a sign of it being cyclical, menstrual related. But, then again- i dont know for certain!",
