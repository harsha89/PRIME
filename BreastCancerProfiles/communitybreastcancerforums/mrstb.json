I also have 4 weekly injections of Zoladex to put my ovaries to sleep through chemo, in the hope that chemo won't bring on early menopause and that I might be able to conceive again. I'm 39yr wife and mum of one precious 7yr old boy. I live in Auckland NZ and feel blessed our public service for breast cancer is great. I have a 5cm carcinoma tumour in my right breast. No family history of BC. I have had two cycles of taxotare and struggle the most with not being able to concentrate in the week I have chemo. I get medical symptoms nausea, mouth ulcers, hair loss, head aches Â etc most are controlled fine with tablets. However, I have chemo on a Monday, Tuesday day has been fine, Tuesday night the effects creep up on me and then boom I can't seem to hold my concentration for the next 5 days. Might not sound like big deal but this is totally distressing for me. I am working through chemo on my two good weeks. I feel fuzzy, useless and scared. I feel my emotions following a cycle of treatment are all over the place. I'm seeing a clinical psychologist to help with my mindset etc, but just wanted to know if anyone else struggles with what I am. The doctors here are all comfortable with the medical and tangible side effects but as soon as I say it makes me feel fuzzy, light headed and I can't concentrate they have said to me this might not be linked to chemo, I was like seriously what else would it beðŸ˜ž Am I truly alone? Kind regards all, Tania oxoÂ  Log in to post a reply",

Oncologists here certainly won't acknowledge the fuzziness I get, so your reply is comforting in a very difficult time. I'll try to relax and go with it as you say xx Tania",
