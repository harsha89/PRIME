I was diagnosed with Stage IV with bone mets.  My primary tumor was 6 cm but is now 3.7 cm and might get smaller.  The surgeons say I could do a lumpectomy but might be left distorted.  I'm not thrilled with the reconstruction options for a masectomy and just curious if any doctors provided any medical reasons to do one over the other as it relates to survival rates or studies?",
