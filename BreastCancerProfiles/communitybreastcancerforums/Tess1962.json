It is your body and your cancer. Get as many opinions as you want and can afford. It is normal to see the surgeon first and then Oncology because the surgeon will have your tumor tested several different ways and also order the heredity blood testing which will be part of your treatment path. I am one week post surgery. Dealing with lymphedema in my left arm. Starting PT on Monday for that. So many roads leading to the end destination. Hugs and prayers and love coming your way. Teresa",

The breast is pink and a few blister type spots but nothing bad. No itching or pain. I have had a few deep pains inside the breast but unsure if that's from rads.

I started having joint and bone pain, severe headaches, and gained a bunch of weight. In December of this last year I had a hysterectomy. I decided to stop the letrozole. I've been off of it for about 3 months now. My joint pain has disappeared and my sleeping is back to normal. I've lost 12 lbs. I am not going to go back on this drug. I feel like my quality of life is so much better. Everyone has the right to their own decision on their treatment plan and I am glad I chose to stop this drug. My Onco wasn't thrilled but he said my chance of recurrence was slight and with the hysterectomy done he was ok with my choice. I don't have the brca 1 or 2 genes. My oncotype score was less than 10.
