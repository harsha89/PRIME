    "Content": "Aug 25, 2017 03:37PM - edited Aug 25, 2017 04:25PM by Spikar Add me to the list ladies! I am having my lumpectomy this coming Wednesday Aug 30th and from what the surgeon said it should only take a couple of hours to get rid of that unexpected visitor (tumor). They are injecting the tracer for sentinel node biopsy this Monday (2 days earlier). However, I am super nervous since I was never in my life under complete anesthesia before... I am hoping that lymph nodes are clean (they appear to be under US) and that I will have clean margins, don't we all? Anybody who had lymph nodes \"appeared\" as clean but that changed after the lumpectomy? Doctor said that I will need radiation (no chemo) for 5 weeks after surgery and (of course) an aromatase inhibitor to keep me company for a long time. Hopefully this will be the end of it... Please keep me in your prayers... This site has been my only safe harbor in these rough seas besides my husband. ",
