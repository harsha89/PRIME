Calcification's in left breast are probably b9. Birads Cat 3 Was then sent for a magnified mammo . And then called back again for an ultrasound. I do have a cyst. Looks round and clear on screen (from what I can tell) but does not go away when my menstrual cycle ends. Now I was called back for a \"targeted\" ultrasound. I thought the ultrasound was supposed to show what they needed to see? The targeted U/S is for \"outer quadrant on left breast a 3'oclock\", the same spot as the cyst. Should I not worry because I am a Birads 3?
