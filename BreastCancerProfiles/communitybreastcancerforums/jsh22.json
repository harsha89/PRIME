I feel with clear margins and no lymph node involvement the chances are quite low anyways for cancer to come back.  Tamoxifen must do something though, or I think it wouldn't be prescribed so much, right? o2bhealthy(Michelle)...that is a great idea to get baseline uterine measurements to watch for the possibility of the uterine cancer as a potential side effect from the tamoxifen.  I think I will ask my doctor about that...didn't know that was something they did.  Was that the only reason for the measurements...because you were taking tamoxifen?",
