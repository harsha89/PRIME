I'm doing my exchange surgery tomorrow and radiation towards end of September/start of October and was told by my PS that there's a 70% chance of extracapsular contraction. I wanted to ask those of you how your implants fared after radiation. Thank you!!",

Really hoping for the best possible scenario here, especially with regards to my implants and extracapsular contracture. I am feeling a bit fatigued by the end of the day but as others have mentioned, walking helps a lot! Hang in there warrior women!!",

They also put this copper looking mesh thing over my boob to apparently ensure that my skin is getting a proper dose. The tech said the simulation showed I had cold spots and the mesh device will help my skin get the dose. I don't know what that means then in terms of my SEs--I wonder if my skin will burn more. Hello Sidalee, can you link to those studies? I'd love to learn more on how I can minimize the SEs. Thanks!",

My skin is getting quite irritated especially on my armpit where the creases are. I also have dots all over my boob which my RO also said were zapped hair follicles. Recently, I've also experienced some sharp sudden pains, very small areas, almost like someone is stabbing me with a safety pin. I was doing so well for four weeks and then last week, BAM! I'm hoping my skin holds up and my implant does not get extracapsular contracture. My RO ok'ed supplements for me as long as they are not antioxidants. Wishing you all a swift and uneventful recovery!",

I have 33 treatments so seems like such a long way from now. I have to do the breathing tube thing since they are treating me on the left side. I'm super anxious about side effects. I'm finally feeling like myself again after all the surgeries and chemo so hopefully the fatigue is not bad. Also hoping the skin won't get too burnt. My PS kept warning me about extracapsular contraction so holding my breath that that doesn't happen either. Now just to figure out how to lotion myself up at work!",
