The day after my MRI, I get a call that I need to come back for a 3D mammo and US on the *right* breast (not the left one, which is the one with the malignant tumor that we already know about).

If that's the case with you, it sounds like it could still be considered regional or local cancer (i.e., not metastatic). I wish I knew more about the topic, and I wish you could get some quick answers so that you know what you are dealing with.

That's great news (well, great news in the face of a bad situation!). As I think I mentioned, my left breast cancer, which has been tested in every way imaginable, is IDC 2.1 cm, grade 3, HR+ PR- HER2-, just like yours. I did finally receive the full pathology on my right breast yesterday at my appointment with the SO and MO: ILC grade 1, 1.2 cm, HR+ PR+ HER2-. There's also an LCIS, but the doctor said LCIS is no longer considered cancer by most specialists; rather, it is considered a marker or possible precursor. My MO ordered an Oncotype DX, but that'll take three weeks for results, and she is also setting up an appointment with a genetic counselor. Apparently, for bilateral BC, those things are \"standard of care\". My SO is setting up an appointment with a plastic surgeon for a consult. So, nothing really scheduled yet as far as surgery. The results of the Oncotype and genetic testing should help me make up my mind on lumpectomies in both breasts vs. bilateral mastectomy. I'd been leaning toward the latter but I need to really think about the pros and cons of each. Finally, my MO gave me the option of starting on Arimidex for 3 months because the tumors are both ER+. The hope is that it will shrink both tumors, although neither one is actually considered large. I figured what the heck and will start on it right away. The MO said she'll check the tumors in 3 weeks and if there is no change in size, we can move directly to surgery. Or, if the tumors actually grow larger in that time, we'll definitely schedule surgery. (The Arimidex might also completely eradicate the LCIS, she said.) Guess it's time for me to start on some research. Lots of decisions to make in the next 3 weeks! ",
