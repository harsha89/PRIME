That's good of your hairdresser to offer to help you choose - take her up on it!   ",

Still not entirely used to the gray, but I'm holding out for a few more months to decide if I want to start colouring again - I'm still on the fence, LOL! Nkb - first noticed mine showing some wave at about 17 wks, then it was definitely curling a month later.  I'm thrilled to finally have some curl - was poker straight all my life...I'm hoping it lasts a good long while! Well done, Joan - thanks for the chuckle! Edited to add: kjiberty - I keep thinking that's a long ponytail on the one side of your neck in your avatar...what is it?

I really feel for you - it's been more distressful losing my lashes/brows than my hair.  At 22 wks, they're thinning again & it is distressing, but I chide myself for \"sweating the small stuff\".  I'm so sorry this has happened to you!  Congratulations on being NED 7 years, though!",

I've been reading this thread all along because I love hearing about & seeing the progress shots, but didn't have much to add...will be at 35 weeks PFC tomorrow. I must say how much I admire those of you who've managed to go for a year or longer without cutting your hair - shore1, you have such amazing length! How beautiful it looks!   Mine was fine on Boxing Day, but by New Year's Day it looked downright awful!  I couldn't stand it even one more day, so got it trimmed today.  Only about 1/2\" all over, but it probably took me back to where I was 6 weeks ago - which is good.  My curl is definitely waning already (boo!) & maybe once it's reverted back to it's old poker straight self, I'll decide to grow it longer since it will be easiser (for me) to do it then. Knowing I was getting it cut today, I took some fast & dirty shots last night so I could compare & yikes - a bit of bedhead going on made it look even worse, but LORDY:  With the gray, whatever \"funk/edgy\" I'd convinced myself I had with the short, was lost over the past few weeks & I  definitely need some of \"whatever\" to get me through... Wishing you all the best of health in 2013, Ladies - this year *will* be better! ",

It was 8 weeks PFC before I could really see that it was beginning to grow back, & it seemed like it was taking forever!  Then, it just kinda took off...you & shockd will be there soon, too... ",

EmmaC - stylists seem to go on autopilot sometimes.  I thought mine took off too much too, but keep reminding myself that in 2 weeks it'll have grown enough to make me wonder what I was upset about.  I just have to stop whining to myself! Welcome juneaubugg!  You'll be in the \"pettable\" stage now for a while - you won't be able to keep your hands (nor will others) away, LOL.  It's a good feeling! My lashes have all fallen out twice so far, but have grown back in thickly very quickly.  Many have used prescription Latisse, but I'm a forever \"natural\" gal from here on out so cannot comment on effectiveness.  Brows have thinned too, but at least they're much more easily \"camouflaged\".   You all are so good for my self esteem - thanks so much for the lift!",

      "Content": "Sep 2, 2012 08:34AM - edited Sep 2, 2012 09:10AM by CAYH Eggs have long been a protein packed hair treatment, Eileen.  Yolks are loaded with Biotin too. I rinse with organic apple cider vinegar to restore PH balance & make the scalp healthier too (1 Tbsp in ~ 2 cups water).  This excerpt is from my favourite blogger, Crunchy Betty: You know those fancy shampoos you buy that run around with sparkly labels boasting \"protein for strengthening\" in them? Well, you can get the same effect just by washing your hair with eggs.  And egg yolks are nice and packed with vitamins A, D, and E - all great for shiny, healthy hair. To top it off, the fatty acids in eggs moisturize and condition like nothing else. How to Use Eggs in Haircare Much like the baking soda above, the quickest and easiest way to get the great egg effect for your hair is to add a beaten egg to your regular shampoo. Just whip up the egg and pour some shampoo in the bowl with it. Wash your hair as normal. Alternatively, you could whip up one or two eggs (depending on your volume of hair) and rub them into dry hair. Cover with a towel or shower cap and leave on 15 minutes before washing out. And please heed the note below. Note of Caution: As the lovely Miss Stephanie pointed out a few months ago, if you're not careful with your eggs in the shower, you could end up with scrambled hair. Make sure the water you rinse with isn't so hot as to cook the eggs. THAT would be a mess. Who Should Use This: People who have brittle or delicate hair - or anyone just wanting to add luster, strengthening, and moisture.  Lots of great tips on her site for using natural - truly natural - stuff to do your body good!",

Rockym - if I were 8 yrs younger, I'd definitely go back to colouring, too.  I'm tempted to let it grow just to see how the curls develop, but then I remind myself how EASY it is when it's so short.  I'm aiming towards this like Diane Salvator - scrunch & go: No reason to complain though - it has gotten very thick & I don't think about near as much as I used to while in hypersensitive mode. jittersmom - I'm right behind you...shaping helps a lot.  You'll be amazed at how little hair can be cut off to make a big difference!",

If you can, embrace those curls those of you that had poker straight hair before as I did - mine reverted back to the former straight way too soon for my liking!  I found the whole growing in process fascinating & now it feels like so long ago that I was waiting for it to begin. Since the first fallout 6 weeks after chemo ended, my lashes have fallen out for a third cycle (every 3 months), but this time my right eye's went first before the left eye followed suit.  They seem to be taking longer to grow back in length this time too. My brows only seemed to thin a teensy bit this time & since my brows are thin anyway, that was a bonus. Nice seeing all your progress shots, Ladies! ",
