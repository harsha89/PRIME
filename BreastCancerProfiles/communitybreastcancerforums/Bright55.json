My bone scan was negatve.. it took two weeks from biopsy and bone scan to see onc then i started AI. . It all takes time to co ordinate scans and get results then health care team will review scans to determine best way foreward. Usually Ct scan and blood work every three months to see if drug therapy is starting to reduce tumor size. Bone scans usually after 6 months . PET scans some time is used. If bone is involved other therapy drugs and some times radiation is used Make notes when seeing oncologist and record all tests and drug info Maybe time frame will be more approproprite when three month rescan is done then MO can suggest time frame..some times very difficult for them if multiple sites are involved. Best not to revisit this till treatment has started. Good luck with mums treatment",
