I am learning about myself and trying to get over my insecurity, but it is hard. I guess my self esteem took a huge hit when I had my mastectomy and I've struggled for some time now. Anxiety seems to take over and the woman with the revealing top didn't help. I think I'll see my GP about some counselling support and see if that can help me move forward. Once again, thanks for your support. ",

      "Content": "happy12day wrote: i went out last night with a group of my husband's friends. One of the women had a top that revealed so much Breast and cleavage; I saw my husband looking at her chest a couple of times. I felt like running from the room crying ( as I do writing this post). In my husband's defence her boobs were so in your face! I stated to my husband this morning how revealing her top was and that I'd seen him looking at her chest. He told me what else was he to do, they were in his face. But you are the one I love. I tried to explain how I felt, that I'd had a mastectomy, that I'm scared and will never look like her. It was a conversation that ended in \"me needing to move on\", said my husband. I am very unhappy. I don't know how to deal with this. Any ideas or words of wisdom? One final thing, I feel like there's an attraction there? Log in to post a reply",
