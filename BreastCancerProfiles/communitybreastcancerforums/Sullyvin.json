Both hurt A LOT and I have a very high pain threshold. Both times, the medical staff were kind and sensitive and gave lots of the lido ane, but it really hurt. If I ever need one again, I will really talk to them upfront so we can work out a game plan to minimize the pain. With my recent one, the dr asked, \"do u want me to stop?\" I appreciated her asking and chose to go on.",
