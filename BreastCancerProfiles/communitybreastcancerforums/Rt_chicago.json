Then on to others that are even more horrific. I feel mutilated by this disease. I was diagnosed in 2015 with stage III.

My family has been through enough. My gut says go live life while I feel great and deal with the symptoms when they come. I feel selfish and afraid. Though my faith is strong and I'm not fearful of death it this suffering part that messing with my mind. üò¢ I'm grieving the loss of not being part of my kids futures and for my sweet husband I have no words. Thanks for allowing me to see into each of your battles. Michelle",

As far as my emotions they are all over the place. One minute I'm praying and the next minute I'm saying ALL THE BAD WORDS lol. I am at peace with the decision for now and I hope you will be as well. Please keep us posted. If you have any questions for me about y90 I'm happy to share. I would do it again in a second.",

I wanted to update you all on my appointment with my MO yesterday. It went quite well considering. After seeing my liver on the screen I completely agree with the treatment plan he suggested. He was very open and gave me several options but we both agreed on Taxol . I\u2019m saying this because I could not believe what I was looking at on that screen. My largest lesion was indeed smaller but I could not count the number of new little stinkers that had popped up. üòÆ. I seriously was shocked and motivated to come at these things full force. I asked all the questions you guys told me to ask and felt very satisfied with his answers. He agreed to everything and anything I feel I need done. He had been looking into trials for me and will continue to do so. For those of you considering y90. Please don\u2019t let my experience discourage you. Many women on this site have had great success (my hero Grannax) being one of them. I too can share my experience about the actual procedures if anyone\u2019s needs it. MO wanted to start Taxol this week but I want the port put in first. So Thursday is the start date for me. Besides, I need time to go buy some fabulous scarfs and earrings. üòä ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR TAXOL SE WOULDBE GREATLY APPRECIATED. I\u2019m so thankful for each of you!
