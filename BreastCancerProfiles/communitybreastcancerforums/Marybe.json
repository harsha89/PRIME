      "Content": "Jul 8, 2011 05:25AM - edited Jul 8, 2011 05:31AM by Marybe   I have always had low body temp.  If I am at 98.6, I have a fever.  Normal for me is more like 96.8/97 range .  I also have low blood pressure and since both are \"normal\" for me sort of thought they went hand in hand. Whenever I am in the hospital and have any type of surgery, my BP really drops.  The lst time I had a neulasta shot my temp was at 101 and that was really high for me.  I can always tell when I am getting a fever because my eyes start to burn.  When other people are hot, I am usually comfortable and always need a sweater or some sort of jacket in the movie theater or at restaurants.  I have found that I am much more tolerant of heat than I am the cold so in the winter we really need to keep the heat cranked up for me to be comfortable. Even though sunbathing is not really recommended for anyone, I have always felt better with a tan and to this day, love sitting in the sun, soaking up the heat, even on really hot days.  When I had my Vit D levels checked simply because so many women on the threads were talking about them and how low levels seemed to go along with BC, mine was at 68 and I have never taken vitamins in my life (up until now and I am trying a few to ward off neuropathy) so I thought Ah ha, maybe all those years of basking in the sun paid off.      Since I have always been this way, I don't think it is any way related to my breast cancer.  Both my mother and father had low BP and my mother is gone, but I will ask my Dad about his body temp to see if I inherited that also.  I just saw this thread and guess I should go back and read the whole thing to find out if this is something I should worry about.  But at this stage of the game, I most likely won't. ",

years.  When I first started treatment there was almost a 50 % shrinkage in the lung tumors and from then on it was stable every time with the bone mets as well as the liver and lung until they saw some new bone mets in my sacrum and I had to have radiaton then and also moved from the hormonal to oral chemo which did not work because then with my next CAT scan there was a change in my liver..that was a huge blow because I had gotten so used to nothing changing.......BUT the good news is that the chemo he then changed me to, Avastin and Abraxane has once again caused them to say Stable and I am really happy about that.  I also know that I am not going to beat this since Stage lV is as far as you can go, BUT I got that diagnosis 11 years ago and I have been living a very normal life and have been able to work during that time frame. I was single up up until Dec 07, but did a lot of dating up until then and found out boobs really don't mean all that much to guys.   It is only lately that I am having side effects and that is from the chemo and I may have to go on SS disability, but at least I am still lving and able to do things and can truly say I do enjoy my life.  I think I appreciate life a lot more since my cancer diagnosis.Because I do act so \"normal\" and look so healthy (only lost my hair for the lst time a few months ago) most people don't recognize the seriousness of my cancer and they do say stupid things, but they mean well.  I said this is a post a long time ago and it is so true, but most people have just never thought of it.....We are all terminal, each and every person on the face of the earth.  Everyone is going to die one day, be it from cancer, diabetes, a heart attack or just old age.....we are all going to die.  What we need to concentrate on now is living each day to its fullest and make the most out of the life we have.  I totally know what you mean Lynn, about people callling.  When I am doing fine and the scans come back with no changes time after time, my friends get wrapped up in their own little lives and family as we all do, and I hear nothing from them.  When I get a bad report, they call up and want to know if they can run errands for me, help me clean, just want to get together to hang out....they mean well but it pisses me off because even though I know these are my friends, they only make these offers when they think I am going to die.  Now after this diagnosis with changes for the worse in my liver and starting on chemo, I heard from people I had not heard from in years because it is true bad news does travel fast.  Well, I told my husband I am going to have a list of people I do not want at my funeral.....like former classmates whom are only cordial to me at reunions because it is the thing to do but did not even speak to me in highschool.....I don't want those people coming to my funeral.  And actually I am not really going to have a \"funeral\" My mother thought they were morbid and so do I. ..I want to have more like a wake....have my true friends there, with lots of good food (which I hope to God I will be able to taste again before this is all over), drinks and my favorite songs playing....and I want them all to tell their favorite stories about things we did together, not sit around and be sad and mopey.  They always talk about fairweather friends and this kind of shows you who the real ones are.  The ones who have always been there for me are there for me now and I know they will be when the going gets rough....but even they say stupid things and it is because no one ever really knows what anything is like until they have been there.  Facing the reality of all this is a good thing, but it is always good to have hope.  The drugs I am being treated with today where not around when I got my lst diagnosis in 1990 so one never knows what might happen in the next 20.  I think it is wonderful to get so many opinions and information from all of you ladies.  My father isn't in denial about me as much as he is his brother....he always says my brother is just fine when I remind him he has alzheimers and takes a medication for it so my father sould not be talking to him about drinking martinis. since Uncle BIll's kids would have a fit if they heard my dad doing that...but when I told him my cancer was active again and that I was starting chemo, he says Well, you have put up a good fight.  I said Good grief, don't talk about me like I am dead Daddy....I am not giving up yet.  I mean it just really sort of threw me since my father is always the one saying how great I am doing and how he wants me to outlive him (as all parents want for their children.)  So even the best of them say something stupid, but I try not to hold it against any of them because they truly don't know what it is like.  Obviously upping the steriods has me back to the point where I am not sleeping....I need to get up for work in 4 hours so think I will go give sleep a try.  Hope tomorrow is a good day for all of us. ",

I normally have a Wed.AM appt, but they moved it to this afternoon late and I went after work.  I was so tired when I went in there all I wanted to do was get called back to the treatment room so I could take a nap under a nice warm blanket.  Now I have had my steroid premed mix and will probably be up most of the night......its a much lower dosage, but when it was really low I asked them to up it again, because I found being hyped up and having energy preferable to falling asleep the minute I sat down. When I started with the onco I see now, 11 yrs ago, I told him how important it was that I could maintain a \"normal life\", wanted to continue working, not feel like crap, be able to travel and enjoy doing things and that is why we did not jump into chemo as my original onco wanted to do.   I hope you have a good appt tomorrow, Diane..and will be thinking about you. ",

My husband on the other hand just doesn't talk about it I was yelling at him last night when he told me something a woman said in the treatment room yesterday afternoon and he said they couldn't have told her that and blah blah and I screamed at him, \"What do you think she is doing?  Lying?  I am sure they did tell her that and you have no right to say they didn't because YOU do not know what it is like to live with cancer and do NOT know what you are talking about.\"  On that note, he retreated to his room with the bigscreen tv in the basement where he likes to watch the news all day long and complain about the world to the dogs because they listen to him and don't comment.  I am always telling him that unless he plans on doing something about it, just to quit his complaining. . Anyway, enough of home biliss tales.  Let me know how you do with the Avastin.I know a lot of people who are on it.   I get it twice a month.  For some reason was not blowing as much slimy blood and scabs the past few days and almost ( note I say almost) missed it and wondered if something was wrong.  I have started using Flonase and think it actually helps with the congestion. My eyes are really running today and I am still fighting the runny nose, but the aches now seem to be gone.....I think this is a cold or something I picked up and not a SE.      Well, Good night ladies.  I already had a nice little snooze as I went to bed at about 10:00 and just got up awhile ago to go to the bathroom and ended up in here at the computer.  Think I will go back to bed now.  I agree, it is wonderful to have someone to vent to, someone who knows, yet someone who does not necessarily have to agree with all we think since we are all different, have different responses and opinions, BUT at the same time we are all in the same boat.  Sometimes our boat may spring a leak, but hopefully it will stay afloat or  has lifeboats enough for all of us. ",

The edema was horrible, but I think that is finally under control with water pills and support stockings.  Since I had not had bad SEs with anything before I went into this thinking it probably would not happen to me, but also dreading it because I had said all along I did not want to do chemo.  And now I know why.  Since I quit my treatments ( I did 22, not the 24 as planned) my taste is back, I am not only growing hair, but the eyebrows and eyelashes are also starting to come it, my nails are still eventually going to come off, but they are so much better and the smell stopped within a week of stopping chemo.  My eyes are still weeping, but maybe I just haven't given the surgery enough time and will see the opthalmic surgeon again in a week.  The neuropathy is still unchanged, but at least it has not gotten any worse.  I really did not have bad SEs until after almost 3 months of treatment and then every week they got a little worse.  Now I am faced with what to do next.  We are taking \"a break\" and I am loving it, but will say I am more tired now than I was during the treatments and when it hits it is almost like narcolepsy.  I never required a lot of sleep so this is all new to me and not something I like. Also my skin is horrible....on my arms it looks like chicken skin and it just sort of hangs there.....I am no spring chicken, but this looks like an 80 yr old woould have. I used to look younger than my years and did not have many wrinkles at all, now I think I look like I have aged at least 6 yrs in 6 months.  I have been investigating other treatment options, but my onco keeps saying But the treatment was working.  Yes it did shrink the tumors in the liver, but I question at what cost if this neuropathy stays with me.  He wants to do a drug in the same family since the abraxane was working as he puts it.  That means taxol or taxotere and the SEs listed for those are almost exactly the same as Abraxane.  No longer do I read these things and think Oh it won't happen to me .  I was not scared when I got my first chemo treatment....really did not want to do it, but felt I had no options since the AIs and oral chemo were no longer working for me.  If I do it again, I will be scared because I know what could happen.  I have been at this a long time, but nothing about this disease is predictable.    Oddly enough I like my port.....since they can only use my non mastectomy arm and I have veins that are small and roll, I shudder when a nurse(this only happens in the hospital since at my onco office they always use my port)  insists on using my arm because very seldom am I ever lucky enough to get one who can hit a vein the first try and sometimes not even on the 2nd or 3rd. Mine is above my left breast  near the center and very much resembles a doorbell.  It is there because they tried thee veins to hook it up with and failed so it goes into my jugular and at first you could see it going up my neck.  What do I wish they would have told me about chemo before I started it?.....Maybe not just that it could save my life, but it would make me feel like I was dying in the process.  I know I should be greatful to be here, but I have nothing good to say about the way I responded to chemo, even if my onco is still saying But it was working. ",

He wants me to start next week and I was all set to do both, but then after what the other onco said, I am worried and would prefer doing them one at a time....unless someone has had phenomenal results by doing them as a combo.  I also get Xgeva once a month. Thanks for any experiences you have to share.     Marybe Marybe Be you own advocate and keep on your toes. I went from no stage (1990) to Stage lV while under an onco's supervision.

He wants me to start next week and I was all set to do both, but then after what the other onco said, I am worried and would prefer doing them one at a time....unless someone has had phenomenal results by doing them as a combo.  I also get Xgeva once a month. Thanks for any experiences you have to share.     Marybe Marybe Be you own advocate and keep on your toes. I went from no stage (1990) to Stage lV while under an onco's supervision.

I guess it is also called Gemzar.   But in the meantime we are going to give this Megace a try and that means a few months before scans. He said the only reason he suggested I go back to TX is that he thought maybe they were doing some new hormonal drug studies because all the ones they have suggested are old ones and he feels that since one failed, there is a good likelihook the others will.....but he said there is always the possibility it could work and he hopes it does and proves him wrong.  I am glad I went to MDA and have loved my time off chemo, BUT the fact is I trust this man.  Who wouldn't, considering he's been keeping me going and I have been able to work this past 12 yrs under his care. I know I do not want to do anything in the taxol family again unless that is the only option left.  So I am asking for some feedback on this other drug because I learn more from these boards that just reading about SEs.  Have any of you with liver and bone mets been on this with success?  Or failure?  And what were your SEs?  And is this a medication you just stay on until it stops working or a treatment that you get for a certain time frame?   He did agree I can cut my zometa to every other month instead of monthly without jepordizing anything.  Marybe Be you own advocate and keep on your toes.

It came in straight and very soft and has stayed that way, softer than my hair used to be.  My eyebrows are back, but they are not as thick or dark as they used to be, but I recall looking in the mirror and thinking what in the heck are those bruises.  I am sure she will now want to keep her hair gray since she isnt even 50, but who knows, maybe it will get darker. Mine is salt and pepper and very silvery and I like it.  My eyelashes, now those are a problem, but I am still hoping one day they will be back to normal...they grow down like a camels instead of out and I also have a few lashes that grow inward and those have to be plucked out because they scratch my cornea.  Now that is a real PIA.  But I am doing OK, have hair and feel better than I have for a long time so want to encourage you all to hang in there.  I should be ashamed of myself, but tonight when she exclaimed And today I looked in the mirror and there's all this peach fuzz!!! I just couldnt help laughing.  She.s still got drains in which is bugging her since its been 3 wks, she is going to be starting radiation once they finish filling the expanders and she's having a fit over peach fuzz.  Ah, ain.t it grand to be a woman!!!",

So fighting and war and survivor just must be terms they use a lot when it come to this disease ......and I suppose as opposed to lying down and just letting it take over we are fighting and if we are still alive we are surviving.  But Stage lV is not something people can relate to unless they have been there.  Even though I have been extemely fortunate and am able to still work and feel I lead a pretty \"normal\" life, it is there in the back of my mind and when it comes time for scans, I always worry that this may be IT.  I look healthy and I keep up with my friends and I do my job at work and that is what I told my onco was important to me right from the beginning, I did not want people to look at me and think Oh my God, she's really sick, she's got cancer.  In a way this has backfired because everyone thinks I have beaten it and they will say stupid things  you have mentioned already like,  But you look great,  or You're going to be OK now, right?, You are through with  treatments now, aren't you?   They don't understand that this is something I am going to be dealing with the rest of my life. And a lot of them don't even know what Stage IV is....I myself didn't until I went to the library and read about it at the library after my diagnosis.  I am glad to hear that there have been a few stories told this month about Stage lV, but am sure that in general they want to tell the public the ones that have happy endings.  I may be overly negative here, but I honestly think it will always come back....was 8 yrs on me (probably less, but not diagnosed til then), I know a woman who was 12 years out and look at all the women on these boards , who had recurrences.  It is a determined disease and does not give up easily. I was involved with trying to get info out about Stage lV in the early days...have already told on here about how I was very involved in a letter writing campaign which never really materialized even though thousands and thousands of letter were written....the woman who started it was Stage lV and she is long gone. I just sort of got uninvolved after that, although I was in a program they they produced for the internet last year....sort of doubt if it opened any eyes though....I have not given up, but just pretty much live with my cancer and know that they are not going to come out with a cure in my lifetime.  I know Oprah won't help.....we tried to get her involved when we were doing the letter campaign....letters to the paper are a good idea and I would imagine if there was a woman editor or one in charge of articles, you would have a better chance of not being stuck on the back page or down in a corner, IF you are lucky enough to make print.  Also contacting Ellen is a good idea....she seems like a down-to-earth sort and from what I have read does reach out and help people.  What you wrote, was great English Major....also I can relate to  your feelings , Bo. Thank you for starting this topic, Cat.   I think we have to be our own advocates when it comes to this and I for one have chosen not to wear pink this month.  Today I am going to a big fundraising luncheon at the convention center, but only because my husband bought tickets....if they ask for any comments from the audience I will raise my hand and ask What about Stage lV? ",

The gal who was evening it up, thought some of it might actually be new growth, but I doubt that.  So far I have had 15 treatments of abraxane once a week and after 24 am having scans done again..  I get avastin every other week and have been getting that since last year when I was doing oral chemo.and that did not seem to effect my hair.   I have lost quite a few eyelashes, but did not really notice them going.  I have very little left in the pubic area, have lost all the fuzz I had on my face, but still have evebrows. The hair on my legs is gone and I am happy to say the eyebrows area I used to pluck did not grow back and neither did this one little wild whisker I had under my chin that even electrolosis would not get rid of.  So there were a few perks to this hair loss, but I am wondering why I did not lose the hair on my arms ( of which there was a lot)  and am hoping I will not lose my eyebrows.  I have been using a shampoo called Revive TH which I got from a beautician .....in addition to the shampoo there is a spray that you are supposed to mist you head with daily.  I was also using Nioxn at the advice of this lady at the wig place. I do not know if it the ReviveT helps or not since I really do not think the beautician saw any new hair growth since I was told at the oncologist's office my hair would not grow until treatments had stopped.  I had a LOT of hair which may be why I did not totally lose all of it on my head.  I got three wigs, all of them synthetic....one cost $110, one $180 and one I got from free from Cancer Family Care...one of them is gray, but the other two are more the color my hair used to be. .  The American Cancer society will reimburse you for one wig if you have a RX, but we have not turned that in yet.  There are several women where I get my treatments who got wigs that were under $50 and they look really good....Paula Young makes them.  I think this summer I am just going with bandannas or bald when I am around the house. I dislike the feeling of a wig....it is itchy and also even though it is the right size, they make ridges on my scalp and feel uncomfortable.  I went to this one place in the beginning and the wig I liked best was $999 !!!!!.  I can't imagine paying that for a wig.  It was not even real hair,....someone on here said how the real hair take more care and several people I know have confirmed that.  The synthetic wigs all you have to do is wash them and shake them and I usually just brush the hair with my fingers to style it when I put it on.  They look very natural and several people have said \"Wow.  Maybe I will get a wig.  It would be nice to have just to pop on when I don't feel like messing with my hair.\"  Yeh, right!  I don't see why anyone who has real hair would want to wear a wig.  I like all of your short hair pics and always used to say If I ever get thin, I want my hair really really short.....well I am going to get my wish if it grows back, but so far have gained rather than lost lbs.   ",

I have a good friend who went through all this just this past year and I remember her calling me up and saying, Good Lord,  I am growing a beard and I just burst out laughing because I had forgotten all about that part, but I reassured her it would not be permanent.  My underarm hair never did grow back and it is pretty sparse on my legs and the parts unknown, well, not much there either.  Maybe this all has to do with age, but I can't say I miss it.  Anyway, hang in there all of you.  It's no fun, but I am hoping the fact it is killing hair follicles, means it is killing the cancer.  With my last two chemos I did not lose any hair and also they did not work.  They tell me there is no proven correlation with this, but it makes me wonder.  You will be surprised at how fast it comes back...I know it was gone in the summer and then by fall, I had hair, not a lot, but enough I was not wearing a wig all the time and by Dec. I went to the office Xmas party with my \"new\" hair and had given up wearing a wig at all and was getting lots of compliments.  Uh oh, just gave it a tug, and I would say more like 15 hairs are coming out now.  Am almost afraid to wash it today.  Hopeful, Did anyone tell you how to post pics?  You need to move the ones you want to post to photobucket to get started. Then you can copy and paste a pic.  It took me a long time, but if I can do it, anyone can.    Have a good day everyone.   Marybe",

I did not do the wig route again even though I had my wigs from last time.....just did bandannas if I was out among strangers, but with friends I didn't wear anything on my head.",

Having it trimmed helped make it look thicker and the  gal who cuts it found it strange that just as I noted, it is the dark stuff that fell out and the white is hanging in there.  I still don't know how much more is going to fall out, but  as of right now it is sort of at a standstill so maybe it is just going to thin this time.  I am going to get a picture this weekend. ",

Anyway, to make a long story short I had out patient surgery and they put these little tubes called canulae in the ducts.  We have them on the top and bottom and that was something I did not know.  It does not really help the problem UNTIL they take them out which in my case was 4 months.....what the tubes do is re-establish the opening and although it sounds terrible, it really was not all that uncomfortable.  You used drops the first month that are anti-inflamatory until the eyes gets used to the tubes being there.....the watering even got worse for awhile because what happens is the tissue grows up tight against these little tubes and there is still nowhere for the tears to go.  However once the tubes came out, it was like a miracle....no more tearing.  I accidently pulled the lower ones out rubbing my eyes,(it was shocking how long those little things were)  but it was only a week or two early so the procedure still worked.  I have heard of some women who didn't have this done and eventually their tear ducts opened back up, but when this woman I was talking to said go right away, I did because I did not want to risk having a permanant tearing issue.  I would at least get it checked out by an eye doctor to see what he has to say.  Now the only issue I have with my eyes is the lashes.  Good luck to you.  I remeber what a PIA that was.  The skin on my cheeks and around my eyes was chapped from being wet all the time.  ",

I hated wearing a wig and gave mine to a friend of a friend who went through chemo after I did and she likes it so much that even though she has hair now, she prefers to wear the wig when she goes out.  Again, shows how different we all are....to me it felt like I was wearing a hat all the time and it itched and was hot......but it must have been very natural looking because unless I chose to tell people I was not really close to, no one even knew I had cancer.  When my hair first started coming out I saved it...SAVED it!....for what I don't know, but I had little baggies full of it.  The only thing I can figure is that this must have gone back to when we were little and my mother would have us put our hair outside for the birds to build nests with after a haircut.  Once my hair started coming back in I could not keep my hands off my head, was constantly touching it, petting it because it was just soooo soft.  I was always thick, but now it feels a lot softer in texture.  I shampooed  with Nioxin even when I was bald.  I think chemo gives a whole new perspective to the bad hair days.",

And here I was thinking they are looking almost normal and they almost are except for about 1/4 of my thumbnails on the end where it is still yellow and sort of looks like I have a fungus on the end and they are very thick where it is like this and difficult to cut with the nail clippers. Maybe they are just so much better, I think they look normal.   The last time I had abraxane was July 22 2009 or somewhere around there so it has been close to 2 years that they have been growing back.  My toenails which I completely lost will never look like toenails again....they are just a mess.",

I am not sure what I will do this time and still have time to think about it since it is not coming out in handfuls, but I definitely need to start staying away from black and dark colors since I get these little piles on my shoulders.  I am going to look for Lee's pic....she won't care if I post it since she knows I write as ask advice for her on here.  Zumba!!   I am uncordinated anyway and cannot imagine myself doing something like zumba especially with neuropathy.  But I know people who have lost up to 20 lbs on it plus lots of inches.  It is definitely a total body work out. ",

You certainly did have an unusually hot summer out there.   ",

The other one Revive was also a shampoo and after using it there was a spray you could use that was supposed to stimulate the hair folicles. Both of these products I got from a hair salon.  I am growing hair pretty rapidly, but do not know if it is becasue I used these products or the fact I had very thick hair to begin with.  Re facial hair, Nodapearl.....the onco I saw at MD Anderson was telling me about a male hormonal treatment that is sometimes used for BC and said the drawback was excess hair growth....not only facial, but sometimes on your chest and he said he talls patients just to shave it off.  That shaving does not make hair more coarse or plentiful. ",

I do not think your hair is supposed to grow back while you are still getting the Abraxane treatments so this may just all be my imagination.  First the hair on the head went, all the peachfuzz on my cheeks and jawline and my lip hairs (actually had electrolysis on that at one point in time)  then the pubic hair, I have very few eyelashes left and even though people comment on the fact I still have eyebrows, I can see they ae also a lot more sparse than they used to be and that they become more compact every week (I had a lot of eyebrows.....was a unibrow before my mother allowed me to pluck them)  Oh, and I still have lots of arm hair, but the hair on my legs did not grow back after shaving once I started chemo.  For some odd reason the hair under my arms stopped growing years ago.  I was happy to see that fuzz on my face go, but now you ladies have me worried that it is going to come back even worse.  Oh, and there was this one stubborn chin whisker that I am very happy is gone.....sometimes that thing would come back and I wouldn't notice it and would be putting on my makeup and see it there curling up and wonder how long others had been noticing it.....probably no one had, but you know how it is.....When you have a zit, it's like the focal point of your face...same way with a chin hair.  Anyway, I am keeping track of you ladies and your progress and want to say that every picture I have seen of you, has been beautiful.  There is something about a bald head that makes a fashion statement and if you have ever noticed you sort of get this radiant glow to your face.......no, not a reflection off your head, but sort of an inner beauty showing through.  Heck, there were some famous singers going for that look.        Susan, I know what you mean about the wig and work.  I take it off as soon as I get home and I wear a bandana when I go out for dinner or somewhere with friends instead of a wig cuz it  just feels better.  At home I just go without and even will walk about the yard and don't  care if neighbors and friends see the real me....also take it off at my Dad's and go without there.  I always feel like I should be wearing a Star Trek outfit, fitted jumpsuit with one of those big collars on it when I see my bald head. I myself think your new hairgrowth looks great and would ditch the wig if you are comfortable going without it.  Doesn't it just kill you when people say Oh, you have a nice shaped head.  I mean what can they say?  Gee, you have a strange little indentation there in back or your veins are very close to the skin aren't they?  For some odd reason I was saving my hair when it first started coming out.....have several baggies full of it.  I am not sure if I hought I was going to make my own wig or some fake bags or what, but I was saving it. Yesterday at work I had a patient come in and say I REALLY like your hair.  When did you do that?  It looks great on you.   I just gave her a big smile and said Thank you and was sort of laughing.  When I got her back in the chair I told her it was a wig and that I was doing chemo and she said she wondered what I thought was so funny about the compliment. I don't tell everyone, but the patients I know well and have formed a bond with over the years.  See, I had let my hair go gray and I really liked it and people always said it looked good that way, but there were many who told me it was aging and that I should color it and I think a lot of people think that is what I did. I will say it is a very good looking wig and didn't cost that much,  but to me it looks like a wig because I know. At this stage of the game, I would be happy for hair any color, but know that is a ways off.  If my husband will help me today I am going to post some hair pics in the gray post, on this one and some of my pets.  I am not kidding about all of you looking lovely, hair or no hair.....it's a smiling face that makes alll the difference.  We have to smile in the face of adversity....isn't that how the saying goes?  .     Oh, and the weight gain......from my own experience and from all I had read in other posts, that is just part of it.  At first I thought Wow, how can anyone gain weight when they are doing chemo?,( I was still under the impression you got sick and skinny)  but now I know it's easy to do.....the same with the hormonal stuff.  I am at medium weight now, have gained about 8 lbs, but at one time was way up there when I was doing the hormonal stuff, but I did take it off after. Maybe we need that extra fat as insulation to ward off other things.....sort of like when the bear hibernates.  Is anyone else cold all the time?......I am so guess I need some insulation.  I think the most frustrating thing about weight gain with treatment is because it is just one more thing we have no control over.  I am not a control freak or anything, but it would just make me want to cry/scream/whatever when I would go in for my treatment and the scale would be up another two lbs in spite of my really watching what I was eating and exercising.  Now I am on an icecream, chocolate shake diet so can't blame it all on my treatments.   LOL!    Marybe",

I could be wrong about this, but I think that is what it means.  Stage lV needs to be treated and managed as a chronic disease since there is no cure for it.",

Unfortunately, we will never know if it will work for us unless we try it.  Doctors do the best they can with the knowledge they have and base a lot on the success and failures they have had with other patients, but they cannot make any guarantees when they put us on a new treatment.  Right now I am on Halaven and when I started on it the beginning of May he told me that so far he has had nothing but success with it, excellent results in fact and jokingly added he didn't want me messing up his track record.  Well, for sure I don't want to, but until I get my scans done and find out it is working, I have my doubts.  One, my hair isn't coming out as fast an everyone else's did and also my tumor markers did not show much of a decrease when we tested them last month and others have had far more dramatic results.  Again, this is a case of me going on how others have responded and I know that doesn't mean I would react the same, but you know how that goes.  When I hear news that someone on the threads is in remission or NED,  not only am I happy for that person, but it always gives me hope and I think most of us feel the same way.  It is more or less luck if it works, but unless we try, we are sure to lose. As they say nothing ventured, nothing gained. I know there has been a lot of heated discussion on these threads about chemo vs alternative and everyone is entitled to their own opinion on that, but the fact is there are no guarantees any of it is going to work....so yes, a lot of it is luck.  However, since we were unlucky enough to be the one in eight, there is nothing to say that we don't have just as good of a shot at responding to treatment and getting the best of the wicked witch. I have been Stage lV for a long time and just hope my \"luck\" holds out because I still have a lot of things I want to do before I give up. I wish you the best and hope that we all survive.",

I am constantly buying things for my Dad's house which we are remodeling 6 months or 12 months same as cash, also like to play those credit card games with balances 0% for 12 months and it would be a great feeling to just be able to pay cash at the time of purchase.  Oh well, guess I should just be thankful I don't really need the benefits right now and am still doing so well and am able to continue working.    I find these boards are wonderful for giving good advice.  ",

I am now planning a trip to MD Anderson where the onco there has actually suggested perhaps putting me back on hormonal treatments depending on what he decides after reviewing my prior treatment and scan reports.  Many women complain about the SEs they experience with AIs (inhibitors/hormonal), but I did not have any real problem with them at all. I asked about surgery in the beginning because I wondered why they just didn't go in and cut that place out of my liver since they do regenerate and was told because the cancer was systemic we needed something that would treat all the areas.  Best wishes for your mother....she is fortunate to have a daughter looking out for her. ",

Usually I had been doing something that they could attribute the pain to and it would go away until the last time it came and then it was really bad and constant.  I insisted she had to do something so she did a bone scan.My sternum was full of it. \"  Sorry, it looks like your cancer is back.  We better do a CT scan to see if it's anywhere else.\"   Well, sorry again, it was in my left lung and there was a spot on my liver.  I should have sued her, but my father said that wouldn't solve anything and I listened to him.  I know of several other people who went to this woman and died....I often wonder if she dismissed their complaints also.  She is a well respected oncologist in this community and everytime I read a quote from her or see her name listed with some cancer event, I want to tell the world about my experience.  I am really sorry I did not sue her.  Not just for myself, but because if it could happen to me, it could happen to someone else and I am sure it has. It is now way too long for me to do anything becasue there is some rule about statute of limitations, but if I knew someone going to her, you would bet I would warn them.  I ran into her once at a cancer event and she acted really shocked to see me.  She probably thought I would be dead by then.   I thank God every day that my surgeon gave me the name of another oncology group and I started going to someone else.  I agree with the others, don't do Utube.  I think you have a legitimate case against this doctor.  You met those other women who had the same experience and I am sure there were others and will be more unless someone speaks up against him.",

I just can't imagine that it would have stopped working so soon....only had my 12th treatment this week and have been so pleased that the SEs are so minimal for me.  We have not done scans to show what is really going on yet, but already I am anticipating having to switch to another chemo. ",

      "Content": "Jul 14, 2012 06:44AM - edited Jul 14, 2012 06:47AM by Marybe    I have never done any alternative treatments, read all the articles people bring me or forward to me in emails about eating asparagus, supplemental vitamins, etc, and normally think they are a bunch of bull and just smile.  I do appreciate people want to help, but in general believe in modern medicine and follow my doctor's advice.  I did however take L-Glutamine and some other vitamins  when I was doing one chemo that caused bad neuropathy on the advice of someone from the BCO threads. I will never be sure if they helped or not since I am one who does not get normal SEs. I have been doing chemo for many years.....was fortunate enough to avoid it for a long time after I was diagnosed Stage lV since the hormonal treatments worked for me and actually put me into remission.   I had always said I would NEVER do chemo.  However, when the AIs quit working, the scans were showing progression and the tumor markers started climbing, there was not much choice.  Onco said we will \"try\" this one and that is what we did.....in my opinion it is all trial and error.  Most of the chemos we tried did not work and when my CA 27.29 was up to 7,668 and the MRI showed that the tumors in my liver were too mutiple to count, the largest of them being almost 10 cm, I called my onco's office immediately and wanted to know when we could get started on this last chemo I have been doing (Adriamycin weekly).  I was putting it off because of the holidays and also because I was afraid of it, having heard all the horror stories about \"the Red Devil\" and also having been told there was only a 20% chance it would even work.   Well, I am happy to say, I took the chance and it DID work....tumor markers were 528 last month and I have been tolerating the SEs quite well....although now the treatments are on hold since my EF dropped and I need to see a cardiologist.  I knew about the danger of heart damage when we started this treatment so it is no big surprise, just a disappointment.  If it is determined, I can no longer stay on this treatment, I will be starting another chemo and guess things will continue that way until we run out of them.  I still find it rather amazing that here I was so sure I would never do chemo, yet look forward to getting my treatments because I think they are going to help me...not cure me, but help me, give me more time.   Quality if important to me as well as quantity so I do take into consideration how I am feeling and I have just been oh so very fortunate in that I actually feel good most of the time and am able not only to still work and do routine things, I have been able to travel.  I did quit one chemo when the SEs just got to be more than I could handle.   Sorry to be rambling on here and will try to get to my point, mho......... I will continue to do all I can to stay alive and when and if I am told Sorry, we have exhausted all of the treatment options, if I cannot find a clinical trial that is trying something new ( I am willing to be a guinea pig) I will be eating tree bark, researching alternative on the internet, and trying some of the alternative ideas I now think to be \"crazy\". At least I think I will, won't really know til I get there.    It is all relative and depending on where we are at the time, determines how we view something. I remember when I thought I never wanted to get old....thought my parents were old and they were only 40( coincidence that I was lst diagnosed at 40) .....now I look forward to every birthday.   I think it would be wonderful to win the lottery, but I won't.....I am too lazy to buy a ticket, have never been lucky in contests, and just don't think about it until I hear the big winners announced.   When it comes to my cancer, I do think about it, A lot,.....so I will continue to keep plugging along and even though nothing is a sure thing, not even proved treatments, for me, I will try just about anything to  keep on living.   I am really fortunate to be able to say that I am still \"living\"....if I felt like crap, was unable to get up and do things, I am sure I would look at it differently.   The good thing, again just my humble opinion, in these women who are looking at alternative treatments when conventional have failed them, the fact the are looking shows they still have hope.   Without hope, I think it's over.   Hope is what keeps me going.   Sorry to have gone on and on.   Have a good day, Ladies.  ",

I have always gotten it like clockwork once a month, but am trying to cut down on costs and wonder if it would be just as effective every other month or every three months?  Yeh, I should be asking my onco this, but lately he isn't my best friend since he is opposed to the treatments I am trying recommended by MDA. Also I have learned as much from you ladies as I have my doctors.  We have great insurance once we meet the dedutcible and out of pocket which has gone up to $6,000 this year, but until we meet that my onco's office has this policy where I have to pay a % of my bill from what they have calculated I will owe out of pocket and it is $398 every time I go in there.  I guess I should not complain since last year it was $580 but that was when I was doing chemo and I think we hit the deductible after about two months...also I had a zero % credit card to put in on then which I don't now.  Right now money is a little tight so if I could cut down on my zometa (which is what makes my % so much)  that would be great and I was just wondering if any of you (with bone mets) get zometa less often.  Thanks so much.  Marybe Be you own advocate and keep on your toes.

I still do not know if the halaven is working, but I have hopes since I know many other women at my onco's office who had great results with it.....one woman has been on it since Jan and her last scan showed her liver to be clear. That is my main worry at this point, my liver, but also have extensive bone mets.   She had neuropathy bad....whole leg is numb, but she is taking some of the vitamin supplements I also learned about on this board and she says it seems to be helping along with the neurontin she is taking. And she has grown about 1 1/2 in of hair while on the havalen. Another woman I know has a lot of nausea so they are working on her anti-nausea meds and she also says she has extreme fatigue. I do get tired and it is normally when my steroids inthe premed wear off....so it hits like Friday late afternoon and sometimes on Sat I just feel like staying in bed and sleep and read and watch tv.....I don't fight it and know the sleep is good for me.   She started on it a week after I did. She still has hair, but it has thinned a lot....like mine. We both had thick hair. Some lose it all and maybe I still will.    I am still able to work and think this surprises my onco.   In general I think I am just extemely fortunate when it comes to SEs in that they do not hit me really hard......not that a few of them didn't, but I am odd in that once they are gone I just sort of forget how bad they were.  My tumor markers were sky high when I started the halaven....2,709 and when we checked them after the two cycles, a week ago Wed., they came back 2,635 which I found to be very disappointing, but at least they went down for the lst time in something like 18 months. I am having scans July 18 so then we will really find out if it is working or not. There is a Halaven thread on here, called Day One, Halaven, I think. Put halaven in the subject line on search and it will come up.....there are success stories as well as failures on there. I hope you do well on it.....complain....there are things they can do to lessen your SEs.....also try the claritin...sounds crazy, but it worked for me. Hope I have not confused you....the thing is we all respond differently and don't all get the same SEs. Now I note your name and avitar, think you are already on that other thread.   Duh.....although actually think I am thinking clearer on this chemo that I did some of the others. ",

I myself have just started on navelbine and have had two treatments so far and other than being very tired two days after and my eyes burning for a few days the way they do when I have a fever, no SEs, but I know it is way to early to tell.

Re last post I do not know what an omentum is or where it is.  Found my anatomy knowledge was not all that great since I thought my liver was more in the stomach region until they told me this pressure I feel is where my liver is. I learn a lot about medications and side effects when I go for my treatments and visit with other women in the treatment room.....I also hope to learn a lot from this message board. ",

Oh, forgot the methotrexate/cytoxin, but that was an oral one.   The one I am about to start in May, Halaven, you do lose hair with.  On the adrimycin, yes, you will lose your hair....also with taxol, taxotere and Abraxane (all members of the taxol family)  I did Abraxane and did not lose my hair until the 29th day after treatment and it did not come out all at once, just got sparcer and sparcer and when that happened, I went and had it cut very short, not shaved, but short.  I do not like losing my hair, but found it easier to deal with than the funky nails and lose of taste.....maybe it is not big deal to some, but I need my sense of taste.  I think you will find everyone is different with their SEs....some women only have an altered sense of taste and some do not get neuropathy.  They list the SEs with each chemo, but that does not mean you will necessarily get them.  I don't know of anyone who has developed luekemia from adriamycin/ cytoxin.............as I said they just have to tell you all the possibilites to cover themselves in case something does happen.  Many women find that their hair starts growing back before they finish the treatments.  No one ever really wants to do this, but consider the alternative.  I actually do recall when I started on one chemo, maybe the navelbine, I was anxious to get it started and happy that we were doing something because my scans had showed progression.  The one I am starting May 4, I am not looking forward to, but that is only because right now I am feeling really good......know I am not good on the inside because of the CAT scan results, but I am feeling good.   So even though I am not looking forward to this, I look forward to getting to know all of you in the months to come.",

But I met a woman in the treatment room who has been on it since Jan. and she is doing well except for the neuropathy and her hair is even starting to come back while she is on it and she said she really has not suffered from fatigue so I found that to be really encouraging.  It took forever as usual since you have to go through that crap with the business office first and then you see the dr or the PA and then they send you to the treatment room and they have to await approval from up front before they can even mix your meds and then there is another wait before they hang them.  Deciding not to work this afternoon was a very smart move since I would have been very late getting there.  I hope I am not up all night because of the steriods....I asked How much am I getting and the nurse said the full dose.  I feel like I have a sore throat, but this is not a listed common or uncommon SE so think I may just be dry.  Oh and I guess the reason my onco was really pushing this one is because he's had good results with every patient so far and he told me to keep it going....Like I have any say in that....but I sure am hoping.  I like your haircut Cyborg.  Almond milk is yummy, Laureen  Robyn, I know it sounds awful, but I think I would be happy if I ever had a treatment where I lost my appetite.  I eat even when I am unable to taste.   I really like your advice about just getting through TODAY, V.   ",

      "Content": "May 5, 2011 08:59PM - edited May 5, 2011 09:07PM by Marybe You are freaking out because it is normal to do so.....this is a scary thing, having chemicals that actually kill cancer cells shot into your body. I have had a port for 12 years and love it. I did not get it when I was lst diagnosed Stage lV because I was being treated hormonally, but I did get an infusion of aredia every month for my bones (that was pre Zometa) and also after awhile they started having trouble with my veins from drawing blood and stuff, plus after my mastectomy they only had the one arm to use......so I gave in and got the port. I think the reason I hated the idea of it so much was because it was physical evidence that I had cancer....not that the big slash across my breast and not having a nipple wasn't a tip off, but for some reason I just did not want that port. I remember when my boyfriend saw it for the lst time he said It looks like a doorbell. And that made me laugh because it did. Mine sticks out a lot more than most for some reason and it is a definite round projection.....but let me tell you , it works every time and I don't even need the cold spray anymore, because it is probably calloused. What else did I want to comment on...can't go back a page or I will lose my post and I hate that. Oh, the wigs.....as I said earlier check the yellow pages. Many times in the onco's office they will have flyers or ads for wig and prosthesis places, but don't go to them if you can help it, as they are expensive. Also google wigs and a ton of places will come up. I did not get one through the Am Cancer society, but did get one through a local cancer organization and also bought one....I take that back, bought two. Buying wigs can be sort of addictive and it's a fun way to get a whole new look. I did not want to lose my hair, but I had treatments for so long that did not cause me to lose my hair, that by the time I actually did, it was not such a big deal, My original diagnosis was in 1990 and I did not lose my hair until 2009 so it was like I had 19 years to get used to the idea. I do recall or at least the friend who went with me when I found out I first had BC likes to remind me, the lst words out of my mouth were Will I lose my hair? My tumor was very small, the 19 lymph nodes I had removed were all negative and I had a modified radical mastectomy at the advice of my surgeon who said that way we would be sure to get it all.....so chemo was not recommended. However, the onco I am with now said that had it been as few as five yrs later, they would have given me chemo and if that had happened who knows, maybe it never would have come back. But that is something I will never know. However as un-fun as it is to do, I think all of you who are starting out with it stand a much better chance of never having to deal with recurrent BC and will remain cancer free. Taste....interesting that you crave salty things....salt was the lst sense of taste that I lost....things would be plenty salty, but I could not taste the salt at all. Then all the flavor in things just gradually diminished.....I could eat really spicy things, but they didn't even taste hot. I ended up having chocolate malts or a Frosty every day....sometimes several a day. Sweet was the last taste I lost, but I still liked the milkshakes and malts because they just felt good going down. Chemo gave me heartburn....I took protonics and have now graduated to nexium....before that I had a cast iron stomach and nothing bothered me. Let's see, what else....I forget. Oh I think your onco is wise in giving you the AC slowly since you did have it before and it is true it can cause heart problems....not a guarantee that it will, but it is always possible. Oh and someone was talking about the SE disclosure that came with the klonipen (sp)...if you read most of those inserts you would be afraid to take an aspirin....they are just trying to cover themselves. I did not ever have restless leg,,,,but my friend did. I am going to ask her what she takes for it. Your dentist can prescribe that Miracle mouthwash for mouth sores and thrush...they mix it up at the pharmacy for you. Just try to keep your mouth and tongue as clean as possible. I think that is about all I can remember. This whole deal is an adventure....we can be told about SEs and read about them, but we all react differently....one may lose their hair right on schedule, another it might take longer, and believe it or not some don't lose it....one may have nausea as soon as they get home while another one may not be phased by it at all. They had me fill the Rx for zoffran,but so far I feel fine and have not needed it at all. My eyes got totally messed up and teared all the time because my tear ducts got blocked, but this does not happen to everyone. We all react differently and we will never know how it is going to effect us until we actually get the treatment. I was always so scared of chemo and said I would NEVER do it....well, I certainly ate my words on that one. This halaven is the 5th chemo I have done and getting the lst treatment yesterday was just as scary as the very first time I had chemo. And that is why I am here going through it with you ladies, As they say misery loves company, but I am really praying it is not miserable for any of us. If I forgot to comment on anything I should of, I apologize....I have chemo brain big time...that is not a myth, it is true you do get that. Edited to add ...I just read your post which was made while I was writing away....I did not go for that visualization imagry at all....they told me to think of the treatment as a little pacman eating up the cancer cells....it backfired and I just kept seeing the little pacman character eating holes in my bones (because I do have bone mets) .  Maybe it will help you, but it scared me.  I do like the growing flowers analogy though. ",

I just hurt everywhere and am not sure if it was bone, muscle, joints or all of them, but it was an effort to move around.   I have had nuprogen before, but I think with those you get them for several days, don't you?  Neulasta is one shot.  Now I had a friend who had no problems with it whatsoever, but boy oh boy, do I ever feel like a big fat achy mess.  BKJ66, hopefully this too shall pass.  The way I always look at it is that the cancer was there and we did not know about it until a test discovered it and they told us.  It is devestating news, but at least now we are getting treatment and not just allowing it to take over.  Better days ARE ahead.  I sure would not want to be driving downtown for a shot in Seattle.....your traffic there is terrible! ",

I like several of you do not plan on going the wig route again, but may change my mind.....I seem to have given all my scarfs and headgear away to others who needed them after me, but a good friend from another thread is going to send me hers and also I am going to check out the website carabear posted.  Mine was already short, but I am thinking Tues, I should get it cut even shorter to cut down on fallout.  Bkj66,  That was a very stupid thing for your friend's husband to ask you the prognosis, but sometimes I think men just don't get it......they are rather blunt and to the point and sometimes don't realize how things they say sound.   My onco will never give me a prognosis, he will say this is serious, or tell me how he thinks I will respond to something, but when I ask him prognosis, he tells me that he does not have a crystal ball.  Everything hinges on how we respond to the treatment and sometimes we have to feel like crap along the way, but if it works, in the long run it is worth it.  Cyborg, It is a normal reaction for you to feel the way you do....cancer and the treatments take away so much, but the good side is that this will pass and the time will go faster than you ever thought it would....it's almost June so you now have a month under your belt.....and something I have found from having to deal with this stuff is that we will find we appreciate things that we used to take for granted....like stretching without any pain, having a bad hair day (at least it is there), telling someone sure you would love to go out for lunch without having to worry that maybe you won't be up to eat, biting into something and actually being able to get the full flavor of it.You will even find your sexuality returns . Sometimes I feel like maybe I should not be on this thread since so many of you are just starting out and I am stage lV and have been doing this for a long time, but when you stop to think about it we are all in the same boat, all of us have cancer and all of us are going through treatments that we just started and having SEs.  I am on here in need of support as much as  hopefully being able to give it.  I will tell you from experience that you will get through this and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.....not necessarily for me, but for the rest of you.  I know I will never be NED, but I would be thrilled to get back into remission.  I hope you are able to enjoy the holiday Monday....we are taking off for my father's later this morning, which I do not want to do at all, but it's his 89th birthday tomorrow so I have to go, already put it off a day so I could rest up.  When I told him I was going to spend yesterday in bed he said that was good, to rest up and take care of myself and that he is always behind me 100% and that I need to take care of me....and then he asks Are you going to make me a birthday cake? ",

      "Content": "Dec 17, 2011 04:00AM - edited Dec 17, 2011 06:07AM by Marybe Well, hello you fellow eaters.  Have you all been in the closet?.....thought I was all alone in this one.  I used to blame it on the decadron, but I really think a lot of it is stress or the combo of meds you are getting.  It used to be decadron would keep me awake for exactly 2 1/2 days after treatment....I would get my treatment on a Wed. morning and be going strong until Friday afternoon when if I would sit down I would fall asleep in a chair mid-sentence.  I would go to bed and then sleep for a day.  I ate a lot also.....would get these food cravings that I had to satisfy RIGHT NOW.....found myself pulling off exits to get whatever I had seen on a billboard or heard an add for on the radio, BUT I must admit I always have liked fast food (as well as food for the more sophisticated palates) and think there is nothing like a Burger King Whopper or Rally's fries to satisfy hunger.  I was eating things I had never eaten before in my life also just because they sounded good or they were there.  I must confess I did the same thing though when I was doing Abraxane and lost my sense of taste completely....then I was searching for something I could get a taste out of and that led to quite a food quest.  I actually loved the energy and got a lot done staying up most of the night. I would look forward to getting lots of projects down the night after treatment.  Prior to this chemo,  I had them lower my dose until I was off it all together (this was when I was really feeling sleep deprived ), but I still ate.  I think steroids are meant to help with the nausea as well as pain, but I can't swear to this. Now, I am doing decadron again , BUT it is not keeping me awake at all....nothing is keeping me awake with this one and I am sleeping more than I ever did in my life.  And  alas, I am  overeating, but I think it is because I feel I am entitled to eat whatever I want at this point in life.  I know I will be unhappy later when I am observing yet another chin in the mirror, but it tastes so good going down.  I told one of my friends once, that I actually enjoy being stuffed.   And so the cycle goes on.  I am sure it does increase our appetites, but in my case I think it is also partly mental....I am rewarding myself with food for doing treatment.  I am not saying that is what you all are doing because I know for a fact I was starving that one time I was doing decadron, but I also found it could be controlled.   I did WW and would then pig out on healthy food so it is possible to lose while on it, but unless it really bothers you putting on the lbs, I would not worry about it.....at least not until the holidays are over and you have had your fill of Xmas cookies, Yule logs, egg nog and fudge.   I used to have no problem turning down sweets, now I love them.  Carbs always have been my downfall......I would order a grilled cheese with mac and cheese and a baked potato on this side  if I didn't think people would stop by my table and stare. So what am I doing up now if the decadron isn't doing it?.....I went to bed really early and for some reason my body now feels like it is morning, but I am going back to bed just as soon as I let the dogs out.  Oddly enough, I am not hungry so I think I will just go get some more ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZs.   You are not alone, Kathy.   This is a great thread you started.   Oh, I forgot to add whenever I am going for a scan (unless it is one where I cannot eat beforehand) or waiting for results, I really shovel it in. It took me a long time to realize that I stress eat, but I do for sure.......used to chain smoke when I was stressed, but thank goodness I quit that one a long time ago ",

Whatever the treatment, I hope it doesn't involve neulasta....the claritin did seem to help, but it just doesn't make me feel good at all.....like now I am feeling almost like I have a cold and it didn't start til after this last shot. I sure do hope all of you are doing well and please keep in mind my cancer was more advanced than any of you just starting out so I think remission and NED is in store for many of you and soon treatment will be behind you.

Once you know, you can do something about it.  I don't know what your onco is going to suggest, but AIs can be used for bone mets.   You would not have wanted an alien....The National Enquirer would have been hounding you day and night. ",
