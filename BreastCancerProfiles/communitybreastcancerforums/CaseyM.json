I saw that on one of these threads someone was asking about the side effects experienced with Tamoxifen...my mother is a breast cancer survivor--first diagnosed at 36--had a mastectomy--breast cancer reappeared almost ten years later in one of her lungs--she had a lobectomy and was put on Tamoxifen for five years--that has been 16 years ago now (she is a 26-year survivor).  She has had numerous side effects--but perhaps the most significant was her skin has become really thin (bruises and bleeds very easily now).  It also affected her weight, and perhaps her joints.  However, she is still here, and for that I am SO thankful and I know she is too.  She has just started a blog to share her story with others:  www.faithhopeandlattes.blogspot.com.  It is only two weeks old, so there are still lots of topics and issues to discuss...if you have a question for her please post a comment on the blog and we promise to reply.",
