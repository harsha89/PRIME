These are mammographically suspicious. They extend over a distance of about 2 cm and are located approximately 7 cm from the nipple. I am scheduled for this week to see the surgeon and determine what needs to happen next. Will probably need a biopsy im sure :/ im 60 yrs old with no family history of breast cancer.

Prior I had a regular mammogram and an ultrasound. Im particulary concerned by the pleomorphic microcalcification :(",
