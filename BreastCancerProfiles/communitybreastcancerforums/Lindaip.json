With each therapy, (4 A/C, 4 Taxotere and 5 years of Arimidex) my chances of reccurrence would go down. I calculated it out to about 17.5%. That was six years ago and I now have NED. I am also on a clinical trial to see if 5 years of Femara (I am either getting Femara or a placebo) brings the recurrence rate down even more. Also remember that the informationÂ on recurrence rates is 5 years old and women are doing muuch better now than those rates show. Linda",
