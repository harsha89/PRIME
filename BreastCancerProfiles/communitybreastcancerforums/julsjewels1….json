I will try to add my diagnosis. I realised when reviewing my initial post that I had made a few omissions and also some spelling mistakes- must be chemo brain. So, how are you both feeling? Looking forward to keeping in touch and getting to \"know\" everyone. Talk soon,   Hugs, Juls",

Also, sometimes, you just need to have someone's shoulder to lean on- or at times,cry on- good therapy in itself. I think we are all living someone else's lives at present- it all seems so unreal and unfamiliar. We'll just get on- things will be normal again! Carla-so relieved to hear your good news. I think this fear will linger for a long time whenever something new crops up but I know that the tx's now are so targeted and effective that we have to trust our teams and have faith. Be encouraged. Tappy- I fought the worst cold of my life the last couple of weeks but I think I'm on the mend. I went to my GP in the second week and he put me on antibiotics just to keep the bases covered- were they necessary?likely not as most colds are viral. As long as your blood counts are okay, it seems that they go ahead with Tx's. If you're sick or coughing a lot they ask you to wear a mask. cfdr-I too, am paranoid about germs- always using wipes and lotions in the car and washing all the time. I was told that was the best defence to infection but what a pain. I think I'm driving my husband nuts too! Anybody else out there obsessed with taking their temp? Crazy isn't it? Dia123- hope all went well yesterday and you're doing okay today. Hugs to all and wishing you a pleasant day         Juls",

As far as the difference or se's, I don't there is any, only the number of shots required. So far I have been okay, I have the third one today. Apparently bone pain is common and Claritin helps with that- or Tylenol is another option. Good luck.

I had my second of 4 sessions Oct.18th and will follow with Taxol/DD for 4 sessions also, followed by radiation so should be finished up maybe Feb.2012.

I feel for those of you are have young ones to care for, a job you need to go to and those with little support...I am lucky in those regards, this is a journey where one needs backup and care. I don't know about most, but I feel as though I am living someone else's life at present and it is confirmed visually every time I pass the mirror as we buzzed my hair last night in anticipation of the inevitable fall out. I can't wait to see my Grandies reaction! First treatment for me was full of anxiety...not knowing what to expect and what SE's would happen and how I would handle them. This time, I knew ahead what to do to help with some in adance so  that helped. I think being flexible will be the key - and just keeping distracted and carrying on as normal as possible. I have been following along through the month and found the helpful hints, camaraderie and support very helpful. I have found that eating raw parsley helps with acid reflux, and eating a couple of plain crackers or cookies at 2 hour intervals is of benefit. We try and walk when weather permits and I always like a ride in the countryside to fill in time.Copios amounts of water is essential too. I couldn't find a way to acccess the diagnosis section ( I am not all that computer literate ) but I had a 3.4cm tumour, 0/1 nodes,clear margins, and am triple neg.

St,Jude- I shaved mine off too and wonder if I should have...I still have stubble although thinning-haven't noticed any growth yet. I start Taxol Tuesday-a bit(no-a lot) worried about this and not knowing how it will affect me but it's the next step- so may as well just get on with it! We have to drive an hour to get to the centre and it is a 8:00 o'clock appointment so it will be a really early start- I am definitely NOT good at mornings! I guess they do this IV really slowly so we will be there most of the day I suspect.,Have to start the steroids tomorrow ( ahead this time).

I feel like I have a big ball of gas or goo high in my stomach and sometimes it really hurts. I don't want to take any more meds-we are already overloaded. Did you have to take any more nausea meds yet? I have found Tetley White tea fairly easy on the tummy and I am trying to drink the ginger/lemon mix too.

Looks like a bunch of us are having eyesight problems and cotton head. I keep cleaning my glasses thinking that will help- but no-still not right. Today DH and I are cleaning and getting things in order for tomorrow when I go for round 3...mixed feelings but at least I'll be over half way with A/C tx's. I wonder if any of this will fall into a pattern? Getting in the groceries that I tolerate and topping up supplies- and drinking tons of water. I think that helped last time with the IV and eliminating the drugs. Terry: I meant to write Lakeside Drive and I thought about that while I was writing it but chemo brain mixed things up again. I remember when we first went to visit our friends when I was really young, we arrived late at night- thought we wanted Lakeshore Dr. and drove around in the dark for ages on the wrong side of North Bay! Still haven't learned I guess. The city has spread out a lot since then. Dia123- you okay? Haven't heard from you for awhile. Hope you've been welll and just busy. Just wondering where you live. I find it really interesting that so many of us have connections. I just want to add that I take my hat off to all of you who are plodding along as normal as can be, going to jobs, caring for families and getting about. I find I lack the motivation for that at present but maybe I'll give myself a kick in the pants now that my cold seems to be improving, and just get moving! As winter sets in here in Ontario that may be a challenge in itself. My onc nurse says \" you have to live you know\" and this is after all temporary. Auntienance- I buzzed my hair a couple of weeks ago and not much of it has fallen out either- just a bit on the top, likely from rubbing it all the time...still can't get used to the look.

Got it's name because it is red and makes you pee red for a couple of days till it's clear from your system- sort of freaky! My chemo is DD(Dose dense tx every 2 wks) A/C (C-Cyclophosphamide) for 4 sessions, then DD T (Taxol or Paclitaxel) for 4 sessions, then rads ( maybe 16) following. I should be finished up in Feb. if everything goes along as to schedule. I don't know if they use the same drugs in the States - I see some of our ladies get different things for nausea. Do you go to a major cancer clinic? I use a Biotene toothpaste and I like it. When you have dry mouth it increases spit and is quite mild. I also use the Biotene mouthwash every night to gargle and rinse my mouth just before bed and it has kept things in failry good shape. Love the idea about snow cones...they haven't offered any tasty syrup on the ice chips as of yet- wouldn't that just start something! They do bring around cookies and drinks whenever you want and that's nice. I too, had constipation the first tx so I take Soflax ( a stool softener) starting the day before ( 1,am and 1,pm) and for a few days after and it has worked great. I wish they had told me that before 1st tx 'cause it wasn't fun! Yes- I have weird things going on with body temp....sometimes cold and sometimes warm- usually at night for the warm part. I have cuddly blankets on the couch and they keep me cozy. Don't know about you, but I feel better if I am cool and then at least you can add clothes.

I'm first day after tx yesterday and feel pretty good so went for a short walk and it was lovely to be out in the sunshine and crisp fall air. My next few days will be the problem ones if anything like last time. I wonder if the different reactions and timing of such are due to the drugs we each take? Aren't these temperature changes weird?

I also like rides in the country. Tappy- hope your cold is on the mend-I'm still hacking up goo- more than four weeks now! Anyway ladies- I'm going to watch the Rememberance Day ceremony on TV and think how lucky I am to live in a country where we have such freedoms, and safety and good health care and thank all those who have given their lives to protect all these values....many died so young so that we could be free. We must all be grateful today for that.  have  a good day, Love, Hugs and prayers to all,   Juls",

It is a matter of how old you feel although this cancer diagnosis,tx's,se's and being bald has made me look and feel old,tired and unwell. I hope when all is done I regain my youthful attitude and at least look my age- not so much older! Glad your stomach is improving. I have trouble with yogurt-makes my tummy sourish. Just talked with the onc nurse and told her I felt like I had morning sickness all the time and she said just eat small amounts of neutral,carby type foods- and often...so it seems like that is good advice all round. Have a great weekend all- I hope with good nights rest,minimal side effects and some joy. Warm Hugs and Happy Thoughts      Juls",

Luvrving-you look sassy with your red hair coming back in.How are you feeling generally, six weeks out from tx? Terry-bet you are anxious to get your last treatment over. I have my last one of A/C on Tuesday and then onto the Taxol. I have heard that the nausea isn't as bad but the aches and pains start-anyone got any comments on this transition? I think I'll load up on Tylenol. These sore feet are awful- can't even go for short walks...I am hobbling like a 90 year old! At least they don't hurt when I am sitting-I think my butt will be flatter soon! I haven't had any head pimple issues and my hair still hasn't completely fallen out although it is thinning-still bristly and I just use my regular shampoo. I have developed some pimple type spots on my body- that clear by themselves- guess it's the system breaking down somewhat. Anybody else feeling queasy a lot of the time? I am on the verge most days and all day. Makes it hard to get the water down- I shall try the cranberry juice with it-white tea seems okay too. Carla-I don't know how do your job- any chance of taking a leave- it all seems just simply too much to deal with! Dia123-I'll maybe look into the wellness group although a little harder for me to get at from here in Dover.We seem to be on the highway a lot as it is.

Perts-I don't have weird dreams- but I do lie awake at night with things going through my head that make no sense and are a waste of time. I think these drugs do strange things to your brain- I hope my returns to it's semi normal state after this! Tappy- I agree that this journey we are on changes your perspective. I look at people and things in a gentler,more compassionate way and I am going to try and do more good. I have always put family first and now when I see people I wonder what is going in their lives that they may be dealing with and don't judge their behaviour as much. Maybe there are life lessons to learn. I will also make sure I appreciate each day and the beauty it brings. Wimusicmaker-good news on your heart echo. You have a hard decision on tx. There is always a balance needed and you have to weigh up the pros and cons.Do you have anyone to ask for second opinions or advice?Could the tightness in your chest be from fatigue or stress/anxiety...I sometimes get it from that. Is anyone else sick of worrying about germs and germy people? I never used to give it a second thought and now I consider whether stores are busy and crowded and I spray my DH down when he returns from the stores- those darn dirty shopping cart handles! I think I'm becoming paranoid-just don't want to get my cold back or sick and have something else to deal with. To all our U.S, gals- Happy Thanksgiving! Hope you all feel well enough to enjoy the goodies and celebrations. I guess this is the big kick off to your Christmas season as well- Happy Holidays to come! Dia123-glad to hear you're doing well- me too. To All - have a great day and hope you are feeling okay. Warm Hugs Juls",

It feels good to be out-even in the car-but you're right- I do become housebound and sit a lot. My DH has been doing almost everything- I am very lucky in that regard. Nice that many are looking forward and making plans for trips -something to look forward to. I have radiation after chemo so won't be finished till sometime in March so we will see what we do then-maybe just try and get back to normal!

I asked about cold compresses for nails and was told there is no conclusive evidence that it helps-any comments? I will suck on ice chips too. My reading doesn't suggest that it is as necessary to drink as much water to flush it out....am I dreaming? Are you having 4 tx's? too. Tappy- when I was at my worst with that cold they put me on an antibiotic as a precaution but I haven't heard of Lavaquin. I still have traces of it and am always worried it's coming back!

A lot of us are starting Taxol next and I guess we all have the same reservations and worries. I go tomorrow. My understanding is that we will have decreased nausea but possibly more joint and bone pain but I figure we can fight that with pain killers! Apparently it happens- if it does- 3 or 4 days after tx and lasts a few days..we'll see. I hope none of us have the allergic reaction they talk about to complicate things.My onc gave me a script for 100 Tylenol 3's ( was he trying to tell me something?) Wildrumara and Pippen and Tappy:I was an emotional wreck tx3 too but more stable now.It's just the meds and after all, this whole process is stressful and crappy-just gotta push through it as those who have gone before...most of us are half way through-woo  hoo! Carla-interesting you are having your A/C and Taxol together-how long is the course? Fredntan-good luck with the banjo. My grandad started lessons at 80 and got quite good so you can do it- something to focus and accomplish. WelcomeDmeltesen-sure you can join us- the more resources and support we have the better. We are on the same tx schedule so we will go through this together-there are a bunch of us all at the same stage of tx. Well, Christmas decs do make one feel cheerier and I love that the shows are starting on tv. I seem to cry at them, whether they are happy, sad,or funny-but that's okay. have a good day all, Hugs Juls ",

I shall follow your routine- if it helps good- I'm with you on \"helping the odds\". To those starting Taxol- my experience is that so far it is easier than the A/C or \"red Devil\" as we call it ( now I know why!). I don't feel so nauseated or \"out of it\" or \"off\" and seem to have less emotional fits. It's early in the scheme of things- just a few dayss post 1st tx. but I am hopeful that this is a trend and that I can deal with any aches and pains if and when they develop. Things change daily don't they so it's just managing what's thrown at us... Look at us though- more than half way through Ya Hoo! I have an appointment with the radiologist next so that's where I go after chemo. Hope everyone else tolerates the Taxol better. Fran- how you coping on your own- any help showing up?- thinking of you. AbqTiger-Looks like they give you the ice gloves if you have docetaxol. I am on paclitaxol- don't know what the difference is but they say the nail issue is not as critical with mine so I am just taking the supplements that are supposed to help with it. So many variations it's hard to keep up on them isn't it?I have GiIi trouble too, and have never had before all this chemo- it really is a pain-literally-isn't it? I drink white tea and it is quite easy on the stomach and rice puddings! Take care all,   Hugs Juls",

I guess I'll just have to sort it out- new side effects to manage. They say that this drug is more predictable in the timing of the se's- anybody find that? I am happy that the nausea is all but gone. Taste buds stilll awful but I can deal with that. Hope everyone is having few se's and an okay day- we're getting there ladies!",
