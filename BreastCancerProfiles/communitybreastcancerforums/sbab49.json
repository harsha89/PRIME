I would choose savi again only because I know what it is and would be better prepared, but I too found it somewhat painful. I still have minor pain and the savi sight still drains somewhat at night. I still have a very red breast and I completed rads on 6/18. Being a candidate for brachytherapy meant that we were very fortunate to have early stage BC and required no chemo and for that I am very thankful. I start Femara next week and am dreading it. Praying I don't experience the dreadful side affects that I have read about. None of us asked to take this journey but here we are and I pray for good outcomes for all us.",

After waiting for 2 1/2 hours after scan, they finally came and told me that start of rads was cancelled today due to air pocket in cavity. They knew it was there yesterday and said nothing. It had resolved somewhat today but not enough to start rads. I am so frustrated and of course found tears that had been lurking waiting to be spilled. Hopefully tomorrow will be a new beginning. They have me pressure wrapped to help force the air out of the cavity. So darn uncomfortable. I don't want to second guess this decision because I know in the end it will be good, but they delayed a week and now another delay and so many things to do to get ready for company a week from Thursday. Thanks for listening and hugs to everyone.",

Had device removed a week ago and I agree while it was no walk in the park, very grateful to have been a candidate for this type of rads. My surg onco inserted device and rad nurse removed it. Insertion and removal while a little painful was the easy part. Having this device in place for 9 days was rough but constantly reminded myself the alternative was rads for 7 weeks for 35 treatments. That helped bring it back into perspective.  The rep from the savi company was present when my device was inserted and said savi company recommends that device be placed within 1 month time frame of surgery. However every doc has own preference. Mine was placed one day before the month was up due to scheduling problems. Ended up with air pocket in cavity which required a pressure binding and delayed rads for one day. My best wishes to all of us for a good outcome to all of this.",

I took articles I printed from breastcancer.org and we discussed them pretty thoroughly. I was concerned because the articles weren't real assuring.

I did not find it brutal but very uncomfortable for sure. Lidocaine was used for insertion and topical lidocaine for removal. Both were painful but tolerable. I was due for follow up mammogram last month but opted to skip until yearly, due to fact that breast is still painful and just the thought of squeezing the poor breast brings tears to my eyes. All Oncs were ok with that decision. All in all I would do internal rads again if I had to make that choice. I had skin burns and savi site still is not 100%. Onc said that had I had external rads the skin burns would have been far worse since internal rads is supposed to spare skin trauma and it occurred anyway. I am sorry that any of us have to be here but thankful to have this behind me. My thoughts and prayers for all still waiting for treatment.",
