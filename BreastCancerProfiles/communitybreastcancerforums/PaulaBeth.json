B vitamins aren't very effective alone. Taking B-complex makes the B-6 work better. My onc said to take 50 mg. I take 200 mg. in addition to the 100 mg. that's in the B-complex.",

I think I remember someone telling me that when the arm stays indented for longer than a few seconds after pressure that is a problem. I don't remember whether it had to do with the LE or the clot. Does anyone know if this is something I need to worry about? Log in to post a reply",
