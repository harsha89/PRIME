So, for those of you that haven't started chemo yet keep that in mind.  If you get severe headaches and feel nausea even though you may be taking Zofran or Compazine then they may have to change your anti-nausea meds.  We will get through this one step at a time.  Now I just have to stop thinking about the next treatment. ",

I'm just glad that we can laugh while fighting this horrible disease.  I hate having cancer but refuse to let it stop me from laughing and living.  Laughing just makes me feel better.  I've even started watching World's Funniest Videos again so that I can just have at least dose of good laughter each day. Take care everyone and talk to you soon.  I'm off to aggravate my cat with my wig!!!",

As for myself, I am just so sad about the holidays.  I don't know why.  Even my good old antidepressants aren't really helping.  I have to travel four hours to go home tomorrow and I don't even want to go.  I haven't seen my mom since my mastectomy surgery so this is the first time she'll see me in the midst of chemo - everyone else too.  A couple of good friends want to visit me while I'm in my home town but I just don't want to see anybody.  I just don't know what is wrong with me.  If my kids weren't going to be there I would just stay here.

Kim - sorry to hear that you're not feeling good.  I find that a good cry helps me a lot.  Although here lately I've cried more than ever.  I can barely listen to my beloved country music because it ends up making me cry - which ruins my makeup - which makes me look even worse with no hair!  How many of you cried as you put up your Christmas decorations?  I did.  When I pulled out those ornaments that my kids made when they were little I lost it.  Oh my - so many tears these days.

Well, gotta run.  You guys are in my prayers.  Hope the rest of your week is fantastic!!",

It's worth having the conversation with your doctor. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.  Hope you all have a good night.",

The doctor is having fluid tested but meanwhile I'm scared.  I asked him whether he thought it could be cancer and he said that he thought it was \" most likely due to fluid build-up\".  Has anyone else had this happen to them? Please let me know. Thanks!",

Are any of you actually not wearing wigs/scarves anymore?   I'm telling you - as soon as my little bit of hair is about 1/4 inch long - I'm ditching my hats.  I'm so sick of wearing them.  Looks like I'll have to color my hair though - it's coming back grey.  That's okay though - just as long as it comes back.  I just haven't been brave enough to go out in public being bald or with what little bit of peach fuzz I have right now.

Another note - I'm divorced and think I can handle anything.  My family lives 4 hours away so I didn't want them to come over and probably just end up watching me sleep.  I was regretting that decision big time last night as I was sitting here sick as a dog and scared to deah.  Big mistake on my part.  My sisters and mom said that they are coming next treatment - just in case.  I guess I have to learn that I can't control everything about this stupid cancer and will sometimes need help.  Boy that's tough though when you're so independent and stubborn.  I shouldn't have tried to do this treatment by myself. So, I hope all of the bad stuff is behind now.  Feeling pretty good today. On the bright side - one day - five to go.  I say we all visit Normandy in France when we're all healthy again - doesn't that sound like a great time!  Hope you all have a great weekend!",

Pippen - I'm so sorry to hear that you passed out.  Hope that doesn't happen to you again.  Sorry to hear that you had to go to the emergency room WIMusicmaker.  My oncologist went ahead and put me on an antibiotic on Friday since my white counts were so low. As far as the Claritin goes I stopped taking it on Day 5 and felt the bone pain coming on.  I immediately took another one and it went away.  I think next time around I'll take the Claritin the day before, day of and 6 or 7 days after treatment.  My oncologist told me that the neulasta shot wouldn't keep my white counts from going down but it would keep the number of days when I would be most susceptible to infection at a lower rate than if I didn't take it.  With all of the germs floating around out there and the fact that I  am working I figure I need it. Hope you all have a good night.  Talk to you tomorrow.",

Having the second treatment has just confirmed what I thought - it's going to take a few days to get back to a somewhat normal feeling and the crappy taste is going to linger for about a week.  Boy it sure makes everything taste bad.  I've found water with lemon is about the only thing I can drink the first week.  I miss my Diet Cokes!!

Good news is that the Claritin is doing the trick - no bone pain this time either - yet.  I guess we just have to expect that the first week after treatment is just going to be a hard week and keep moving forward to that last treatment date.  Hang in there girls.  We'll get through this.  Talk to you later!",

I'm not so sure. As far as the metal taste goes, a friend of my mom's that went through chemo told me that she learned that if she crunched on ice or ate popsicles (which she would bring in a cooler) during the treatment that she didn't have any metal taste.  Not sure how that would work but I'm going to try it on Friday.  I just hate that everything tastes so gross after treatment.  My foods of choice during treatment are just about the same as you ladies except for kettle corn.  Wow - I'm going to have to try that - I love it. Fran - I have a hard time getting up some days too.  I just want to stay curled up with my kitty and sleep and sleep and sleep.  I'm just so tired but some days just don't want to deal with the bald head, feeling like crap, etc., etc.  Tappy - glad to hear that you are feeling a little better.  It must be horrible to have a cold on top of everything else.  Take care of yourself. WIMusicMaker - I crave carbs too and have gained weight.  What the heck?  It's kind of hard to believe that I'm going through chemo and have gained weight!!  My doctor says now is not the time to worry about dieting but I sure hate gaining weight.  I don't have the energy to exercise right now.  After working all day all l want to do is sleep.

Fran - I'm starting to get my hair back too but it just isn't growing near as fast as I want it to grow.  I'm so sick of scarves and hats.  It was so bad that I even pulled the old wig that I swore I would never wear again out this week and wore it.  I just wanted to have hair and didn't even care if it felt like a dead animal on my head!!  I wore it two days and then went back to my scarf/hat again. I hope everyone has a great weekend!!  Take care!",

CFDR - I hear you on the energy levels.  I'm still not able to work a full week.  I just can't make it.  I guess our energy will return some day.  Hang in there! Lori - Doing the \"happy dance\" for you right now.  Isn't it wonderful to know that you don't have to sit in that chemo chair again?  Whew - that is a great feeling.  Wildrumara - that is great news.  I have a feeling that any time we get a headache for a while we're going to think it's cancer.  That's just natural after all we've been through.  Hang in there and you can vent here anytime. Hope everyone has a good night!",

What about hair?  Anybody have any yet?  Mine is just peach fuzz and it looks grey.  Oh well, I'll color it - I just want hair so I can burn the wig and hats/scarves. Hope you all have a great night!  Talk to you soon!",

In the case of your friend it would really depend on the type of cancer she had and the stage.  I just think it's kind of scary not to have any type of chemo or radiation.  I don't know what's involved with \"natural\" treatment\" since I haven't heard of it. All I can say is that it's a personal choice, but for me I chose to list to the doctors and do what they were telling me because I wanted the best odds of beating this stuff. I sure hope your friend is going to be okay.  Being thin may just be a result of her eating habits now. Not sure any of this helped but wanted to respond. Best wishes to you and your friend.   ",
