I feel like a man possesed with this project. My heart goes out to you Jennifer and your husband I know you have been dealing with this longer than my lovely girlfried and I cannot even fathom the pain this is causing you or any of the others who have this affliction ( i dont know how else to put it ) keep faith and stay strong is all I can say. I got an interesting comment out of my discussions with the CCS and it help put things in perspective for me so maybe it will help the men who are reading this. I had told the woman I was talking to that I was feeling really helpless and useless and she said \"Of course you are most men want to be able to FIX IT and when they cannot they get confused and angry \" and just hearing that from a woman who is a survivor really helped me to calm down and just think things through. To all of you who posted you are amazing to me and I wish you all the best in the future truly Much love to you all You folks are very inspirational and they more I read the more I admire you all for those interested in the fundraiser my e-mail is kevinwkipp@hotmail.com Love you all Kevin",

Karen has gone in for her bone scan and it was clean and she is going in for ct scan on tuesday and then surgery on wednesday. I keep finding myself at a loss for words even when she is not around. All my friends and hers are calling and I find myself more and more worried with every call and I cannot imagine what she is going through. cliches even elude me.I dont know what the heck I am supposed to do or say and I know that doing and saying nothing is of little use. From a mans perspective this is so hard to comprehend I cannot imagine how it is to live it from a womans. Keep strong and have faith Love you all Kevin",

She has an appointment with the cancer clinic next week and as far as I know she will be getting hormone therapy as well as radiation.All this seems so much worse because I came down with the flu 2 days ago and could not be with her today or yesterday as I did not want to risk her getting that as well. My little brother is spending the night at her place to watch over her for me.My lord she has been understanding and she has been very tolerent of people telling her what to expect but sooner or later I am sure she is gonna breakdown as she has not yet. What can I do to help her through all the hormone therapy and radiation? is it Chemo or radiation that causes hair loss? she is really concerned about this Much love Kevin",

I know my post is kind of rambling and I guess that is the fear in me is I dont want to ramble to her she has alot to deal with and I dont know what I can say to her that will make an impact or lasting feeling. I guess a little background may help in why I am posting here would help. Her sister had breast cancer and beat it but not until she had a double mastectomy (am I spelling that right?) she eventually got cancer of the liver and brain and passed away 3 years ago and her father passed away from cancer as well and I dont think it has hit her yet that now she has it. Now this part may be too much info but we broke up 2 years ago after 14 years together and we have been trying to rekindle our relationship ever since and have been making great strides over the last 6 months she has her own place and has alot on the go and this is just 1 more thing to overcome and I want to NOT be the cliche guy I just want her to know that nothing is more important to me than her and to be supportive. I thank you all for any and all input and wish you all the best, Truly much love to you all.",

I know that hearing \"your a fighter\" or \"it will be alright\" or better yet \"you will make it through this\" does not help and that is all I want to do. I know that this is her fight and she has to fight it for the most part on her own but that does not mean I cant be her cornerman and stand by her while she goes through all of this. That is not the hard part for me the hard part is what do I say to her to let her know that I love her and will be with her through all of it? I am soo confused and scared for her and all I want to do is make her understand that no matter what happens I am here. Now I know in some small way this seems to be a selfish kind of post but I do not want to pummel her with all the cliches that others will I want her to know that she is not alone. All I want is to know what I can do to support her through all of it Log in to post a reply",
