I do not feel prepared although I have read everything and asked the medical staff many questions. Emotionally, it doesn\"t seem possible that a human has to go through all of this to get \"well\".",

Tuesday is my 2nd treatment, so wondering how it will go next week. ANYONE doing Taxol and herceptin together? Nowheregirl: Thank you for sharing that some day hair will return. Not looking forward to losing it of course. Everytime my head tingles I wonder. It is so helpful to be reading posts on this forum. I thank all of you.",

I was very anxious, since I had a horrible reaction to propofel during the lumpectomy. Talked with the anesthesist and he finally guesstimated what had caused it, but I was still fearful it would happen again. but they gave me a med that totally relaxed me. Icing the area right now, I forgot to when I arrived home. Had a 3:30 pm surgery yesterday and was released about 6:15 pm. Then went to have a small steak. Now to start Taxol once a week for 12 weekly infusions on Wed. Also, will have an infusion for Herceptin every three weeks for one year. Yikes, so many concerns for while I'm on these and future. I do have a MO that seems compassionate and competent. Will go to this afternoon to try on more wigs. People act like this is such an exciting thing to do. I find it depressing and sad. Need to get some soft caps and scarves. Seems like here you can express how you really feel and not like you have to keep the happy face on all the time.",

I did buy a wig last week that is very similar in style and color to my own hair. Also, have bought a couple of hats and scarves to get prepared. Definitely not looking forward to losing my hair, since someome told me it would take two years to be the below the chin length again. Had my first taxol plus herceptin on Wednesday with the premeds. Infusion went fine and the next day I had the steroids giving me lots of energy, on Friday somewhat subdued and during the night had very sharp throbbing pains in joint and leg bones. Miserable night and into Saturday. I read on here about taking benedryl, so I went out and bought Advil PM which has benedryl plus pain meds. Waiting to see if it helps this eve. I can't believe so many people have gone through this. I think it is awful already!",

Then when I was there the nurse also got an ice bag and put it on the area and I made sure it was numb. Didn't feel a thing. Headed for the 2nd treatment tomorrow morning and will do the same.",
