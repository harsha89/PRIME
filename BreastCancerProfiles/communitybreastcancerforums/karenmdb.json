Told me I wasn't there for him & that I was depressed.  I was depressed over the relationship.  He has decided to get a divorce because he said I  let him down.  OUCH!!!!  I have now been in therapy for a few years now & my therapist tells me he is a narcissist - very selfish, no empathy, it is all about them.  Maybe you can look into it & see if any of the traits fit your BF.  It sounds like they may.  If they do it may give you some understanding & let you see that you do not need to be treated this way.    Good Luck to You - ",
