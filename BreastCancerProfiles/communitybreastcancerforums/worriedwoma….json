I am not sure what I am more worried about- the surgery or the placing of the wires or the waiting and worry for the results. Anyway- I am anxious but I guess it will be good to have it done- it seems reasonable to take it out and have a more substantial biopsy. I have been reading all that I can find about ADH- and followed the link on one of the threads here for the New York Times Article about  ADH and DCIS..and then I search for more information- like grasping for answers.  I will be sending thoughts and prayers your way tomorrow as well as you meet with your oncologist and determine next step to take in treatment................it is certainly a process. It sounds like you have been weighing all aspects and are leaning toward the excisional. Let me know how it goes and what you decide. You have support here.............",

I just had a mammo at the end of Oct and was sent for a stereotactic biopsy- ended up having two and they found three areas with the diagnosis of Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia. I met with the surgeon and am scheduled for exicsional biopsy surgery of the areas on Jan 13 ( an nervous- first surgery and I am 52). I have not met with an oncologist but have also read a lot about tamoxifen and would like to have an alternative as well should that be a recomendation.. I am sorry you are going through all of this- it has been a roller coaster ride - but the women here on this site have been a calm in this storm. What is your next step....is it meeting with the oncologist to discuss the plan? You are in my thoughts.",

You were a strong woman! The waiting is hard- I know.....I may have to have another stereotactic based on what they find with the next diagnostic mammos on Tuesday.I was hoping the surgeon could just look at the other areas of calcifications when I have the surgical biopsy........which I am already scared to have. Anyway- we do what we have to do. Take good care of yourself and use that ice pack- it really helped me from swelling. Hope to read an update of B9 results here next week.",

( the dentist has been my number one place of anxiety  as long as I can remember so you have a kindred spirit- I empathize with  you). You can talk but it is a little hard because the machine does make some noise..........I asked the doc and techs to let me know what they were doing as they did which really help me calm down...... The most difficult thing for me was to lay that still for so long. I had my appointment with the breast surgeon today and she may want me t have another stereotactic of another \"faint area\".......and  Imust admit - that makes me want to cry to think of going through  another.....mostly because I was glad to have that part behind me. This road is really bumpy  I am finding....but we women are strong for the joourney. You'll be fine and be looking back on it sometime soon. And we are hoping to benign results for you!
