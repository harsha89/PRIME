The morning after Thanksgiving (the 23rd), I awoke and noted a thumbprint sized relatively angry red mark on the lateral side of my right breast. I ignored it, other than hoping it was not cellulitis caused by my underwire, as we were leaving to drive to Orlando for a family vacation. I did not feel sick, but was going to watch it, and if needed, stop at a walk-in for some Augmentin or Keflex. Either Saturday or Sunday (1-2 days later), I noted a different type rash on the medial side of the same breast. It was slightly different - less coalesced, but the follicles were also full and prominent (sort of exactly opposite of peau d'orange), and the capillaries were very prominent. This rash was about 3cmx2cm. The original rash at this point also has an extended placement of capillary enlargement. No nipple inversion. No full breast, heat or erythema. Only a slight bit uncomfortable at the actual spots. So I am thinking that i doubt it is an infection, as I don't feel sick and any \"cellulitis\" has not spread. I also didn't think it was erysipelas, as I would have been really sick by then. Mastitis had originally crossed my mind briefly, as I think i have finally weaned my 2.5 year old after several months of \"snacking\" every 2-5 days. However, I know this is not mastitis for a couple of reasons - I am a IBCLC and an APRN in maternity, and have had a plugged duct before (but not mastitis. as I was able to finally express the duct before I was febrile), and the plugged duct hurt much, much more than this. Briefly shingles crossed my mind, but as I was not sick or did not have neuralgia, I dismissed it. So, I get through the week of Orlando with my extended family. Although about 5.5 days into the vacation, my underwire really starts to bother the outside spot. I discover that I have some sore lymph nodes that are slightly enlarged (but not pathologically large). The breast feels heavy and just \"lazy,\" if that is something that everyone understands. I still am not sick at this point. We decided to take the short route home when we left on Thursday and I made an 0900 appointment for this morning (a few short hours after we arrived) with a practice partner of my regular OB/Gyn. Last night, I did have a \"let-down\" feeling once also, but have not felt that for more than a year while breastfeeding. I arrived for the appointment and told the tech why i was there (spots on the breast, now discomfort at edges and axilla with fullness and heaviness, concern about IBC because none of the infectious etiologies made sense with m lack of being sick). I already was getting attitude when I was trying to explain why I was there (did not think it was cellulitis, erysipelas, mastitis, shingles, but was concerned about IBC). The Gyn came in and without even listening to what I was saying, she says I need to \"dial back\" my \"anxiety.\" I tell her that I am not anxious, but want to figure out what this is - I am not sick, but this has now been going on for 8 days. I tell her that this summer, it took me 3 weeks to come back despite pretty serious constant pain after my IUD insertion, because I figured things would work themselves out (the IUD was embedded in my uterine wall). She told me she did not realize that (well read my chart, I want to say to her). She goes on to tell me that IBC starts as a tumor and that the skin rash is it breaking through, and that it is not that fast that all this happens etc. etc. I try to nicely suggest that my readings have not supported that. She does a quick breast exam, but does not feel the outside breast edges or axilla for my lymph nodes. She tells me that it is shingles (and let me just say again that I have never had prodromal symptoms or vesicles or felt sick and it was not until I had swollen lymph nodes >5 days after the rash appeared, that I was uncomfortable). I ask to see a Breast Specialist. I essentially have to beg for this. I know that I have offended her. She said that come Monday, they will try to make a few phone calls, but will not tell me who she will refer to, and also says that I should not do it myself. I also have to beg for a mammogram, as that is all I am going to get for imaging. I was able to get a cancelled appointment today. The tech immediately knew what I was worried about when I told her I had a rash on my breast and was diagnosed with shingles. The mammo was clear. I am on Valtrex, 8 days into this (best time to actually go on it is within 72 hours of rash, which is supposed to follow the pain by days to weeks). Now granted, I do not think that I have IBC, but I needed to advocate for my health, as I allowed my old OBs to ignore my severe preeclampsia for 10 weeks before my daughter's preterm birth because they kept telling me that everything was ok despite my labwork, symptoms, signs and bloodpressures being diagnositic. And, as a result of my injury during that delivery, I am unable to safely have another child without at least two surgeries prior to delivery (at least one during pregnancy), with no guarantee that I will deliver a viable child, according to one of the two worldwide experts. So, needless to say, I am not putting up with people not taking what I am saying seriously anymore (and I have also become a billboard for preeclampsia and incompetent cervices). I plan on writing a letter to the practice manager, the offending Gyn, and my normal OB to let them know how disappointed I was with the condescending dismissal I experienced today, as well as maybe include some websites/information to gently educate this OB. I am wondering for those of you who were first incorrectly diagnosed with shingles, what your rash looked like and what your symptoms were that made them tell you it was shingles? Thanks guys. I am inspired by reading all of your experiences and life lessons. Meghan  Log in to post a reply",
