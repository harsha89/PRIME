The AC got to me by the 3 session and two days after my first Taxol I started with severe bone and musle pain which stayed with me right through the 4 sessions and even now I still have residual pain from it.  I see my onc today and he will be starting me on Tamox - I can't imagine ever getting my energy back!!",

As it so happens I got an infection in the incision wound adjacent to the port so it was never actually used for my chemo except for the very last one.

And things haven't changed much - it took them ages to get a vein for a blood test yesterday - even tried my feet - ouch!!

Today I heard that a friend of mine who was diagnosed about 3 months before me has had a recurrence in the same breast and has had to have a mastectomy - she had a lumpectomy first time round (she is triple neg though) but now I think at least with a mastectomy that shouldn't happen me.  Physically I recoved very well from the mastectomy and because I had rads I haven't had any reconstruction - that's another days work - but it is a very visible and constant reminder of what has happened you would have to be strong and get your head around that.  As in most things that I have to make a decision about I normally get out a sheet of paper draw a line down the middle and do a list of pros on one side and cons on the other - it may sound trite but it does help.  Best of luck and remember there are some wonderful people on these forums who are great support so visit often - I don't know what I would do without the support of this forum.",

How do you compartmentalise this fear and put it in the background - does it just happen automatically as time goes on??  I am really, really trying to lose weigh ( I am very over weight) and I am trying to build some exercise into my daily routine but I wonder a) am I doing enough and b) will I be able to keep it up.

      "Content": "Oct 27, 2009 05:59PM - edited Oct 27, 2009 06:00PM by Ainm Shanagirl, We were both dx about the same time and I am finding it quite hard to accept that I have not been \"cured\" too.  I know that every treatment I had/have will improve my chances of escaping recurrence and I've had mastectomy, chemo, rads and now on Tamoxifen but, and this is the big BUT, no one can guarantee me 'it' will not come back.  I try to reason with myself and say well if I had a heart attack no one would guarantee me that  I wouldn't die of a heart attack but I guess if that was my situation I might be just as fearful as I am in my present situation anyway. I was speaking to a lady who had been dx 19 years ago and she said that although you can never totally forget what might happen she has found that generally she can put it to the back of her mind - when she hears or reads about someone who has had a recurrence - she takes out her fear dusts it off, says 'not yet' and puts it back to the back of her mind again!!! Maybe I'll be like that in 19 years time but now, 10 months after dx, I am too raw and fearful to even imagine that I'll make 19 years!!  I'm not being negative - just honest and scared!! I have joined a BC support group in the hopes that I might find the tools to help myself get beyond this.  It's good to be able to talk to like minded women and I found that most of those I spoke to who were recently dx (upto 2 years ) are still quite fearful of recurrence - I was happy to find I wasn't alone in this!!  So Shanagirl - you are most definitely not alone!!",

Sometimes it is highlighted because of the left over se's from chemo or se's from Tamoxifen.  There are so many reminders - hair growing back, lack of sleep, taking medication - it's hard to get away from it.  I still cry for the least reason.  As I said I am exercising and dieting and this also serves as a reminder - I feel deprived of one of my favourite things - FOOD!!! I try not to let my insecurities be apparent to those around me although DH knows and is very supportive, but it is very hard to smile through it all.  Terry I take your point about the forums - I spend hours scouring the boards for any thread I can identify with - maybe I should cut back on it.  And I know what you mean when you say about hearing about others who get a cancer dx.  I also noticed that quite often when people ask me how I am they also seem to be compelled to tell me about others who have cancer - people I don't know at all!!  And of course cancer related deaths are hard too. A friends sister died a few weeks ago. She had been dx with BC 10 years ago and had a recurrence resulting in her death. When I went to sympathise with her mother she said 'but you'll be fine' - it just set me off and once out of hearing I needed my DH to assure me that I would indeed get more than 10 years out of all this fiasco - irrationality working overtime!!! Hmm - the Oncotype test is only being trialled in Ireland at present so we have to rely on the expertise and experiences of our drs still.  I ended up with mx, 4 DD AC, 4 DD T, 15 DD rads and Tamoxifen (with two bouts of staph thrown in for good measure!!) - really hope this has annihilated the damn cancer. It's great to see all the people who are joining in on this thread and Lisa it's really good to see you here as an older stage ll'er!!.",
