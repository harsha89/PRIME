I didn't think breast cancer presented as a small rash either, until I became concerned that my small rash wasn't going away on it's own and saw the doctor.  Since I hadn't had a mammogram in years, I made sure I got one quickly.  That action likely saved my life.  My IBC was diagnosed about as early as IBC can be diagnosed.  That improves my survival-thrival chances considerably. Get it checked out quickly and don't live in fear.  Best wishes. ",

The bone scan is likely a baseline because your regime will be hard on your bones (osteoporosis (sp?)). The ultrasound... is that an ECHO for your heart?  If so, that is also likely a baseline because certain chemo drugs are also hard on the heart.  They want to make sure you don't have any complications. Once you start chemo, you will also likely get a complete blood work-up a few days before each treatment.  That lets them know that your body is tolerating the treatments.  If your counts are too low (or too high in some tests), they may postpone or adjust your treatment/dosage plan accordingly. I always ask for a copy of my blood results each time I go in for chemo.  They print a copy for me and it occupies some of my time in the chemo chair while I \"dr. google\" with my ipad to see what it all means.  ;-)  Somewhere in the last three months I've become more patient with all the testing and poking and prodding that comes along with treatment.  But it never stops me from asking questions.  It is my body and my future.  My doctors, PAs, and nurses, have come to know that I feel better about it when I understand it. Everyone has their own knowledge comfort zone.  Mine is to know as much as I can, pray a lot, and realize that faith is seeing the next step but sometimes not the whole staircase.",

I took a drive this afternoon, found a safe quiet, unpopulated, place near the water and just vented many emotions. My planned emotional breakdown was a good thing because I felt much better afterwards. God is in charge.  He's delegated some things to me. I'm going to be delegating some things to doctors, nurses, and people I've never met before.  As long as everyone respects the chain of command, I'm sure we'll all get through this without a mishap.  ",

I found a great place a relatively short distance away where I won't run into people I know. From what I have researched and heard, I have lucked into the best doctors in our area. Did they do your port installation with a local or a general anesthetic?  My understanding is that they are going to knock me out before I even get to the surgery room (my preference!). Glad you are feeling better.  Have a great Sunday and get some Vitamin D.",

The good news... cancer is NOT a death sentence these days.  Especially if you are ready for your most important acronym of the road ahead... KCA!!  (Kick Cancer's Arsk!!)  Five months ago I was terrified.  Thinking of six rounds of chemo, a double mastectomy, and weeks of radiation treatment was just too overwhelming! I had to compartmentalize it.  First, get the best docs on my team.  Then, get through chemo.  Now that chemo has wrapped up, I'm working on wrapping my head around the upcoming surgery.  In a few weeks, I'll wrap my head around the radiation treatment plan.  But the one driving force in all of this is that I AM Stronger than Cancer!  And so are YOU!! You got this!  And we are here for you!",
