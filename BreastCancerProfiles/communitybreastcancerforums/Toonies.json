[Which isn't always easy]  So, needless to say, I am a great cheerleader for Zeloda and wish that it were still effective for me.  Life would be much simpler.  If you need to go on any med. that would win my vote.  Good luck with everything and I hope you get a long time out of the Zeloda or go NED before that.  Keep your chin up.                                                                          Toonies",
