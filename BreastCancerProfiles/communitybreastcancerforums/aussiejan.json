Finished rads in early May.",

This is considered to be the gold standard and, although it does not give you a 'good' week, it does get chemo over and done in a shorter time! I am four years out from treatment now so there is light. I really sympathise with your thoughts about losing your hair.  I had mine cut very short so that I felt as though I had some control.  As it was summer when I was having treatment I didn't worry about hats or scarves.  I was okay with it and my family were okay with it and we figured no-one else mattered. Best wishes to you as you embark on this next stage.  DD ACT is very doable.",

Of late, however, I have been diagnosed with an enlarged left lobe thyroid with nodes.  While all thyroid blood levels are in the normal range, albeit high, the only abnormal results are thyroid antibodies which are way out of whack. The investigations for this were because of shortness of breath, cough and a sometimes raspy voice.  I am being referred to an endocrinologist for this. My recent Onc review last week, and my onc is concerned about the shortness of breath and is sending me for a cardiac echo.  He has explained that it may be due to toxicity from dose dense AC + T, 4 rounds of each.  He said that while this does not happen often as a late onset (three years out from end of chemo) it does happen and may manifest itself as cardiomyopathy or congestive cardiac failure.  Whoopee.  I am not worrying at this point, time enough when I know what I am dealing with.  He did say that it was unlikely the thyroid was related to the chemo or rads but his offsider said not to ignore the thyroid issue as it, too, could cause cardiac failure.  I think it is time to stop going to the doctors!  I was a very healthy woman before breast cancer.  LOL",
