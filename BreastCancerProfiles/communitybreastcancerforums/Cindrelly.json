    "Content": "Cindrelly wrote: First, some backstory: I'm 39, married for 20 years, and have 4 children, 1 each in elementary, middle, high school, and college. 6 months ago, we moved across the country for my husband's job. 2 months ago, I found a lump in my right breast. This week I finally received results: invasive ductal carcinoma, Stage 1 (that we know so far), Grade III, Estrogen+, Her2+. After diagnosis and per my doctor's (surgeon who did the biopsy) ok, we went ahead with our previously planned trip back to our home city to spend the holidays with friends and family. As soon as we return in January, I meet with an oncologist to plan and begin treatment, starting with chemo. Being back home, though, I'm realizing that maybe I should stay here for treatment. Here I have my parents, a large extended family, my husband's family, my college-age son, and a huge network of very close friends and supportive neighbors. In our new town, we only know one couple who have been close friends of my husband for years, a sister 2 hours away, and only a few acquaintances. Back home, I would have access to one of the most predominent cancer centers in the country and personally know many medical professionals. I've loved my doctor in our new town, but it's a small coastal community at least an hour from a bigger city and I'm unfamiliar with the medical system. It would mean splitting up the family, though. I would keep the two youngest with me while my husband and high schooler go back to work and school across the country. This is especially hard to consider because we did something similar for 5 months last year while preparing to move. And it really sucked. It also might mean living in my parents' basement or our studio apartment (no separate bedrooms) with my girls while going through treatment because our old home is rented out as an Airbnb. This is also hard to consider because having just gone through a traumatic move I recognize that a stable and comfortable \"home\" is a crucial concept for me and my mental/emotional health. And I still feel a bit homeless. I'm still kind of reeling in shock and don't really know much about cancer treatments and what it will all entail. So what I'm trying to figure out is, which is more important to have around me while going through treatment: a large supportive network or my husband? Temporary living conditions or my own home? A large big-city cancer treatment facility or a doctor who I've really connected with? I know these are questions that ultimately only I can decide, but I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation? Whether you were or not, what factors have contributed the most to the success of your treatment? Log in to post a reply",
