Unfortunately, 2 days ago we found out that there is metastasis on liver and bones, multiple spots on both. Our oncologist adviced us to go through a therapy of Avastin and Xeloda (cycles of Avastin every 3 weeks and Xeloda for 14 consecutive days with one week stop). For us its a HUGE shock since we believed that she was almost free from the disease. We would be really appreciate anyinformation on the following - what shall we expect from now on? What is the life expectancy? - shall we visit any BC center in US and / or Europe. Have you got any recommendations? - any recommendation for BC specialist who can involve my wife to any new protocol? - I know that Avastin is prohibited in US but it is still used in Europe. What is your opinion to use it? Is there any other alternative or better treatment to suggest to our oncologists? Really thank you for your replies.

It's really encouraging to have some people to give you information and to exchange opinions on thinks which were completely unknown to you since some days. This forum and it's members are helping a lot. I will contact to the centers and the doctor you mention for their opinion. I will also speak to my wife's oncologist about the option to have a biopsy of the tumor. As I noticed there is a way to make a biopsy to the liver but I dont know how painful it is. On the other hand I read that it's not an option to make a biopsy to the bones. However, bones are less likely to have different type of tumor than the initial one. My wife's initial tumor biopsy was PR+/ER+/HER2-. Thanks once more for your support and I will post any relevant information or news. George",

I will ask the oncologist about this option as well. Of, course on the other hand I don't know if its better to start the chemo cyles immediately without losing further time",
