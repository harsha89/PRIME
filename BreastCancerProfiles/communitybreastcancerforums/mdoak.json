I am wondering why they labelled yours \"complex.\" Given your family history, the doctor will want to excise any mass that grows to make sure it's not cancer. Another possibility is that it's a phyllodes tumor -- hard to distinguish from a fibroadenoma even with a core biopsy, and almost impossible with a fine needle. Phyllodes are usually benign as well, though. So there are lots of possibilities of what it could be, most of them benign -- a strange-acting fibroadenoma (I had one of those recently), a phyllodes tumor (almost always benign, but they grow and need to be excised), and it is possible it's cancer. Keep us posted. And by the way, the excisional biopsy won't be bad at all. I personally have found the core biopsy to be more difficult. Melissa",

Just so you know -- you are just as likely to have a benign result as a malignant result.  What really helped me when I was waiting was telling my family and the people closest to me. Sure, they were worried, but they were also incredibly supportive. My parents were especially supportive, even though I know they were worried sick. I don't know how I would have gotten through without them. Everyone is different with how comfortable they are sharing these things, but you sure could use some attention and care right now.

However, he was going to give me an MRI if my last biopsy had been malignant, to help see, also in his words \"the extent of her disease.\" I am left wondering about MRI as well. If you don't think it would be helpful detecting cancer given all of my fibroadenomas, why would it be helpful in finding more cancer once you have found it?  I am going to a high risk clinic in February -- my fibroadenomas don't increase my risk much, but the fact that I had ADH on one of these biopsies once upon a time does. Thankfully, once you're accepted there, they say insurance will generally pay for what they recommend, and I\"m hoping they recommend an MRI. I'm more afraid of my dense breasts hiding cancer than I am an occasional false positive. I wish I had pressed my current radiologist for more information on this.

I can completely relate to the worry, and also completely relate to having difficulty getting medical people to take us seriously. Sometimes I think that's the female condition, to be not taken seriously by doctors regardless of what we present with. I've been concerned about my right breast since last october--the doc found a lump that looked suspicious and it turned out to be benign, but no one has explained other lumps, pain, and swelling in that breast. I went back a couple times and now am just sitting on my hands until June, when I have a screening MRI scheduled because I scraped in over the line at high-risk when I insisted they plug me into their model.   What you describe sounds like it could be concerning for inflammatory breast cancer, which from what I've read on here doesn't show up well on either mammogram or ultrasound. Since you're having a diagnostic, I assume you'll talk to a radiologist. If nothing is seen on the mammogram, can you ask him or her to rule out inflammatory? I think punch biopsies are the only way. The place where I go for imaging they do biopsies right on the spot for suspicious findings, although I think that's kind of rare. But you could push. Let us know how it goes, okay? And keep posting before your appointment if you need some more feedback or support.",

And if you don't see a radiologist, maybe you could ask to speak with him. We have to pick our words so carefully. The only explanation I have gotten for my breast symptoms has been perimenopause. This would be hysterical if it wasn't so serious, since I had my ovaries removed FIVE YEARS AGO. It is so wrong to feel like you have to walk a tightrope -- if you insist something is wrong, they write you off as a hysterical female.

Sometimes the results are clear cut, so you can get the results in 24 hours. However, sometimes the results are not clear cut, and the pathologist has to ask for more stains to be done. This takes extra time. This doesn't mean you have cancer, not at all. Like I told squid, there are benign conditions that are difficult to distinguish from each other sometimes.  When women have really long waits, it generally means the lab has sent the slides to an expert. Again, this doesn't mean cancer. So don't draw conclusions from how long it's taking. In fact, if they were sure it was cancer you would know already, even if they needed to do more tests to determine exactly what kind, homone receptors, etc. The waiting is horrible, I know.

She said it doesn't mean you have cancer, at all, and not to panic if that happens. From what I've read, there is not a hard and fast line between atypia and say, DCIS, and that is a VERY important distinction, since DCIS is usually treated with radiation and atypia is not. So you want your slides to be read by an expert. The wait, however, is excruciating. I am so sorry it will take so long! Melissa",

That will give you a sense of the radiologist's sense of how likely it is that your particular lump is malignant.  You might also try to see if you can get scheduled sooner for your biopsy.

They make a nick about 3 mm long after numbing your skin really well and put a probe in there that can cut or vacuum out little slivers of tissue about the size of a grain of rice. They'll take a bunch of those slivers out of each lump to make sure they have a good sample. It shouldn't hurt and you'll be on your feet again in an hour. I found the whole thing quite anxiety producing but not at all painful.  Best of luck, I hope it goes well.  Edited -- forgot to mention that it might be ultrasound or mammogram guided -- that's the machine he's talking about. Hope for you it's ultrasound-guided -- that is not uncomfortable at all. But lots of people do fine in the other machine as well. Melissa",

Fibroadenomas are not cancer, and they are not a risk factor for cancer.  If your lump has all the characteristics of a fibroadenoma on imaging they will probably have you back in six months to see if it grows, although they may biopsy it because of your age (they are more common in younger women -- but I am 41 and I have lots of them). And if you're nervous you should insist on a biopsy for piece of mind. If it doesn't look like a characteristic fibroadenoma on imaging, they will biopsy it -- still doesn't mean it's cancer.

Post-menopausal, they often remove them -- because fibroadenomas are usually associated with younger women. Pre-menopausal, they generally leave them alone, these days. I am a rare bird in that 20 years ago I had 9 of them removed -- they were going for 4 or 5, I can't rememember now, and found DCIS nearby -- so they removed the rest. (I recently had my slides gone over again, and the new pathologist said ADH--pathology is tricky, and standards vary on the line between DCIS and ADH from lab to lab, and hey, it was 20 years ago). I now have dozens of fibroadenomas. I am (surgically) post menopausal but because there are so many they do a watch-them approach.They have a very distinct appearance on ultrasound, so that is feasible. You certainly can have it out if you want to -- and I would if you are post-menopausal -- but otherwise, they will recommend following up in a few months to make sure it hasn't grown. Great news, that it's benign! Melissa",

I recently felt a funny lump, went to the breast surgeon who felt it as well, but when she ultrasounded it, it was again a fibroadenoma, just very deep and flatter since it was up against my chest wall. Do a self-exam every month, or twice a month even until you get to know all your lumps and bumps, and then if anything changes, go right to the doc. Otherwise, if they are identified as fibroadenomas on ultrasound, you really don't need to worry. Easier said than done, eh?",

They may do an additional follow up 6 months after that. If the fibroadenomas don't change in size, then you should be \"released\" and told to come back in if there is any change. Why did you have excisions? They don't generally do that anymore -- they usually do core needle biopsies if anything looks suspicious. If anything looks suspicious on your next round of imaging, they'll schedule you for another biopsy -- core needle should be sufficient. The surgeon should be competent reading the ultrasounds or doing his own. There is no link that I know of between cervical and breast cancer. Breathe!

I asked him outright what were the chances of this being cancer, and he said maybe 10%. But I got a very bad feeling from him. He had pointed out on the ultrasound the things that made this lump suspicious -- taller rather than wide, jagged edges. And then on the way out he said he thought the next step would be an MRI. Well, there are two things I want to point out. One is that my biopsy was benign, despite the jagged edges and other bad things about that lump. And the other is that the radiologist told me when he delivered the results that he had believed it was cancer--despite what he told me in that room, not that he said that--and therefore had had a second pathologist look it over as well. When I got the radiology report, he had listed the lump as BI-RADS 4B, which is somewhere around 50-50 or 60-40 (or worse, depending on if they use a 4C category or not). And the MRI comment was specifically to prepare me for what he would order when it turned out to be cancer. So I say, trust your gut about what the radiologist thinks -- I don't think it's a bad idea to be realistic, and personally I think it helps to deal with bad news when it comes if you have done a little mental preparation leading up to it. BUT even when a radiologist thinks that the biopsy has a high likelihood of being cancer (even people in the BI-RADS 5 category, which is 95% sure), it often turns out to be benign. I'll be crossing my fingers for you. Melissa",

As far as radiation due to mammos goes, there is some, but it's much, much less than it used to be -- I think you can put your mind to rest about that. If you have cancer, the risk of ignoring it due to fear of radiation exposure is way more than that radiation exposure would be!  My only caveat would be the experience of your first vs. your second radiologist. Was your first radiologist a dedicated breast guy? If so, go with what he says, and get that biopsy. It's not really a difficult procedure and it should give you some piece of mind. Good luck.",

My radiologist was explaining to me that perimenapausal women's breasts can do a bunch of proliferative changes (benign) in response to fluctuating hormones. And my reproductive system went totally awry as well when I hit about 35, with 9 fibroids, ovarian cysts, etc. Crossing my fingers that this is the case for you.",

It is about an inch below where I had a benign biopsy in December, at about the 7 o'clock position. I can only feel it lying down. It's odd, and doesn't feel round at all, like my many dozen fibroadenomas. I go to a breast center, and can call and refer myself there for diagnostic imaging, but I feel stupid, since I had something checked out in January that they decided was nothing. Should I just wait for my next check/MRI at the end of June?  Alternately I could call my gynecologist who said she would refer me to a breast surgeon in her women's health group who would do biannual clinical exams. I am torn, because I know the radiologist would get me in within 10 days or so, while I might have to wait longer for the surgeon. Or I could just keep an eye on it until June and point it out then. I feel like a hypochondriac! Log in to post a reply",

They may recommend that you take hormonal treatments after surgery, but all in all this is very good news. I was diagnosed with ADH nearly twenty years ago (incidental finding when they removed fibroadenomas in my 20s) and I am still, at this point, fine. My monitoring schedule at this point is every six months, mammo/ultrasound alternated with MRIs, although I haven't had an MRI yet as I'm just beginning this schedule.  Good luck with your excisional and I'm crossing my fingers for you that ADH is all the find.",
