Was told both breasts are full of small cysts however there larger ones have been drained. The pain can be excruciating at times to a degree can leave me in tears especially when the bra comes off. It doesn't help the fact I also have had ovarian cysts too which I am currently waiting another ultrasound to see if this recent one has reduced in size or dissapeared. I had hysterectomy when I was 31, I am now coming up to 47 however they left my ovaries so I didn't go through the menopause early. Last week I had this slight itch on my left breast which when I scratched felt I hard lump beneath. Brushed it to one side thinking its another cyst. Following morning woke up with a red patch on my nipple right where the lump is beneath. As the day progressed I had this terrible pain In my left arm to a degree where I could not lift it. I've been on antibiotics bring treated for mastitis, the redness has gone, pain in arm much better however experiencing a lot of back, shoulder pain. Lump still there but not so prominent now. Do I still go bk to the gp for follow up appointment this Wednesday 21st Feb or leave it? The whole lot is driving me mad and feel like a right hyperchondriac. Fed up with constantly being in pain with both breasts and ovaries. Anyone have any similar experiences?",
