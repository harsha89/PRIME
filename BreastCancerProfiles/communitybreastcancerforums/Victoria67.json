They did a scan which apparently I'll have once a week and then the radiation machine did its stuff. I kept repeating to myself, 'this is healing me' and it didn't take too long. Barbcard2 - wishing you good news that it isn't shingles and thanks Grannydukes for the tip on the shingles shot, glad you are doing well after #10. Oakley - good luck tomorrow, I'm sure you'll be ok, I was nervous too but it was fine. 1Christy - happy birthday for tomorrow!  And good luck too, let us know how you get on. Mjbmiller- hope all went well for you today",
