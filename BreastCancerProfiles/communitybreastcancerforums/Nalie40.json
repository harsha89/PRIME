I have had 3 rounds of FEC and 3 rounds of Taxotere, the last one was last January 8th. My hair started to come out when I  began with taxotere and now I have a head full of curls. I am eager for my hair to get longer, had it long before chemo. I still have 7 rounds of Herceptin left and will finish that in January. I feel great and I am  working fulltime again. This whole process was hard but  I  was always positive and that helped. hang in there!!!!",

I am now 9 months past chemo and hair is growing and my eyebrows and lashes came in nicely also. So do not worry about your regrowth, It will grow back. I am still on Herceptin till January.  ",
