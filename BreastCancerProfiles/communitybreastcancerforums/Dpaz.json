Nothing crazy, I\u2019m 28, but I have super lumpy breasts so I do almost daily self-exams and noticed things were changing. I went to doc and he scheduled me for ultrasound. It will be Weds when I wake up and my ultrasound is first thing Friday morning. I have - in 2 days - developed a very painful Red square (ish) patchand a line of sunkenness down to my nipple, I don't know how to explain it. Honestly, I went to the doc more as a precaution than anything but this new development is in one of my concern areas, my boob looks \"off,\" and it friggen HURTS. So - all I am really asking is - can I wait the 2 days? Should I try to move up my U/s? Should I try to get back into the doc so he can see the update? (He's not the greatest but I don't hate him either). Pain is spreading, I thought maybe an infection but I don't have a fever and def not breastfeeding anymore or anything. I did just lose my mom about 10 days ago so I am blaming almost everything on stress, but this is something I felt I needed backup opinions on ☺️. I have 2 kids I raised solo (and my new husband brings 3 - we get married in a few weeks), so of course I am motivated to do whatever is best! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
