I have had a \"granuloma nodule\" in one lung that they have been watching for at least a year. Now I have a second nodule in the other lung. I have had a chronic cough and also periodic shortness of breath or more not being able to catch my breath. I go for more scans in a couple weeks. Should I ask specifically for a biopsy even if the nodules havent grown? I want to know for sure. Has anyone else had these same symptoms?",

I have developed coronary artery disease (with blockages) and left bundle branch block, and first degree av block. If you look closely at the research, these are all things that can be caused by one or another of these chemo's. I have my heart cath tomorrow. All of these are named specifically as side effects of the above meds. Because I have multiple allergies , I didn't think anything about it. My cardiologist said this all was caused by the chemo. I am not saying that anyone with a cough has side effects or such, however, if you have had any of these chemo's , it would behoove you to check it out early so that you have the best chance of early treatment. I could just kick myself that I didn't think cardiac problem earlier. BTW, it was found incidentally on a CT of the Chest. All this time, I was treated for \"silent gerd\" and allergies. ",
