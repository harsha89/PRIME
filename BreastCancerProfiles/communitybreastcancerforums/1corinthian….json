The lumps are the things I call them I don't know the word....they are these \"lumps\" attached to my nipples I don't know what they are called. But yes it was also seen on mammo. So waiting till tomorrow to see surgeon. I took a drive yesterday as I was tired of all of this n hoping to get away. No cell service out here. But have WiFi. Gonna sit on the lake n fish Hoping to catch walleye n all this just goes away. Peace.",
