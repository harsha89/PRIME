Three nodes and tissue roughly the size of a hockey puck (my surgeon's words!) right up against the muscle and rib cage were removed. This year's mammogram was normal but my breast sometimes hurts quite a bit and remains sensitive to pressure. My oncologist says the pain may never disappear completely, and it does seem to hurt more when I exercise so I try not to worry, but sometimes it's hard to ignore the pain.",

The port in my arm was removed after 3 weeks because of the pain and slight swelling. I had to insist, because an arm Doppler did not reveal anything and it was only when the port was removed and a vein scan was performed that thrombosis in the subclaviculat vein was found. I was prescribed self injected Fragmin for 6 months. Two months later, my arm is still slightly swollen and tight and the veins that appeared on my chest with thrombosis are still visible. I have no idea if the occlusion will ever resolve and will be asking the doctor next week about what can be done if it doesn't.",

Not a big fan of needles either at this point but the daily injection in the belly fat is pretty easy. Too bad though that alcohol and blood thinners are a complete no no.",
