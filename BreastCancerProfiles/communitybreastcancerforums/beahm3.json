Just the recommendation of the radiologist, who has a great reputation. :-) I have to remember to start collecting/keeping records. I remember looking at the questionable \"node\" on the screen. All I remember is it looked oval and kind of cloudy throughout compared to totally black. Sorry to be so vague. There did not seem to be a definitive outline to the oval shape. Looks alot like the images online of a fibroadenoma? But, I guess the ultrasound can tell the difference?",

Also, here comes the borrowing trouble part, I guess it's possible that the core biopsy missed something? The axillary lymph node that is inflamed is pretty obvious not at all hard to get to and if I remember correctly, four to six samples were taken. Funny, if it wasn't achy I wouldn't give it a second thought but it keeps reminding me that it's there. :-( Also, I am avoiding getting the Tdap vaccine with a new baby arriving soon in the family for fear the vaccine may affect the lymph node?

First of all it was explained to me that they very rarely do the FNS's unless it is of the thyroid....instead, djmammo, they opt for the core biopsy. Made perfect sense. I really didn't see the point of FNA if there was such a big chance of being called back. For me, at least, this was a very easy procedure. No pain at all. Took about 20 mins. Even the numbing of the area was quick and less \"pinchy\" than novacaine at the dentist. The doctor took 4 samples and I was able to watch the screen while the nurse was doing the ultrasound. All in all a relatively smooth experience. I did gather my courage to ask him what he thought....letting him know that I know he can't tell much yet. He agreed with that and since I wont know anything until early next week, he said that if he had to guess, he would guess that it is simply an enlarged lymph nope and I THINK he may even have said nothing to worry about. I may have imagined that, tho. hahaha. One more thing. This lymph node was measured previously, about a month ago at 3.5 cm....today it was measured at a \"little under 3cm\". Not sure if that means anything or not. May have even been an incorrect first measurement. So- that's that. Thank you again for your support and wisdom. I will keep you posted. Just wanted anyone who is concerned about pain with a core biopsy, please don't worry. The anticipation is way worse than the procedure. For me, I wouldn't even say I was uncomfortable...just nervous.",

Djmammo- the report does mention, like you said, they would be looking for fluid collection, etc. You also mentioned that you didn't expect a change in size of the lymph node. What has me concerned is that there is a slight increase in size but they do mention that the node is, \"still well defined and wider than tall\" I noticed on the report that the size has gone from 3.5x1.1x2.2 cm to 3.8x1.1x2.6. That kind of concerns me altho the size of the node does seem to fluctuate. My question is, even tho the biopsy was negative could having an enlarged node like this eventually lead to a problem in the breast? And would removal possibly prevent any future problems? The slight size increase was not a concern apparently, since the report says, \"This does not appear to be changed\". Thanks so much for any insight!",

I know that typically they are one sided...but, have read that isn't always the case? I didn't realize that that is probably what I had. After a few days of headache, fever and overall ickyness is when the rash began and lasted for a couple weeks. Do not have a cat. Was around my daughters cat a month or so ago...but, no scratching...it was just near me. I'm more of a dog person. :-) I do work outside gardening alot and also do some woodworking so, I often have scratches and bumps. Also, get splinters once in a while. I'm assuming this one lymph node is the only one swollen and originally I went to my GP just to see why there was puffiness up in front of the armpit over the muscle. Never did feel anything there....just that it's a little puffy. Thats when she said not to worry about it and it looked/felt like an \"inflamed tendon\" (after planting 30 trees). I have noticed this puffiness before over the past 5 years but then it kind of goes away. But, the area is always a little larger on the right side compared to left. Maybe cuz I'm right handed. So, was hoping maybe its just a worn out lymph node that just wants to stay large. I don't have symptoms of a problem anywhere else. Also, just as a kind of interesting point...I have had Lyme disease with bulls-eye rash twice in the past 7 years and took a months worth of antibiotic each time. Maybe if thickening of cortex was not mentioned it was not an issue when he looked at the pictures? I would think if it helped explain the condition of the node he would have included it in report. sheesh. I would have thought if he rated it a birad 3 he must have leaned one way or the other? Why not do birad 4 if there had been cortical thickening? Who knows. Thanks so much for your knowledge and help.  ",

About a month and a half ago I noticed a slight, soft puffiness in the front of my right armpit...noticed only when arm is about head. No lumpiness and the puffiness is soft. I have noticed this in the past but it wasnt as pronounced. Figured it was from all the heavy lifting and gardening I do. Had a mammo about 6 weeks ago. Came back fine. But, went to my GP to check out fullness under arm. She said it looked like an inflamed tendon...but knowing how much I worry she said I could go get an ultrasound. Got ultrasound. Radiologist did not say much except possible swollen lymph node...3.5cm. He recommended needle biopsy and follow up in 6 months. My GP saw results and recommended seeing a surgeon and have the lymph node removed. So, I have an appt for a consult in 2 days. No pain, just a little achiness especially after the poking and prodding of US. So, now, with many of you...I wait. Makes me wonder tho why radiologist and GP are so far apart with their recommendations? Thanks so much for any ideas or if any of you have been thru this type of thing? Also, I did have a \"mild\" case of Shingles about a month and a half ago...but, docs seem to dismiss that as cause of swollen gland. Thanks again for any ideas. Log in to post a reply",

In this past month I have come up with a list of questions to ask my doctor but since I won't be seeing her for a few weeks I thought maybe I could get a few answered here! djmammo- I was wondering exactly what a biopsy of enlarged axillary lymph nodes typically looks for. Is it usually checking only for Lymphoma or could you tell by the info I posted if the core biopsy I had also checked for any infections or other cancers which may be causing the enlarged lymph node? Also, and I know I am borrowing trouble here...but, is it possible for the wrong lymph node to be biopsied? It didn't seem like the technician or the doctor had reviewed my case beforehand. I had to explain why I was there...maybe that is standard operating procedure? So, basically what I am wondering is exactly what this biopsy ruled out...and did it get to the bottom of anything or should I be prepared for more testing. Having an enlarged \"benign\" lymph node is something that wouldn't bother me but I'm just wondering if all the bad stuff has been ruled out. After hearing that the results were benign I thought I had put it behind me at least until the next ultrasound but over the last couple weeks it seems like new symptoms have popped up. There seems to be more achiness at the top outer side of my breast on the side where the biopsy was done. Maybe I am just focused on it too much. :-/ Anyway, thanks for any help you can give me!",

I guess I feel like I'm just going round and round with this and just want someone to tell me that it's OK to have an enlarged lymph node and it will eventually go away. :-) Core biopsy says benign...I guess I can trust that (until I start googling). So, now I am thinking that I should call and get more info about the cortical thickness of the node even tho the biopsy came back benign? I guess I just feel like I don't have an answer yet. No one has really explained why this lymph node is acting up and what it means. Also, I am now in between doctors so there really hasn't been any follow up or anyone to explain anything. :-(",
