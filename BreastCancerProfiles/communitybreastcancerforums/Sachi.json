I chatted with the doc the whole time ( maybe 15 minutes?) and really didn't feel what he was doing. I don't remember about restrictions - but I would imagine you should \"baby\" the area for a few days so as not to open up the incision. It also calls for a lovely facial and a nice chocolate sundae... I think those are highly recommended!! Good luck, Barb ",

I had 4 chemos, surgery, more chemo, and radiation. I finished in October of '03 and went to Disney World with my family. I remember survivors coming to my house and telling me I could fight this, I could win. I didn't believe them. I thought that I didn't have a chance. My only experience with cancer had been my Dad. He had pancreatic cancer and died 3 years after being diagnosed. I did beat it. I'm here and it's been 5 years. I know you might not believe me, and we all know that there are people who don't win the battle, but the odds are with you. You can win and you can get back to your life. I'm sorry you're here, I'm sorry you are dealing with this, but you can get through it. there is life after breast cancer! Barb  Sachi Log in to post a reply",

To answer your question. I doubt that waiting the weeks until Oct 9th for your mast will make any difference. The cancer has probably been there awhile. I've heard that we usually have cancer for years before its discovered - so a few weeks won't matter. I was diagnosed in Feb of '03 with stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). I went through chemo, a mast, and radiation. I am now NED ( no evidence of disease). You will get through this! Barb ",

It sounds like you have a lot of questions that would be good for your doctor. Maybe you should start a list , so you won't forget to ask when you're there.  I hope you have a better day today.

That's hard for anyone - but I wonder if you might have a cold or strep throat or something else? I know when I'm sick everything else is so much harder to deal with. I hope you get a good night's sleep and feel better in the morning. You can fight this BC! Treatments have improved by light years since your poor mother went through this! There is so much for all of us, and there is a lot they can do preventatively if you do carry the BRCA gene. Maybe you'll want to ask about a double mastectomy?  Take care, and come here when you're feeling down.  Barb ",
