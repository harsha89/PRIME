My breast specialist told me that this is their protocol for these types of diagnoses and referred me to a general surgeon to have it removed then send the sample to the pathologist. I live in a rural community and the nearest breast surgeon is about 3 hours from here. Would I (in your most humble opinion) be waisting my time over a benign result to go to one? I'm thankful it is benign but I wanted more or less advice on what to do now, if I went to a breast surgeon WOULD that be jumping the gun for a benign biopsy excision, etc. This website has a wonderful discussion board with wonderful help and motivation for others and I wanted to ask someone who knows way more about this either with experience on the matter or knowledge in your journey. Basically, what would be your opinion to do now? :)",

She found a small, easily moveable nodule in my right breast under my nipple area. I have had no tenderness, and no discharge at all. My aunt died at age 41 from breast cancer on my fathers side and was diagnosed with breast cancer in her middle 30s. Her breast cancer came from this type of tissue so my family wanted me to definitely look into it. I went for a breast biopsy and it came back as an intraductal papilloma. The radiologist recommended I see a surgeon to get it removed just in case. I have had my surgery and got the results back from the pathologist and everything came back benign (whew). I know most studies say that these occur in women starting in their 30s. I know I am almost to that point but if anyone has more information you could offer on the subject and if me being younger then most to have this alreadyis a very bad sign for future things to come. I obviously will be following up in 6 months for an ultrasound and I will be doing my regular breast self exams. Thank you for any information Log in to post a reply",
