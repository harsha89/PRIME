I cant say it hurt but it felt so weird I too saw stars, got light headed and needed a break before we did the second one. My husband said it looked like a scene out of alien as he could see the drain coming from under the skin. The doctor told us he had lost a few husbands during the process (as in the husbands passed out). The doctor told me the second set were not in as deep and shouldn't bother me as much. That was true, I hardly felt anything. I felt well enough afterward to get my first fill. That was painless as well. Last week I had my stitches removed and my second fill. I am on weekly fills of 60cc.",
