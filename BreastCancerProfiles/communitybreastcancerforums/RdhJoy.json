It was .7mm, no node involvement, ER+, PR+, Her2-, Ki67 10%. Got the word margins and nodes were clear 11-8-18. Plan was to move on to radiation treatment, then Tamoxifen. Last test waiting on was oncotype. Breast surgeon thought it would be a low number but it came back in her words as high risk yesterday and I will need chemo. My number is a 28. I have an appointment Tuesday with the MO. Just wondering what thoughts are with this information. My head is spinning as I wasn\u2019t expecting to need chemo.

Is the oncotype testing for recurrence of breast cancer or recurrence of distant cancers or both? I\u2019m having trouble understanding what information the testing is giving me.",
