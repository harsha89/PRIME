I was hospitalized for 5 days, went home on all the ugly afib drugs, felt awful, and suffered greatly. I then found a naturopathic cardiologist who agreed that I shouldn't be treated the same at the 70 year old men who most commonly get afib. He believed mine at least to be a disease of deficiency, as opposed to excess (a lot of people who get afib are either heavy drinkers, extreme exercisers, excess weight, older in age, etc.). As expected, ALL of my hormones were out of whack. Once my thyroid problems, adrenal problems, etc. were under control, the afib disappeared. I had a partial hysterectomy in March, and I've had some brief afib runs since then. I was estrogen dominant with an enormous fibroid - even though they left my ovaries, I still had tons of hot flashes just from the estrogen depletion. That settled down, and then in July I was dx with breast cancer! I will be doing tamoxifen, and given how much that messes with hormones, I expect I'll be experiencing afib once again. Actually, I haven't even started tamoxifen yet, but had my first real episode of afib in 7 years this week - I think with the \"reset\" from my hyster, my thyroid hormone doses are probably too high and I'm all out of whack again. Some traditional cardiologists recognize that hormone imbalances can contribute to afib, so it might be worth asking to be tested! I hope it settles - afib is no fun - especially if you are symptomatic, as I am. I can hardly breathe, get weak and dizzy, my legs go numb, etc. It's incapacitating. Other people don't even know they have it, which is scarier as the risk of blood clots goes up significantly if you're out of rhythm for a long time. Good luck! ",
