Waiting for results IS tough, but hopefully you should get some results before the Christmas holiday. Funny story(now) about my LX/SNB day. I've never had anesthesia so I was super nervous (I'm in medicine & I see people put to sleep and I see surgeries every day, but this time it was me)plus the isotope injections & needle local were giving me anxiety too. The nuclear med tech was SO sweet & explained things well that morning so that went just fine. Then I go for the needle local & the radiologist is a man I see often in the doctor's lounge and we lock eyes & I say \"yea, it's me\" & it was so awkward seeing him with my breast squashed in the mammogram machine! But he was great & didn't let the resident touch me & now I get hugs & good wishes from him like we're best friends! ThenI got to tell him how vulnerable & scared we ladies feel & I think he gets it. I'm a month postop & feeling great. A tiny bit of LE in my breast onlybut no big deal, I wear a sports bra 24/7, and almost pain-free now. Every weekthe numbness and swelling have gotten noticeably better. Be patient with your body and take it easy on yourself for a while. It is worth the investment so that you heal properly.",

You will find a lot of information and support here. I agree with the above posters that your surgeon will be an invaluable part of your whole team, and not someone who just wants to do invasive things to you. You're going to need that surgical pathology report to guide your treatment plan. A navigator is great for guidance too; my hospital does not have one so I'm kind of flying out there on my own, but as I am learning fast what I need, it is less scary. Use reliable sources to learn more about BC & know that we are in this together",

The amount of tissue that was taken during my lumpectomy did get kind of near my nipple, but that was all on the inside! My incision is at the top of my breast towards my armpit- a pretty good spot, all things considered. No pathologic evidence of microinvasion, however, I am planning on radiation therapy just in case based upon my surgeon's recommendation. Then tamoxifen for five years since I am pre-menopausal. I don't expect that plan to change, but hope to meet my RO and MO in the next couple of weeks and I will see what they have to say. How are you feeling and handling everything? Are you learning a lot and getting a little morepeace of mind? Knowledge is power!",

Great news...all 5 nodes were clear and margins were clear after she took a bit more on 2 sides during lumpectomy. I am so thankful. She said tumor was just under 2cm, well formed and obvious\". So I think that makes me IDC stage 1, 0/5 nodes, stage 2? Concerned about swelling, slight redness, still oh so tender breast and nipple. A seroma has formed for sure. She is giving me Abx just in case of infection (doubts) but I am concerned I may have early breast lymphedema. In addition, although I have great range of motion in my arm and shoulder, I am having almost constant, at times intense pain over my shoulder blade/back of arm on that side (feels \"nervy\" and achy) and my upper arm circumference is 2 cm bigger than it was preop. Should I be concerned about lymphedema? Narrowing down my choices for MO & RO, and radiation location. So grateful I have some good choices. I don't have a cancer navigator person, so I'm kind of on my own with the arrangements. Wondering if I should see a certified lymphedema specialist just for an evaluation? Any thoughts or is it just too soon to expect less swelling and pain?",

I found out the day before my best friend's mom's funeral...she died from BC that went to her bones, a very aggressive type much different than mine, but I knew nothing about BC so I sat in the pew grieving and feeling fear like I'd never known. All the while, I didn't tell anybody (even my mom who was sitting next to me or my best friend) because I didn't want the day to be about me. That was a tough day. I feel better now that I have learned so much & have a plan",

I, too was just diagnosed this month with IDC 1.2cmx0.9cm & underwent lumpectomy with SNB 8 days ago. Surgeon took a lot out of my breast and 5 nodes - wondering if tumor really bigger? Except for \"clear borders\" I still am awaiting the path report. So frustrating with the holiday it will be another 5 days before I have a real Dx - stage, etc. Planning on radiation for 5 weeks after 1 month for postoperative healing. Then tamoxifen for 5 years saysmy surgeon. I have no idea how to find a RO or arrange for that, much less find a nutritionist or get a baseline cardiac workup (reading about CV complication risk 10-15 yrs after tx). Do I need a RO plus regular oncologist? Sending sample for genomic testing to see if chemo also needed. How long does that take? How can I get it all arranged to begin in 3 weeks with full time job & 4 kids? Glad husband can cook;) ",
