I guess I'm just doing research because I know that I have several risk factors and want to keep myself informed. As far as hyperthyroid risk, I have not been treated to radioactive iodine, so at least in that respect I am okay. Thanks for your info Leaf, very thorough response!   I wish everyone the best on this site and my thoughts and prayers to all.   SingS",
