These disrupt your sleep cycles by tricking your body into thinking its morning. If 3 mg doesn't work you can go up to 5 mg.

I keep losing the same three nails over and over again. Two on one foot, one on the other. I know these are very minor issues but all I can say is chemo is the gift that keeps on giving.

Initially had intense PT daily for 3 weeks only to find slight improvement. This was 18 months ago. Over these past 18 months I have managed quite well not needing to wrap or even wear a sleeve unless I was flying. On October 19 this year after a very busy day at work, I woke up to my hand looking like a balloon And my arm not much better. I was able to get in to my LE therapist right away. My arm and hand were 40% larger!!! After two weeks of wrapping, therapy and constant compression, it's back down to 21% larger. Not sure if this flare is ever going to get better but I sincerely wish I was back to my old self with Stage I LE. I certainly understand your feelings and sympathize with you, and I'm not even sure if you will take my post in the manner in which it was written, but I guess I'm trying to say \"it\" can always be worse. I really don't mean to minimize what you're going through. It stinks that it's not enough to have BC but add the bonus of LE and wow, we won the jackpot of \"it sucks to be us\" Btw, you don't have to smile about LE but I do hope you find many great things in your life to smile about. Good luck to you and I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with family and friends. Amy",

I'm still considering removing my implants permanently if I cannot be pain free forever.  Horse02 - I agree your surgeon behaved like a horses ass and you have every right to be angry but you also did your due diligence with second and third opinions so don't beat yourself up over this. You don't deserve it and you have other things to focus on now, so please try to move on. Good luck with your reconstruction.  Amy",

Mets to multiple levels in my spine, large met on pelvis, smaller one that broke a lower section of my pelvis, bilateral ribs, sternum, bilateral humerus, and I'm pretty sure a pain in my left knee was a met but they didn't scan that low. I'm ER+ had 5 rounds of TC and take Femera (thankfully without many SE) I am NED and have been since July 2, 2013.   I know how scary this all is and especially to think we have cancer throughout our bodies and really didn't suspect a thing. At least I didn't.  I had a few aches and pains but blamed aging and old sports injuries.  I think I was more devastated hearing about the mets than hearing about the BC.  As others have said, having mets to your bones is far better and I only pray they continue to stay that way.  Btw, I too get monthly Xgeva shots and am very happy the shots continue to repair my brittled bones. Good luck to you.",

One thing I learned about myself which I will hang onto as positive.  I have a healing fracture on my pelvis which I didn't know i had other than limping in January from the mets.  My take on this is if my body can heal itself even with cancer growing, I have alot of hope and optimism. ",

I made my mom cry, but these were happy tears.  So just wanted to share.   I am going to write another note under pain management regarding my experience with pain and reducing the use of Oxycodone and Oxcycotin to actually reduce my pain.

To summarize, researchers have found a way to hide a current drug, doxorubicin in microscopic discs allowing the drug to hide from cancer cells once injected in the body. A clearer explanation is found in the link. Again, it sounds hopeful, especially for us with metastatic disease.

It feels like PTSD with a duck-and-cover type reaction. I hate this is what BC has done to me and I'm sure to millions of others. Last night I was rubbing my thigh, found a lump, got up and start exploring it further. I finally decided I cannot live my life in constant fear of a reoccurance or my life will be miserable. I will keep an eye on whatever this is, but I hate hate hate what BC has done to us.",

I know when I was first diagnosed I felt lost and helpless but once I met my surgeon, oncologist and plastic surgeon and a plan was put together, I felt much better about everything. I know how scared and worried you must be. Something else that helped was speaking with other breast cancer survivors to hear what they went through, how they're doing and what to expect. Of course everyone is different, but once I heard personal stories, it was a little less daunting. I was in the very fortunate position of not knowing a single person who had BC but quickly met sisters of friends, co-workers of my sibs etc who were very willing to share their experiences with me. This helped so much. You probably don't yet know your staging but even if it is Stage IV it's not an automatic death sentence. There are many many women who survive and live 10 and 20+ years beyond diagnosis. There are dozens of drugs and treatments available that help us survive and live good quality lives. I would recommend surrounding yourself with those you love and those that love you and end relationships with toxic co-workers, colleagues, family and friends. Right now you need to focus on you and people who love and support you. If friends ask to help, let them. I found the journey was much easier shared. Don't feel like you are burdening anyone. I couldn't have gone through this year without these wonderful people in my life. Lastly, remain hopeful and optimistic; bring a list of questions with you to the next several appointments you have, get copies of your medical reports, pathology and lab reports and bring someone with you to \"hear\" the news and to rehash details once you get home. There is a point where your brain stops hearing and panic sets in. Another set of ears helps. Good luck to you and please keep us posted on how you are doing. Amy",

Doctors can estimate but even they have seen unexplainable events that defy the statistics. Butsince you are not a statistic, you are a very strong woman who has so far survived a horrific condition that would crush my spirit. I will pray you enjoy every moment you can this summer and that you will dance at your son's wedding. The human spirit is amazing and I think you are too! Healing Hugs, Amy",

I chose to take #5 as sort of icing on the cake. I did not do #6 and am very comfortable with this decision as I have remained NED since July 3, 2013. I guess my point is the number of treatments is based on experience but everyone is different and responds differently. I know I haven't answered your question, but if you are hesitating to finish to no good reason other than being sick of it all, I would encourage you to have the final round.

I was taken back by his response but once I admitted this to myself I was able to accept the help...she prescribed Ativan and I take it when I know I'm going to be in a high-stress situation or I'm unable to turn off my feelings of doom and gloom. But I also recently spent 12 days in Europe where I was forced to walk everywhere and that was like a runners high. I don't think I ever opened my pill bottle once. So to the newly diagnosed, there is no shame in getting help for your emotional well-being. I believe without the help, many of us would be crippled physically as emotions are directly tied to our physical health. Does that make sense?  And let me prescribe one more bit of help...develop bonds with the lovely women here. Don't be afraid to yell, scream, cry or vent. That too is good medicine. Amy",

This was a new development and rather disheartening. The good news was my PET CT showed no active cancer soooo makes all the crummy days worthwhile. At least I know the treatments are working.   I've read the side-effects are cumulative but I don't know if that's the case for everyone.  I just know that each of us experience different things at different times.  The most important for you and your wife is to help her eat and to sleep when she needs it.  Another bit of advice someone gave me is try to get out for a walk everyday, even if it she doesn't feel like it. Exercise helps to aleviate symptoms and keeps her muscles strong.   Lastly, when my bones hurt from the Neulasta or Xgeva shots, I soak in a warm bubble bath for over an hour. I'll read a book or just snooze and it does a world of good.  Much luck to you both.  I will be thinking of you.",

I would have lost all my hair had I not used Penguin Cold Caps - I am so grateful to these babies...and to the women who recommended them. I completely lost my appetite about 6 weeks PFC which helped me to lose 38 pounds but during the infusions, no real taste changes. My worst day was the 4th day after my first infusion. I sat in the bathtub crying (feeling sorry for myself maybe?) with bone pain, acid reflux, scared and worried but my husband stepped in and sorted through each of my complaints and within half an hour and Lorazepam I was better.  Good luck Patti.

I think 10 rounds of radiation knocked me off my feet more than 5 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxen. Good luck to all you ladies undergoing radiation in whatever part of your body.

This meant painful TE and eventually saline implants, which I may exchange early next year for silicone.

I don't know how fast bc spreads but your onc must think the delay isn't going to adversely affect your health right now. Again, it's best not to feel sick with bone mets.

As far as waiting to lose weight, that's a tough one.  No one knows when the ticking time bomb may explode, so I can't say yes, wait or no don't wait. Again I think once you've found the right surgeon you'll have answers to timing and preparation.  Good luck to you.  If you believe in the power of prayer, I'd also pray for an answer.  It's helped me find clarity when I've had a difficult time with important decisions.

You're right about the burning and tingling, it's pretty much constant. Prayers for you and your wife. I've decided that dealing with stage IV breast cancer is part of me and who I am.. It will never go away, it will always be in my daily thoughts, and treatment, however it will not define who I am. I am one of the lucky ones. I have a great quality of life and I wish the same for all my sisters on these boards. When I start to let the dark thoughts in, when I feel sorry for myself, I stop and remember the children. Children born with cancer or children diagnosed at a very young age. They don't know a life without treatments and its terrible side-effects. What kind of life do they have hooked up to machines inside a bed that looks more like a cage. And what about their parents? Those poor parents worried that their precious child may die before them. Isn't' that a parent's worse nightmare? When I stop to think about the children and their parents, I cry for them, but not for myself. I have nothing to cry for...I am one of the lucky ones. So I give thanks to God I have lived a great life and while my time is not yet over, whenever he chooses to call me home, I will remember the children and be happy. Amy",

I've discussed this with my husband who just shakes his head and said, you and your friends on BC.org are funny, but if you think it works, why not. He's a physician and looked up the study that was done some time ago. The study disproved that Claritin helped with pain from Neulasta (sp) shots. I don't care what he says nor do I care about the study. In my mind, it's working for me. And I'm not getting Neulasta shots but I do get monthly Xgeva shots. He's not going to rain on my parade!",

I am hopeful there's no node involvement but who ever knows until the results are back. I'm so surprised at all the decisions that have to be made and in a fairly short amount of time.  No one really can prepare you and being fortunate not to have friends or family go through this, it's all so new. I'm focusing on staying positive and grateful for the early detection as well as a fabulous team of doctors.  I've chosen all female docs for the first time in my life and feel they really do offer a compassionate perspective most men are incapable of (not their fault) just saying. I hope to have good news after my surgery and hoping my oncologist says surgery was all I needed. So that's all for now - wish me luck!",

If I were to face it elsewhere however I would refuse to accept a partial quantity and put the onus on them.

However the waiting part is the hardest, which is why a second opinion might help settle the matter, once and for all. I don't think you can be too cautious in these situations, especially since you are having pain and feel a lump. Although, my doctor husband says generally painful lumps aren't cancer.

I'm with Debiann, I had side-effects right away with the first round so my advice is to postpone your chemo until after your wedding. Another thought, chemo does a number of your white blood cells and neutrophils - you don't want a weakened immune system and celebrate with a few hundred germ-carrying guests. I think that's another reason for postponement. Good luck with your decision and I'm very sorry you are facing such a dilemma and right before a great day. Amy",

Over the past few months I have been running out of my pills sooner than I'm supposed and been scratching my head trying to figure out why. Duh - This past week after picking up my refill, I brought the bottle home and counted them. Guess what, short 25 pills! i called the pharmacy immediately and they acted like I'm the problem. They refuse to acknowledge that through their checks and balances it's impossible to have a mistake. They implied that someone at my home is diverting the pills and absolutely refused to accept responsibility. I went in and spoke to the pharmacist two days later and asked what if I had counted the pills in front of him and was short. He said we would handle this the exact same way - they would report the shortage to DEA (drug enforcement agency) as they are required to do and actually did and then go back to the manufacturer and report the shortage but basically even if I showed him 275 pills instead of 300, he would NOT replace the missing pills. I am furious! I did not get what I paid for AND I'm certain this has been happening pretty regularly. He did try to assure me that if at the end of my 30 days my insurance will not refill early, he will speak with my insurer and figure out a solution, but still that is small consolation. Anyway, today I called my local DEA office and spoke to an officer - I explained the situation and he's going to forward my complaint to an officer who deals with pharmacies. I look forward to hearing back from them. I just want to alert others that while this is just my experience, I hope others do not or have not encountered something similar and for those who deal with large quantities, especially of controlled substances, COUNT YOUR MEDS!

If there have been other complaints about this same pharmacy, then I will go on record with my local police. I see others have had similar complaints (via google) which I am not surprised. My message to my fellow BC survivors and especially MBC us Stage IV survivors, we often times have extreme pain due to our cancer and to be called in question for missing pills is a travesty. We are suffering at the hands of a dishonest employee somewhere, be it the pharmacy or the supplier. My pills come in a large bottle and are not in blister packs, unfortunately. Sandy, as you read, even if I counted the pills in front of the pharmacist, he would not make up the difference. What sense does that make??? What I want is to get a solid answer from DEA on this matter - not excuses from the pharmacy. I will keep you all posted. Thanks! Amy",

I am deathly afraid to see a dentist because of the jaw necrosis possibility, so I don't. I'm a little confused however, I thought Xgeva isn't a chemo but rather something to build up my bones which have been damaged from the cancer. But lately I've been getting the impression that Xgeva is another form of chemo (?) Which is it? Does anyone know? Btw, I've lost my appetite since TC so consequently have lost about 35 pounds...the ONLY benefit to this mess!",

I am sorry you have to go through this, but once surgery is behind you and you learn more about the properties of the tumor(s) your oncologist and you can make an informed decision on your next treatment. The uncertainty is one of the most difficult parts of the entire experience. If throughout your next several weeks/months you receive a recommendation that sounds questionable, question it. Get a second or third opinion if needed. Just after my BMX my onc asked if I thought I was depressed or anxious. My first reaction was no, but my DH jumped in and said yes, rightfully so, therefore I was given Lorazepam which I have taken and has helped me cope through many many difficult days and nights. Please do not be afraid to express your anxiety, worries, doubts, etc. Your care team is there to treat all of you, not just the cancer part. Prayers for you tonight...try to sleep if you can. PM me if you have any questions about anything. I assume you live in MN which is where I am, so I can even simply offer support or a shoulder, I will. Amy",

I'm on Femara and Xgeva and have been on both since at least July, 2013 so I'm bummed I didn't have a long stretch of NED, however I guess it can always be worse.

She also recommended I report this incident to the board of pharmacy. I have an outstanding Rx for Fentanyl at this same pharmacy bc I am missing my insurance card and don't want to try to get this filled without it, but I guarantee this is my LAST fill there - After I get my Rx, I'll report them to the Board of Pharmacy and see what they say, if anything. Take care and I'm happy this post will help others, at least warn them that this can happen. Still irritates me to no end since I end up suffering with the shortage of pills. Amy",

I had bc in one breast and when the surgeon was discussing options, lumpectomy was not one of them but UMX was. A little voice in my head (I like to think it was God) told me to go the BMX route which I did. After surgery I learned there were undetected cancer cells in my other breast as well...so I avoided two surgeries, two recoveries etc. I do believe a persons age factors into the decision making process. I am 58 and so cared much less about the cosmetics of it all than I would have at 38. I posted on another thread that I am voluntarily having another surgery to replace saline implants with silicone and going smaller. So I haven't saved much in the surgery part but I am hoping to improve the quality of my life with this \"last\" surgery. One final thought - once your breast(s) are gone they're obviously gone forever, so if you save one and lose one, you will always have one remaining. That is the good news in all this. Good luck - Amy",

In the end I never used it because Penguin Cold Caps worked very well. Given that I have a very thick head of hair, I estimate I lost 20 to 30% of it. Not noticible at all. There's a new system out there much less trouble than PCC called Digi Caps or something like it. No changing caps when they warm up, a compressor much like a freezer keeps the cap at a constant temperature and attaches by a hose to the cap. If that were available when I was going through chemo, I would have done it in a heartbeat. Good luck to you. Amy",
