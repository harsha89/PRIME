I just wanted to let you know you're not alone in the waiting game - I have a US/spot magnification scheduled for tomorrow AM. Same side - left - what really resonated with me was that swelling and heavy feeling - I get it much more on the left side than I do the right. I haven't had pain down my arms, but I have had that feeling of cramping or overstretching high on that side. I realize I haven't helped at all, but just wanted to say you're not alone. Hoping the best for both of us! Kelly",

Two years ago, I had the same thing happen (follow-up mammo and ultrasound), and was told I have left-side asymmetry, two spots close to my chest wall. Had a mammo last year, went fine, cleared to go to the 12-month schedule. Here's the part I'm concerned about - It sounds like the asymmetry or spots I had present, have changed. I'm really concerned about what that means --It just seems like spots that have changed are bad news. Has anyone ever had this happen? Any input is much appreciated. --Kelly Log in to post a reply",
