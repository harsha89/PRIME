I agonized over how much to tell them and when. I ended up telling them everything, appropriate to their ages of course. My little girl asked me if I was going to die and I said that sometimes people did but I am going to do everything not to, and that is why I was having surgery, and why chemo was a good thing and worth losing my hair and being sick over. She asked me a little later whether my breasts would grow back like my hair - it was such an innocent question and made me laugh so much. My son was 9 and was a little different - his questions came out bit by bit over a few weeks. I guess they all process it in their own way and as Moms we know how best to tell them I think, and how much they can handle. I am sure they are all different. At the end of the day I am so happy that I told them. I could be very open in conversation with other adults or on the phone - I didn't have to run and hide from them - and now they trust me to tell them whatever is going on. My son is now almost 13 and he told me the other day that he was so shocked when I told him but he is glad that I did. Like you, I felt very relieved and a whole lot better after telling them. Good luck sweetie and take care of yourself. Peggy xxoxo",

If it's any comfort, a spot showed on my lung a few weeks after surgery and they kept and eye on it - it eventually disappeared. They told me when it was first seen that it was likely a little clot or bit of tissue from the surgery. Let's hope it's the same for you. I don't know about the liver but presumably non-cancer stuff happens there too. Good luck girl. Sending hugs your way.",

I was diagnosed with lobular cancer 2 years ago this month, and am doing fine now. This website was a real help to me, particularly the thread called \"lobular carcinoma\"....there are many many people on there with this cancer. As you said, it is relatively uncommon so it is good to have a place which is accessed by people all over the world - there is sure to be an answer to every question. In general, lobular cancer is harder to detect in the beginning, but it tends to be less aggressive too. Most breast cancers are very treatable now and there is an excellent chance that yours will be too. Try getting on to the lobular thread....and keep in touch with us. We have been there and know what it is like. Good luck sweetie.",

Let's all hope your thickening is nothing serious at all, but I did want to make you aware of one uncommon kind of b. cancer which often presents this way. This is called lobular carcinoma and rarely forms a lump - the cancer starts in the lobules of the breast not the ducts, and the cells line up in strings, often causing a thickening. As far as IÂ  know the only way to be sure is a biopsy. I was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer in Jan 2006 - this was not picked up by mammogram or ultrasound, another feature common to lobular. I am not trying to frighten you but want you to be informed so you can look after yourself. The waiting is torture but here's hoping that you will get good news. Make sure they really know before they dismiss it. Sending strong hugs your way. Let us know how it turns out.",
