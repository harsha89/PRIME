I didn't think I would. Thought my heart would give out. Best thing to do is stay distracted if possible and reach out to everyone and everything you love. Whatever the results might be, you've already proven yourselves stronger than most. ",

I think I will really push my gyno to get me into see a breast specialist but only if it's soon. I know they sometimes book up in advance. I read your experience on the Paget's thread. Doctors shouldn't say what something is or isn't until they have definitive proof. In my gut though, I know I'll be joining you soon.Â ",

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2015 10:56AM - edited Aug 24, 2015 10:57AM by Kittylover79 So I spoke to the dermatologist's nurse who spoke to the Physician Assistant who will look at me on Thursday, and the nurse said she could do a biopsy \"if she feels one is necessary\". I know how most medical professionals think Paget's presents, and for the most part my issue doesn't present textbook. How can I be firm without sounding hysterical that I'm not leaving there without a biopsy? If they say no then I have to try and find another specialist somewhere in a city and my insurance probably won't cover it. So anxious they'll take a brief look again, say \"nope\" and I'm left to go looking as more time is wasted. I am also seeing the gyno tomorrow who may order an MRI or know of a breast specialist.",
