I'm 73 years young, active, love life, when I found myself feeling anxious and depressed for several months. Well, who wouldn't feel that way after losing husband and then a year later my son to cancer. Stage 4, melanoma. No cure. But 5 years had passed and I assumed my grief was cat hing up with me. Perhaps it was. Anyway I found myself very ill for two weeks, each day rising and telling myself I was getting better. After about ten days I found myself having shortness of breath, so much so, I could barely breathe. At this point my other son, who lives about an hour or so from me came and took me to my GP, who listened to my lungs and said it seemed like my left lung had collapsed. Is this serious, I said. Serious enough to go to the ER, he said where it was discovered tha I had over 2 and a half liters of fluid in my lungs. I was kept in the hospital and tested for a week. Finally, they told me and my son that I had stage 4 breast cancer to spine and lungs. How long do I have, was my first question. 8 to 10 months was the answer. My son and I were both shocked. I thought I was too full of life to die. But I think that given my age and the fact that it was in my lungs my days were numbered. Boy, were they wrong. I have been on Aromasin and faslodex since Sept of last year and I can honestly feel myself getting better with each month. My timer markers come down a little each month( not a lot but they do go down). And here's the clincher. I feel great. No side effects from meds, no pain in spine or lungs, no loss of appetite or energy. Cancer? What cancer? I just returned from a glorious trip to France where I kept up with everyone. And I'm scheduled for a ct next Wed. I am not fooling myself. I know I have a very fast growing cancer that can turn on me like a dime. And I know the meds,which are doing wonders, can stop working. But for today I'm happy. I do not grieve. I rarely have a pity party, but I do sometimes. And I'm planning to move to a home in a community near my son, because its something we both want. And I look forward to it. My life is not perfect., but I'm still here kicking up a storm and loving it.",

I hope that's a good sign. In the mean time I own a small condo on the water at CapeCpd in MA, and although the weather is a little insane (lots of rain and wind) I'm away from the condo that's being shown all the time, which means I have to clean up and clear out. So here I am about to celebrate our Independence Day tomorrow, the fourth, and my son, daughters law and two grand kids are coming in on a ferry from Boston, MA to celebrate with me. I look forward to having them here and was up and grocery shopping at 6:30 this morning in preparation. I find that's the best time to shop,AWAY from the crowds. I hope all of you have a wonderful and safe weekend and try to forget your worries at least for a few days. Tree",

My bc is in my spine and lungs and when I was first diagnosed in aug.2012, I had fluid in my left lung which was drained and I have had no problems with my lungs since that time. I take a daily dose of Aromasin with a monthly shot of faslodex and xgeva for bone strengthening. For the last year things seemed to be going pretty well. My markers, although high, continued to drop. Well, my latest cat scan showed a very small node in my upper left lung which did not appear in the cat scan four months ago. However, at the same time, my markers continue to drop. So......my onc said, this is a wait and see kind of thing. She's scheduled me for another ca scan in two months and i continue with monthly lab tests with my usual treatment. Has this occurrence happened to anyone else? In May after that scan she said my lungs looked pretty clear, but now she thinks with this latest scan that it may be a sign that my meds have stopped working. But have they as my markers continue to drop. What to Think?I don't know",

Raised a family, built a successful business, lost a man whom I adored and we had a fun filled relationship. Lots of traveling. And now with this breast cancer I've come to realize that what I want is to live closer to my family and enjoy them for as long as I can. And they enjoy me too. I think I have fulfilled a lot of my bucket list, and so I'm having a house built near my son's home where I hope to live out the remainder of my life. I have my condo on the market and that's the nervous part. I have my house being built while waiting for the condo to be sold. No bites on it yet, which is nerve wracking. I need the condo to be sold in order to pay for the house.. I have faith that it will happen. Nothing like adding a little stress to an already stressed out life. But I've been doing well with faslodex and Aromasin, and my lungs appear to be fine. Ct scan showed a small spot on the lung with no growth. So that's good. I would just like to see my condo sold. I'm 73 years old and my cancer is aggressive so anything can happen.",

But, I also have a nutribullet, and I bought it because it helps me get more fruits and veggies into my system, which my onc said I needed.  But here's something I've been told and have read.  Research in Canada has determined that a daily dose of flax seed, perhaps a tablespoon, has signifently lowered the markers of patients with stage 4 breast cancer.  Is there any truth to this?  I'm not sure but I went to a health store and bought a bag of ground flax seed and throw some of it into my nutribullet mixture whenever I whip one up, which is not every day but should be.   It certainly can't hurt.  Give it a try.

I have an offer that I have accepted. And, when I was told, I cried. I cried because the selling of my condo and the moving to a new home near my son, made my cancer a true reality. You see, I love to live in denial, and that's pretty much where I go accept for once a month when I have to get my blood checked and hear about my markers, which by the way, was yesterday and they continue to come down. And then I realized how happy we all are,family and me, that I'm moving there. I mean it really is such a wonderful thing. And then I think, but for the cancer, I wouldn't be moving there. And then I think, is this cancer a blessing in disguise? Is that a sick thought? No, I don't think so. I could die of any other thing suddenly, and never have this chance. So I'm the queen of de Nile. I never think about dying. Always think about what's the next thing ill be doing. Where am I going. Who will I be with, or will I do it alone. Feel great and hope to feel that way for a long time as my new house will need a lot of decorating and tender loving care. No time to think of cancer. I'm not sure how I got to be this way. I live alone. It may be that I've watched so many loved ones lose the struggle to stay alive that I've learned how to appreciate what I have just for today.as that's all I have is today. I hope some day you will also find today. Yesterday is gone and tomorrow is not here. Please keep writing. I love reading your posts from Australia. Teresa",
