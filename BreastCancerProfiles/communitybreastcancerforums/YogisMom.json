I had my head shaved last Friday since my scalp and hair hurt so bad. I bought a cute wig that I thought I would wear it every time I was outside of the house. But today I decided to put my big girl panties on and face the world with some cute turban/caps I bought. I shocked my husband but he is so supportive and happy that I feel that comfortable with myself ðŸ˜ƒ I know the next few days will be rough because of the shot tomorrow which last time made my jaw and legs hurt terrible, the 3 day headache, the jitters and just feeling blah. But by next week at this time I will hopefully feel somewhat normal again. I am only having 4 treatments which are 3 weeks apart so I keep telling myself I am halfway done!! If you have read through my ramblings this long...thank you and I have read this board so much in the last month and enjoy all of your knowledge and uplifting stories.",
