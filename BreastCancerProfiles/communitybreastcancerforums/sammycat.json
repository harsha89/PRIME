Im 39 and have two kids 7 and 3 both girls and wish this would just go away! However Im looking at it more postive at the moment I did press my consultant at my original appointment back in april when I had a mamogram but they at the time suggested a ultra sound too, but if they dont, request it as you are concerned. This however still did not show up anything but it has left my consultant baffled why i have no lump/mass under neath the skin where the dimples are.She then suggested i have another mamogram is 6 months time but if anything changes i should call and make a appointment earier Within 3 weeks of the original appointment i did notice small changes and a further 2 lines have appeared very faint but i know they are there, I called and was saw straight away She is still confused by this and said she think now it was time for a MRI hopefully this will give me the all clear or pick up something that is not right either way its a good MOT on my breast, I have large breast too and at the time thought it could be where i am a more fuller person however the right breast has not changed shape or have any such lines so have ruled that out. Its always better to be safe than sorry and Im a true beliver of if you dont ask something you wont get it.  So if your not happy with your results and want further test done then ask and mention my case. Take care and good luck please let me know how you get on x",
