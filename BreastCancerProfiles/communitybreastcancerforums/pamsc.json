I'm new here--had a melanoma on my upper arm and a couple of sentinel nodes removed in April.  The lymphedema specialist was worried enough to order me a custom sleeve and suggest I wear compression tops. ",

The surgeon thought that it was just swelling to be expected after the surgery that would go down in time, but he clearly isn't LE sensitive.  No achy feeling or heaviness, and I am back to swimming fairly hard twice a week with a masters team.  I have not had BC, but melanoma (stage 1b) on my arm with SNB raises similar issues.",

I looked up lymphedema specialists and mine did not come up but one did about 30 miles away.  I suppose I need to go to that one for a second opinion.  The one I went to initially saved my husband, who had serious lymphedema in his legs as a result of Atypical Parkinson's (Multiple System Atrophy).",

My LE therapist said it was ok to wear a sleeve without a glove if I was careful that the end of the sleeve sits on the wrist bones.  She said the veins and lymph vessels go down between the bones at the wrist and the sleeve resting on the bones holds it up so it doesn't block the channels. My sleeve is a Jobst Elvarex soft custom.  I find it rough on the tender skin of my upper arm if I move my arm a lot, and it folds and irritates the inside of my elbow.  I tried BodyGlide inside my elbow today, but it doesn't seem to help.  How does it look?

Has anyone experimented with athletic compression sleeves for light compression?  The 23-32 custom sleeve the therapist ordered me is so uncomfortable when I move around not only because it is so tight but also because it folds sharply at the elbow and because the material is rough against my skin as my skin moves slightly inside the sleeve as I swing my arm.   ",
