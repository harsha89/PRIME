I will say that books of this type and authors of this type (no insult intended) and programs with \"TV Doctors\" like Doctor Oz can be very appealing to laypersons.  Put medical information in a \"catchy format\" that can be consumed in 30 seconds or less and you have the makings of a hit tv program or best selling book.  Flip comments sell books. And, they are books that I don't read...mainly because I resent someone / anyone cashing in on my disease....and, yes, I am aware that these psuedo-doctors are doing us a service...it's just not something that I appreciate. There has been speculation about lymphadema causes v. not causes in recent number of years. I think it is certainly a worthy topic of discussion. tl",

One of the main reasons to try neoadjuvant chemo is that it may allow some women to preserve their breast tissue. Currently, there is no data to support the idea that neoadjuvant chemo (as opposed to chemo after surgery) improves survival...it can shrink the cancer and make it easier to remove, and it may allow for breast conservation.

There is alot of pressure on cancer patients to be \"perky.\"  The power of repetition can cause certain issues to be perceived as humorous. As a breast cancer patient, I was the target (and I still am) of many suggestions. My head is leaning on the cool porcelain and I have been puking my guts out for 12 hours.  This is probably not a good time for a \"pep talk\" on how I need to \"keep a positive attitude.\"  You might be met with a less than favorable response. Timing is everything.  Right now, you may feel traumatized by your wife's recent diagnosis...and this \"humor\" is inappropriate.  Frankly, in the light of my experiences, it is hilarious. The walking wounded. tl",

      "Content": "Oct 29, 2009 02:58PM - edited Oct 29, 2009 02:59PM by TammyLou I strongly wanted recon, and I persisted and I got it...and, it was the right choice for me. HOWEVER, I spent a couple of years boobless. I now have 2 flap reconstructions.  And, I can tell you that there is little difference between \"strap on\" boobies and my flaps. The key difference is that I don't have to strap them on.  Just call me, \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" (total lack of feeling...nerves are cut during mastectomy). In other words, I have some good place holders that keep my shirt up...and I'm \"happy\" with them, but they are nothing like real boobies.  They look like boobies, but with a bra on, there's little external difference (prosthetics vs recon.) As far as naked goes, it's less traumatic...but, the scars are reminders.  Anybody who sees me naked knows something bad happened here.  Skin-sparing tends to produce better outcomes.  Time fades scars, but they are still prominent.  Naked, I feel like I have to \"explain\" the scars. It's hot as hades in South Mississippi and it is convenient having reconstructions...in the event that I'm going \"commando\"...I've gotten used to my flaps and in clothing, I am less self-conscious about them. It's kind of like having false teeth.  I know they're not \"real\"...the big difference to me...recon versus no recon is that I don't have to strap on my fake boobs...when I wake up in the morning, they're already on. I have formed an impression that immediate recon is less traumatic...but it will still be traumatic, because this will be a drastic body change.  Sort of like having a surrogate stuffed animal...it helps, but it isn't what you're used to.  tl P.S.  I was age 40 at diagnosis...45 grand years old now!  :)",

This is a \"benign\" condition (not breast cancer) and it is common for the lumps to come and go...and sometimes, relates to menstral cycle. The only way that I know of to positively diagnose breast cancer is to biopsy.  So, when something suspicious is seen on imaging or felt, the doctor may order biopsy to rule out breast cancer. It is reasonable to believe that the breast specialist would be able (by feel) to identify what's a lump and what may be other structures in your chest wall (like underlying muscle). It is unlikely that if there is nothing on imaging and nothing on palpation that the doctor would be willing to order a biopsy. (I have no medical training).  I would personally be inclined to do my regular doctor visits (gyn etc.) and have the routine scans that my doctor recommends. The overwhelming likelihood is that if you have had this lump for 4 years and nothing dramatic has happened, (it hasn't grown, etc.), it probably is not breast cancer. People, in general, have all sorts of structures in their bodies that come and go that scientists cannot really explain.  I've had a few myself that have popped up on scan (and it is scary!). ...so I can dig it. tl ",
