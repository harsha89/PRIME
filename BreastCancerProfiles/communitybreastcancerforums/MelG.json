I was terrified for about the first year.   It really does get better!  Love Mel",

However, I see you are only young.   As others have said, go with Benign until you know any different.   Most lumps are *not* breast cancer and fibrocystic changes are common in your age group.  Best wishes for benign results!   Hope all goes well for you on Wednesday.
