Just a quick update for those of you starting tomorrow: Chemo #1 is history for me and went well overall. During the treatment itself, I felt perfectly fine, though VERY sleepy from the Benadryl and of course you can't get any sleep when your vitals are being checked every half hour. I'm about 6 hours post treatment now and have minor naseau and a strong buzz for the steroid dose. I had mild tingling in my legs for a very short time.  I have drunk and drunk and drunk water today and am now sipping Yogi brand Ginger tea which I have loved for years and which seems to be helping with the nausea. I am so happy to have this first treatment behind me. I know some SE's could raise their ugly little heads tomorrow, but I'm going with: so far, so good.",

I'm hoping, with you, that the Lexapro will keep the headaches away plus help with anxiety and depesssion.  I'm really looking forward to the LGFB workshop - I'm going Nov 1. Hard to say what shape I'll be in then - my chemo nurse said I may not lose much hair at all. But, like you say, there are other good reasons for taking the class, like good hygiene. Plus you get free stuff. Yesterday, I had terrrible heartburn so I am REALLY watching what I eat today. Just trying things on mentally first to forsee if it will sit well or not. Also I was drinking lots of club soda but that strikes a wrong note today so I'm done with that.  Had lots of bone pain last night. The clinic I go to does not routinely give the Neulasta shot with my treatment regimen - they test first, then give it (warning that by doing it this way, I may have to delay a treatment). But I figure even without the shot, the pain bone may have the same cause - my marrow working overtime to produce white blood cells. Does this seem reasonable? I took a Claritin since I know I tolerate it well and it does seem to have helped some. Deciding I just couldn't go into work today so I'm working 1/2 day from home. I have the sort of job where that is accepted and common and doable - very thankful for that. And for a supportive boss.",

The Compazine seemed to make it worse (terrible cramping along with more nausea and I could not keep my eyes open). So I'm off that and just dealing with the now manageable nausea with Sea Bands and very small very bland meals. At least I am able to be awake for hours at a stretch. I won't go into how hard the last several days have been. The first MO I saw (not the one I ended up with) warned that symptoms could get worse 8-10 days out because (as someone mentioned in an earlier post) of the drop in WBC. I tucked this in the back of my mind, but didn't hear it from anyone else, so I hoped she was wrong. Turns out she wasn't. One thing that has made me angry/sad is how several of my 'alpha female' friends have pretty much denied that this is all a result of chemo: 1) there must be something else going on, 2) most people get over it in two or three days and 3) you really have to get in and be seen. I have really regretted having any sort of interaction with them. I know they mean well but what I wish I had had the strength to say is 1) I didn't know you were an expert on chemo 2) I've very happy for them but that's not been my experience and 3) don't you think I know that and don't you know I am doing EVERYTHING I can to feel better? Take care all.",

I wore my hair short (not this short, tho) for years before growing it long over the past 2 years, so it's not that much of an adjustment and people have been very complimentary. But what really warmed my heart is when I saw my 17 YO DS that night. We both had caps on. I took mine off to reveal my shorn head. He took his off to reveal a very close buzz. He said he did it to show solidarity with me. So sweet. He doesn't say much but I know he is feeling this. I had 4 good days last week free of nausea. Yesterday it came back but today I am feeling all right. I'm hoping for 3 good days before my next treatment on Thursday, but I'm learning to very much take it one day at a time and not be discouraged.

Sorry to say I don't have a more serious tip for you. I used Zegerid (now OTC) for heartburn and had good results (for those who may not like Zantac).

She went through this 10 years ago and said she thought the first Tx was the hardest as far as side effects go. She felt her body handled the subsequent treatments better, because it knew what was coming and how to adjust.

It's sweet to read all the posts and share what we're going through and feel the support. It's Day 5 Chemo #2 and my temp is starting to climb so I'm going to take an ibuprofen and see if that knocks it down.  Cheers to the awesome October 2011 chemo ladies!",

I changed mine to a recent one of my son and me - he showed his solidarity by getting his head shaved. That really warmed my heart. I'm on Day 7 after Chemo (TCH) #3. Neuropathy and bone aches hit hard Sunday and Monday but I've felt good after a great night's sleep Monday night. I'm anticipating trouble on Days 8, 9, 10 since that was the pattern the first two times, but maybe that won't happen this time. Juls - your 'boomy cottony' description really sums it up. Eyes are funky too at times. I'm very thankful for a generous leave policy at work so I can stay home, work as many hours as I feel up to and nap freely. This really eases my stress.",

Perts1 - I'm trying your lemon-ginger recipe. Ramping up the fluid consumption for Tx #3 tomorrow and I'm already sick of water. Anyone else using acupuncture to help get through this? My acupuncturist put ear seeds in last time for nausea and gave me some magnets which I applied when the symptoms started to build. I didn't have to use Zofran at all after Tx #2 so I believe it was beneficial. I'm all for using meds if needed but I like to try other things first.   ",

Best news this week so far, is that I'll only have 4 treatments and I was expected 6. Worst news is that I pulled a filling out of my tooth while taking a ginger chew (to combat nausea) for a test drive. So I'll be going in on Friday to get that fixed. One more in a long list of appointments. I'm going to read back through all these posts and try to get to know you all a little. I'm really glad to have a group of virtual friends to stay in touch with through this.",

My MO used the Adjuvantonline.com site to show me the numbers - explaining why chemo was advised despite negative nodes - namely because it was medium sized and had several markers for being fast growing. I found that really helpful. @Carla -  You've been through a lot more than me already, but I share, in some ways the unreal sense. I'm planning to be back on work on Monday after my first treatment tomorrow. May we all be among those who breeze through! ",

Let me say a warm welcome to you, too Sounds like you have a hard road ahead of you and the lion's heart to win the battle. I've never had reflexology but anything that helps you feel better and relax has got to be good. A good practitioner of any kind with a healing touch is a gift from God. Perts1 - love the lemon ginger water. However, DS likes it too so I might have to fight him for it! WIMusicMaker - tough times and tough wait and tough decision for you. Extra prayers for you tonight.",
