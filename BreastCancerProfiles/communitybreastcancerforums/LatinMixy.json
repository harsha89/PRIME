      "Content": "LatinMixy wrote: I had a full mastectomy 2 weeks ago. I had two tumors in each breast, and in one of the breast I had two types of cancer (lobular and ductal). My tumors were all relatively small. The largest being 2.5cm. I had the sentinel nodes dissection in both sides. One side was negative. The other side showed micro metastases in one of the two sentinel nodes that were dissected. My challenge is now deciding if I should go further in the removal of my axillary lymph nodes and have radiation treatment. I have trouble justifying having those two, as I see the real benefit of removing my axillary lymph nodes, with all the potential risk and complications, having radiation to my chest (my breast were removed anyway) part of my neck and the armpit area. Also, I had to go under chemotherapy anyway, in order to address the fact that some cancer cells were released to the rest of the body through the lymph nodes. Since I had an early stage cancer, most of this treatments would be of a preventive nature mostly. I kind of feel like going through chemo and long lasting endocrine therapy will be a good path for me. But, has anybody here been through something similar that can enlighten me?

I have never felt a SE from it. I also followed my pharmacists and MO advise of taking Claritin since the day before my first round without stopping. My liver enzymes are back to normal, thanks God! They will continue monitoring them for peaks and valleys. I assume my stint at the ER had a lot to do with it. Also, I visited my surgeon and the little lump I found in one of my breasts is benign. Lots of good news, finally! Sleeping has been a huge challenge. My MO recommended taking an Ativan at night. It kind of help, but I still cannot sleep as good as I used to. Oh well, another SE of cancer, chemo, etc, etc, etc. I don't think I will continue with the Ativan intake, I know so many people that have fell of the rails with it. Scary.

Specially from the colon cancer standpoint, which has taken so many lives in my father's side of the family, including himself. :( My taste buds are completely gone. At least I don't have any mouth sores! But wow, how much do we underestimate having the sense of taste. Eating is not nearly as much fun. I had three rounds in November. My last AC is on December 13, YAY! Good bye red devil! According to my MO, Taxol is easier to the body. We will see. The infusion will be over 5 hours. Thanks God Netflix is finally allowing downloads. I hate regular TV. I hate to go to the hospital today to get an interim blood work to see how is my liver doing. I also have follow up appointment with surgeon. I found a little weird mass on my right breast. My PS said that it is fatty tissue, but at this point we dont want to take risks and assume. I believe most of you guys are having neoadjuvent chemo and then surgery. I already had my mastectomy and we already started reconstruction. It may sound ridiculous, but the sense of happiness and normalcy I feel when I get my tissue expanders filled is amazing. ",
