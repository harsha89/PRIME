I requested conscious sedation but was talked out of it by the bs and anesthesiologist. I can't say I'm happy to have had the general because of the lingering ill effects but I also had a LOT of pain coming out of it so perhaps it was better than I agreed to the general. The bs said she had to go deep and didn't want me to move around at all during surgery. So perhaps you could discuss with your bs his/her preferences and find out if he lumpectomy will be easy to access.",

Since then I've had 3 more sessions and the redness has not worsened. I did speak with the RO about it and he said the redness was not unusual. Also, the rad tech who has been doing this for 28 years reassured me that where the redness occurred on me was the usual place to see it first. I'm sticking with the aloe gel for now as that feels the best. I use it 3 to 4 times a day.",

As a former RN I am very critical of docs but she was tops. Her mom had aggressive bc so that was one of her motivations to specialize in bc. At first I did start freaking out because she did not yet have the biopsy report so she couldn't tell me what kind of ca I had so she laid out the worst case scenario. A half hour into the consult the nurse was able to access the report which revealed it was DCIS. So that was quite a relief. I'm having a lumpectomy in 2 days. We were going to put it off for 2 weeks to let me get though my busy season in my business BUT she started talking about the possibility that on surgery day I would have to go through more imaging to stick the wire in my breast so she would know where to excise (even though the radiologist put in the marker during my biopsy). As it stands now I have a large hematoma from the biopsy and it certainly won't dissolve in 2 days so that will help guide her to the area for lumpectomy. We discussed some of what I learned on this great forum such as even though it biopsied as DCIS it might turn up IDC as well. And that I might need further surgery. I felt like I was well prepared after reading so many of the threads and suggested reading and topics of this site. Great work, mods. I'll update my signature line after surgery.",

Had the stereotactic biopsy and my primary doc called me in to tell me that it was positive but said the results didn't indicate the particular flavor of ca. I had already done enough research to believe that the biopsy would indicate what cancer it was but the doc said no and all that he saw was that it was positive for bc. I tend to think he just didn't want to or didn't think it was his place to tell me the type. I have a surgical consult in 3 days so I'm sure I'll find out more at that appt but it would have been good to have the type ahead of that consult so I could be more prepared with questions. Oh well! But I posted to see if this was par for the course of a biopsy showing positive but not giving the type. Sister and mother both have had it so it was no great surprise.

The report was transmitted electronically 4 days after the biopsy so it would seem that all the information about the biopsy would have been there. I'm not fretting (well maybe just a little) because I'll find out from the BS this week but I just thought it odd when I read so many posts that suggest the type was known when the biopsy report came back positive. I know it's one step at a time but just knowing that it came back positive made me want to start researching more so if I had known the type it would have been helpful. I don't blame my doc if he knew but didn't tell me. He's had his hands full with me over the years and kept a good demeanor. I keep copies of all my records so I'll add all that is to come. I have a type of chronic blood cancer also so I'm used to dealing with obtaining my own copies.",
