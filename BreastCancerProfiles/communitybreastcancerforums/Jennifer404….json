You will be glad to have the port in the long run. I have not shaved my head...only got a pixie. Considering shaving now though. My hair has been loosening up for days and now it is full on coming out when I touch it. My scalp feels weird...not painful per say...just different. You have to do what makes you feel the best about it. Our hair is a very personal thing. For me...I am gonna skip the wigs and just go natural or with a scarf:)",

You go to their website and fill out their questionnaire and they assign two breast cancer survivors to you and they send you little things, cards, gifts etc. for encouragement...all through snail mail and they continue through your treatment. I find that it lifts my spirits and look forward to doing the same for someone next year:)",

Thought I would be ok when it started happening.. But, I will admit I was sad. Seems to be the schedule that I hear everyone say that their hair falls out. I think I had myself convinced it might not happen:( Hair, schmair...it's too hot anyway. By the way is there anyone else on here that is her2+?",

He is a two time cancer survivor (super young) and when he was going through treatments he could not find a really good support system with mentors that have gone through his specific treatments, for his type of cancer, and at his age.  So he started Imermans Angels.  It seems that you can request support and be matched to someone that has gone through what you have gone through (ie same type of cancer, treatment, age group, with kids/or not, single/married/straight/gay etc) also your spouse/significant other/ caregiver can be matched with someone that has been in a situation just like them.  It would be so good for my husband to talk to another man in his situation.  It can be short term or long term.  I signed up for it and suggest you look into it.  I find an amazing amount of support on these threads... and am so thankful that they are here for us, but, sometimes I just want to talk to someone or skype. You know?  just thought I would share:) stay strong ladies and be encouraged. http://www.imermanangels.org/get-cancer-support.php",

My name is jennifer and I was diagnosed with idc stage 2 grade 2 er/pr+ her2+ brac - on June 22, 2012 Had a port put in on 6/292012...placed in chest...surgeon did great. Almost no scar. Very comfortable. Started chemo...7/2/2012 (6 rounds) 18 weeks. TCH. Have not lost my hair yet. But my scalp feels weird. So I know that it is coming. I cut my hair into a pixie when my onc confirmed there was no way around hair loss. I thought it would ease my 2 year old into things a bit. Then surgery. Maybe the end of November. Not sure what kind yet...probably a bilateral mastectomy. I hate it that we are all here...it brings me to tears when I read how many women are on here. Overwhelms me. But, I am glad we are finding strength in each other. It means so much. Jennifer",

But I was disappointed. And all of my dr's said for sure a total hysterectomy next year. Wish they would let me do both a mx and hysterectomy at the same time.",
