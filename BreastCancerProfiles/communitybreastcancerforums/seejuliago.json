Great news from the mammo though- tumor shrunk significantly and nothing picked up in the lymph nodes! Hoping your MRI goes well! Sorry I don't have any info to pass along...",

Didn't realize how many had sternum mets till I read here! I am 3 weeks out from the end of my first chemo (just beginning this process) and tomorrow I have a breast MRI to check the progression of the primary site. Don't know if it will pick up lymph nodes or sternum. Then, on the 20th I have a CT and bone scan to check progress of met. Happy to know you all!",
