I hate it because I don't know how to say this to my parents. I know they will be affected by this as well as my other siblings. I have pain on my shoulder down to my arm which I felt years ago. My chest x-ray 5 years ago was first pleural adhesion, then last year I know have pleural effusion on my right lung. A sign of metastasis. I have this lump on my breast and my nipples are itchy and have a tingling sensation and there's this flake thing falling off. I'm a nurse and my mom wants me to work abroad and he doesn't know everything bout it. There are medical exams to work abroad and I'm pretty sure they'll know about it. I'm now losing hope and just wish I was never born. I don't know where I'm going. I'm too afraid to face everything what I'm going to deal with.",
