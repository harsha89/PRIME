I am also taking Aleve and Claritin as the Neulasta monster is doing its trick again. I'm hopeful that today will be the turning point. I can't imagine how people go to work while,they are doing this. I rarely, if ever missed a day at work but this would have done it. I am grateful to be retired.

How do you handle blood draws, finger sticks(pre-diabetes) and blood pressures when you don't have a non-surgery arm. My thinking in choosing prohy for the non disease side is that at least I can escape SNB on that side. Since my cancer was so hard to find and I have taken ERT for 22 years I thought there was a significant chance of eventual cancer in the good breast (dense with microcalcifications and a biopsy years ago).

I am a young active seventy. The idea of being completely flat with no extra surgery works but I am prediabetic and control that disease with diet. That requires constant finger sticks. I am therefore very concerned about what I would do if I developed lymphedema in both arms. My surgeon is wonderful but like all of them she pooh-poohed my fears of lymphedema. Is my thinking correct? I would still have the use of my good arm without fear of lymphedema or can finger sticks contribute to truncal lymphedema? I also go to Europe at least once a year and hope to continue flying. I feel like I have become irrationallynfearful of Lymphedema but my Aunt developed it and suffers very much from it. For today I am leaning toward unilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction. I am a D cup but very thin and have lived in tee shirts and jeans since retirement. I can't imagine being able to make that work. Thanks so much ladies. This is my first post so it feels good to get connected  ",

Everything they gave me had carbs so I ate very little until I got home and ate the refrigerator. The bowel issues should be fun!! For those of you who don't have someone to stay with you in the hospitalI think all will be well. They had to unplug me from so many gizmos each time I had to go to the bathroom that my husband was unable to help. I had a constant IV, and leg pumpers on. For a while I even had a blood pressure and oxygen monitor on me. Since they monitor input and output the nurses always were there when I had to go. They also gave me round the clock medication.

My husband and adult children were with me so I was very well supported. The hospital staff were amazing. Every one of them. I was constantly attended to. I have manageable pain so far. I am sitting in bed propped up on a wedge and will try to sleep that way. One crazy thing happened in the hospital. Several hours after surgery I had to go to the bathroom and they asked me if I wanted to try to walk. I was feeling fine so I said yes. My blood pressure is always very low and as soon as I sat up I began to feel bad. The next thing I know I awaken in bed with at least 8 people looking over me. I heard them say \"cancel the code blue\" she is back. According to my husband I fell back like a rock, was white as a sheet and could not be awakened. Since I was sweating profusely they feared that I might be having a heart attack. It was all over in a few minutes but it took about 10 years off my husbands life. I have been a fainter all of my life so the whole thing was not that unusual. Back to the he bottom line. They removed two sentinel nodes and my surgeon said they looked good. I should know for sure next week. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I'm so glad to have this part behind me. .",

I got freaked about lymph nodes because my surgery was two months after diagnosis but nodes were gratefully clear. I was given such little information about exercise and that was contradictory. My surgeon gave me a pamphlet which said lift arm over your head near the ear. Discharge from nurse said no more than 90 degrees. So I followed nurse and did exercises that were all below 90. Then at follow up, surgeon again said \"get that arm up\". So I started the climbing up the wall thing. It really doesn't hurt bad, it just pulls a little. My only concern is it clearly made the swelling worse under my arm. I'm curious if any of you are exercising. I am 11 days out and my drain was removed. Thoughts on cancer. I am low Vitamin D and now taking supplements. I have chronically high blood sugar as in pre-diabetes (worse since a few days before surgery-stress?). Always wonder if there is a connection. I stopped eating sugar and refined carbs over one year ago. I wonder. Sending prayers and healing thoughts to all. You have all helped me so much. Bless you.",

However as your PS said there are lots of options. Saw my Onc today and he is doing the Mamaprint.im trying to figure out how such a small tumor that is grade one could come back intermediate. It is like there is something sneaky about the little sucker. I am praying for a no on the Mamaprint because I just have a bad feeling about chem for me because I am 70. My Onc doesn't put a lot of faith in either of the two tests he said they always used to just go by the pathology. Then, back to my original thought.....the Oncotype should have then been lower than 23 with such \"nice\" pathology. Decisions and fear",

So I guess my MO makes his calls on Sunday evening so there it was. It seems my Mamaprint came back high risk. So looks like I am now in the chemo group. So my problem is my increasingly uncontrolled diabetes. The way I knew I had blood sugar problems was the terrible pain in my feet and legs. So even the early stages I was developing neuropathy. I am on a strict no sugar low carb diet and after 1 and one half years it slowly cleared up. Lately my numbers are creeping up( since diagnosis) and add the Arimidex and it is back in full force. So I told him I was terrified of more and permanent neuropathy if I took taxotere. He agreed and wants me to take CMF. When I was practicing pharmacy back in the 70's I used to prepare these drugs for people. Interestingly this is an old protocol that Sloan Kettering has started using again. I hope it works for me. I so agee about needing to watch the sugar. I am sure that a high glycemic load is not good for our bodies at this time. Just saying. I am praying daily for all,of,us. Hang in there and thank you ladies who are already doing or have done chemo. Your courage is inspiring and helps me to face this new bend in the road",

I am assured by all that it is all doable but I hate that anyone has to go through it. Does anyone have swelling anywhere? I have a soft golf ball size swelling right where my arm joins my torso. Is this normal or the start of lymphedema? As a diabetic they say I am at higher risk but hopefully it is just post op swelling. Enjoy The Weeknd as best you can. We are on the road to health.",

The grieving process takes as long as it takes. That being said, sometimes we need to talk to someone. There are so many good support groups and counselors who deal with this specific thing. Most oncology offices have social workers who are there to talk to. This group will be invaluable as well. We are all on this journey together and we will get through. The road has several hills for many of the gals but we will eventually achieve good robust health. welcome to the group. We all understand. Illimae, they drained my seroma last week but it did not affect this spot. I have an appointment Monday morning so I will have her look at it. I think I worry about swelling because I am fairly obsessed with lymphedema. My Aunt developed it after breast surgery and it made a huge impression on me. I vowed I would nip,it in the bud if I got it.  SBKH I hope you are up to,posting again soon. Sending love and support Thank you to all of you for being so amazing. I did not think i would be dealing with this in my 70's. I kind of thought I had dodged the bullet. It has been so,helpful to be part of this group. XXXOOOO  I",

But glad to say it is definitely improving (exactly 4 weeks today). What about the cold nipple when you drink cold water.....how weird is that I like the idea that massage may get rid of the swelling. My scar looked so much better before it started to get stretched. I'm going to try the massage and maybe the silicone strips as well. Thanks for that tip. Have an awesome weekend everyone. Take good care of yourselves.",

My Oncotype is delayed so I don't know the score but he told me that I now have a 20 percent chance of recurrence with mastectomy. I was hoping for less. He started me on Arimidex but I did not ask how low that brought me. He said he would only recommend chemo if I was in the high or high intermediate range. Now I'm thinking I need to research diet, lifestyle etc. etc. .. also my genetic testing has not come in yet. I am 70 (but healthy I thought) and I think they are very focused on side effects. A person on another board said that at my age when you fix one thing you might break another!!! Along those notes, I'm thinking my desire to stay informed might be getting eclipsed by my desire to stay sane. Just kidding (sort of). Toughiebird.....good for you for getting everything scheduled. I think there is a strength that comes from knowing you have begun to fight back. It sounds like you have made really good decisions. I was very active after my surgery and five weeks out I am back to normal activity. That being said, perhaps my swelling was a result of that so what the heck do I know! What I wore all the time was soft tank tops with large Chico type button downs over them. Since I had company almost every day that worked for me. I also got these very soft T shirts from target that I could step into. That was great (stepped into the tanks as well) I have a little fur baby and he stayed home but my husband walked him and he is way too old to jump on me anymore. So no help,there.

It was really only about the ritual that my husband and I enjoyed at the end of the day before dinner (a real throw back to the sixties) I did lower my coffee intake gradually a few weeks before surgery. I did not want to deal with a withdrawal headache on the day of surgery. I wish I could tell you how doable giving up sugar is. When I became diabetic (early or pre as they call it) of course it was off the table for me. It is just like addiction....,sugar craves sugar. Once you break the cycle it is amazing how many wonderful flavors are out there. It took me two weeks of hell to retrain my pallet. This is just my personal opinion but I think the sugar subs just keep the sugar cravings alive. Good luck to you all. I hear you about the weight. I am looking at three months of chemo starting in two weeks and I am terrified of losing more weight. I lost 7 pounds at the surgery and have not found them. So now I am 127 at 5' 7\" and looking too thin. I can't eat high carb drinks to gain weight without having diabetic complications. So I'm stumped. I eat high fat with no trouble but wonder if it is a problem with breast cancer. Toughiebird you have a lot on your plate. Prayers and hugs. Good for you for advocating for your needs. I'm sick of the whole medical machine that wants to heard us through like cattle. We are making decisions about our lives. We get to ask questions and sorry if we can't fit it all into there little 10 minute time slots. Illimae I am so happy that you are back to work. You have really walked the walk. Your story gives me hope. Also, my chemo regimented will be Cytoxan and Taxotere. I'm scared all over again",
