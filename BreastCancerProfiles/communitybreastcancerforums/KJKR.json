It is so easy to read all the stories on internet, look at all the pictures, and read all posts  here, too and assume that there is no other option.  I was in the same boat three months ago.  My left breast was red and swollen, I didn't respond to antibiotics first, I thought my skin had dimples, I was sure it was IBC.  My mammogram was normal, my ultrasound was normal, but I knew it didn't mean anything. I begged my surgeon for a biopsy and she did a skin biopsy which came back benign.  For a short while I was happier, but then I started to question the results -- what if she sampled from the wrong spot?  Then I read about someone here who needed to have multiple biopsies to diagnose IBC.  Again, I was sure I had IBC, because my symptoms didn't go away.  Eventually, after 3 months, 3 rounds of different antibiotics, anti-inflamatory drugs, change to a new, very soft, silky bra, everything cleared up.  I do not have IBC.  What I am trying to say, unless you have a positive diagnosis, do not think you have it.  For every IBC story here, there are tens of others that ended up like mine.  Women who end up diagnosed with cancer, stay here and post.  Those who get good news, usually leave and you can't find any information about those cases.  That is why what you find on internet is skewed.  On the other hand, it is true -- do not give up until you have a good explanation of any of your symptoms or until they are gone.  You have to demand whatever tests are needed to make sure it is not IBC (or to confirm it is - very unlikely).  My breast surgeon said she diagnoses breast cancer all the time, but she sees IBC only about once a year.  It is very, very rare.  Do not give up hope, but do not stop your fight to diagnose it properly.  Good luck.
