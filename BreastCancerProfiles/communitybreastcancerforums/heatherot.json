I'm glad to hear that you've liked it in the past for both day and night wear. And, she has tried \"fragrance free\" detergent. However, her dermatologist said she should use \"Dreft\" detergent. So, she's giving that a try. She state that she wore a brand new Miro sleeve without washing first and still broke out - so there was no detergent on that particular sleeve. We haven't tried skin prep before donning the sleeve - my experience with the prep was that it is used to provide some \"stickiness\" to the skin to hold wraps in place or to place at the top of a sleeve to hold it up. Is there a different type of skin prep than I'm thinking of? And thank you for the Lyphoderm info as well. I've heard of this product, but haven't used it with any clients.Â  This is all great info to pass onto my client/patient. I've only been in touch with her via phone as she lives farther away from me. But, I will keep you all posted on what we find. Heather",

She has worn a compression sleeve for 12 years and within the past 3 years has been struggling with an allergy to the sleeve. She has tried Juzo, Miro and Lymphedivas. She has been hospitalized with hives 3 times in the past 3 years. She appears to have developed an allergy over time. She feels it is the spandex in the garment. Does anyone have any experience with this or have any suggestions for us? Thank you! Heather Log in to post a reply",
