I\u2019ve only been on this discussion board for two days and have learned a lot already.There seems to be so many different drugs to treat this disease (which is agood thing.) My doctor tells me at some point the current treatment will stop working and we will have to move on to another one.

This past February I was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer (to the bones) so I'm new to this.Â I'm being treated with Arimidex, Xgeva, and Faslodex. What I find so frustrating is that you don't really know if the meds are working until the next scan. Am I right on that?",
