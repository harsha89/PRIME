I have lancinating pain that goes through my chest wall to my scapula,& neck & shoulder pain. This is on the side of my BLM that I developed MRSA in my tissue expander, necessitating removal. The pain flare ups are becoming more frequent & affects my QOL when I have pain... hoping one of my docs will listen & help. https://www.curetoday.com/publications/cure/2013/winter2013/post-mastectomy-pain-hits-a-nerve",
