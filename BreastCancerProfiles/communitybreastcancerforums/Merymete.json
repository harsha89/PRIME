Longest part was plastic surgeon, said he removed a pound of tissue from the non-lumpectomy side for the reduction. I'm guessing my BS was able to get clean margins then. I was cleared to leave whenever I felt able, or stay overnight if I wanted. How great is that! I left around 8pm, snuggled up at home. In a tremendous head fog (yay Percocet!) but I am thinking of my surgery sisters and all of you lovely ladies tonight. My new motto: Cancer-free since 3:00!! Lol!!  Edited to add pathology results. Margins were clear, SNB negative!!! Woo hoo baby!!!!",

Long, long story short: I started randomly bleeding on Saturday. Gushing. Called the ambulance, got sent to one hospital to stop the bleeding then transferred to where I had the lumpectomy done. Stayed overnight for monitoring. Got sent home Sunday, and when I changed to gauze (wet to dry wound care), it opened up again. I ended up having surgery to repair the artery. Was in the hospital 3 nights, received 3 units of blood to replace the 2.5 liters I lost. I am so tired right now! I feel like the cancer was the least of my problems. The docs all say they've never seen this happen. No problems since the surgery, but boy am I ever careful during gauze changes",

I'm glad you are on a healing track!  I'm a mess. I'm having a reaction to the IORT (intraoperative radiation therapy). The breast that had a reduction is great. The cancer breast looks like a war zone. It's black in multiple places from hematomas, and my incision is open about an inch and solid hematoma mass is coming out. I have stretch marks from the swelling. No infection, I'm doing wet to dry wound care, but it's just so very gross!!! I will see the plastic surgeon again on Thursday, thank goodness.",
