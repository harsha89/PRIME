The firs time a \"lump\" was found the expected hysteria followed.  After several repeat mammograms (due to dense tissue) and Ultra Sound examinations I was told I have multiple large cysts in my breasts and not to worry.  As the months passed I did notice that my breast size would flucuate with my periods and some \"lumps\" would appears to get larger then smaller with my menses as well.  All subsequent Mammograms and Ultra sounds told the same story.  Now.....I have a lump that does not go away with my period, it feels different harder and it doesn't hurt.  ( did I mention the cysts used to hurt)  I usually have several lumps/bumps, but right now I just have this one on my left breast and my doctor is super concerned about it,  any ideas?   I have an exam on friday but if anyone has had anything similar I would appreciate the feed back thanks Lag[Edit] [Delete] Log in to post a reply",
