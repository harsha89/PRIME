My RO gave me a hand written and hard copy of who, what, when and how much and went over it all before hand so I've had no surprises. I am grateful for it all.

As for your pain, I know it sound crazy but I found meditation very helpful. I'm not one of those people that put my full self into all of the natural healing stuff but it does help. Some places can teach you how to meditate, I learned from practicing yoga. It really helped me through all the pain of the biopsies and my surgeries.

So my MO suggested I have my ovaries removed so that I could start on Arimidex (Anastrozole). So in October I had the surgery and started the Arimidex. The worst side effect I had was hot flashes which come with menopause anyway and I was a little fatigued for the first two weeks but other than that I was good. However, everyone is different so hopefully you will fair well like I have so far. My MO took me off of the meds until I finish rads so that the rads can do their job, but I will go back on it after I finish for about the next 8yrs. Arimidex has the least amount of side effects than most and it's mainly bone related. The way I look at it is women have bone loss when they start menopause anyway but at least with the pill it will help prevent the cancer from coming back. I take calcium and D3 to help combat it and my primary doc keeps an eye on my levels. Positive thoughts you're almost there. Feline, I'm glad you finally got some help and reassurance. Prayers that everything goes well for you. Flowergal, Congrats on finishing! Metoo, Yeah half way there! Yesterday my armpit area was in a lot of pain so saw the RO that was on duty. He told me to get aloe with lidocaine. Boy does it work! I finally had some relief. He also told me to take a non-drowsy antihistamine so I did that to. Between the two I was finally able to get a good night sleep because I wasn't in pain. 4 more whole breast treatments then 5 boosts and I'll be done on the 30th, I can't wait.

I found that aloe gel w/ 4% lidocaine at Walgreens. My RO gave me a Rx for 3% straight lidocaine but the tube was $52 for 2oz. I don't get it, insurance companies will pick up highly addictive narcotics but not a tube of lidocaine. Hope you heal quickly and have a pain free day! ",

It's like an assembly line of patients but they still make sure everyone feels cared for and top priority. I get that treatment form all the doctors and nurses on my team. I am very lucky. I'm sitting here now trying to figure out what to do today now that I don't have rads. I go back to work tomorrow but they have me on a 4 hour a day schedule until I heal up. People may complain about Home Depot but they take care of their employees when we need it. Hope everyone has a pain free day ",

The only redness is on my incision area but it doesn't burn there, which is weird. I put some aloe on straight from the plant and sprayed my aquarphor and it has calmed the burning. 25 more to go. Hope everyone is having a good day. ",

My RO wants to give my underarm a break seeing that the skin is peeling and then I'll finish the whole breast after my boosts. So tomorrow after I get all the X-rays done we will go over my boost plan. So far my RO has been great with everything and I'm thankful she is giving me a few days to get my skin issue under control. I will say this, the aloe gel w/ lidocaine is working wonders to keep my pain at a minimum. Kaywrite, One more to go for you right? Congrats! Hope everyone is doing as well as they can.",

I'm sorry you've had to work through it, I can't even imagine.I've been really fortunate that I haven't had to work since my surgery in January, but I do have to go back Thursday. They moved me to another department so I'll be doing computer training for about a week or so. As for treating the skin, I have resorted to mixing aloe w/ 4% lidocaine into calendula cream, it really helps the pain.Then I spray it all with aquaphor. Also keeping it clean and covered. I also take 1 Advil and 1 Tylenol every six hours, that helps too. However the skin under my arm peeled off and it's not as painful any more. My husband told me this morning I look like a burn victim he's pulled out of a fire. We are almost done. We will cook a bit longer once were done but it shouldn't get any worse than it is now. Congrats on finishing and hang in there Dawn. Hope you have a less painful day   ",

When did you have your last chemo? Taxol does have a skin side effect. If I were you I would go get it checked out. I know that's the last thing you want to do is see another doctor but they might have a better cream to help. Good luck. Hope everyone else is healing well. Happy Mother's Day to all the mom's! Have a wonderful day. ",
