At first she could not feel it. It is only a pea size lump. Yesterday I felt the lump again and it feels like it has grown in size. I also noticed that my skin is discolored over the lump. Not sure if that says something or not. So, my doctor wants me to stay off the caffeine and then I go back on the 13th. Not sure why no caffeine. The lump is not sore at all. So, we shall see.",
