I was given to expect I would be seeing him in the exam room, so I thought it got switched to after the treatment. I never imagined that a simple \"how are you?\" qualified as a normal appt. But I'm glad to hear that is more the normal doc visit. So I guess I just need to be more prepared for my weekly doctor visits to take place while I am actually being given treatments. The techs are all polite, but not informative. I ask questions, but it doesn't prompt them to be more forthcoming with what to expect. I think having to draw every bit of information out of them has made me more sensitive during the appointments. I think I need to just simmer down. I got used to friendly staff at the chemo place that always let me know what they were doing and why.",

I have a list of questions, so I'll try to get them answered or leave them with the techs for him to answer. I was just so rattled by things today. I'm sure it will be fine.

Thank you to everyone that has shared their experiences! I'm not getting a good feeling about my doctor so far, but I wonder if I am being overly sensitive. I saw him right after surgery in July and really liked him at that time. I had my CT scan a few weeks ago and sim last week. The doctor stepped into the room for a moment each time and looked under the cloth with a brief comment about checking to see if everything was lined up. I don't believe he said hello or goodbye either time. He wasn't unpleasant, but not friendly either. But I didn't expect anything since I knew it wasn't an official doctor visit. I was told that Wednesdays will be the day I see the doctor weekly and since today was my first treatment, I was taken to an exam room and had vitals taken, then given a gown to change into and told the doctor would be right in. The doctor didn't come, but a tech came and told me to gather my belongings and then she took me to the treatment room. They started by taking X-rays and said they would do the radiation after that. While I was on the table the doctor came in and said he was going to check my position. Then he lifted the cloth and checked. He said, \"How are you?\" I replied, \"Fine.\" He then said, \"Your X-rays look fine. We'll get started.\" And then left the room. No hello or goodbye. At this point I assumed I would be seeing him after the treatment. I was given the treatment and it went fine. Then a male tech came in and said I was done and moved the table down. I got up and the tech left the room. I didn't know whether to get dressed or not, so I followed him out and asked if I would still be seeing the doctor. He said, \"Sorry, no, he already saw you. You can get dressed\" I replied, \"Oh.\" He then followed with, \"If you have questions, I can take you to a room and have the nurse come talk to you.\" I was feeling kinda pissy at that point and just said, \"No thanks. I'll just check online.\" So I got dressed. When I walked out the doctor was in the hallway and told me they needed to get my vitals. I replied that they already had. He then asked how it went and I said, \"Fine, fine.\" and kept walking. I was upset and just wanted out of there at that point. Also, I was pretty sure the only reason he was talking to me is because he either overheard the conversation with the tech, or the tech told him I seemed upset. Is this normal for RO's? Did you get any kind of \"education\" like for chemo? When I saw him back in July he was informative. But since then, he hasn't gone over my treatment plan with me or explained how he arrived at it. I was told over the phone that I would have 30 regular treatments and 6 boosts. Nor have I been told what to expect or if there is anything I should be doing differently from normal. Maybe since he had a consult with me 6 months ago, he doesn't think I need any additional info. Thanks for any feedback.",
