      "Content": "Apr 27, 2017 03:28PM lovepugs77 wrote: Sure, Daniusa. My initial surgery was a bilateral lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy on the left. The sentinel node biopsy came back with 4/5 positive nodes, so my surgeon did an axillary lymph node dissection. The initial surgery was on March 28, and the second was on April 13, so they were about two weeks apart. For the actual procedure, he re-opened the incision from the sentinel node biopsy and enlarged it. He took 19 additional lymph nodes during that surgery, and all of those were negative. In terms of recovery, today is 2 weeks since that surgery, and I'm still not 100%. I think part of that is having two procedures in the same area so close together. The surgeon did tell me in advance that recovery from this would be more difficult, though. My biggest problems have been skin irritation, range of motion, and just plain discomfort. I haven't had a ton of pain, I've just been itchy and uncomfortable since I came home. I do get tired very easily now, though. My stamina is nowhere near what it used to be. Skin irritation - The bandages were tight up against my armpit, so they irritated my skin. The adhesive from the bandages made me itchy, and I wasn't allowed to shower for over a week(!) after the surgery, so that didn't help at all. When I finally got the bandages off and drain removed, I used Dial antibacterial soap instead of my regular body wash (not directly on the incisions) thinking that the fragrance in my body wash would be irritating...bad call. I think the Dial irritated my skin even further, so I haven't used any kind of soap on my chest or armpits all week. Still itchy and red, but doesn't look infected. Just irritated and bothersome. I have a follow up with the surgeon tomorrow, and am hoping he can prescribe something to help. I also was waking up around 1-2 AM when the oxycodone wore off, and I wasn't in pain, but just was terribly itchy/uncomfortable. I don't know if it was something about the oxy wearing off that made me itchy. I was only taking the oxy at night because I am terrified of becoming dependent, so I just don't know. I wish I had asked my surgeon about antihistamines for the itching. I've been afraid to take any, but I think they might have helped. Range of motion - when I first came home, I couldn't move my left arm much at all. When I did (or even when I moved the other side too much) I'd get a shooting pain through my left shoulder blade. That went away after a few days. I still don't have full ROM, but I can lift my arm so that it goes straight out from my shoulder (perpendicular to my body) without pain - just tightness in my armpit. My surgeon said that there are exercises I can do to regain some ROM, but he doesn't want me to do them yet for fear of re-opening the cavity that is trying to heal. He showed me the exercise when I asked about Physical Therapy, but I want to actually go to PT, because I'm worried about lymphadema and there is a lymphadema specialist here in town. I'm going to push for that referral when I see him tomorrow. Discomfort - I've had a pins and needles kind of numbness in my left arm, shoulder, and armpit since the procedure. This doesn't seem to be getting better, and the surgeon said that it might not. For some people it goes away, and some are stuck with it for life. It doesn't hurt, but that whole area just feels strange. It doesn't affect my hand at all, or anything below my elbow. Now I'm starting to feel some bruising around my armpit and the front of my shoulder. I think it was probably there all along, so maybe some of the numbness is wearing off? Drain - the drain was gross and annoying, but not as bad as I expected. I only had one, and it came out after a week. My major annoyance with it was just that I wasn't allowed to shower as long as it was in. Oh, and the tape/adhesive/bandages were irritating my skin. For the first week, I slept on a bed wedge. My surgeon didn't say I had to, but I had such a hard time sitting up after the lumpectomy that I just felt safer that way. During the lumpectomy, they gave me a muscle relaxer that caused a ton of lactic acid build up in my abs and neck. I told the anesthesiologist before the ALND, and he said they wouldn't use that drug on me again. I didn't have the abdominal or neck pain this go around, so the wedge might not have been necessary. I still think it made life easier for me. My surgeon wanted me to hold a pillow under my armpit at all times (I even sleep with it there). They were supposed to give me a U shaped pillow at the hospital, but they said they didn't have any, so when I had my one week follow up, I got one at the surgery center. My surgeon said any small pillow would work, though. If you don't already have something like that from your last surgery, you might want to have something handy just in case they don't give you one. I think that's everything, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

I haven't started treatment yet, but I will say that so far for me, the first week or so after diagnosis was the worst. Now that most of the test results are back and we are starting to formulate a plan, I feel a little less scared. Developing a plan makes me feel like I have regained some small amount of control in my life, which makes me feel better. This site is a great source of support. I haven't participated much yet, but just reading through helps me feel like I'm not alone. I'm sorry you have to be here, but you've come to the right place.",

On the day of my surgery, I had to have the nuclear injection in my left breast, and a wire localization in my right. I was absolutely terrified about both of them, but especially the nuclear injection because the surgeon had warned me it had to be done without any anesthesia. He said sometimes the anesthesia interferes with the drainage of the injected material. They told me I could either get the cream at the pharmacy for about $30, or I could just get a tube of aspercreme and use that, because it was the same thing (4% lidocaine). After confirming that with the pharmacist, I opted for the aspercreme. I applied it at about 6 AM, and wrapped the breast in saran wrap as directed. When we were in the waiting room before the procedure, I was so scared that I was in tears and I had the shakes. They finally did it, and I was surprised that it really wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It hurt, but it was really not too bad. One of the four injections hurt worse than the others, and the radiologist said that's how it usually is. I actually think that the IV insertion later in the day hurt worse than the nuclear injection.",

I just took some pics of my fuzzy head, and looked back at the ones I've taken this year. Here are a few: This was May 3, 2017 - before chemo. This was the day I got my chemo-cut. My hair was past the middle of my back when I left the house that morning. I didn't love the cut, but I knew I'd only have it a few weeks. August 15, 2017. This was 9 days before my last chemo session. I was still bald, but sometime that week I noticed a little bit of fuzz coming back. My eyebrows and eyelashes were almost completely gone. (The cranky fuzzball in the picture is Mouse) October 13, 2017. My head was completely covered in white fuzz. There were a few spots where I could see the color coming back a little bit. I had no visible eyebrows at this point, but I did have a five o'clock shadow where they were trying to come back.  November 3. My hair is growing pretty fast, and has a lot more color than a few weeks ago. I have a feeling it would look a lot darker if I'd go get those white ends cut off, but I haven't yet. I took a picture of the back of my head, too, but it doesn't want to upload. No big deal, it looks like the back of an old man's head, anyway!  My eyelashes and most of my brows are back. I'm still not sure my hair is going to get back to pre-chemo color, but there is definitely progress.

My hair was crazy short and looked awful, but I was just over the whole thing. It's all about what is comfortable for you, but I think yours is long enough that it looks like a short haircut, not necessarily post-chemo hair. By half brows I mean that some of the hairs have grown in such a light color that they are invisible. To me it looks like my brows only go about halfway across my eyes. Lashes are fine, but I think my brows look strange. I wonder if I went and got them waxed if they would look any better? Ingerp, I got mine buzzed to about a quarter inch (probably less) once it really started coming out fast. It was such a relief at that point - I could not cope with the messiness of my hair falling out. Plus it was just heartbreaking to lose handfuls of it in the shower. The buzz cut honestly was a relief because it just got it over with. I didn't lose my brows & lashes until I was about 3/4 of the way through chemo. They held on through 4 dose-dense AC infusions, and the first 2 dose-dense taxols. They fell out sometime around taxol #3 - I don't remember exactly when. I do remember being very upset. I thought I was going to make it through without losing them, but no. That might have been harder for me than losing my hair, because without brows and lashes, I really didn't look like myself at all.  ",

The picture with my cat was between taxol #3 and 4, so I think it would be closest to where you are right now. I do take biotin. I have no idea if it is helping or not, but I take it anyway. I had some nail issues on chemo (lifting, ridges, Beau's lines, etc.), so I'm taking the biotin in hopes it will help my nails grow out faster. I'm having lots of skin issues during radiation, so I figure it may help with that, too. Flynn, I started the biotin after chemo was over. I think my MO would have been fine with it though. He put me on a B6/B12 supplement to help with my neuropathy. I love the pumpkin & santa hat idea. I realized last weekend that I had the perfect amount of hair to dress up as GI Jane for Halloween if I wanted to! I almost did it - I figured my radiation team would get a kick out of it. PeachyJeanne, I bet your hair starts growing faster. I felt like mine wasn't doing anything for quite a while, then it would suddenly progress. One of the radiation therapists commented on it this past Monday. She hadn't seen me in a week, and couldn't believe how much it had grown in that time. I feel like it grows in spurts!",

Those pics were right after a shower, and the humidity does make it curl a bit more. It was a little wavy pre-chemo, so I'm not sure it's all that different from before. I never had hair this short (except for a couple of weeks when I got my chemo-cut). I do think I'm going to keep it short, though. It is so much easier than long hair. I do wish I had my old color back. I have a lot more gray now than before chemo. Ingerp, my hair felt like it was taking forever to grow back, but once it really got started, it grew pretty fast. I've actually had two haircuts since January/February. My eyelashes and eyebrows were slower to grow back. They're all back, but are lighter than they were pre-chemo.

I was more tired after this one, and pretty much slept all weekend, but still not too bad. I still haven't had any of what I would call nausea, but my tummy did feel a little odd last weekend, so I took a compazine and that seemed to help. The worst part for me has been muscle pain. After infusions #2 and 3, I've had upper body muscle aches (chest, arms, neck, and back). It starts about 48 hours after the infusion, and around 21-24 hours after the neulasta shot. I'm blaming the neulasta. It only lasts for about 36 hours, so it isn't too bad, just annoying. My last AC is scheduled for next week, and then on to 4 DD taxol infusions! Edited to add that my nurses had trouble with my port and blood return at infusion #2. They finally got it to work by having me lie down with one arm above my head. No problems at #1 or #3. I think the problem was that I had slept on my side the night before #2, because I didn't before #1 or #3. I hate sleeping on my back, but am trying to do it for the night or two before each infusion.",

The major problems I experienced with Taxol were neuropathy (which actually started just prior to my first Taxol, so some of it was from the AC) in my hands and feet, acid reflux, and some nail issues. My thumbnails and one big toenail look pretty bad and have partially lifted. I had my last infusion 4 weeks ago this Thursday, and all of them seem to be getting better, though. I still have neuropathy, but it seems to be diminishing a bit. My oncologist said it can take a long time to go away completely. My reflux is gone, but I'll be starting radiation within the next week or so, and I expect that it will come back. My nails still don't look good, but they don't seem to be lifting anymore, and my oncologist examined them on Monday and said that the top part of my nails looks healthy, so hopefully the damaged part will just grow out. I only iced for the last two infusions, and if I had it to do over again, I'd ice my nails from the first one. I also lost most of my sense of taste during Taxol - I could only taste sweet for about a week after each infusion. The easy parts of Taxol for me were that there was no nausea, I wasn't as tired as on AC, and my hair started growing back about halfway through Taxol. Right now it is just white fuzz, but at least it's hair! I'm hoping it regains its color - I just turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, and I'm not ready to be all gray yet!",

Update on me: My last infusion was 8/24, and right now my head is covered in about a centimeter of fuzzy hair. It started off white, but after growing for a few weeks, the color is coming back. I'm going to try to get the white ends buzzed off in a couple of weeks. My brows started growing back just this week, and I look like I have a five o'clock shadow where the brows should be. I just noticed today that I have eyelashes! The neuropathy in my hands and feet is decreasing. There is still a little tingling, but it is definitely getting better.

I'm pretty sure the nurse told me I will get some anti-nausea meds just before the infusion, and they've already called in a prescription for me to take at home, too. I'm pretty sure I saw Biotene at Walmart last week. I don't do well with the sad looks, either. I'm okay most of the time, but the sad looks & I'm so sorries upset me. ",

I'd say at least 10 strands at a time when i just run my hands through it. Has your scalp been tender? Mine has been since Monday or Tuesday. When I saw my MO yesterday before my infusion, he said it was a little early for hair loss (in his experience, it usually comes out quickly around day 18), but since my scalp was already tender, he expected it to fall out quickly over the next 2-3 days. It is coming out much faster today than yesterday, so I expect that I will shed like crazy tomorrow and Sunday. I'm going wig shopping tomorrow, so that should be interesting. My MO's office just faxed a \"cranial prosthesis\" prescription so it will be dated before the purchase, and maybe I can get some reimbursement from insurance. So, update on me: The Neulasta worked REALLY well for me. My WBC count yesterday was actually high, at 15.4. I feel very fortunate after reading some of the stories on here. My SE from infusion #2 have been pretty much the same as with #1. No nausea, but I'm tired. I do seem to have the steroid rosy cheeks today. I don't know if I just didn't notice that last time, or if I didn't have it. Other than that, so far so good! I'm glad to be 50% done with AC, and 25% done overall!",

My sense of taste is back now (just 2 weeks after my final chemo), but the icky feeling has come back. I read somewhere that sometimes it takes a long time for the fast growing cells to get out of sync with growth/death cycles. I'm guessing that the cells that line the mouth are fast growing, have a short life, and are just in sync, so I just had a bunch of them die off over the last few days. Hopefully they will get staggered soon. My hair started growing back halfway through Taxol, and is still growing, but slowly. My head looks like a fuzzy peach. All of the new growth is white/gray...I just turned 40 last week, and before chemo I was only about 10% gray. I'm REALLY hoping the color comes back. I've read that sometimes it does. However, my eyebrows hung in there until during Taxol, then they fell out. I have no eyebrows right now, and I have no idea how long it will take for them to come back. I have read that people have the same problem with the eyebrows being in sync, so sometimes well after chemo the brows and lashes will all fall out together because they aren't staggered like they used to be. Eventually they should get out of sync, though.",

I wasn't too worried about it, because I didn't have any with AC. I know that he said (repeatedly) that nausea isn't usually as bad with taxol. That said, I've been using an ultra soft toothbrush (actually a children's toothbrush) and biotene toothpaste since I started chemo. Not taking any chances. The two times I got something that even remotely looked like mouth sores, I used baking soda + salt water rinse, and they were gone by the next day. I think this second round with taxol was easier than the first, probably because I knew what to expect. I took Advil every four hours starting Saturday morning (my infusion was Thursday), and the bone/joint pain wasn't nearly as bad as the first time. I still had some, but the Advil helped. I don't have any pain right now...expecting to be a little achy tonight, but again, I think Advil will take care of it. I got a summons for jury duty for the week of August 14th. I've got a request in to my MO, and I'm really hoping he'll write a letter to help me get a deferment. I don't feel awful, but I have trouble concentrating, and there's no way I can sit still long enough to be on a jury right now. If he doesn't write one, I guess I'll show up, and hope the judge is sympathetic. I'm hoping to defer to next year, when I'll be done with chemo and radiation.",

My genetic testing came back negative for all everything. When I look at all of that together, combined with the difficult recovery I'd expect from double mastectomy, I decided that bilateral lumpectomy + radiation is the best choice for me. I had already decided that if the genetic tests came back positive, I would go with the double mastectomy. My surgery (all of it - lumpectomy for DCIS in the right, as well as lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on the left) is scheduled for next Tuesday. Good luck with your decision making. I know it is a difficult choice.",

The nurse said chemo will start around 5 days after I get the port, so I think I'm looking at mid-May. I'm going to get my hair cut in advance, too. I've always had super long hair, and I just think it will be less traumatic if I cut in advance. And like someone said above, cutting it is one way of taking a little bit of control back. Plus, like ParakeetsRule said, it is a great chance to try something I wouldn't have otherwise! I actually wish I had done it before my surgeries, just because it felt so gross during recovery when I wasn't allowed to shower. Have you ladies been looking into wigs and scarves? I'm undecided about what to do there. I think I probably need to get a wig for when I feel like I need it, but it is SO hot here in the summer and I think scarves will be cooler. Right now I'm feeling scared, but relieved that I'm finally doing something about it.",

So, consult with surgeon, MUGA, chemo education with nurse, and consult with my MO's insurance specialist tomorrow. Busy day. Then PET scan on Tuesday and follow up with MO on Wednesday.

I also like to keep the a/c cranked up to keep the house cold and cut the humidity, so I imagine my head will get cold at night. I've spent the entire morning looking at wigs online. I'm going to stick with something short, since I've read that short wigs are easier to maintain. Here are the ones I like the best.

That's the only time I've had trouble. They said some ports can be positional, and that's why they had me lie down.

Be sure to get plain Claritin (not D), and start taking it before the neulasta shot. I took it the day of the neulasta shot and for 4-5 days afterward. Good luck to all of you getting started with chemo",

Some of their stores now offer free curbside pickup. You do your shopping online and choose a pickup time. They email you when your order is ready, and you go to pick it up. I just did it, and I didn't even have to get out of my car! They have an app you can download that lets you check in when you are on your way, and it uses your phone's GPS to calculate your arrival time. I used that, and almost as soon as I parked, the guy brought my order out, had me sign digitally, and loaded my car up. I'm sure you could have someone else pick up for you, as well. They didn't ask for ID or anything, just for the name on the order. I'm having some painful peeling under my breasts from radiation, so I can't wear a bra. The idea of grocery shopping bra-less just doesn't appeal to me, so a friend suggested this. He actually intended for me to do the order online, then he would go pick it up, but I wanted to do it myself. I LOVE that this removes the need to depend on anyone...that's such a big deal to me. I really wish this had been available when I was doing chemo - I would have used it the whole time. Every time I went grocery shopping, I worried about getting sick from germs on the carts, people sneezing/coughing around me, etc. I know other stores do it, too, but they are usually more expensive. Anyway, I hope this is helpful information to someone! https://grocery.walmart.com/ Aymerz33, what chemo regimen are you going to be on? I did dense dose AC + T this May-August, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I never had any nausea or vomiting. I did have some bone pain with taxol, which was manageable with advil. I also had some neuropathy in my hands and some nail issues, which are both clearing up. It really was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting.",
