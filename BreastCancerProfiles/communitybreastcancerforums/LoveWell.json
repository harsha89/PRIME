But I really don't know what to tell you about making her see this your way.  You're only 17, so you can't make the appointment by yourself, and the doctor's office can call your house and inform your mom about it without telling you.  All I can say is keep pushing her.  Give her statistics and facts and figures.  Do anything you can.  What's important is YOUR health and YOUR peace of mind. Sending you prayers and good thoughts.  Fingers crossed everything turns out okay :)",

But don't take the chance.  It's never worth it.  Demand a biopsy, no matter what your mom says.  If your doctor reccomends it, that's even more reason to get it.  Let's hope that both of us fall into the majority and get benign diagnoses :) ~ Love",
