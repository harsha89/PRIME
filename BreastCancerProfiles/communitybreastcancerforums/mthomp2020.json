Sorry you had to join us here.  This is a great group of women, and they'll help you every step of the way.",

I'm so sorry to hear you're having so much trouble with the treatments. Is Navelbine making your neuropathy worse? If so, I can't blame you for wanting to take a chemo break for a while. Having to live that way can really suck all the joy out of your life. A lot of people don't realize how debilitating some of these chemos can be. It seems as if our oncs don't want to admit that this can happen. When you have children relying on you, you fight tooth and nail to be there for them. I think sometimes it's the only thing that keeps people going when it gets bad. I've got neuropathy in my hands and feet, moreso in my hands. It's at grade 2 right now. I'm on Navelbine, and it's causing more numbness. I live alone during the week as my hubby travels on his job. Plus he's legally blind and can't drive, so I'm the taxi driver. If I let it get to the point that I couldn't walk or drive, I wouldn't be able to live in my home anymore, and would have to go into assisted living. Since my hands are really affected, I'd assume that if I couldn't walk, I'd also lose a lot of use of my hands. I'd be giving up my pets, who are my \"children\", my home, being able to do the needlework I love doing, basically my life. So if it starts going in that direction, I'll stop treatment. My onc is the type who seems to value quantity of quality of life. One of the nurses even told me to make sure to emphasize to him that ending up in a nursing home is unacceptable.",

My last scan report did say that, and the doc that read it said the prior one also showed it, though the doc that read the previous one didn't mention it. Seems I have a different doc read my scans each time! Of course, my onc didn't mention it. When I saw him after scans, I hadn't picked up my scan copies from the hospital yet, so I didn't know about it. However, when the nurse hooked me up for tx, she said they were drawing blood for a metabolic panel. They had done that 2 weeks ago because I get Zometa, and their policy is to do a metabolic every time you get Zometa to make sure your kidney function is OK before you get it. So it kind of raised a red flag for me. Well, my blood work was good, so no problems so far. According to what I read, fatty liver is often caught by blood work. I'm both hypertensive, though under control, and hypothyroid, which both can be causes of it. They also drew blood for a panel yesterday, even though I wasn't getting Zometa, so it looks like my doc is keeping a close eye on it. Thing is, he never says anything about having any concerns. The only way I knew about it was reading my scan report. I guess there's a possibility that I'm getting liver mets again. I don't mind him being positive, but on the other hand he never really tells me much of anything. When he \"goes over\" my scans with me, he just says they're good, or when I had mets show up in my hip, that I had \"some\" progression in my hip. Good thing I read the reports myself. If it is fatty liver and not mets, I wonder what can be done about it. You need a healthy liver to process the chemo, so I don't want to end up with liver disease on top of everything else. Apparently statins are of no help. I'm on meds for my BP and thyroid. 　 Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I just bought another Silique Comfort Lite on-line from Tru-Kare, and it was only $116 with shipping, which is even cheaper then TLC, which is still a good price in my opinion.l  I've also noticed that Amoena, I think, is selling them under their name at $300 plus.  I need to go to the fitter and get my freebie foob and bras.  I'll just use the foob for swimming.  I could probably get the form and bras that I really want from the fitter, but I'd have to pay for them up-front, and then apply to the insurance company myself for reimbursement for the difference.  By the time I've paid the mark-up the shop charges, I really wouldn't come out that much ahead compared to the on-line pricing, especially on the Comfort-Lite form.  The hassle just doesn't seem to be worth it.  There are only 2 \"approved\" providers in the area, and one of them only carries Classique forms and bras, so not a lot of choice there. It is pretty funny that a fitter tells a person who's an A that they need the weight or they'll develop posture/spine problems!  Until I got the Comfort-lite, my size 4 Airway light form would pull my bra down on that side so I would be a low-rider!  With the Silique, I don't have that problem all, plus I'm not getting wet under the form. So far, I haven't noticed any posture/back problems.  I ride my horse wearing a foam form, or none during the winter, and she certainly doesn't seem to notice the weight difference!  It's all about marketing/profit, isn't it?",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2010 02:44AM - edited Apr 23, 2010 02:49AM by mthomp2020 Otter, I'm using bra extenders for some of the same reasons.  I found them at Kohl's, and they carry all 3 sizes.  They're made by Maidenform.  I think they also carry them at Target.  They're 1 1/4\" and 1 1/2\"  with 2 hooks, and a 3-hook size.  Just measure your bra straps and see what size you'll need.  I only have 2-hook bras.  They really do help with the tightness problem.  I would think that anywhere they sell Maidenform bras would carry them.  They come 3 to a pack in white, nude and black, so you can cover all your color bases with one set. I still get puffy under my arm if I wear a bra all day, and it does get irritated, and I'm over 2 years out from surgery.  The mx bras were pretty uncomfortable for me under the arm.  I've never really been comfortable with the elastic anyway, and never liked bras.  I'm a large A/small B as well, so I know how you feel! Actually, I just got a couple of T-shirt bras from Nicola Jane in the UK, they're actually the Nicola Jane brand, and they're the only bras I've had so far that I don't want to rip off when I get home!  Plus they come with 2 sets of straps, one clear, and you can wear them as cross-over or I guess even as a halter bra.  And they're not super expensive.  One of the ones I ordered has a lace panel between the cups in the middle, so I can wear it with some lower tops.  They tend to run a little tight, so they recommended ordering up a band size and down a cup size.  Diagnosis: 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+",

Here's a website that has some information on different protocols for neuropathy that have been used with some success:  http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com.  They cite a study using Acetyl-L-Carnitine that showed very good results in cancer patients using Taxol or cisplatin.  I'll be using that next time I get a neuropathy inducing chemo. Also, Dana Farber has a specific protocol they have for peripheral neuropathy help which is very useful.  I was using 30 grams of L-Glutamine a day and 600 mg of B6.  Both may have helped with the pain aspect, as I didn't have problems with nerve pain, just joint pain.",

Good luck tomorrow.  I had my mastectomy in August.  I'm glad to say that I really didn't have any pain from it, just soreness under my arm from the lymph nodes.  Find out if they're going to use something called On-Q for the incision.  It's a little pump that feeds local anesthetic continuosly through a small catheter that runs along the incision.  Mine lasted for 60 hours.  I had absolutely no incision pain, and didn't need pain meds afterwards.  The Best Invention Ever!",

I'm quite relieved.  Navelbine has been very easy to tolerate so far, though it has made my hands and feet number.  Hopefully another 10 tx's will knock those nasty suckers down in my hip!  In the meantime, I'm more then happy to have an affair with the stable boy!

Navelbine can mess with your counts, but they can adjust the dose.  You have to watch out for constipation - it's not nicknamed Navelbind for nothing!  I had 2 dosage drops, then was fine after that. Gemzar can be especially hard on your platelets.  My counts stayed high enough that I never had a dose reduction or change of schedule, but many people do.  Over the last several months on it, I started having some problems with vomiting on the third and fourth day after tx, but no nausea at all.  My onc prescribed Regulan, and that really helped take care of the problem. Both cause hair thinning, but not total hair loss.  I had more thinning on Gemzar. Unfortunately, Gemzar stopped working, and I'm now on an old combo, CMF (cytoxan, methotrexate, 5FU), which is kicking my butt.  I had my first dose last Monday, and felt like crap on Tuesday, and have run a fever each day.  I've been able to eat breakfast and lunch, but by dinner the fever kicks in and I don't eat more then a few bites.  Ensure is my friend!  I go back today for them to check my blood counts to see if I need Neulasta.  Fortunately, tx is only every 3 weeks.  Hopefully, whichever one you choose will be gentle and easy on you.  Good luck!",

My insurance only pays for 2 a year, which I already have.  Plus they only cover about $22 if you buy a bra that isn't specifically covered.  I did find a regular Warner's bra on sale for $15 that gives really good coverage, and is comfortable and cute - and the strap doesn't hit my port.  So I'll be ordering some sew-in pockets. ",

I can understand Elizabeth wanting her privacy right now.  When I'm under the weather, I don't want people around, I just want to settle in and be quiet.  My husband is a road warrior, and he's out of town Monday thru Thursday, so I'm alone during the week.  I don't really mind, for the most part.  There's a friend of ours who works a few miles away from us, and he's always offering to stop by.  To be honest, I just don't feel like having to tidy everything up, including me!  We see them every weekend as it is.  So I totally get why KK wants her privacy.  I remember last time she posted, she said it took her over an hour to compose the post, so I understand why she's not posting right now.  It has to be very, very frustrating for her. ",

My right hip is pretty much covered with lesions, but so far they're all sclerotic, so the bone isn't being eaten away.  My L-3 is lytic, so I'm losing bone.  I'm also getting the hip radiated at the same time.  If they feel your hip is in danger of a fracture, I know they can put rods or pins in to stabilize it.  I know they do that pretty often with the head of the femure. Hopefully someone will be along with some experience in this. ",

Something you might look into is the pain pump that LuAnn had put in for her back pain - she has some very bad disk problems as well, and the pump has done a great job.  It releases pain meds directly to the affected area, rather then going through your system.  You could probably PM her and ask her about it.  I know she had a few issues initially with it, but they're straightened out, and it seems to really be working for her.",

I have scans again on Monday, so we'll see how that goes.  If you're now HER2+, Herceptin can be miraculous, so definitely insist on another biopsy.

I picked up a copy of the scans yesterday (which was my birthday, by the way).  I checked the bone scan first, and there was a large area around the right hip that I had no problem seeing.  There was also a small spot on a rib that was mentioned.  What a wonderful birthday present, huh?  The area involved is the socket.  I would think that, from the area involved, that I would be having a great deal of pain if it was mets.  Since last weekend, it hasn't bothered me since.  I own a horse and ride several days a week.  I rode last Friday.  When I dismount, I kick my feet out of the stirrups and drop to the ground.  I wonder if I could have done something when I did that.  The doc who read the bone scan suggested an MRI to get a better idea what's going on.  I don't see my onc until Monday.  To be honest, I even wonder if they read the report until the day of my appointment, since he's only at that office on Mondays, and my records are all kept at the office I go to.  My CT scans were fine, so nothing going on anywhere else.  The rib spot didn't show on the CT, which all my bone mets usually do.  There wasn't a mention on the CT scan report, it said no evidence of boney metastisis. Needless to say, I took an Ativan before I went to bed last night!  I'm afraid I won't be dancing with NED again for a while.  I'm really hoping the hip isn't mets, since it hasn't been bothering me.  I would think it would have been giving me a lot of trouble from the looks of it.  I'd like to get some more diagnostics done before we jump on the chemo/radiation bandwagon.  Now we'll just have to see on Monday what they tell me compared to what I read on the report.  I'll actually be seeing the NP, who actually gives me more info and answers my questions better then my onc.  I don't think I've ever talked to my onc more then 15 minutes, and that was my first appointment.  I think maybe I had 5 minutes, 10 tops, when he told me I was Stage IV.  Might be time to start looking for another onc who's more communicative.  Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I may just look into a new onc.  I did get the name of one who's supposed to be very good, and doesn't sugar-coat things.  He actually gave a lecture on living with stage IV breast cancer with our local American Cancer Society.  Biggest issue is his office is quite a bit further away, and if you have to go during rush hour, it can take forever to get there.  I drive myself to my appointments and don't take anyone with me.  I'll see what happens on Monday and come to some kind of decision. You guys are the best!  My hope is that I did do something when I hopped off my horse on Friday, since it started hurting the next day.  It feels just fine today, too, has since Monday.  Hey, on the plus side, I just turned 56, which means I'll no longer have to fill out the \"are you pregnant\" forms when I get my scans!  Yipee!",

Great news about the bone mets, not so great about the disc.  It seems to me that bone mets respond best to anti-hormonals rather then chemo.  If I end up having surgery for my spine met at some point, I'm definitely going to have them biopsy and test to see if I'm ER+ now.  Studies are showing that Herceptin can kick people to ER+ in about 30% of cases.  One more tool in the arsenal!",

I think she feels that since I'm unable to do the wrapping myself due to not being able to reach my foot because of the tumor on my spine, and having no one there during the week to help me, she'll try to use MLD only to bring the swelling down. I'm to do the MLD myself at home 3 times a day. I won't be able to do my foot and lower leg, just from the knee up. She's planning on doing 4 weeks of this. My insurance has only approved 12 visits. If it looks like it'll take more, we'll have to appeal, and possibly end up going a week without the therapy. I hope this does the job. She is LANA certified, and works through a hospital physical therapy department. It sort of worries me that I won't be wrapped, since that's supposed to keep your leg from swelling back up after the MLD. I guess I'll have to wait and see. I wasn't as swollen today as I sometimes am, and even so the leg was noticeably larger. She thinks we'll be able to bring it down with the therapy. At one point, my upper thigh was 2 inches larger then the other leg. I wonder if anyone else has had a therapist do MLD only with no wrapping, and if it worked for them. I'd hate to put in all this time and not have it take care of the swelling. Each session is 1 1/2 hours, so pretty time consuming.

The Herceptin/TDM1 would kill off the positive buggers, but not the non-positive ones, allowing the hormone-fed ones to grow. The only way to prove this would be to biopsy several lesions, and nobody really wants to do that. I was only 1% ER+ when initially tested. Some studies going on are showing that 1/3 of HER2+/ER- women become ER+ afer being treated with Herceptin. So it's possible that some hormone positive lesions could develop that aren't HER2+, but that's just my theory - I like to play doctor too! Since my liver was cleared of lesions, and my original bone mets healed, I've only had lesions show up in my right hip. They've been stable with Navelbine/herceptin, but they aren't healing either. If it wasn't too traumatic to get a sample from my hip socket, I'd ask for a biopsy, but that wouldn't be very pleasant. I wonder if the hip mets are ER+ now, and would respond to AI's. Bone mets seem to respond better to AI's then chemo.. Are you not allowed to add AI's to the trial chemo you're doing? It would be interesting to see if adding one has any affect on the one met or not. Then again, it might not even actually be a met but something else. You don't really know for sure unless they biopsied it. I'm glad they didn't kick you out of the trial yet. It's obvious it's working for you.",

They really don't look like they'd be too bulky. Lefty - I thought the same thing - thongs!  Maybe that's how someone got the idea? Jodee makes a camisole dickie as well.  Here's the link to it: http://www.jodee.com/   It's shown under accessories. It's only in lace, though, which isn't as versatile.  Doesn't look as comfortable, either.  You know, if you're reasonably handy with a sewing machine, it wouldn't be hard to trace a pattern off the dickie and make yourself some in different colors.  Then you could have quite a wardrobe of them!  I find so many tops that would work well with a camisole, but can't find the right color. ",

I did 6 tx of Taxol/Herceptin - my onc wanted to do at least 8.  I did them every 3 weeks instead of weekly.  I asked if going weekly would help lessen the cumulative neuropathy, and they told me it would still be about the same, so I stuck with the 3 week schedule.  My liver was stable on it, and my spine mets showed some healing, but the results weren't spetacular - who knows if it was the Taxol or Herceptin?  I wasn't going to allow myself to end up having a lot of problems with my hands.  As it is, I drop things a lot, and have problems picking up small items.  Each tx I was getting a little bit number.  I'm alone during the week, as my husband travels, so I'm not willing to end up with mobility problems, and not being able to take care of myself.  It's something you need to discuss with your dr.  Loss of mobility is a very serious side effect/issue, and should be avoided if possible.  Maybe it's time to switch to a different treatment. I've been doing a little research on the nueropathy issue.  Acetyl-L-Carnitine has shown some good results in actually healing and reversing the nerve damage that causes the neuropathy.  I'm going to talk to my onc and see about trying it when he puts me on one of the chemos that cause it.  Vitamin E has also been shown effective in decreasing the chance of getting neuropathy.  This can be such a debilitating side effect.  Personally, I'm not willing to become bed  or chair-bound in order to lengthen my life.  In my situation, I'd have to go into assisted living, and as an active 55 year old, I'm certainly not ready for a nursing home!  I'd have to give up way too much, including my furry friend in my avatar!  My husband is legally blind and can't drive, so getting around would be extremely difficult.  Our home is 2 stories with all the bedrooms/full baths on the 2nd floor, and garage/laundry in the basement.  So I couldn't live there. There are times when the treatment is worse then the disease itself.",

Aren't the animals wonderful at a time like this?  The dogs are such great companions - no questions, just lots of cuddling and loving.  And escaping to the barn to be with your horses - it's like an entirely different world, where you forget everything else.  Riding, and even just a long grooming session, really takes you out of yourself, and the rest of the world just disappears.  I can't ride anymore due to a spinal tumor, and my mare has arthritis, so grooming is about it for me!  I do enjoy the time I spend with her, though.  She certainly doesn't miss the riding part! Just hang in there.  You're still pretty new to all this.  Eventually things will settle down, and it will get better. ",

I even bought a new form on-line, and it worked out great.  Again, when I went to the fitter, I mentioned that I was interested in a climate control type form, as I do sweat a great deal.  She said \"you can just put a cover on it, and the pocket in the bra will also make it OK.  The form I ended up with was comfortable, but I would sweat right through the pocket, even during cold weather.  No way I could wear it without a cover in a regular bra, either.  Gets kind of annoying to have your chest damp all the time!  I now have a Silique Comfort Lite, and I no longer sweat through the bra.  Plus, it doesn't pull that side of the bra down like my old form did.  I'm only a large A, so I hate to think how far down the proth side would hang if I were larger!

Also, only bone met of 6 on my spine they mentioned was one that was lytic, and it's nearly healed as well, not a mention of the other ones, which were all sclerotic. Now I won't worry about every little twinge in my back for a while!  I sure wasn't expecting such great news.  My last scan after 4 Taxol/Herceptin tx showed my liver was stable, and the bones showed a little healing, so I was hoping for at least that.  It was the A/C before that that really worked on my liver.  I did another 2 Taxols/Herceptin after the previous scan, and just Herceptin for the last 2.  Apparently the Taxol just took a while to kick in. Since Taxol obviously worked for me, I guess I can go back and use it or another Taxane.  Just have to let some of the numbness clear up, which is why I stopped it in the first place.  For now, I get to cruise along on just the Herceptin.  Time to plan our trip to Vancouver Island and the Pacific Rim National Forest!

What I'm really looking forward to is when the new vaccine goes into trials.  If it's effective in humans, we might be able to avoid a lot of the chemos.  Wouldn't that be absolutely wonderful! ",

He's an IT consultant, and is out of town during the week, which works out well, as he then only needs transport to and from the airport. His company reimburses for cabs. He makes a very good living. Our house and car are paid off, and we don't have children, so we just have his retirement to worry about. He has an old friend from high school who had moved to New Jersey many years ago. He moved back to Cincinnati after hubby told him about my being stage IV. This guy is a drug user, and he's done time. That's one reason he moved to NJ. My husband pays him to drive him to and from the airport, as the company won't reimburse us for mileage but will for cab service. This guy needs the money, as he currently only works as a dishwasher for a small deli/restaurant. A lot of his income goes up his nose. He lives with a brother in a one room efficiency apt. He has another brother and a half sister that he lived with until they kicked him out. He tried to talk my hubby into moving into our house, but there's no way I'd want him here - I can't stand him, and he can't stand me. Even hubby couldn't take living with him. Now here's what I actually find really funny. We have a modest 4 bedroom home, with an inground pool and a hot tub. We also have satellite and HD TV. So not a hard place to live in. The other day, he told my husband he has a plan. When I die, he'd move in and take care of the house and our dog and cat during the week while hubby works. (Chances are the dog and cat would just be let out the door and end up dead because they were hit by a car, since that's what happened with his sister's dog). Plus someone would be there in the house so it wouldn't be empty. He'd \"take care\" of the pool and hot tub. And he would use the car, since it's just sitting there (his vehicle is on it's last leg), and drive him around on weekends when needed. He wouldn't be doing housework or yardwork. He's willing to do all this for just $2000 a month! When my hubby told me this, I just started laughing. He almost laughed in the guy's face too, and told him it wouldn't be hard to find someone who would gladly do this for nothing, in return for a a place to live and a car available. I always told hubby up front that this is why the guy moved back here, so he'd have a place to live, and he'd expect to be paid to live here. He's 57, and I think he considers my husband to be his retirement plan. If it weren't for the fact that the company won't reimburse us for mileage (it's 160 miles per week to and from the airport, plus up to 2 hours in the car each trip), I'd drive him myself and tell him to give this guy the boot. He is a complete loser. He was actually living in his van in NJ for several months before moving back here. He's got a lot of gall, I'll give him that! Rant over.  Quite the soap opera, isn't it?!

I really don't know why my husband still wants to associate with this guy.  In reality, he could have a regular cab take him back and forth.  If the company balks at paying the extra cash, then we could just pay the difference.  I'm really afraid that something could happen and my husband would end up in trouble with the law.  If he went to jail, he'd lose everything he's worked for all these years.  He says he knows the guy is using him, and he has at times started to distance himself from him, but then his friend starts to insinuate himself back into his life again.  There's some other things as well that I can't really discuss on a public board that keep him hanging with this guy.  Let's just say if they pass a medical marijuana bill in Ohio, I'll be relieved.  Other friends who know about all this keep telling him he needs to stay away from him. Oh, and to top it all off, there's a woman who he knows from high school/college who recently asked him if she \"had a chance\" after I'm gone!  I'd told him a long time ago that the minute she heard about me being stage IV, she thought she might have a chance to marry him.  He really can't stand being around her, so it is pretty funny.  She's 4'11\" and over 200 lbs, and she's really obnoxious (We've socialized with her and her ex-husband in the past, and I never did like her).  Before we married, she lectured me on taking good care of my husband.  This woman has been married 2 times, and the guy she's been living with won't marry her.  Mainly because he'd have to support her daughter and son-in-law and their 3 children.  Wow, Sincity - sounds like your brother!  I really don't know where my hubby finds these people!  He's got a couple of other friends that go back that far that are almost as bad.  He seems to be the only one of his group who made something of his life and isn't a loser.  I just wish he'd find some more normal friends. ",

Part of my problem is we live in a 2-story home, with bedrooms and full baths on the second floor, and laundry and garage in the basement.  I do worry sometimes that I won't be able to handle stairs at some point and will have to go live in assisted living.  Hubby can't drive due to vision, so I'm the sole driver, so I can't send him out to do shopping for me if I'm not feeling up to it.  His cooking leaves a lot to be desired, so I don't depend on him to help in that area.  He can't/won't read directions when cooking, so if he tries to do something, I have to tell him how and show him, so it's just easier to do it myself.  I think the biggest problem is that since my activity is so limited, I'm pretty bored at times.  I do needlework/beading/jewelry making, but you can only do so much of that before you get burnt out on it.  I really don't like to sit around and watch TV all day, and I can't seem to get interested in picking up a book and reading.  I'm hoping when the weather warms up in the spring I can at least get out and sit in the sun, maybe take the dog to a dog park.  When summer comes, we have a swimming pool and I plan on getting out in it almost every day and getting some exercise, which I think is part of the problem.  It's really hard going from being active to so in-active.  Compounding things, I have lymphadema in my right leg from hip radiation, so I have to be careful of that, and it does cause some of the hip pain at times.  A palliative/pain care doctor would be a good idea.  Just have to figure out how to locate one in my area.  My onc keeps wanting to throw narcotics at it, but they just don't work on the type of pain I have.  Percocet didn't even put a dent in it, and made me throw up. ",

I'd rather see the money go to the new findings in BC stem cell research and genetic causes.  That's where there will probably be real break-throughs, and some hope of a true cure.",

Did your onc stop it after a year, but used it again with chemo when you had progression?  Enquiring minds want to know!

I have spinal mets, but they've healed and were never advanced enough to keep me off my horse. Next to that, all kinds of needlework. I learned to knit when I was 12, and taught myself how to crochet. Great projects to bring along to chemo. I also do cross-stitch and needlepoint. My most recent thing has been beadweaving using seed beads. I've been making beaded Christmas ornament covers for the past 3 years and giving them as gifts. I usually do all my bead/needlework while watching TV - keeps me from falling asleep! I acquired a kitten this summer, so it has been a bit of a challenge! I can actually do my knitting/crocheting with him around, but for some reason when I'm beading, he loves to grab at the thread when it moves, so I have to ban him to the basement while I work on a project. I used to read quite a bit, but now seem to only do it on vacation, though I can usually finish 3 books while I'm away. When I'm at home, I tend to do my beadwork or needlework instead. I just really enjoy doing anything with my hands. I used to do a lot of sketching, mostly horses and animals, but I've gotten away from that over the years. Maybe I'll take it up again when I have more time - like that'll ever happen! I've always wanted to try my hand at painting with watercolors, so maybe I'll sign up for a class some time in the future. I agree, great topic!",

I gather that you're on Zometa.  Have you found it helps with bone pain?  So far, I haven't had any bone pain from the mets, just the nerve pain and some muscle pain from my right hip, which is nicely covered with lesions extending into the muscle.  So I've got to be careful not to strain the muscle - ask me how I know that!  If it wasn't for the nerve compression, I wouldn't know there was that bad an issue.",

Bestbird, I've had many hobbies over the years.  Most types of needlework, beading and beadweaving, piano, drawing - numb fingers make some of it difficult to do.  I currently do a great deal of knitting, and when I'm working on a project, it definitely helps.  You can only do so much of that in a day, though.  Whenever a new craft catches my interest, I teach myself how to do it.  Just running out of new things that interest me!  It probably would help to talk to someone, but it seems as if everyone wants to tell me about their issues and problems rather then listen to me.  When they're depressed, they call ME - maybe it makes them feel better when they compare their problems to mine!  I guess that's where a pro could help - you pay them to listen! I do try to find a good movie to watch, but comedies are my favorite, and there just doesn't seem to be that many good ones out there anymore.  We have satellite, so there's a good number to choose from, but sometimes I just can't find anything I want to watch.  A good comedy really makes me feel better and puts me in a good mood.  Whenever I see something that looks interesting, I record it for later.  That way, if it's not very good, I haven't wasted money on a rental and I can just delete it. I actually haven't been bursting into tears.  Just feel like I want to scream sometimes.  I made it through 4 years of this without feeling the need for an anti-depressant.  It really wasn't until I had to start dealing with the leg lymphedema on top of the hip pain that I started feeling like this.  We all have our breaking point, I guess. Hubby has been talking about maybe being able to work from home at times instead of going to the client site.  It would help just having someone here - it does get lonely here while he's out of town. ",

My last scans in November showed some increased activity in my hip, and a new lytic lesion on my L-3 has progressed as well. Oh well, I did get a good 1 1/2 year run out of Navelbine. Over the past couple of weeks, I've had some on again/off again pain in my hips, but nothing that Advil couldn't handle. However, last night I had some pretty serious pain, and nothing except Advil to handle it. I called and got an RX for percocet, as vicodan does squat for me. And the nurse did say I'll probably be starting rads next week - some Christmas present, huh?! To be honest, I've been really lucky so far and not had problems with my hip, but I knew it was coming sooner or later. If you saw my bone scan, you'd probably think \"wow, that must hurt!\" Plus, the liver mets haven't shown any signs of returning, so looks like the Herceptin is still working. After the rads, I'll be starting a different chemo, though what I don't know. I haven't even seen my onc since the scans, just the NP, who said we'd just continue with the same chemo for the moment. On the bright side, I'll have hair over the Christmas holiday! I already had a chemo appt. for Monday, so I guess I'll find out what's what, how many and where. Hey - I'll be getting my first tattoo, too! The problem area seems to be on the back of my pelvis, so hopefully they won't have to zap through anything important. 　 Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Pre-mastectomy, I wore camis and tanks with shelf bras more then I wore regular bras, just because they were so much more comfortable. After my single mastectomy, most of the camis were too low and would tend to gap on that side. If I were a bi-lat, it probably would be OK, but with one side it's an issue. So I'm always trying to find something that can work for me. I found a great cami at TJ Maxx. It's by Nouvelle Seamless Intimates. It's actually a pretty snug fitting cami, as it's supposed to be shapeware. It does give mild compression all over, so it smooths you out a bit, but I don't find it too tight at all. I pin one of my Amoena 126's into it. Just too lazy to try to sew a pocket in it! I only paid $10 for it. I'm a size 12, and usually wear a large in tops. I bought it in an XL, and it fits very well without being too tight. It's high enough that the concavity on my mast side isn't noticable, and it doesn't gap out when you bend over. I'd have to say this was a great find! Unfortuately, last time I went to TJ, they didn't have any in my size. However, I did some searching on-line and found someone on eBay that carries them, so I ordered a couple more of them. I saw them in white, black, gray, nude, and I think coral. The price wasn't as good, I think about $16-17, but still not that bad. I highly recommend these. They're great under a blouse or a lower cut knit shirt for a layered look.  If you have a TJ Maxx near you, check to see if they have any.  At that price, you can't lose! Even though I don't have lymphadema, I sometimes do get a little sore and puffy under my arm if I wear a bra all day. Even some of the other camis cause this because of the elastic band. For some reason, this cami doesn't bother me much at all, probably because there's more of an all-over compression. So it would probably be perfect for someone with truncal lymphadema.

Due to nerve pain in my right hip/leg, I do very little, as walking and standing is painful. I'm alone most the time except on weekends, as my husband travels as a consultant. I can't get out and walk my dog, or go shopping for fun - it's not fun if it hurts. So my big outings are grocery shopping once a week, and going out to dinner with friends on the weekend. Even when we go out, we always end up back at our house. I'm getting pretty tired of looking at these 4 walls all the time. Plus my blood pressure has been elevated, and my PCP doubled the dose, which was the smallest dose you can be on. It doesn't seemt to be doing the job. I'm afraid maybe the Herceptin might be affecting my heart now after almost 5 years on it. What anti-depressants seem to work well for you ladies? I certainly don't want to be a zombie, but I'd like to wake up in the morning without dreading getting through another day. I was doing really well until my back and hip problems started a year ago, and even then managed OK until this fall/winter. My scans in January were stable, so that's not the cause of feeling this way. Now I really need to do something to pull myself out of this funk and bring a little joy back into my life. Maybe just getting on something will help with my blood pressure, as stress is a big cause of raised blood pressure for me. I've been using a little Ativan, and it helps, but I need more help then that. I try to get out with friends or family once during the week, but they're busy with work and their own families, so it isn't that often - maybe once or twice a month. When I'm having a good time with people and hubby is with me, he sometimes cuts things short and shoos people out of the house or whisks me away early, even though I tell him I'm OK and having fun. A friend has noticed this as well. I think he worries about me overdoing it, as I have to clean the house (with his help) prior to getting together, since as I said before, we always end up back at our place.  Nobody else seems to want to entertain at their house anymore, so hubby always has them over here every weekend. Thanks for listening. I'd been hoping to avoid anti-depressants for a while longer, but it's time now to start on one. Hopefully se's aren't bad. I already feel I'm taking WAY too many pills a day as it is! If it makes me feel better and sleep better, it'll be worth it, though. 　 Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

My thinking is that the lytic lesions tend to be more painful, since bone is being destroyed at a faster rate then your body can counter-act.  Sclerotic lesions keep laying more bone down on the affected area, surrounding the cancerous bone tissue with more bone to control it.  I would think if it's happening in a joint, it could cause pain the same way arthritis does.  I hear you about not being able to do the things you love to do.  Right now I can't even take my dog for a walk, let alone ride my horse.  Hard to give up the riding after 30+ years.  But you just try to adjust to the new normal.  If the weather would warm up a bit, I could jump in my pool and enjoy that.  You do what you can do.  On the plus side, my knitting and jewelry making have been highly productive!  Looks like people will be getting lots of hand-made gifts this year!",

I did get a year of dancing with NED after finishing 6 Taxol txs, so no complaint there. No pain or symptoms from the mets, they just show up on the scans. My liver, which originally had been full of mets, is still clear. So onc starts me on Navelbine. I had 2 txs which lowered WBC to 2.0, plus some stomach/gastric issues. I skipped a week, and he put me on a lower dose. No stomach issues, but my hands/feet have gotten number, especially after the 3rd tx. They still had numbness from the Taxol I finished a year ago. So apparently neuropathy-causing chemos are NOT my friend! On top of that, my hair has been shedding non-stop now for a week. I think it's going a bit beyond \"thinning\"! At this rate, I'll be bald in another week. I wouldn't mind that so much if I could still use this drug, but it ain't going to happen. If three tx's have increased my numbness this much, there's no way I can do weekly tx's for several months. So on Monday I'm going to say \"no more Navelbine for me\", not to mention any other chemos that cause neuropathy, unless I get desperate. Definitely won't even consider Ixempra. Just ain't worth it if I can't wipe myself when I go to the bathroom! Wonder if my onc gets that? He seems to pride himself on how long he can keep people going, even if they're not particularly enjoying it. Okay, rant over. Just kind of bums me that I've pretty much cut down on the number of chemos I can do, since neuropathy is a common demoninator of many of them.

Another thing you could look into is Acetyl-L-Carnitine.  One of the big cancer centers, it might be M.D.Anderson, is currently doing a trial with it to see if can prevent/lessen neuropathy.  Do a search on it and see what comes up.  You could talk to your onc about trying this to see if it gives you any relief.  Plus, if you do end up going on Taxotere, it might help the neuropathy from getting worse.  Taxotere can definitely cause it, as it's one of the taxanes.  My onc is all gung-ho about Abraxane these days, and mentioned it as a possible chemo.  It's a formulation of Taxol, which caused my neuropathy.  When I said something about that, he replied \"the side effects go away in 4-6 weeks after you stop it\".  That may be true of the pain, but nerves do not grow back.  He seems to ingore the numbness issue, and only focuses on the pain aspect. ",

I had excellent results with 6 A/C treatments, liver mets either shrank or disappeared, areas on spine didn't change one way or the other, so I was hoping they were just old injury/possible arthritis. I just had my 5th Taxol/Herceptin tx today. I had CT scans before Christmas. I was told the results of the scans today, saw the NP rather then the onc, and he said he had good news/bad news. Liver was stable, no progression or decrease after 4 treatments. The spots on the spine did, however, shrink some. So, obviously they were mets. It's interesting that the A/C had no affect on them, but the Taxol/Herceptin did. Sounds like the Taxol/Herceptin isn't kicking butt on the liver like I'd hoped, but at least there's no progression. To top it all off, right before Christmas I found a lump in my remaining breast. It was clean back in May, with both mammo and MRI. So now I've got an appointment with my surgeon next Monday to have that checked out. So Happy New year! It would just be my luck to end up with another bc during chemo! I was really hoping that the current treatment would help get rid of some more of the smaller mets. The spots on the spine seem to be pretty small, so I would love to see those go away completely. But 4 treatments shrunk them just a little. My onc wanted to do 3 more Taxol tx's, but my finger numbness gets a little worse each time, and I might not be able to continue with it. At least I'm not having any kind of pain from my back, so if it stays stable that's something. Just a shame the A/C is so limited in how many times you can do it, as my results were great with it. I even had a 7 week break for surgery during A/C, and still ended up with more shrinkage with the last 2 treatments. I don't know why, but I had a feeling that the Taxol just wasn't going to be nearly as effective as the A/C for that. I'm only 7 months into this rollercoaster ride. Guess I'd better buckle my seatbelt, it's gonna be a bumpy ride! Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Fortunately, the pain isn't constant, but getting up out of a chair is a real challenge.  One can't stand on their feet all day.  Once I'm verticle and moving it gets better.  The percocet takes the edge off, and it definitely gave me a good night's sleep last night.  I'll ask about adding naproxen to the percocet, since that can really help with the inflamation.  The NSAIDs really seem to work much better for me. I think the area on my hip that's giving me trouble is where the muscle/ligament attach, so when I'm getting up or bending over, it pulls on it.  Fortunately, my mets in my hip are sclerotic, so the bone isn't being eaten away.  I'm sure the rads will help. Fitz, has adding the Tykerb helped your bone mets?  I'd like something to at least stop them.  I have a lytic lesion on L-3 that showed up on my August scans, and has gotten worse, and that's the one that's really of concern to me.  I haven't particularly noticed any issues with it yet, but that could change any time.  I'd like to stop that one in it's tracks before I've lost too much bone.  Maybe adding Carbo like Kona would do the job.  The Navelbine never really gave me any improvement, it kept things pretty stable though. The worse things about the rads will be having to go every day.  I have to drive myself, so I might not be able to take the pain med before going.  I'm not particularly anxious about it, I just want to get on with it and get it done.  Hey, at least I'll still have my hair for the holidays!",

I currently have mets in my right hip, but they're now decreasing, so the chemo is finally kicking them to the curb.  However, now I have a disc problem, probably from the fall, so I haven't attempted to ride at this time.  My onc still doesn't think it would be a problem, though. As long as you stick to nice quiet rides, you should be able to stay in the saddle!  As long your onc doesn't think it'll cause any harm, go for it!  Hopefully when you have your next scans, it'll show the lesions healed or healing. ",

They had Dr. Susan Love and another doctor on talking about BC. They both were all about how important it was to concentrate on prevention, no mention of cure. There are so many causes of bc, how in hell can you possibly prevent it? The only type you have a chance of preventing is BRCA1, and you have to take pretty drastic measures to do it, and even then there's still a very small chance you can still get bc, since you can't every little bit of breast tissue in a mastectomy. They said diet and exercise can help, but it's certainly no gaurantee, as women who have done everything right and lived very healthy lifestyles still develop bc, and some of them die from it. Personally, I think the \"cause\" of bc is largely environmental, and it's very difficult if not impossible to control that aspect. Unless you grow and raise your own food so you know exactly what goes into it, you can't control that aspect of it. The very air we breath contains carcinogens. So it's pretty much a crap-shoot who does and doesn't get bc. It really all boils down to the fact that the only real prevention of bc deaths is a cure. Something that can turn off the \"switch\" that triggers the cells to grow, which is currently being researched for several different cancers. I wish the money they're trying to raise for \"prevention\" for bc would instead go into finding cures for each type of bc, which would save a lot more lives then prevention. Plus it could keep women from having to go through the surgery, chemo and radiation they now have to endure in order to be \"cured\". Which of course, isn't really a true cure, as many of the women here can attest to. I periodically get calls from an organization that wants me to mail and give out material to women in my area about using diet, exercise and a healthy lifestyle as prevention for bc, and I don't waste my time talking to them, as I don't truly believe it's a preventative. I'd sooner use my time/money on a cure.",

The weird thing is, the insurance premiums were always paid a month in advance, so you would think we'd have a couple of weeks of coverage, so I'm not sure how they're getting around this.  In the letter, it says that in lieau of notice, they're paying 6 weeks of salary.  My husband was the one who spoke to the HR people.  They pretty much told him just to pay the bill and resubmit it for payment.  I'm going to need to call them on Monday and find out what all this is going to mean to me reagarding treatment.  We certainly can't afford to pay it out of pocket until Cobra kicks in - it would be over 5 figures just for Monday's visit.  I posted this under the insurance/finance forum as well, and someone there thought it was retroactive between the time you sign up and originally lost your insurance. Hopefully that's the case. Just thought I'd throw this out there in case anyone had any suggestions or ideas or experience with this.

I do have soft tissue involvement with my bone mets, which is what's causing pain.  The CT scan shows tumor growing into the soft tissue from the illiac crest.  There's also soft tissue involvement by my L-3 vertabrae as well.  The bone mets themselves don't hurt, though if you saw my bone scan, you'd wonder why they don't.  My right hip is riddled with sclerotic lesions, and my L-3 is badly damaged with a lytic lesion.  Zometa must be doing it's job! ",

I think it helps to give your body a break from chemo if at all possible.  Have you talked to your onc about taking a break?  You can always restart the chemo if anything pops up again.  The Herceptin can keep things at bay just by itself.  Maybe you could get a 2nd opinion.  Some oncs think you need to be on continuous chemo, some don't.  My onc prefers not to go through chemos too fast if he can help it.  In reality, the only way you know if you need to stay on chemo is to stop it for a while.",

Hope4us, arrogant is exactly who another poster here described him after she and her husband consulted with him.  Needless to say, she didn't go to him.  There never has been any discussions, just him telling me what's what.  If I didn't pick up my scan results and read them before my appointments, he probably wouldn't tell me what's really going on.  When I was initially diagnosed I was already stage IV.  When he told me the results of the scans, he said I had multiple liver lesions and \"a\" spot on my spine.  Shortly after that, I went and got copies of my scans.  Turns out I had 5-6 different areas on my spine, and one on each hip, as well as too many liver lesions to count.  He has never discussed chemo \"options\" - just what chemo we're doing next.  One patient told him she was getting tired and worn out from all the chemo and wanted to stop, and his answer was, \"I've kept you alive this long, haven't I?\"  Sometimes I think it's a big contest to see just how long he can keep people going.  He has quite the ego.  By the way, his wife had breast cancer right around the time I first started this - you'd think he'd have a little more insight. Another woman who sees him had a big wedding for her daughter planned this summer.  She had some progression, and needed to change chemos - she's triple negative.  He wanted to put her on Ixempra, and she didn't want to do that right before the wedding.  She had people coming to stay with her, and wanted to be able to enjoy it.  She ended up going to someone else and got a 2nd opinion.  She ended up on Gemzar, and it did keep her stable and she got to enjoy her daughter's wedding.  She's now on Ixempra, and it's really kicking her butt.  I'm sure she's glad she stuck to her guns, since it would have been tough for her to handle the wedding.",

Is there any way they would consider using Doxil instead?  It's a version of Adriamyacin that's easier on you. ",

      "Content": "mthomp2020 wrote: Sorry if this is a little long, but I just need to talk/vent, and you guys are great listeners, and understand. After the spine MRI I had a week ago Monday showed that my entire L-3 vertebrae is cancerous, yesterday my onc finally admitted that Navelbine isn't working anymore. My scans in November said as much, but he didn't want to do anything at that time for some reason - said he didn't want to run through chemos too fast. The MRI must of looked pretty scarey to the radiologist who read it, since she tried to reach my onc 15 minutes after I was done with the MRI. The office was closed for MLK day, and she spoke to the doctor who was on call. However, it doesn't look like my onc received any information about the call, and I don't even think he saw the results of the MRI. I saw the NP instead of him - 2nd time in a row I've seen him for scan results rather then my onc. He asked if anyone had contacted me about it, and no one did. Anywho, I'm seeing a rads onc on Thursday, and then probably 2 weeks worth of rads to my spine. Problem is, I'm not going to get any pain relief, as I don't have any bone pain (thank you, Zometa!). The big issue right now is the left nerve root that passes through the vertabrae is being compressed because the opening has narrowed because of the cancer - MRI said moderate to severe stensosis. I get nerve pain running down from my hip to my knee, and some muscle cramping. The radiation isn't going to do anything to relieve that. As a matter of fact, I suspect it might further irritate the nerve and cause the pain to worsen. The only thing that would help it is is surgery. The radiation is for damage control, as I already have 25% compression in the end plate, so probably some chance of a compression fracture - probably why the radiologist called my office so quickly. Hopefully the rad onc will have some answers for me. I really feel that my onc dropped the ball on this. When I question him, he just brushes it off. One time he told me he was the captain of the ship! Guess what - I own the boat, he works for me! He doesn't seem to like patients who ask questions or have an opinion. He just wants us to be good little sheeple who go along with whatever he says. Some of his patients love him, but not this one. I think it's time to go shopping for a new one. If we had jumped on this back in November, I wouldn't be having as much trouble with the nerve, and possibly the vertabrae wouldn't be as bad. Too late now, though. When the L-3 showed up on my August scans, I was definitely concerned, but he didn't seem to be. Guess I need to listen to my gut from now on. Looks like I'll be starting Gemzar, too.  He wanted to start me on it in 2 weeks, which would be right in the middle of the radiation.  I'd have one day when I would be doing both chemo and radiation.  Is that usual?  I thought they never did both at the same time.  Something else I'll have to ask the rad onc on Thursday, I guess.  Thanks for listening, guys.  Marsha Dx 5/21/2007, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

In late July it started to swell more, and August 3rd my onc ordered a dopplar to see if it was a blood clot. It wasn't, and they said just keep an eye on it. I flew out to Seattle and back a few days after the dopplar - 4 hours each way - and maybe a week later the swelling got worse. The skin has been red and tender in different areas as well as the leg being swollen, and at one point it got pretty hot. Last week I started a week of Keflex in case it was cellulitis. The heat is gone, but still swollen and sore. Back in January, I had 15 radiation tx's to my spine and upper wing of my right hip. Then in April I had 5 rad tx's to the area not radiated before on my hip. I started to put 2 and 2 together this weekend, and began thinking lymphadema. I put a call in to my onc office this morning (no tx this week), and sure enough, the nurse who looked over my chart was thinking the same thing, so they're referring me to a lymphadema clinic. On one hand, it's great not to have a blood clot, but lymphadema will be a major pain to deal with. I know wrapping is an important part of the treatment, and I can't reach my right foot due to the tumor on my spine, so I have no idea how I'm going to be able to handle that. My hubby is only home on the weekend, plus he's legally blind, so no help. He couldn't even put a compression sock on my foot properly. Fortunately, from what I've read, it's in the early stages, and with the therapy the swelling can be reversed. Unfortunately, it means compression garments from now on. As if there's not enough to deal with being stage IV!  Well, at least summer is pretty much over so heat won't be a big issue until next summer. I just want to get the swelling down so I can wear shoes again. Right now I have real trouble tying my shoe laces on my right foot because I can't bend down that far.

I know with me the numbness never went away after getting Taxol.  A year later I started on Navelbine, and it made the numbness a bit worse.  The L-Glutamine I think has slowed it down, though.",

I am hoping the lump is benign.  Sometimes it's pretty hard to find - I could feel it in the shower this morning, but couldn't find the darn thing at the doc's office!  Though I usually can feel it lying down, but not in the shower, so go figure!  One thing I did notice, I found it right after my flu shot (first one I've ever had) which I got the day after my last treatment, along with my Nuelasta.  The next day I was somewhat sore under that arm, and my lymph nodes seemed to be a bit swollen and hard.  They've been that way on again, off again since the shot.  So it could be something to do with that.  Guess it could be a really irritated lymph gland in the breast. Since I'm getting Taxol and Herceptin together, you can't really say which one is doing the most good.  If I have to drop the Taxol, I guess they might try just Herceptin and see what happens.  Herceptin can keep things stable, it just doesn't always shrink the tumors.  I know they can still use Tykerb, and Xeloda.  That combo seems to really help a lot of women.  I'm wondering if the receptors are different on my bone mets.  At this point, they aren't talking about doing a biopsy, and that's the only way to tell.  Guess I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.  There's a trial/study going on in Canada for testing if a chemo is actually working after one treatment.  They inject a radioactive dye that will attach itself to dying cancer cells, and then they do scans which show if there's any activity.  If there isn't, the chemo isn't working on the cancer.  If this becomes available soon, it'll save us so much hit and miss treatments and se's, and take the guess work out of treatment.  It will certainly save the insurance companies money!",

I'll keep my fingers crossed that your scans show improvement. ",

I was most interested in the Comfort-Lite, so size 5 would be about right from the sound of it.  I really want to get as light as I can, as it seems my form pulls the bra down lower on that side.  I adjust the straps as far up as I can, but if you shorten it too much, the bra pulls up.  So I do end up with the remaining breast higher then the form side - not a very attractive look!  As my post said, my insurance has very limited coverage as to the bra brands, so I would like to upgrade.  Unofortunately, the shop that's covered by my insurance wants you to pay the full price outright, and then I'd have to place a claim with the insurance company myself, which with an HMO can be a real PITA.  It doesn't seem worth the hassel to get the $22 back that they would cover.  The shop doesn't seem to want to be very helpful if you want anything besides the covered forms and bras.  When I was fitted for my first form, I asked about climate control forms, and they didn't seem too eager to look into it for me.  They pretty much wanted me to just take what they had in stock.  You're so lucky to have a shop and fitter that will work with you to try different products.  Good customer service is everything, isn't it?",

I'm interested in possibly getting a Silique form.  I'm not due for a new form for another year, plus my insurance covers a very limited number of brands, of which I'm sure Silique are not included.  Same thing with bras.  When I got my form, I had lost about 15 lbs. at that time.  Since then, I've managed to gain back what I lost, plus 10 more, and my current form is a bit smaller then my remaining brest, so I'd like to buy a new one. My current form is an Airway Softlite.  I was wondering how the Airways and Silique forms compare size-wise.  I know that Barbara has both brands, so she might be able to tell me if the sizing seems to be comparable or not.  My airway is a size 4, and it was a good match until my weight gain.  I don't think anyone in the greater Cincinnati area carries Silique, plus the shops charge considerably more for the forms then you can get them on-line, so I'm considering going the on-line route. My insurance only covers 2 providers that are in my area, and one of them only carries one line of forms/bras, Classique, so not a lot to chose from.  The other shop doesn't seem inclined to go out of their way to work with you.  The only covered bras through my insurance are Classique.  Anything else I'd have to pay full price for and try to get reimbursement from the insurance company myself, so something of a hastle.  Any feedback would be appreciated!

You might want to get in touch with your local American Cancer Association Wellness Community support organization.  They might be able to help you with contacts.  There's probably women who would be glad to give you feedback. What I would like to see addressed is the styling of mastectomy bras.  Most are styles that seem to date from the 50's, with horizontal seams and geared toward a lot of support.  They give you a very conical shape.  I'm 54, but I don't want to look like a grandmother.  I like a rounder, more natural look.  Also, I'm not large - between an A and B cup.  Currently, there's only a few mastectomy bras out there that are like that. ",

I did 6 Taxol treatments in combo with Herceptin.  Made for a long day!  1/2 hour for pre-meds, 1 1/2 for Herceptin, and 3 hours for the Taxol every 3 weeks.  Never had any reactions to any of it, thank God.  I was able to drive myself home afterwards with no problem.  The Benedryl doesn't make me the least bit sleepy, and the Decadron keeps me going all day!  I get both IV before the chemo.",

      "Content": "mthomp2020 wrote: Just wanted to again thank all you lovely women (especially Binney and kira) for all your wonderful advice, and to give an update. It's no surprise that MLD alone without wrapping did not provide lasting results with my leg lymphedema. So now I'm getting wrapped up past my knee. I'll be going 4 days a week, as the therapist doesn't want to wrap on chemo day - my leg swells that day quite a bit, and she doesn't want to make things worse by stimulating the fluid flow right after chemo. The results from the wrapping have been great. My foot looks normal, and my ankle is considerably better and more flexible/less painful. I can get my foot back in my shoes again when not wrapped. My knee has also improved quite a bit, the thigh is taking a bit longer but is improved. Hopefully after a couple more weeks I'll be able to get a compression garment to wear and I won't have to do my imitation of the Michelin Man. I won't be able to wrap myself due to back issues. After seeing what you have to do to wrap a leg, it's nearly impossible for anyone to do it by themselves even if you're limber, as my therapist admitted. You need a helper, and hubby travels, so night wrapping is a no-go. So we'll look into a night garment if she feels I need it to keep things under control. I'm also seeing a decrease in my hip pain when the swelling is down, so that's a big plus as well. Obviously the lymphedema has had an impact on the tumor in the muscle in my hip, so as the swelling decreases it's putting less pressure on that and really helping. Once again, thank you for your help. It's great having a place like this to come to vent and whine when needed!

Are you a bi-lat or uni?  I'm a uni, and it can make it a bit hard sometimes to find something that works when you still have one breast, since the form can pull the top down on that side.  Sounds like the micro-bead form might be just the ticket for me.  Foam forms can be hard to match, but the micro-beads sound like they would tend to drape more naturally.  Plus being able to swim in them would be a big plus.",
