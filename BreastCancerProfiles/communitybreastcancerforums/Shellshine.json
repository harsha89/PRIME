At first I was pissed that the media poured so many \"brave\" adjectives on her case while so many of the rest of us have to truly brave these decisions with lesser resources, but I got over it. She is a good ambassador in so many ways. It would have been nice for her or the media to acknowledge the huge numbers of those of us going through similar surgeries with fewer options. In  the end I'm pleased that this wonderful humanitarian publicized and paved the way for others, some still young girls who are years away from diagnosis, that you can experience  mastectomy and still be a strong and beautiful.",

Also, try a cool washcloth across the top of your chest for short term relief. Ask your doctor if you can take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like Motrin or Aleve but be careful about the dosing. Distraction helped me: window shopping, coffee with friends, watching a movie or reading. Helps during the day but not so useful at night. Glad you posted - was worrying about you!",

If you haven't already, read the \"Staging of Breast Cancer\" on this website (Home → Symptoms & Diagnosis → Your Diagnosis → Stages of Breast Cancer), especially the section on lymph nodes.   If you are the type of person who wants to read the results of clinical studies, the National Cancer Institute is a good resource. Type in \"breast cancer lymph nodes.\" Don't get overwhelmed if it's too much information, you can take your time and go back to read study results in smaller doses. I'm wondering if it is possible to do a \"staged\" lymph node dissection process: remove nodes that are closest to the sentinal nodes, have them evaluated by pathology while you are still in the procedure, then stop when they are negative. I don't know the anatomy of breast lymph node sequence, but it's worth it to ask.  So glad you are feeling better and that you can wait until after chemo to consider the right decision for you. Please let us know how you are doing.",

I stayed at my mom's the first few days because my husband is disabled and it would have been hard for him to take care of us both. My son, who lives with us summers and winter break, is away at school. My family wouldn't let me lift a finger so I healed pretty fast. I bought a Nutri-Bullet and lots of fresh fruits, veggies and other whole foods the day prior to surgery so my nutrition was good. I, too, was off narcotics pretty fast and now at 2 weeks post-op only need NSAID, tylenol and Robaxin, a muscle relaxer - one dose each at bedtime. Don't really need anything during the day. I started off with gentle walks a week post-op, and slowly increased each day. Is it my imagination, or is the world more beautiful? The ocean, sky and nature as a  whole soothe my spirit. I feel so much gratitude for all the blessings that I receive every day. I was laid off as a Nurse Practitioner last summer due to budget cuts, so am back in grad school while on severance pay to expand my scope of practice from Research to Adult and Pediatrics - want to work in Hospice Care. Drains came out 10 days post-op and I returned back to classes next day. Getting rid of the drains really marked a milestone in getting back into the swing of life. I rented a recliner but actually feel better sleeping on our couch with lots of pillows - but looking forward to moving back to our bed with my DH. I drove after the first week - avoiding high peak traffic and take the smoothest routes - really enjoy getting out and about, having coffee with friends, hitting the libraries, window shopping, studying. My life now is so much more relaxed after 20 years as a working mom. I'll need to find a job when my severence pay ends in June, but after DCIS diagnosis a few weeks ago, am much more relaxed and enjoying lifes's blessings. One area I would like to explore with other women is acceptance of altered body image. My PS inflated my expanders with 200 ccs during BMX surgery, so my silhouette isn't remarkably altered. Aside from the annoying irritation of TE's, I don't feel some of the devastating emotions that I read about in other posts. If I could do one good thing as a result of this, it would be to encourage other women to feel better about their body image after MX. I feel really good about how I look. I feel so rested! It will be nice to get the TEs out and implants done, and having perkier breasts with cute 3D tattoos. At age 57 I have had my young beauty and now enjoy my mature beauty, style and joie de vivre  tremendously.    ",
