After today's treatment I thought, \"Since I can't see the rays they could be just moving the machines around and not doing anything.\" lol! They gave me aloe vera and a basic moisturizer. It sounds like I should be applying them a bit more liberally. Joytxs - I have had trouble sleeping for the first time ever. Without fail, the night before an appointment I'm up all night. I was off work for my surgeries and chemo. I am returning to work this Thursday. Hopefully I could get back on schedule, otherwise there's going to be some long workdays!",

With chemo I went from a possible 40% recurrence in 10 years down to 12%. Before I got the results I thought if it was borderline and I had to make a decision on whether to do chemo, I was leaning towards chemo. I thought I'm going through all this now, just get it over with and hope for a healthy future. That's great if Medicare pays for your test. It's definitely a big decision to make. WORK!! I returned to work full time the week I started radiation. The cancer center is in the opposite direction of my work and my appointment times at 7:15 am, so by 1pm I was wiped out. I worked an additional full week then I went on half days. So much better! I had no problem getting a disability note which was shocking. The RO nurses actually brought it up to me. Thanks everyone for posting your experiences. It's so helpful. My skin is dark and red now, and I'm am so swollen! Three more boosts and I'm done!",

Unprocessed food, organic, little or no meat. However...since my diagnosis I've never eaten so poorly. I'll get back to proper nutrition although it's difficult on days I'm not feeling well.

I had horrible diarrhea on days 16-18 after my first AC. This round, yesterday, on day 15, my stomach is a bit unsettled. (I'm on day 16) I hope all of you ladies are having a good day today!!",
