      "Content": "Rae9880 wrote: Hello everyone. I'm 37 years old and I started this world wind of worry on October 26th. I went in for a Breast MRI for a screening due to being high risk patient because of family history. My MRI report reads: History: Screening for high-risk patient. Comparison: Correlation is made with mammogram April 12th Protocol: Multi-parametric MR imaging of both breasts are obtained on a 3 Tesla magnet using T1 and T 2 weighting along with a diffusion sequence and a dynamic contrast enhanced sequence. Findings: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense. Parenchyma pattern is category C. There is one small irregular enhancing lesion in the upper aspect of the right breast just medial to the mid point. This lesion measures approximately 7.4 x 7.5 x 4 mm. It has irregular borders and demonstrates moderately intense enhancement with rapid washout kinetics. This lesion is not readily apparent on the April mammogram but is indeterminate and I recommend further evaluation initially with repeat mammogram and diagnostic cone views in this area. I would also recommend ultrasound to see if this can be characterized and also provide localization for biopsy if it should prove to be suspicious. The lesion at the junction of the medial and posterior to the nipple and approximately 3 cm from the medial skin surface, three o'clock position. There is one lesion in the medial aspect of the left breast also seen. This is more tubular in shape but it does demonstrate enhancement and mostly smooth borders. This lesion measures 16.7 mm anterior to posterior and has thickness of 6.9 x 5.7 mm. The enhancement Kinect are less suspicious but does remain indeterminate. This area also was not seen mammographically and may have been obscured by surrounding fibroglandular density. This also should be evaluated at the time the patient returns for the additional imaging. This area in the left breast within the middle third 6.2 cm back from the nipple just in the midline 2.5 cm from the medial skin surface approximately ten o'clock position. BIRADS 0 November 11th I had a biopsy on my left breast only because the ultrasound tech in with the radiologists couldn't find the lesion in the right breast even after another technician came in and found the lesion for her. When the doctor came in he acted as if he almost didn't want to do the biopsy. He explained that because it was hard to find the lesion on the right side was hard to see we would revisit that breast in 6 months and looked at the ultrasound of the left breast and said it looks benign but it does have some flow so I'll biopsy it. I don't know what to think. My husband and I felt a lump under my left arm before all this happened but I thought it was probably from shaving but then I received a concerning MRI report but the radiologists who did my biopsy didn't seem too concerned so my emotions are a little bipolar helpðŸ˜£.

I'm just anxious hopefully I'll hear something soon. My coworker had a biopsy on Monday and was diagnosed by Wednesday. Same doctor and facility. I'm trying not to eat myself to death. Thanks for being encouraging.",
