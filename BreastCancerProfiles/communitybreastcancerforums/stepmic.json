I was 54 at the time and my oldest son was just graduating from university. So this Thursday is my five year cancer free anniversary. I didn't have chemo as my oncotype scores were low (I live in Canada and had to pay for the test) nor did I need radiation. As I think back to five years ago, I felt such anxiety and sadness over my surgery. My counsellor suggested that I brace myself as I walked into the fire the morning of my surgery knowing that I would walk out the other side and that made me feel strong. It was a very dark emotional time for me and I cried a lot after the surgery. I liked my breasts... I just couldn't imagine losing one but I knew I had to get the cancer out of my body. I was fortunate and healed well without infection. I hated the drains and they took forever to get out. I hated the way I looked. But I got used to it... I became the camisole queen as I was very self conscious when I leaned over. I had always worn clothes that had a bit of a lower neckline so I had to change the way I shopped and dressed. I found that hard. I went back to work teaching in late August. I was so tired all fall but wanted so much to be \"normal\" again. I didn't take into account the emotional rollercoaster that I had been on since my diagnosis in mid-April. I should have taken more time off to heal emotionally as I had the sick time. So be good to yourselves and if you can, take lots of time for you. I had a tissue expander put in in May of 2013 and a reduction of my right breast and implant surgery in January of 2014. I was a 38F before my mastectomy, now I am a 38D. I love my new girls! I had a nipple reconstructed in January of 2015. I have been taking Arimidex since August, 2012 and hope my five years won't be extended when I see my oncologist in August. I haven't had any really bad side effects. When I think back and I am reflective now due to the five year anniversary this week, I think of that time as the darkest time in my life. I survived though and now I hardly ever think of my cancer. I swim a lot and do yoga. I am active and there is really nothing that has changed except I find that I appreciate my health and joy a lot more than I used to. I turn 60 this November and I feel great. I write this today to encourage you all and know that you have the strength to get through this tough time. I hope and pray that in five years you can look back like me and feel strong and healthy. ♥♥♥ K",

I have seen her regularly since then and timed my appointments to be after milestone tests or appointments. This helped me in a huge way to deal with my dx, UMX, waiting for results, family issues, everything that stressed me. It was covered through my EAP at work. I highly recommend getting therapy if you can to help you through this huge life changing event.",
