I managed to make it through the 12 week cycle of taxol with minimal side effects. I feel so lucky that I only experienced fatigue and some other minor symptoms. I have no complaints as I know many of you had a rough time. I am coming up on four weeks PFC and have had little to no hair regrowth. Curious about those of you who only did taxol and how much time on the average it took for you to see some regrowth. I did not loose all my hair, more left in the back than anywhere. I definitely have the beetle juice look going on (lol) and it is not pretty. Your feedback would be appreciated. Thinking about you all as we take this journey together.",
