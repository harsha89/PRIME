I did have body aches and flu like symptoms on the 2nd day. Today was a great day as i did my first 5K run/walk today.  I guess my question is , has anyone expierenced not loosing their hair. I keep reading that most people start sheding or loosing around 2-3 weeks after they start.  So far i have not noticed anything  with ny hair shedding.  I guess if i am going to  start it will start sometime next week or perhaps after my second round of chemo.  I guess the anticipation of it all is driving me crazy. Also is it common for most people to have min side affects like me?  Dx 3/22/2012, ILC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I know i have prob asked about the hair lost thing on this board before but i just wondered if their was anyone who did nit loose it at all.  I guess the hair loss worries me the most. All my other symotoms like the body aches or flu like symptoms  i pretty much dealt with well. It is this next one with the hair loss that im not sure how to handle. Yes i know it will grow back, but im still trying to deal with or process the emotions behind it coming out. Again thsnk you fir your response. I was beginning to think no one would give me a response, prob since ive asked before. Anyway, have a great day. ",

I have already brought 3 wigs and i love how each gives me a differnent look. However there is nothing like your own hair. Right now i have own hair braided so that i can wear the wigs.  Wow so i guess i will see where i am around day 17.  Is it normal to loose all body hair once it starts?  I hoe not to loose my eyebrows. That would have me in my opinion looking crazy. lol Once the hair loss starts what was the first thing you noticed?  Is the scalp tingling or aching a normal sign when it begins to shed? Im just wondering when mines does start becase i refuse to cut it right now will i just wake up one day and there is hair on the pillow or will i run my fingers thru my hair and have hair in my hands.  Oh boy... this is too much. Im so stressing myself out over this. Thanks again everyone for responding. ",

I was given claritain before the shot.So far I can happily say i have not had any side affects. Thank you Jesus.   I do not know what is to come but i will say i am a bit anxious/nervous about it. I do not think i am mentally prepared for hair loss yet. Ive never expierenced fatigue so that will be a new one for me also.  How was everyone else feeling after treatment #1? When did most of the side affects begin? ",
