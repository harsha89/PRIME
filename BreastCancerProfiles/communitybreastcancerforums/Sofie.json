Have to agree that this loss of taste beats losing hair big time. She would find one thing edible then another 2 or 3 occassions later, she would hate it. We are now at the point where she doesn't find anything appealing to eat, she's lost her desire to eat. I'm at a loss trying to get food into her, especially protein. She's gotten depressed and wants to give up chemo. We have 2 AC treatments left. Help... Counting the days, Sofie",
