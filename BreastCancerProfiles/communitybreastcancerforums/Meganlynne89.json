She had a lumpectomy, 36 rounds of radiation, and is now on tomoxifin. She was 50 when initially diagnosed. Cancer plays a really huge role in my family anyway. I've been told to get the genetic testing. I take after my maternal side in many ways as far as physical traits and health risks. I currently take spironolactone as an androgen blocker because I have high testosterone. I have read studies that state spironolactone is not to be taken in women with a firs time degree history of breast cancer and it also makes breast tissue more dense.
