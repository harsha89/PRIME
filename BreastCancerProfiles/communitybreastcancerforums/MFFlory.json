I went to my family dr who told me that it was probably nothing and just to continue to watch it. 6 mths later I go back because it's is larger. My Dr once again tells me it's probably nothing but let's get an ultrasound. My ultrasound come back with nothing to show. They couldn't find anything even though you can clearly feel the lump. My Dr then refers me to a breast surgeon who spent all of 5 minutes feeling the lump and then proceeds to tell me that once again it is probably nothing and to just go about my merry way. Fast forward another 6 mths and I go to my gynecologist to have my check up and she also orders an ultra sound for the lump in my left breast. Again the ultrasound comes up with nothing and once again I am told that it is probably nothing. 3 more mths pass and I have to go back to my gynecologist for another pap due to insufficient cells collected the first time only this time I have a large dimple I'm my right breast that needs to be examined. I have tried everything from going braless as much as I can due to having very large breasts to changing my bras and nothing made this dimple go away. Once again she orders an ultrasound and once again it comes back with nothing. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Do I just let it go and trust my drs that there is in fact nothing even though they haven't been able to give me a 100% sure answer? Or do I keep pushing? I'm so lost on what to do. I am starting to drive myself crazy. PLEASE HELP! Log in to post a reply",
