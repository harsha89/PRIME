Remember sound waves are being used to estimate the dimensions. Magnetic resonance imaging is a different technology, which results in different sizings (not always accurate again). Like someone has already said, you won't find out the true size and character of the tumour until it has been removed and tested. It is however quite typical that during this journey we try to make sense of what is happening; with each piece of additional information. The mind is quite literally trying to find homeostasis so that we can live lives that aren't in perpetual trauma. We also start to exhibit survivor characteristics by rationalising our experiences ... it's a good thing to do, just remember that the journey is somewhat unpredictable and getting used to that is in fact the wave that we ride. Good luck with the next stage and wishing you healing and gentleness.",
