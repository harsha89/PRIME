      "Content": "Oct 21, 2008 03:25AM - edited Oct 21, 2008 03:37AM by 3rdSister I am so glad I found this thread!  When I was first diagnosed and searched this website, I was very discouraged and was doubting my treatment decisions.  I decided to give it another go and found this thread.  Thanks!  I have been an RN since 1981 and an NNP since 1997.  I have worked in many areas (med/surg, level 1-3 nurseries, mother-baby, peds, school nursing) and in many roles (staff nurse, management, nnp, instructor).  Also, put in 6 years of full time nights plus call as an NNP.  I am currently teaching at a community college.  I take my students to a cardiac floor in the fall and to pediatric rehab in the spring.  Work has been great about all this!  My biggest frustration right now is scheduling my radiation.  They think nothing of changing my appointment times, even though it has a big impact on my schedule.  They seem to have \"emergencies\" all the time!  Won't matter in a couple of weeks as someone will take over my clinical groups in November and finish out the semester for me.  I just have to hang in there.  I do not tell anyone I am an RN either as it is assumed I know everything.  My husband announced it the day of my lumpectomy, but I quickly announced that surgery/oncology was not my field.  Seemed to go OK from there.  There are some great posts here.  I will try and get back soon. ",
