It just seems to keep changing for the worse. My mammogram only showed calcifications. I had my biopsy on my 44th birthday (August 22). Two days later I had breast cancer. I was told it was dcis, that surgery was all I needed, hormone therapy was optional...every medical professional except for my primary care physician thought I was crazy for wanting a bilateral mastectomy. I really didn't like my surgeon and the plastic surgeon he worked with only did implants so I switched hospital systems. That cost me some time plus we already had a trip to Disney world planned for Halloween. By the time I switched doctors/ plastic surgeons and they synchronize their schedules December 6th was my surgery date. I has a double skin sparring mastectomy with diep flap reconstruction. Unfortunately what they found was more than just dcis. I was upgraded from stage 0 to stage 1a. They found an invasive 1.2 cm tumor. It was er/pr+. That made hormone therapy necessary but not necessarily chemo. Well my oncodx came back at 31. So off to chemo I go. I have two little kids 4 and 5. I'm most worried about how this will affect them. I'm trying to keep my hair with cold caps but even the surgery and recovery has upended their lives. My biggest fear is dying before they are grown. Before surgery I had this reoccurring dream of my daughter asking Santa to bring her mommy back for Christmas. Trust me, I spent a lot of time bursting into tears. I am healing fairly well from surgery. I do still have an open wound on my abdomen and last week they has to put a drain in because of a pocket of liquid in my belly. My plastic surgeon says he is fine with me starting chemo on schedule. I am scheduled for four rounds of TC three weeks apart. Everything about it scares me. I have very dry sensitive skin, the thought of it getting more uncomfortable than it already is terrifies me. I was super sick with both pregnancies, I lost 40 pounds with one and 20 with the other. In fact, with my miscarriage I knew something was wrong because I wasn't sick as a dog. I hate having an upset stomach more than anything else. I already have very slow growing hair and had to grow back from bald due to a benign brain tumor. I look ok bald but there is a stage when I have about an inch of hair and it all sticks straight out in every direction that is awful. I am also bipolar 2 and have serious anxiety issues. Ugh, I'm a hot mess. Every day brings new panic attacks. The thought of letting them pump poison into my veins makes me want to crawl out of my skin.",
