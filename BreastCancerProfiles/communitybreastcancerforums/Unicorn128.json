I was diag with DCIS in August. I had just lost my mother in March due to Lung cancer. I saw her go through radiation and I just could not see me doing that.  I just started physical therapy for my arms and muscles. It has been very slow for me is this unusual. I know everyone is different. I get sad and scared. The DCIS was detected early which was good news. 2 weeks after my surgery on the 28th of Sept my daughter had to have surgery to have a ovary and fallopian tube removed it twisted and died off. She was in extreme pain. The 29th she turned 16, and missed her homecoming dance. She was a trooper. Poor husband and father to had to take care of us. It is almost December and I am not back to work yet and when will I know. I never thought I would join a chat room but I feel I can get some help emotionally and spiritually. This is a life changing event and I am trying to deal with this. I have a positive attiude but sometimes I just feel abandoned. Thanks for your thoughts and wishes.
