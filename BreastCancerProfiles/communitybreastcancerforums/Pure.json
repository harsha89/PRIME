It doesn't show fermur though. I was also told Pet Scan not as reliable as the MRI. Anyway I don't want to give birth to my baby and be wheeled into scans. I am having no pain-feel good and the first 2 test were cleans sooo I am tempted to ask to not have them or I was thinking asking to have them when chemo was over. Am I being crazy? The thought of having a child, being so happy with the birth, sharing that experience,  and then having scans and  sitting in total and utter fear makes me want to throw up-literally.

My husband made me write this down My mri and CT scan were clear. My brain would hurt if I had brain mets I only have to over come 1 ore test-the bone mets test and considering I am pregnant I would probably have pain. Prior to seeing this ass I felt good, confident and my real doc was really happy with my progress. I know atleast 10-15 women with similar or worse diagnosis doing great I am getting top notch care I get to get Zometa So, I have written this down and put in my planner and will pull when I get scared. I can't WAIT to the day when I don't have to see all these doctors. I am dreading seeing the rads oncologist-maybe I will send hm a note prior to coming that if he can't say something posititve don't say it.",

Each day I have been suffering through what can only be discribed as mini panic attacks that seem to last 5 of 6 hours a day.I went into my oncologist and she said, of course it was stress & anxiety. I started therapy and a anti anxiety medicine called Celerix... I am feeling better...The depression and anxiety has lifted. I am not crying everyday, able to leave the house, feeling pretty much the same old me..I HATE being on all the meds but it's amazing how I go DAYS now not thinking about my cancer...Therapy is really helping as well. Anyway i am still getting this thing with my heart/breathing...Not everyday though. I can go two days and have nothing and then boom I will have a day where my heart feels like it's beating really hard, chest feels slightly tight and I take deep breathes to catch my breathe. The good thing is I am not having it everyday like before but still getting it! I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced this before. Thank you for your help. Blessings!

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2010 06:37PM Pure wrote: Should Oncologists Test for CYP2D6 Before Prescribing Tamoxifen? Zosia Chustecka   February 9, 2009 - In clinical practice, there is a \"hesitation\" about testing for CYP2D6 before prescribing tamoxifen to reduce the risk for breast cancer recurrence, observes an editorial published online February 1 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Tamoxifen is widely used to prevent breast cancer recurrence in women with hormone-positive disease. However, it is not the drug itself that exerts this beneficial effect, but an active metabolite, and there is a genetically determined variation in the ability to metabolize tamoxifen. This variation occurs on the CYP2D6 gene, and testing for an inherited deficiency in this gene identifies women who are poor metabolizers of tamoxifen and who appear to derive less benefit from the protection that the drug offers against breast cancer recurrence. Commercial tests for CYP2D6 genotyping are available, and some experts have argued that they should be used in clinical practice, particularly in the case of postmenopausal women, where there is an alternative therapy to tamoxifen that can be offered (i.e., aromatase inhibitors). But the editorial states that \"routine use should await more reliable evidence from well-designed studies.\" Currently, there remains an \"uncertaincy\" about such testing because it is based on \"incomplete biological evidence and inconsistent epidemiologic evidence,\" write editorialists Timothy Lash, MD, PhD, and Carol Rosenberg, MD, from Boston University School of Health in Massachusetts. They also point out that there is no current consensus guideline that recommends CYP2D6 genotyping in patients prescribed tamoxifen. One Exception - Other Drugs That Affect Metabolism Among all of this uncertainly, however, there is one situation in which a practice recommendation can be made, the editorialists explain. They urge physicians to \"to be cautious about prescribing comedication that might interact with tamoxifen via CYP2D6 inhibition.\" Where there are therapeutically similar drugs available, it is \"prudent to prescribe medications that inhibit CYP2D6 very little,\" they add. One example of this is the drugs that are often coprescribed in this patient population for depression and/or vasomotor symptoms - paroxetine and fluoxetine have been reported to interfere with CYP2D6, whereas citalopram and venlafaxine have not. New data on the interaction between paroxetine and tamoxifen have just been published online in the British Medical Journal, and make this case more forcefully. This interaction was shown to reduce the ability of tamoxifen to protect against breast cancer recurrence to the extent that it increased the risk for death from breast cancer. As a result, clinicians have now been warned against coprescribing the 2 drugs. Highly Variable Practice Patterns Apart from that exception, however, the editorial emphasizes the \"uncertainty\" over the data that are available so far on CYP2D6. \"At present, we do not routinely perform CYP2D6 genotyping for any patient,\" Dr. Rosenberg told Medscape Oncology. \"There are a few individualized exceptions, but they are rare and the situations can't be generalized,\" she added. This is in contrast to the practice that others have reported, in particular at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where Matthew Goetz, MD, said his team has been testing for CYP2D6 for 3 years now. Dr. Goetz and colleagues were among the first to report the effect of CYP2D6 on tamoxifen efficacy, and last year published additional data on 1325 women. \"In the postmenopausal setting, where there is an alternative therapy, the role of genotyping is very compelling, and I think it's very reasonable in that situation to discuss this test,\" Dr. Goetz told Medscape Oncology. The situation is different in premenopausal women, where the data are sparse and there is no proven alternative therapy, but even here, \"what data there are suggest that genotyping is also important in this patient population,\" Dr. Goetz explained. \"The data do not suggest that the poor metabolizers do not benefit from tamoxifen, but the data suggest that they do not do nearly as well as the extensive metabolizers,\" he added. \"I strongly believe that pharmacogenetics does play a role here.\" These 2 opposing opinions are reflected in what the editorialists describe as \"highly variable practice patterns for CYP2D6 genotyping.\" They report carrying out an informal survey among medical oncologists, and also report discovering many different views. \"Some never assay the genotype, some decide on a case-by-case basis, and a few assay frequently,\" the editorialists report. \"Some wonder whether it is ethical to prescribe a drug that may be ineffective if an alternative exists. Most agree that interpreting the assay's results can be problematic, given the lack of definitive data.\" They add that even clinicians who do carry out the test \"seem to cross their fingers that the patient turns out to be a 'normal metabolizer,' so they can prescribe tamoxifen without concern.\" New Study With \"Dramatic\" Results The editorial was prompted by a study also published online February 1 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which reported that CYP2D6 testing identifies women who have a poor response to tamoxifen. The researchers, led by Kazuma Kiyotani, from the RIKEN Center for Genomic Medicine, Yokohama, Japan, reported data from a series of 282 patients, 67 of whom they had reported on previously. These women had invasive hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, had undergone surgery, and were prescribed tamoxifen for 5 years to reduce the risk for breast cancer recurrence. Women who were identified by CYP2D6 testing as poor metabolizers of tamoxifen had a 9.5-fold higher rate of recurrence than those who were identified as good metabolizers, the researchers report. Those who were identified as \"intermediate metabolizers\" (with only 1 fully functional allele) had a 4.5-fold higher rate of recurrence. \"These results are dramatic,\" say the editorialists, but they add that this study shares \"important limitations with earlier reports.\" These include selection of study participants, limited consideration of other prognostic markers, and perhaps most important, immortal person-time bias. This arises in observational studies when follow-up time is included in person-time at risk for the study outcome, even though that time precedes the last event required for entry into the study population, they explain. In contrast, Dr. Goetz said that \"this study provides additional evidence in regard to the role of CYP2D6 metabolism and clinical outcome.\" \"What needs to happen in our community is that we have to come up with some guidelines as to when it is and when it is not appropriate to carry out this testing,\" he added. The editorialists and the researchers have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Dr. Goetz reports that he is named, along with colleagues and the Mayo Clinic, as an inventor on nonprovisional patent applications for tamoxifen and CYP2D6; the technology is not licensed and no royalties have accrued yet. Dr. Goetz also reports having acted as a consultant for Roche and having received honoraria from Pfizer, Roche, and DNA Direct. J Clin Oncol. Published online February 1, 2010.

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2010 06:44PM Pure wrote: SABCS 2008: Zoledronic Acid Has Direct Effect on Breast Cancer Zosia Chustecka December 12, 2008 ( San Antonio , Texas ) - New data suggest that zoledronic acid (Zometa, Novartis) has a direct effect on breast cancer. The bisphosphonate is currently marketed for osteoporosis and bone metastasis, but there is growing evidence to suggest that it might also have a role to play in breast cancer. Preliminary results from a clinical-trial subset presented here at the 31st Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium show that when zoledronic acid was used with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, the combination led to a significantly greater shrinkage of the primary tumor than was seen with chemotherapy alone. Together with chemotherapy, you get this exquisite synergy. Also, data from molecular studies presented here show that the combination produces a change in the expression of a number of genes and proteins associated with cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis, but neither produced these changes when used alone. \"Zoledronic acid on its own had no appreciable effect, but together with chemotherapy, you get this exquisite synergy,\" commented coauthor Robert Coleman, MD, FRCP, professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. These new results are the second time this year that zoledronic acid has shown an effect on breast cancer. When added to adjuvant chemotherapy, it significantly reduced the relapse rate in early breast cancer in the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial 12. These results were presented at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, and reported by Medscape Oncology at that time. Neoadjuvant Use Increased Tumor Shrinkage The latest data come from the AZURE (Neo-Adjuvant Zoledronic Acid to Reduce Recurrence) trial, conducted in 3360 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer. Patients received standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without the addition of zoledronic acid before surgery, and then standard adjuvant chemotherapy with or without zoledronic acid after surgery. The study was funded by the manufacturer. The overall results of this trial are still being evaluated, but at the San Antonio meeting, Dr. Coleman presented preliminary results for a subgroup of 205 patients for whom a retrospective pathology analysis had been performed. The results from this subgroup suggest that the addition of zoledronic acid leads to a greater shrinkage of the primary tumor. After surgery, the median residual tumor size was significantly smaller in women receiving both chemotherapy and zoledronic acid (20.5 mm vs 30.0 mm) than in those receiving chemotherapy alone (P = .002). In addition, a complete pathologic response was seen in 10.8% of women in the combination group vs 5.8% of those in the chemotherapy-alone group (P = .02). Fewer Women Had a Mastectomy In this neoadjuvant setting, the goal is to reduce the size of the tumor, and in doing so to potentially improve breast conservation rates and longer-term outcomes, explained coauthor Matthew Winter, MBChB, MSc, clinical research fellow at the University of Sheffield . In this analysis, fewer women in the combination group required a mastectomy (65.3% compared with 77.9% in the chemotherapy-alone group). \"The results support a potential antitumor benefit of combining zoledronic acid with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer,\" Dr. Winter commented in a statement. Dr. Coleman emphasized that these results come from a retrospective and exploratory analysis and, hence, they should be regarded as hypothesis generating. But if the results from the overall AZURE trial confirm these findings, they could be practice changing, he suggested. The final results from AZURE are expected in the next 2 or 3years, according to a Novartis spokesperson, who said Novartis is \"committed to further exploring zoledronic acid as an anticancer treatment.\" Less Bone Loss Another presentation at the meeting reported an effect of zoledronic acid on breast cancer in yet another setting. ZO-FAST (Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trial) assessed the effect of zoledronic acid on bone loss associated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. The interim results at 36 months, assessed by bone-mineral-density measurements, show that the bisphosphonate is effective in preventing this bone loss, reported lead researcher Holger Eidtmann, MD, from University Frauenklinik, in Kiel, Germany. However, the results also show an effect on breast cancer, he noted. In this study, one group of patients took zoledronic acid throughout the study (the immediate-zoledronic-acid group), and the other group took the drug only if bone-mineral density fell or they had a fracture (the delayed-zoledronic-acid group). The immediate group had a significantly lower disease recurrence than the delayed group (22 events vs 37 events; P = .0423), he reported. When asked whether he would recommend zoledronic acid for breast cancer patients who are at increased risk for relapse, Dr. Eidtmann said: \"No, I think it is too early for that; these results are only 3-year follow-up [data]. But I do believe that there is antitumor activity of zoledronic acid in breast cancer.\" AZURE and ZO-FAST were funded by Novartis. Dr. Coleman reported serving on the speakers' bureau for Novartis. Dr. Eidtmann has disclosed no relevant financial relationships",

Bisphosphonates may be used for these patients because there is no known interaction with estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER, PR). This study evaluated the concurrent use of zoledronic acid in patients with significant osteopenia or osteoporosis who received initial adjuvant letrozole therapy for primary BC, to determine if further bone mineral density (BMD) loss could be prevented. Methods: Postmenopausal women with Stage I-IIIa, ER and/or PR + BC, no evidence of metastatic disease, and a BMD T-score < -2.0 were treated with daily letrozole 2.5 mg/d, vitamin D 400 international units/d, calcium 500 mg twice daily, and 4 mg I.V. zoledronic acid every 6 months (for 5 years). The BMD was measured at baseline and at one year. Kruskall-Wallis p-value methodology was used as the method of statistical analysis. Since this was a single-arm study, the analysis plan was primarily descriptive. The primary endpoint was the mean change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at 1 year. Results: 60 patients were enrolled; 46 completed 1 year of treatment. Mean patient age was 67 years, with 44% having taken prior tamoxifen. At 1 year (see figure 1), LS BMD increased 2.66% (p=0.01), femoral neck (FN) BMD increased 4.81% (p=0.01), and any measured endpoint (within the LS or FN) increased 4.55% (p=0.0052). 7% of patients experienced a fracture vs.13% with a pre-existing history of fracture before enrollment. No patients had disease recurrence during year 1. Toxicity was minimal with arthralgia as the most common complaint. There were no reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Conclusion: Zoledronic acid prevents additional bone loss in postmenopausal women with significant osteopenia or osteoporosis initiating letrozole. Treatment with zoledronic acid was associated with an improvement in BMD. Dr. Clifford Hudis is Chief, Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. View profile. 1. In your view, which development that has occurred since September 2007 could have the most significant impact on oncology in the area of breast cancer? The development from this year that could have the biggest long-term impact on breast cancer is the observation that the bisphosphonates, widely used for treating and preventing osteoporosis, may have a role in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. 2. What specific changes in oncology, specifically in the treatment of breast cancer, have you observed or do you foresee as a result of this development? If the results of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group-12 trial, initially presented at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) by Dr. Michael Gnant, are confirmed by additional ongoing studies, the impact on breast cancer treatment could be profound. As was widely reported during the ASCO meeting, this randomized trial of approximately 1800 premenopausal women with stage I or II endocrine-responsive breast cancer found that the addition of zoledronic acid (Zometa) to endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or anastrozole) lowered the risk of relapse by 36% compared with endocrine therapy alone. This could mean that a large number of women who until now have been treated with direct anticancer drugs that prevent recurrence of early-stage breast cancer could, in addition, be treated with the bisphosphonates. The reason this is so important is that the bisphosphonate drugs are relatively safe, comparatively speaking, and they have known health benefits related to osteoporosis. Now, they appear to have a direct anti-breast cancer effect. They may have anticancer effects against other tumors as well. The use of bisphosphonates as adjuvant therapy would represent a new frontier in preventing recurrence of early-stage breast cancer. Considering that breast cancer is such a common disease and is reasonably well treated in many parts of the world, the addition of bisphosphonate therapy would be an important incremental step toward improving overall outcomes. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td height=\"20\"> <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>",

Results: at 48 months and at 62 months show that adding ZOL significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and reduced disease recurrence. Methods: Premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer (N = 1,803) were randomized to goserelin (3.6 mg q28d) and TAM (20 mg/d) or ANA (1 mg/d) ± ZOL (4 mg q6mo) for 3 years. Endpoints included DFS and overall survival, both analyzed using log-rank test and Cox models. Results: At 48 months' median follow-up, ZOL significantly reduced the risk of DFS events by 36% versus no-ZOL (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; P = .01); this was maintained at 62 months' follow-up (HR = 0.68; P = .009). In addition, the trend toward reduced risk of death with ZOL was maintained at both 48 months (HR = 0.60; P = .11) and 62 months (HR = 0.66; P = .10) compared with no-ZOL. Patients receiving ZOL also had fewer distant recurrences compared with no-ZOL: 29 versus 41 events at 48 months, and 44 versus 56 events at 62 months. No significant renal adverse events or confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been reported. Conclusions: Comparisons of 48- and 62-month data suggest a possible carry-over of the ZOL anticancer benefit 2 years after treatment completion. Additional analyses will be presented, including disease outcomes during therapy and after treatment, as well as overall survival Dx 8/8/2009, IDC, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I struggle with that most of all now-why life is so hard and filled with so much pain. And yes I constantly ask Where is God in this and why is this all happening. This is a process-allow yourself to go through the process... You can't change it but you can fight, and allow your self to heal. Its hard being in our 30's and getting this - we have way to much life to live. You have 3a which you know what-MD Anderson considers EARLY stage bc. You will be ok and hopefully you discover some truths about yourself and life as a result. I refuse to not let something good comeout of this process.",

He found another area that turned out to be cancer. It was .7mm and when the biopsied it it came back stage 1a grade 1. When I went to the oncologist he insisted I check this other area and that is the area that came back stage 3 cancer. The surgeoun missed it-so how ironic I spend my entire adult life chasing bc and end up with being on the verge of stage 4.",

She received the itenary and she said a lot of what is being presented this year is on Zometa. She said that reseachers are so excited about zometa.  I asked her why Doctors don't push it more. She told me that back in the day doctors pushed stem cell transplants-and patients died from them and they didn't work. They weren't based on clinical trails-now doctors are very careful to push anything without several clinical trials-even though Zometa has already been through Good Quality clinical trials and are on round 3 which is more then enough proof of the results.  Anyway, lots coming out about Zometa this year and it really has proven to be a great great drug. Also, she told me the reason we are far from a cure is really bc is 5 different diseases. There is triple neg, her pos, etc. so there is so many different variants of the disease. Also I didn't know that triple negs are worked into the stats along with her plus,  etc. So we are all grouped together. She also said that at MD Anderson they have a group of stage 4 women who had a single METS and were treated agressviely-the same way if they weren't  or didn't have mets. These women with SINGLE spots of mets  are almost 20 years out. They are part of a trial. Anyway- I thought that was encouraging..... The stage 4 stats are not correct either.

So today I get a callfrom Duke wanting to schedule a bone scan and a pet scan. I had just talked to my doc 3 weeks ago asking her if I could wait on these tests until treatment was done. The reason being is b-ing a) my treatment wouldn't change  2) I just had a baby-don't want any false positives. She agreed but I guess she forgot b-c someone from scheduling called me today.  Anyway, I told the scheduler that I wasn't getting them until treatment was done. Next thing I know I get an automated email saying they scheduled me in. So, I call my doctor and get the pratictioner-she says that looking at my notes their is nothing alarming but scans are just routine procedure.Anyway, I am wondering if my doctor changed her mind. I see her tommorow. I so dont want this test done right now but I am afraid she will force me to. I was so happy knowing it would be 3 months before I had to have this done. I am so scared and upset and wondering what the heck. I feel like I have no control over anything. Dx 8/8/2009, IDC, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Butttt I am thankful as things could be so much harder. They took the decatron out of my chemo-I had chemo Tuesday at 5:00 pm and as of right now I have had NOTHING. NO SE\"S-NO DEPRESSION. In fact yesterday morning and this morning I feel really really good. (notice no posts of utter terror and fear this week?:) I did get tired yesterday afternoon so I am assuming I will this afternoon as well but this is a far far different reaction then when I have the decatron. If I wasn't prego I would feel completly and totally normal which SCARES ME-----They are pumping poision in my body.  Why aren't I sick??? We will see what happens next week-my dosage is broken up 96 mgs(I think) this week and then again next week. I was told that was more then most people get, it's just broken up over 2 weeks. So it does build up so I should be more tired next week.  Consulsion-Decatron is an evil drug and I am scared that my chemo is not working:) My blood work is perfect infact another thing that scares me is when I started my platlets was 315 (normal) drpped to 250 over the course of the months and is now back up to 280. How could it be going up? I did notice it started to rise when I stated the wheat grass and juicing but rising? They nurse was like \"wow the nuestra shots really work for you.\" Ummm I don't take shots.... Anyway I guess it's great about the SE's but still I feel like I should have something more then tiredness and hair loss. So I am very thankful though that I have had minimal se's and now with decatron gone the severe depression seems to be gone. Soo sooo thankful.

The Omega Insistture is there ( dedicated to holistic health) Everyone there is into yoga, healthy living, surfing, holistic food, eco style homes. And on top of that its very spirtual. The people are sooo kind and you wake up to Monkeys every mornings.  Its very inexpensive to live there. Tons of Americans have relocated there. The first day I cried-I felt like I found the oneplace on the earth I could live forever.  The thing is I could pick up and go. I can run my business from whereever and I feel like it would be great for the kids to learn another culture and language but it would also devastate them and take them away from everything they know. My husband keeps saying we can move there when they go to College . Can you guess what my first thought is when he says that?",

I am very very emotional and dealing with this diagnoisis has been a mental battle like no other for me. It has ben torture to the point where I was having a hard time just living. I was referred to a man who does deep guided imagiry type of work. He is in his 70's and him and his wife have done this type of work for about 30 years. Anyway, it was $175.00 but there is no time limit-but b-c of the price I was sort of doubting his abilities but I felt I found out about him for a reason right as I end this chemo journey so I decided to try. All I can say is the results was AMAZING -my view towards this disease is 100% different.Whatever he did was exactly what I needed. Usually, the 2 days after chemo is when I crash emotionally, fall apart, and the doubt creaps in...None of that happen... I feel the best I have ever felt since this started ( emotionally) Anyway, I don't know this man very well, I am not trying to sell his services, I don't benifit from giving away his info I just want to share this resource with any fellow sisters who are struggling to the point I was emotionally. I know we all struggle terribly but for me I couldn't get on with my life. He does his session over the phone and in a way it is like very very deep guided imagairy while he asks you some very deep rooted questions. It's sort of weird but it really worked for me-the results are incredible for me. I am so thankful I found him.  Feel free to PM me if you have any interest. I can give you his website.

It's so true-everytime I think of buying myself a purse or shoes I think-humm let me save the money so my family has it-or I don't feel I need to look good anymore b-c I have cancer. I had my scans in August and they were clean-I have more scans in January. I am scared that from now until then the cancer will come back. That I wont get to the other side and get aleast of living a year or 2. My counsler thinks that fear is unfounded and said he has not seen that happen before. Duke gives you a counsler. He calls me everyday. I asked him out of all your patients how many dies last year-he said 4 1 women had stage 4 but had a lot of other medical issues, one lady was 29 and refused treatment at first. He said he loves counsling BC patients b-c he sees so much hope, so many women living. He says he has stage 4 and 3 patients many years out. I think I am just paralyzed by my fear and it sucks. My husband was diagnosed 3 weeks after we got married. I was 25 and I remember it taking a couple of years until we just felt safe that we would be ok. I will say I am really really mad that it's happening again.I can't really get over that on his 10 year annivesary I get breast cancer. I can't get over that I have been following my breast since I was 24 with a fine tooth comb but b-c my doctor messed up he missed this area even though I went to him 4 times about this area.  So here I am with breast cancer, fighting for my life while I grow life, going through this for a second time,not to mention my first child was born while my husband was going through chemo-now my 4th will be born while I undergo chemo, just bewilders me. I am wondering where God is in all this. I don't understand and it's really hard to not be mad and reject this whole situation. Anyway-I am trying to be greatful for what I do have,and know there are others that have it worse. I don't want to wine I want to accept, be strong, and have hope. My husband believes he beat his stage 3 colon cancer b-c he believed he would. Death wasn't an option.He believes in the power of the mind. I am failing there:) Anyway thanks for listening, and your thoughts and encouragement.",

[Epub ahead of print] Vegetable intake is associated with reduced breast cancer recurrence in tamoxifen users: a secondary analysis from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study. Thomson CA, Rock CL, Thompson PA, Caan BJ, Cussler E, Flatt SW, Pierce JP. Department of Nutritional Science, University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, 1177 E 4th Street, Shantz Building Room 328, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA, cthomson@u.arizona.edu. Abstract The protective effect of vegetables on the risk of breast cancer recurrence is uncertain. We sought to evaluate the association between breast cancer recurrence and vegetable intake including analyses stratified on tamoxifen use. Experimental evidence of anti-carcinogenic activity of phytochemicals in cruciferous vegetables in combination with tamoxifen led to specific evaluation of this class of vegetables as well. To assess the association between vegetable intake and breast cancer recurrence, vegetable intake from repeat 24-h dietary recalls were examined as a secondary analysis of 3,080 breast cancer survivors enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study. At the time of enrollment women were, on average, 23.5 months post-diagnosis. The hazard of recurrence, controlling for relevant and significant clinical and demographic variables, with vegetable intake was assessed overall and separately for women taking tamoxifen. WHEL participants reported mean baseline intakes ([Formula: see text], SE) of 3.1 +/- 0.05 and 0.5 +/- 0.02 servings/day of total and cruciferous vegetables, respectively. Baseline vegetable intake in the highest as compared to lowest tertiles was associated with an overall lower adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence of 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87. Among women taking tamoxifen, the HRs were 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.77 for total vegetables and 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.89 for cruciferous vegetable intake. The hazard in women using tamoxifen who reported cruciferous vegetable intake above the median and who were within the highest tertile of total vegetable intake was HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32-0.70. This secondary analysis in over 3,000 breast cancer survivors suggests that baseline vegetable intake may be associated with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer recurrent or new events particularly for those using tamoxifen. Such associations should be explored further as the possibility that vegetable intake is simply a surrogate for other health-promoting behaviors cannot be ruled out.   Dx 8/8/2009, IDC, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

He was wrong...I got the call upon returning from Chicago where I celebrated my husbands 10 year cancer free annivesary. I guess I was his reoccurence. My surgery was Labor Day weekend. Getting that call was one thing but the fact that I was pregnant was a whole other story. I went through surgery while pregnant as well as chemo. I won't say it was easy because it wasn't ...I was a mess... Sometimes I am surprised I made it through..  But here I am 2 years later..I am in the best shape of my life. My company has grown in ways I never imagined. I have received blessing after blessing. I have traveld to Hawaii, Costa Rica, San Francisco, NYC, SC, all since chemo ened. I have new fitness goals that include getting my body in fitness competition state just to prove what can be done after cancer. I am planning on moving my family out of the country for a year to e xperience a different culture. I am living in ways I NEVER dreamed... I laugh REALLY loud..When I smile I feel it with every fiber of my body. I am different and happier in many many ways. My husband had stage 3 colon cancer 3 weeks after we marrired. My mom had bc when I was a teenager. And then I had bc while pregnant. I have survived all of this and I am still her and better then ever. Two years is not a huge anniversary but I wanted others just starting that you do get through and often times there can be a better life waiting for you.

About 30 minutes later I got an email from a friend who had cancer while prego and she had same amount of nodes, same size tumour and if you can believe this it was in the same place. She got the same treatment as me minus zometa and taxol. She emailed me to tell me today is 2 years out from chemo and her scans came back perfect , blood work perfect. That gave me tremendous peace. I read this in the car up to the hospital I arrived at the chemo room and brought the baby. I sat next to this very nice lady who was around 55. She has stage 10 bc and tells me she feels she can go atleast 10 years-that she has met a ton of stage 4 ten year survivors. She knew nothing of Zometa. For some reason seeing how normal she is , how her plans to live I was instantly filled with strength. I then went in to my appt-blood work was perfect infact the best it has been. My platlets were at 450. Phsical exam good. We then discussed doing Zometa every 3 weeks for 4 sessions with my chemo. She agreed. I was filled with more strength. (this dosing shcedule is based on a study I found and I was determined to get it) So my prayers were answered-peace and strength- a very clear answer to my prayer. I then went to chemo- and first went the benadryl. I didn't know it made you feel drunk. I was like \"this is the best I have felt since I was diagnosed.\" It was awsome and I will look forward to that every week:))) lol BUT- THE  real lesson learned was that as that benedryl hit me they kept saying, \" Go to Sleep-let  go- relax\" And I kept thinking-No I don't want to sleep-I want to enjoy this (LOL) and I want to work.  I fought it and I won. I was stronger then the drug. I worked through it.  So, all day I kept thinking how I was bigger then that drug-that my mind controlled my reaction-my thoughts were stronger then what the benedryl wanted to do to my body. That is how we need to be with our cancer. We are bigger then our breast cancer!! No, I don't believe positive thinking cures cancer but after today I believe a strong mind can send messages to our body and our body will react. I proved that to myself today.

Truly-it's as painful of a death of someone you love. Acceptance is the first stage and the hardest. I have been working on it for 2 months. And for me I got diagnosed after returning from Chicago to celebrate my husbands 1o year cancer free anniversary and I am pregnant so when I tell you I am struggling-words can't even explain. Many a magazine has done stories on my family through my company and now I am the victim-I hate it.... I feel if I accept it it will make it real....But the reality is it's here-it's not going away-and let's say worse case it comes back... Hopefully, you will have many years before that happens and if it happens they will have new meds to help control it.  Look at Elizabeth Edwards-she went 5 years and then it came back-Doctors feel she could last another 10 ( and I hope for her husbands sake she out lives him) years. In 10 years we have developed zometa, herceptin, etc. Fight for every day and don't loose help.  We might never no why this has happen to us but it has and we have to be thankful we got it in todays day and age.",

People can't understand this unless they have lived it so to explain it is impossible. Not to mention a lot of people expect that I am dying or just a walking victim. I hate that! I will tell you this-my husband was diagnosed at age 35 3 weeks after we were married. That sucked. He had stage 3 and 60% chance of survival. We were watching video the other night of past Christmas's and I noticed just 3 years after he was diagnosed I was having another baby and we had bought a house. I said to my husband \"what were we thinking?\" He was like.\" umm  we went on with our life and the fear went away.

I am now doing Taxol 12 weeks with Zometa every 3 weeks. I am a immediate metabolizer of tamoxfin so I will do tamoxfin I guess. ( I am really confused on this part why tamox versus femara and which one is better, etc) I still need to do masectomy of other breast and oomph and I am unsure when I should do this? How do you fit this into therapy? Is the tamoxfin better then femara for me or do you do tamox first then switch to femara-this part I am confused. and finally Did I do ALL THE chemo drugs I could do?

Part of me was like well wow she went 19 years-I will take 19 years but another part of me just keeps hearing in my head-\"She was stage 3-the doc told us he knew it would come back.\"  Is that what doctors think-Does it come back no matter what?

My company has grown in ways I never imagined. I have received blessing after blessing. I have traveld to Hawaii, Costa Rica, San Francisco, NYC, SC, all since chemo ened. I have new fitness goals that include getting my body in fitness competition state just to prove what can be done after cancer. I am planning on moving my family out of the country for a year to e xperience a different culture. I am living in ways I NEVER dreamed... I laugh REALLY loud..When I smile I feel it with every fiber of my body. I am different and happier in many many ways. My husband had stage 3 colon cancer 3 weeks after we marrired. My mom had bc when I was a teenager. And then I had bc while pregnant. I have survived all of this and I am still her and better then ever.

That area has gotten better but comes and goes. Now my other side hurts again. I feel like it's going back and forth. The symptoms are identical to scitica. It's about 3 in terms of pain. The pain gets better but doesn't go away unless I take advil. I have kept working out and running but I am really scared it's a met. Would that pain move around like that with a met? Would the pain be worse? I know you can get a met at the base of your spine and it cause sciatica like symptoms but not sure if it would clear up and pass to the other site.

First off her doctor never gave her taxol... I don't understand why they didn't throw everything at her considering her age and stage.. They put her on tamoxifin and 2 years later tested her and said she was an immediate metabolizer but DIDN\"t switch her.I never understood her tx. It would frustrate me but I never said anything b-c she was a huge believer in her doctor. She was a dedicated Christian and believed 100% God healed her. Then it came back. It came back to a node in her neck but then they found out in her spinal fluid. I have never even heard of it in the spinal fluid. She was in the hospital for 4 weeks getting tx and the next thing I hear is she is quitting tx ( it wasn't working) and 3 days later she died. She believed she would beat this. She believed 100% that God would carry her through. I don't get it..It came back and boom she is dead... It's shocking and scary. I miss her so much and I don't know how it could happen so quick... I mean I know we can all become stage 4 but with so many tx available the fact that 2 months later she was dead? I don't understand...Here I am going through recontruction but what for? Am I wasting time healing that I could be with my kids. I hate this disease. I miss my friend..I am questioning where God is in this... I am just so sad and overwhelemed that she is gone.

Up to age 35 your rate of reoccurenece is higher then the rest so I was told if my tumour was bigger then 8 mm I would have chemo. It was so I had chemo.... As far as nodes they said I had none but then they did the surgery and I had nodes. They should remove 15 unless your sentinal nodes were all negative. I was told no radiation until I had the baby but needed to do chemo. I am not sure why you need to do a c section. If you started chemo while 12 weeks pregnant it would take you up to delivery then you could deliver and do the 2nd half of chemo which would be your taxol or taxotere. Then on to rads. Because of your age I would be as agressive as possible.  The surgery for the masectomy was easy so don't be too concerned about that. If you go to the MD Anderson website there is a lot of information on pregnancy and cancer.  I am happy to help in anyway.",

I told them I need treatment so it would get better and that I would loose my hair. I have a 5, 8, and 9 year old. Since I never got sick with treatment not a whole lot has changed in their life-routine -everything has stayed the same. My 5 and 8 year old never said a word-even when slightly probed by me.  They seem more into my pregnancy then anything else. My 9 year old did ask and I told him No I don't have cancer and I am doing treatment to make sure I don't get cancer. He also knows his grandma and dad had cancer and both are fine. Welll my 9 year old said to me that his friend asked him if I had cancer. He told him the above.  Apprently his friend noticed I had on a wig. i guess I feel like the cancer is gone and everything I said above is true. I check in with my kids from time to time to see if they are stressed or wondering and to date they seem not affected and very happy and stress free. I guess my thought is that until they tell me something otherwise then why have them loose ONE DAY to stressing about this. They are to young to understand and if it never comes back then they spent all this time stressed out.  But for some reason I feel guilty-my friend just emailed me saying she found a book to read to her 3 year old to explain cancer. HE IS 3???? Since our life is actually pretty normal and they are not affected I am not sure why I would tell them? But at times I feel bad-like I am keeping something from them.

Does anyone know what the side affects are to arimidex and if what kind of supplements we can take? I had no side affects to tamoxifin and was hoping for the same with Arimidex but I swear I felt sortof shaky and nervou thoughout the night. I usually sleep really good.

One just came out in May that scared me a bit.  I don't know how to interpret it. Here it is http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100325214546.htm On the other hand there are studies that show pregnancy protects against reoccurence, and another one that says the outcomes are the same. So just a lot of conflicting info but scary for me nonethe less. Since you misscarried and the pregnancy didn't continue this wouldn't apply to you at all so please don't worry. There is also this study that actually says pregnancy protects against reoccurence.  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100325214550.htm",

I chose to because I want other women fighting the disease to know there is life on the other side-a great life!  But even more important I want to be an example to other women fighting this disease that acceptance of your body will come and that beauty has nothing to with plastic surgery and botox but an acceptance of who you are. It's been one year since chemo ended. I lost 64 pounds and am in the best shape of my life. I was determined to let not cancer take anything else from me and I decided I would take these stupid pink lemons and make pink lemonade. I am fit, firm and happy. I won-not the cancer-me..No matter what I won. I am posting here because there is power in numbers...But even more so If I do win I want to say I won because of the votes of THOUSANDs of women fighting this horrible disease. We all know that Breast Cancer is not pink and pretty-our bodies have been mutalated and it really sucks hanging out with friends whose biggest issue is the lines on their forehead or their boobs aren't big enough or how they need to loose 10 pounds ( despite the face they have a perfect body) Or my favorite the people who drink, smoke, and never get anything wrong with them and those of us that try and stay health get sick!

I actually didn't have a very big response to this chemo-infact this is the 4th full AUX treatment and it was the easiest. So weird. Taking the decatron out helped but even though last week I did get the chemo funk for 2 days but for some reason it was not as bad this week. I wonder if working out the day after chemo made me feel that way. Who knows-I can't help but be so so thankful that my kids haven't witnessed me being ill, and that the baby is doing so well. This could have gone so differently. My rib pain went away after a day ( I shouldn't have freaked out about that one) and my body feels good. My mood is good too. I go Tuesday to meet with Oncologist to devise a plan as to if I will do one more AUX or induce at 37 weeks. My platelets are at 280 so they are storng so they are not concerned-my blood work all looks good. I am going to tell her on Tuesday I dont want a bone scan until after treatment is all done. I really feel good and I just feel like with the ct and mri being clean and just done 3 months ago that I can wait. She herself said it would be weird for it to show anything so soon but who knows.

I moved to Maui with my family. I am renting someone's house and renting my house out. It was the scariest and craziest thing I have ever done but I am so so happy. I am getting to spend so much quality time with my kids. I feel like I have missed so much over the last few years. Kilian continues to do well and grow perfectly as a baby. I am in awe of him everyday and hope I am around to see what great plans God has for him. Our life is very stress free and easy. The weather allows for so much outside time and recently I learned to surf and stand up paddle. I don't care if I live another 10 years or 10 days I have fullfilled a dream and am living a life I really can't put into words. Cancer taught me that-to live the life you have always dreamed now.. I would have NEVER gone out on a Paddle Board and paddled for hours by myelf-alone-there are sharks out there! Now I am not scared of sharks..Infact, I think it might be cool to see one. I am not scared anymore..I am free... I wish the same for all of you. Despite my happiness I know the reality of life and what can happen-but I don't care. I am living for today and soaking it in like a sponge. My heart breaks for those that don't beat the disease...and that could be me one day..But I know in my heart there is a divine plan that none of us are privy too and I just have to have faith.

      "Content": "Pure wrote: From the Lancet CHICAGO -- Women with early breast cancer continued to have a survival benefit more than two years after the end of treatment with zoledronic acid (Zometa) plus adjuvant hormonal therapy, investigators reported here. Patients treated with zoledronic acid plus hormonal therapy had a 32% reduction in the hazard for disease-free survival events compared with women who received tamoxifen or anastrozole (Arimidex) alone. However, the benefit achieved statistical significance only in a combined analysis of women treated with either of the endocrine agents. Separate analyses of zoledronic acid paired with anastrozole or tamoxifen did not show a significant reduction in disease-free survival compared with endocrine therapy alone, according to findings presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting and published online in The Lancet Oncology. \"Initially, there was some speculation that the effect of zoledronic acid on disease-free survival in [the trial] might be more pronounced in the patients treated with anastrozole because of potential synergy between the two compounds,\" Michael Gnant, MD, of the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and co-authors wrote in the published article. \"However, now, with longer follow-up in this analysis, the benefit of zoledronic acid has been shown to be independent of the type of endocrine therapy used and is consistent with an additive benefit.\" The addition of zoledronic acid did not significantly improve overall survival. The authors noted that women treated with anastrozole alone had worse overall survival compared with women treated with tamoxifen alone (HR 1.75, P=0.02). The findings came from an analysis of long-term follow-up data from the Austrian Breast and Colon Cancer Study Group 12 (ABCSG-12) trial of premenopausal women with stage I-II endocrine-responsive breast cancer. The rationale for the trial came from previous studies suggesting that bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, might have anticancer benefits that extend beyond bone protection. For example, a trial of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer showed that patients treated with zoledronic acid plus endocrine therapy had a significant reduction in the hazard for disease-free survival events compared with women treated with endocrine therapy alone. Another trial involving postmenopausal patients showed improvement in disease-free survival and mortality with zoledronic acid in the subgroup of women who had been postmenopausal for five years or longer. Additionally, data from the same trial showed that adding zoledronic acid to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in residual tumor size compared with chemotherapy alone (SABCS 2010; Abstract S4-5, Br J Cancer 2010; 102: 1099-1105). The favorable results in postmenopausal breast cancer led to ABCSG-12, which involved 1,803 premenopausal women. Investigators randomized study participants to four treatment groups: tamoxifen alone, anastrozole alone, or to one of the endocrine therapies plus zoledronic acid. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. As previously reported, an analysis after 48 months of follow-up showed that the addition of zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy significantly improved disease-free survival (N Engl J Med 2009; 360: 679-691). However, too few events had occurred to permit a definitive assessment of overall survival and to evaluate various subgroups. Gnant reported findings from an analysis performed after a median follow-up of 62 months. Consistent with the first analysis, the addition of zoledronic acid to endocrine significantly reduced the hazard ratio for disease-free survival events (HR 0.68,P=0.009). Separate analysis of the two endocrine agents showed a similar impact on disease-free survival when zoledronic acid was added (HR 0.67, HR 0.68 for tamoxifen and anastrozole, respectively), but the differences did not achieve statistical significance. A third fewer deaths occurred among patients treated with zoledronic acid, but the difference was insufficient to reach statistical significance (HR 0.67, P=0.09). Patients treated with endocrine therapy alone had similar disease-free survival with tamoxifen and anastrozole. However, 46 deaths occurred among 453 treated with anastrozole alone versus 27 of 450 treated with tamoxifen alone, representing a 75% increase in the hazard in the anastrozole-treated patients. In general, all of the treatments were well tolerated, Gnant and co-authors reported. The most common adverse events were bone pain, fatigue, headache, and arthralgia, each of which occurred in similar proportions of patients with and without zoledronic acid. The study was supported by AstraZeneca and Novartis. Gnant disclosed relationships with AstraZeneca, Novartis, Pfizer, sanofi-aventis, Roche, Schering, and Amgen. Several co-authors disclosed relationships with commercial interests.Primary source: The Lancet Oncology Source reference: Gnant M, et al \"Adjuvant endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: 62-month follow-up from the ABCSG-12 randomized trial\" Lancet Oncol 2011; DOI:10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70122-X.

MD Anderson is the leader in pregnancy and cancer... There is a lot of research that says your baby will be just fine even going through chemo. Your doctor will most likely follow their protocols. As I went through TX I had NO side affects. I was told being pregnant helps with the SE's-I forgot why but they were right on. I did loose my hair but I felt good. Though I did  a lot with nutrition with exercise. There was a study recently out of MD Anderson that pregnant women has a better response to chemo then non pregnant women. There are women 5, 10 - even 20 years out with stage 4. The goal is to be here for the next tx and the next one after that until there is cure or controller. Have hope, stay strong and please feel free to pm me if I can help you in anyway!",

I then started getting really bad gas. ( sorry I know gross) I read up the gas is a common side effect of this drug. The gas got better but  still each day, usually in the morning after i have coffee, I get little twinges on my right side or lower abdomen. ( over from my belly button) It comes and go, is very slight, and moves around. Seems to happen after I eat. And yes I have gas. It's not painful, just a twinge. I guess I am concerend I am mistaking this for gas instead of realizing it could be liver mets. Does anyone know what symtoms of liver mets might be? I don't have any other symptoms and if I take some aspirin the twinges go away all together. Yesterday after lunch I took a half a xanax and 2 aspirin and had no issues the rest of the day.

You don't want to go more then 6 weeks inbetween but the sooner the better so just make sure you have with your rads specialist etc and are ready to go. That is atleast my plan.

Results: at 48 months and at 62 months show that adding ZOL significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and reduced disease recurrence. Methods: Premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer (N = 1,803) were randomized to goserelin (3.6 mg q28d) and TAM (20 mg/d) or ANA (1 mg/d) ± ZOL (4 mg q6mo) for 3 years. Endpoints included DFS and overall survival, both analyzed using log-rank test and Cox models. Results: At 48 months' median follow-up, ZOL significantly reduced the risk of DFS events by 36% versus no-ZOL (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; P = .01); this was maintained at 62 months' follow-up (HR = 0.68; P = .009). In addition, the trend toward reduced risk of death with ZOL was maintained at both 48 months (HR = 0.60; P = .11) and 62 months (HR = 0.66; P = .10) compared with no-ZOL. Patients receiving ZOL also had fewer distant recurrences compared with no-ZOL: 29 versus 41 events at 48 months, and 44 versus 56 events at 62 months. No significant renal adverse events or confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been reported. Conclusions: Comparisons of 48- and 62-month data suggest a possible carry-over of the ZOL anticancer benefit 2 years after treatment completion. Additional analyses will be presented, including disease outcomes during therapy and after treatment, as well as overall survival",

I am going to find out tommorow if the gentic adnormality they found in my mom was the same as mine.  Originally they said they were going to test my dad but now that they got my mom's results they said they didn't need to test further.
