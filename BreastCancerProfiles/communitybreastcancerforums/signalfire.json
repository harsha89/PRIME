It depends on the man I might meet :)  For those who are interested, I can offer one possibility that apparently won't clash with AIs or other hormonal treatment but might help. I've always been interested in different scents and smells, not exactly commercial perfumes that give me a headache, but more of the 'aromatherapy' and essential oils kind of thing.  I did research years ago into pheromones and it turns out there's a LOT of information out there now about them, and some wonderful pheromone-containing perfumes being produced.   I have no financial interest in this site, but can recommend it wholeheartedly; it's a wonderful company with superb products and an active and fun community:  http://www.lovepotionperfume.com/ The pheromones have an effect on men but also on yourself, it requires a bit of trial and error to see what works but it sure is fun finding out.   I wanted to thank everyone here for their warmth, compassion and honesty.  This is the best community I've seen yet for honest discussions and it's making a huge difference for me to see what other people are thinking, what their experience has been, etc.  You'll never know how much good you're doing, and thank you again.  ",
