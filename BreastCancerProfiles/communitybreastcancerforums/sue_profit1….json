    "Content": "Apr 18, 2010 01:56AM - edited Apr 18, 2010 02:00AM by sue_profit1942 I was diagnosed with Stage IIa breast cancer in May 2009 and had a lumpectomy in June. I started my radiation on June 9 and finished it on June 18. I finished my Chemo early in January,2010 with hardly any side effects other than the usual tiredness. However, I'm in a clinical trial for Avastin, which is not supposed to have side effects. Been on it since last July when I started on Cyclophosphamide and Dororubicin for 4 sessions, then Paclitaxel for 12 sessions. I'll continue the Avastin for 8 sessions. It's just been since the first of March, 2010 that I've felt joint pain and weakness in my muscles. My oncologist put me on Arimidex for the next five years, and I hope the joint pain and weakness doesn't continue for the next 5 years! I don't think your joint pain is related to the radiation. The other side effect I'm noticing is that my fingernails are beginning to loosen and probably fall off. Was, or is anyone else on the same drug regimen that I was on who has had a similar experience?",
