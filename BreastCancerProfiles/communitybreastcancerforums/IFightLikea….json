Any who I will say that I am going to fight this cancer, more than anything I want to grow old with my husband.",

I just finished big TX 4, so I am getting closer to the end of the chemo part of this nightmare. I feel pretty crappy most of the time and my insecurity about my looks is bothering my husband. I wish he could understand why my \"security\" has taken a hit. I am bald, my face is red and growing rounder. There is a distinct possiblility that I may be without boobs for awhile after the surgery. And I may not be able to give him children when all is said and done. Sorry for such a down post. I  hope everyone is going well on their chemo journeys :-) Love to all my BC sisters and happy valentines day!",

I am beginning to love the attivan they give me before each infusion. My hair is starting to come out :-(  I was hoping to keep it. Right now I have several strands coming out when I run my fingers through my hair. I think I am going to freak at my first clump. I love my hair so much, it is my best physical attribute.  Sophia- you are right we are kicking cancers A$$! FriendGwen- good luck with the ativan tonight please let me know how it works for you.  My next big infusion is next Wens. :-(  So not looking forward to it. I was told I would get to see the Dr. before the infusion to discuss side effects such as vision changes and the other yucky stuff. The nurse said he may lower my dose a little bit. So we will see. Good night all,",

I had a ton of nausea including delayed nausea, I take Zofran, Attivan and they also gave me a patch to put on day 3 post tx. As for the mouth fuzzies, God I hate those, they come early and stay almost up to my next tx. The onc nurses told me to switch to everything biotine, mouthwash and toothpaste, which has seemed to keep the worst of it at bay, meaning the sores. Also magic mouthwash may help. Unfortunatly even though I do all this I still have to deal with the mouth crap, tastes are off, mouth feels odd, makes it difficult to eat and drink; but with the biotine it is not as bad as it could be. You may want to try that. I am so sorry to hear that you are having a rough time. I would not wait until you go in on Monday, I would call, even if its the on call Dr. and see if they can call something in for you.",

He is probably still in shock, the hair loss may have made the cancer more real for him. Just let him know it will be rough but you are going to make it through!- I will be keeping you in mind as you go in for your next infusion! Friendgwen, Merry Christmas, happy to hear about your preps for the baldness. I too was lucky and recieved some head coverings for Christmas, and some bongos!!
