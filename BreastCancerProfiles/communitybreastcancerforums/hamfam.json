I found some great podcasts in which the breast surgeon said she herself would never try to save the nipples because of the risk of reoccurance in that nipple tissue. Also, there's a 20% chance of necrosis (nipples die and fall off). That is WAY too high for me! Additionally, the surgeon said that they never look right even if they survive. They are usually asymmetrical, etc. Check out www.livingbeyondbreastcancer.org.",
