I told her I had some knowledge of it and would like a MRI scheduled of both breasts due to strong family history and knowledge of dense breasts being a risk factor for hidden tumors.  Scheduled MRI per my request for next week.  NO suggestion of lumpectomy or such by MD... Thinking I should maybe see breast specialist at Mayos to follow through after MRI as have read on here as tamoxifen and lumpectomy to remove area and find borders is helpful???? Any suggestions.... really do not want to wait around for cancer to arrive would like to stay PROactive as I can.  I actually am feeling much relief just knowing it is not IBC ( pending MRI results however) my breasts are dense with many lumps and fibrogladular tissue. Glad she ordered the MRI just with my suggestion even if she did not know what ALH was :)  Thanks everyone for your well wishes.... will keep using this forum great info from real people who care about their health!!!!",

I am looking at this WAITING period differently now as feeling if it was a definite invasive cancer they most likely would have got the results right away so I could go on to the next step be lumpectomy or whatever.  Before I was feeling IT IS BAD and felt little hope as it did not just come back B9 within 48 hours.  Hoping for one of the diagnosis that are increasing risk of cancer such as ADH.  But ready to take on what comes and stay POSITIVE.  Enough crying and not eating..... that is getting me no where!!!! It is all about positive and productive from here on.  THANKS everyone will post my results whenever I receive.  10 days wait now so hopefully will have this week!!!!",

So going to be proactive and catch it as they stated at Mayos the cells can lead DCIS and invasive over time if left.  Any others with this and needing treatment???",

Maybe tamoxifen will be the choice if they think that will keep it calm.  Just worried about SE's.  My co-worker was on it and felt suicidal.  Did not find that as a common side effect though per literature.",

I do not know what my result will be yet but if I do have the same as you 12 years ago am wondering how long they checked your status.... yearly mammo or such.... I have multiple microcals in both breasts but just the one group was clustering. I am wondering which route to take if I do end up with the increased risk added to my current risks of 100% cancer on my fathers side.  Two cousins died in their late 40's from breast cancer and my aunt had bilateral mastectomies in her 40's for cancer. My brother died at 16 of embryonical carcinoma. And my father has one brother with prostate, one with throat, sister died of stomach and mother died of stomach, sister died of leukemia and my father has had precancerous colon polyps removed. I have read through medical journals that the fathers side counts as much as the mothers even though some say not. Well guess I will have to wait my results to decide.  This waiting is the worst.  WIll be about three to three and half weeks before I get the result.  Thinking if it was invasive breast cancer they were suspecting they would have had me on the next step already. Thinking they are having a hard time deciding where to categorize me WHO KNOWS!!!! Well best of luck with your treatment and I may do the elective MX if need be.",
