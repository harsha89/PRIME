On my first day back to work I put a nursing pad between the area that I have the stitches and my bra. It started out fine but began to rub. Today I think I am going to try to cut my bra away from the area. Right now it is just so sensitive - still using ice on it at lunch time. Thank you for the wonderful suggestions Duffy\u2019s Mom",

I think part of my problem with the bra was that it hit exactly at the stitch spot and pulled on the steri strips. I bought some inexpensive front close sports bras and cut them down and that seems to work for now",

I am needing some help and hopeful someone will have suggestions I am postop day 2 from sentinel node surgery and can\u2019t seem to find a bra or camisole that doesn\u2019t hit the area under my arm and causes pain. It is right where a bra or camisole or tank hits my arm. I work in an office so no coverage would not be a good option. I am a C-D cup and breast from lumpectomy becomes sore without support also. My front close sports bras have worked for the lumpectomy but now do not work for the sentinel node removal. Any suggestions?
