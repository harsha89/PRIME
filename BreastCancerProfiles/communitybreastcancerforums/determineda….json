I thought I would jump on this thread as I have officially completed my first week of radiation. 1 week down, 6 to go. So far so good. My skin is a little pink and I have some stiffness in my shoulder. But I have a feeling this will get worse before it gets better. I've enjoyed reading everyone's stories. It certainly helps to hear from women that have been where I am.",

I will have a total of 34. Seems higher than most of what I'm seeing on here. The last 6 will focus on the chest wall. Is this a \u201cboost\"? Not sure of the terminology",
