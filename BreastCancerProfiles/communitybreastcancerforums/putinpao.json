(A good reason to covert if there ever were one!!)  Plus, they CANNOT make you do what you do not want to do.  If your rad geeks won't work with you if you dont want them find someone else.  I said no to half their requests and got first class treatment anyway. (and I have real tattoos.  It was just the point of it.  I'm gouging my other two out with a sharp pocketknife and I won't be asking anyone's permission to do it either.  Fuck them.)",
