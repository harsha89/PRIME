Thanks to all for your comments on the hair loss!  Mine is still coming out and I am amazed at how much can come out and yet I still have alot of hair on my head.  I am not waking up with hair all over my pillow yet so I am taking it one day at a time to decide when to shave it but will guess it should be within the next couple of days.  At the moment it doesn't seem to emotional for me but...I still have hair!  I will assume once it is all gone and I am looking at nothing on my head and a partial breast (under construction, ha!) maybe it will be time for a good cry.  I am not too emotional about alot of what has happened and not exactly sure why! MamaQ:  Laughed at your story of still putting a towel on your head after a shower.  I can see that easily happening!!",
