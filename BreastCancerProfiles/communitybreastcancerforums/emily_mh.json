But for now I see myself wearing the wig all the time, it's pretty tough looking at my no hair head. And today is our 19th wedding anniversary! We can't go out because of kids sports schedules but I'm kind of relieved! Though I did go to the grocery store in my wig! Round 2 starts tomorrow for me. I think this time I might take the anti nausea meds preventatively starting the second day after chemo since I was told the meds I get during chemo should work for 48 hours. ",

I'm so glad to hear you went to the mall buzz headed, maybe I'll get there some day. I don't wear a liner with my wig, it has a built in liner with \"rubber\" like material at temples and back of head and that keeps it in place. It feels like it will come off but the stylist promised it would not come off and I would get used to that feeling. I'm really doing ok, I get a good cry out and then it's over and I move on.",
