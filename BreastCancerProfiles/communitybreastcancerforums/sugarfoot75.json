      "Content": "sugarfoot75 wrote: Please, bear with me, as this will be long and involves possible medical neglect/nonfeasance. I had my regular mammogram about a month ago and it came back normal. However, my PCP called me and said I have dense breasts and should get an ultrasound. This was my third mammogram and the first time I heard I had dense breasts. It is a law in my state that the imaging center has to inform you that you have dense breasts. They are supposed to send you a letter with your mammogram report (although I never an act report, just a letter saying it was normal) I never got any such letter on my previous two mammograms. I decided to wait and see if I got a letter with my current mammogram report (again, not an actual report) before saying or doing anything about it. In the meantime, I had the u/s done at the same imaging center and the radiologist came in and said I had a fibroadenoma (mammogram did not pick this up) and reccommended that I come back for an u/s every six months for the next two years to see if it grows. If it doesn't grow, then I can go back to yearly ultrasounds, if it does grow, I would need to have a biopsy. I asked why I needed to wait and why not just biopsy it now? He said \"well it really just looks like a tiny fibroadenoma and we never want to do a biopsy unless it's absolutely necessary.\" My PCP got the report and immediately ordered a biopsy because I have an anxiety disorder (I'm on medication for it) and he knew the watch and wait approach wouldn't work for me. He sent the order to the same imaging place, they called to schedule my biopsy and a technician talked me through the process, it was going to be a core needle biopsy and she did a very good job of explaining it to me. The imaging place called me the day before my biopsy and cancelled it because my doctor ordered the wrong kind of biopsy. I told her that the technician I spoke to explained the core needle biopsy to me and that from my understanding that was the correct type. I asked her what my doctor ordered and she said, \"he ordered a biopsy but it says something about an FNA and I don't even know what he ordered.\" I know exactly what he ordered, it wasn't a FNA, it was a core needle biopsy. She then repeatedly told me that the radiologist had already discussed with me waiting the six months and coming back and asked (condescendingly) if I remembered that conversation. I told her I did remember that conversation, but I never agreed to that course of action. She said, \"well the radiologist has been doing this for a long time and you should really take his advice.\" I told her that the radiologist saw me for 2 minutes, my PCP has been my doctor for 10 years so if he orders a biopsy, he must know something the radiologist doesn't know, like that I have severe anxiety and watching and waiting would only make my anxiety worse. She was unmoved and told me that my PCP would need to call the radiologist to \"straighten everything out.\" There was nothing to straighten out, my doctor ordered the correct biopsy and the radiologist decided to cancel it because I was going against his advice. I told the nurse that wouldn't be necessary because they have lost my business, I then asked her to transfer me to records and I requested all of my records from them. I picked them up the same day and my last two mammogram reports said my breasts were dense radiographically. The letters I got just said my mammogram was normal and didn't mention anything about me having dense breasts which, again, is the law in my state. It's important to note that my first two mammograms were ordered by my ob/gyn and this last one was ordered by my PCP. I never got any report from my ob/gyn either. My PCP sent the biopsy order to a different imaging place and the diagnosis is intraductal papilloma and recommended that I have it removed because, although it's benign, it is a \"high risk precursor for cancer.\" I see a BS on Tuesday. At this point, I have no trust in the first radiologist (with good reason) and I'm concerned he may have missed some things. When I got the scans back, there were two other areas that were measured and with color that were not mentioned in my report. Will the BS, automatically review all of my ultrasound pictures or is that something I specifically have to request? My fear is that he will just go off of the biopsy and not even look at the ultrasound pictures to see if something was missed. Is an MRI standard procedure before this type of surgery? If it isn't, should I request one? Also, do I have grounds to file a complaint against the first radiologist, imaging center and/or on/gyn? They never informed me that I have dense breasts,. I was misdiagnosed, they cancelled my biopsy for no reason, they called me about problems with my doctor's orders when they should've called my doctor, they were dismissive of my concerns, condescending and rude. I might be overreacting to this but I'm quite nervous because I have no idea if breast cancer runs in my family or not. My mother was adopted and died young (not of cancer) so I have no idea if she would've developed cancer later in life or not. The only person who knew the identity of my biological father was my mother and she took that secret to the grave. If you've read all this, thank you. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

      "Content": "Feb 24, 2019 10:26PM - edited Feb 24, 2019 10:33PM by sugarfoot75 I already had the biopsy at a different imaging center (I'm pretty sure I said that) it came back as intraductal papilloma. So the original radiologist misdiagnosed me and the imaging center was negligent in not informing me that I have dense breasts. The core needle biopsy was what my doctor ordered and what the technician explained to me, after looking at said orders. When they cancelled it, they made it seem like I needed a FNA instead of the core needle biopsy my doctor ordered, which would have been wrong as my mass is not palpable. Also, if they had a problem understanding my doctor's orders, they should've called my doctor (not me) to clarify, instead of just automatically canceling the procedure. If you had heard the condescending manner in which the nurse spoke to me, you would suspect that they cancelled it because I was not following the radiologist's orders too. Because of their mismanagement of my care, I do don't trust the original assessment of my ultrasound, which is why I'd like a second opinion. I see a BS on Tuesday and will ask him all of these questions. I was just curious what the normal process is and whether or not I have grounds to file a complaint against the original imaging center and radiologist. ",

My last two mammograms said category 3 and I did not get a letter either of those times. Central intraductal papillomas usually present with nipple discharge. I have a peripheral intraductal papilloma, they do not cause nipple discharge. Also, peripheral papillomas usually present as multiples, which is another reason why I am concerned that something was missed on my ultrasound, only one was found, which would be unusual.   ",
