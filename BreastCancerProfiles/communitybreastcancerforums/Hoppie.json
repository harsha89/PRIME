I felt some pulling and tugging, but again absolutely no pain. I rested the day off, but didnt feel bad at all and other than being mildly sore, was able to get right back to normal activities.

I'm hoping for b9 results for you!",

I first came here a few weeks ago after an abnormal mammo. I was called back right away to come back for additional views and left having had 5 corner needle biopsies, the last thing in the world I expected. I stress and worry so I was grateful happened so quickly. My experience With the core needle biopsy, guided by ultrasound, was not bad at all and I am a huge chicken when it comes to procedures. They first numbed my breast and it was a minor little pinch, I didn't even wince and I almost pass out whenever I get blood drawn! I felt absolutely no pain at all during the 5 biopsies, the only sensation was slight pressure. The tech put firm pressure on the area for a couple of minutes, she taped and gauzed the area and I was done. It took 6 days for the results to come in and I was told the biopsy results were \"non concordant\" with the mammo and US, meaning my tumor looks suspicious for malignancy, but the biopsy came back b9. My radiologist got a second opinion who also agreed with her and they sent me for a contrast mri, which came back inconclusive, but did show 3 areas of concern in my right breast, but due to their shape they are more than likely b9 and should be checked in 6 months. Needless to say, I still do not know what is going on, but I'm meeting with a surgeon on the 15th, the radiologist's are recommending excisional biopsy with possible duct excision. I will be thinking of you and sincerely hope that you have the same experience with your procedure that I did. It's the waiting and not knowing that is the hardest,but the time will pass. No doubt you are busy with 3 children and being busy is the best thing to do right now. Please keep us posted.",

I'm uninsured and recently heard of a mammogram program in my area so I called and scheduled my first mammogram, I'm 46. I had the mammogram last Friday and first thing Monday morning, I received a call that they needed additional views. They scheduled me for the next morning at 930 (yesterday) and said the radiologist would be there to discuss the results with me. It scared me that I had to go back, they were getting me in so soon and that the radiologist was going to be there. I went yesterday and they did an additional 3 views on my left breast (right breast was fine) and brought into a room while the radiologist went over it. She came back in and said they needed to do an ultrasound. The tech did the ultrasound and left and the doctor and tech came back in where the doctor proceeded to do the ultrasound. The radiologist said she saw a pea sized lump behind my nipple that was \"worrisome\" and stated she would like to do a biopsy right away! She left and the tech prepped me and they did a core biopsy using the ultrasound to guide her, she took 6 biopsies. They said the results should be in by next Monday. Is it normal for all of this to happen so fast? Will they give me results over the phone or will I have to endure the ride there and wait until they see me to get them. I'm really in shock right now and I'm grateful I've been able to have everything done so quickly, but then there's a part of me that think something's really bad if they are doing everything so quickly. She was able to confirm that it wasn't a cyst and that is why it worried her. If it is not cancer, will they still want to remove it? The waiting is so very difficult, can't imagine having to endure this weekend.... Any ideas on how to make this time pass without worrying too much? Log in to post a reply",

The 15th is my first meeting with the surgeon, which it he goes With the radiologists recommendations, we will be discussing an excisional biopsy with possible duct removal. I saw the possible duct removal in my records that I just received and not sure why they want to remove it as it has never bend discussed. It sure does help talking about it and this venue has been a godsend as has family and friends. At times I feel paralyzed and other times I am okay. If I am busy, the time goes fast, if I'm not, it goes very slowly. The big girl in me knows what I should do, but sometimes the little girl in me takes over. It's a scary journey I wouldn't wish on anyone, but very comforting to know you get through this as so many on here have and you become stronger. I honestly think I will be okay when I find out what is going on and if a plan needs to be formulated then that is my chosen path.",
