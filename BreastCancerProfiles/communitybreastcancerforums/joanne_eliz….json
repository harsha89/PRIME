I went for my 3rd opinion today and the 3rd person said it would benefit me. Joanne ",

How about the governments culpability for not harnessing the polluting corporations or funding enough prevention strategies instead of \"treatments\"? You will find every type of woman with cancer, those who are skinny enough, had kids young enough and breast fed (my mom), exercised, ate what was considered well at the time.  It is time to point the finger elsewhere and find out the real causes for this.  Check out this book. As countries become industrialized, breast cancer increases.  They expect a surge of this in china in the next 10 years.  Even if you could \"blame\" our diet, the gov't subsidizes sugar and wheat, not organic vegetables. www.alternet.org/healthwellnes... ",

Helen, you must have freaked when they wanted more views.  The really bad thing is every view is more radiation which of course can promote cancer.  Sometimes you wonder. The bc support group is okay, but now we have a male co-chair. I hate to sound sexist, but I can't picture talking about my body image and sexual side effects with a guy there.

The rad doc also wanted me to take off my wig so I didn't \"slide around in the CT\" scanner. I told them if he went bald I would be happy to as well.  Neither of us did. Joanne ",

Thanks for the info about the sports bras - I have been trying to find an acceptable alternative to regular ones for awhile.  I occasionally go to a gym and that is an issue - what to wear, where to change, etc.  Sometimes I think I should just run around half naked and if women don't like the one breast look, don't look, but so far I haven't been that brave. I think I would make more of an impression than if I wear a pink bow on my shirts ! I may just wear the sports bra to work which would make it easier.  Barb - what did you do or say when this woman announced your chemo? I would have been horrorfied!   I don't know if I am imagining this or not, but my mast scar, muscles seem stiffer after 3 rads.  So I am back to doing all the post-breast surgery exercises to try to keep the range of motion going. Hope you are all enjoying the weekend and 2 day reprieve from rads. Joanne ",

You are right after 35 yrs you are pretty set. I only have 11 there though. My biggest issue is benefits, my husband is self-employed so I have the health insurance.  Did you know in many states you can't buy health insurance after a diagnosis like this? I didn't realize how bad it was til I saw the movie Sicko.  My brother used to work for IBM in NY as an enginenerd, but they basically shipped everything to Florida so he eventually left and became a lawyer.   Thanks to everyone for the supportive comments about the \"it is as if someone in the room has cancer\" comments.  Seems when you least expect it, you get a eye-opener crazy comment from someone. Brenda, I felt the arimidex pretty quickly, within the first 2 weeks.  My biggest concern is they have no idea if the joint pain/destruction is permanent. So I joke to people and tell them maybe I won't have bc in 5 yrs, but I won't be able to walk either! It is manageable, but definitely there.  2 more this week then a day off ! Yes ! Joanne ",

Then they say the lumps didn't have clean margins, so maybe it would be more than 4.7. It is very difficult when they don't agree themselves. The medical onc is deferring to the rads guy.  I am seeking a second opinion, but cannot believe this came up just when I though I might be done.  Adding a possible 7 weeks of rads is quite a bit to add to the end. I do know having rads after a dissection doubles your chance of lymphedema.  That is one area they agree upon. I just wonder whose job was it to tell me rads was a possibility, this all started in April. Plus I don't have alot of faith in radiologists - they couldn't see 3 tumors on a mammogram for how many years and never suggested other tests for my dense breasts and now breast.  Joanne ",

Onc #1 said we treat the area not just the chest wall. I am being advised to have rads because of the multifocal addition of tumors adding up to 4.7 cm and depending upon whom you ask the 1 positive sentinel out of 18?   Seems there is no agreement at all about adding the tumors, but I have read the prognosis for multi of uni focals is the same so makes no sense.
