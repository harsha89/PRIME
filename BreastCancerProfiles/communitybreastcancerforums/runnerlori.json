We'll beat it.  And thanks for your support... next I have a D&C then see the oncologist to start the chemo.  And hey sherry64...yes, i do like a plan...but it is so hard to have to keep waiting.  I am sure the heavy periods are from fibroids, but they are going to look on Friday and we'llknow for sure. I will just be so relieved to have the heavy bleeding done.   I'll keep you updated.  Good luck to you girls. hugs..",

I had my biopsy on a Friday and got the call from the surgeon that I was positive for cancer on Tuesday.  Waiting was the worst!  Waiting for appointments, waiting for phone calls, waiting for surgeries... Yikes... Now it is waiting for the chemo to start.  Had my port a cath insertion last Friday and now I have one more hurdle, I need a D&C... heavy periods have left me anemic and they feel it will do me good to have this procedure so I will be as strong as possible going into the chemotherapy phase.  I can handle that right?  13 weeks? then radiation for 7 weeks.  Including herceptin for a year.    Partial mastectomy was on April 13th... it wasn't so bad.  I am about all healed.  the ribs were sore and the sentinal node biopsy site was sorest, but that is healed too. ",

I will get my last dose of Adriamycin and Cytoxin next week.  I haven't done too badly with it.  my symptoms have improved over the course of treatment. I get it every two weeks with neulasta injections.  I had my last cycle a week ago and today I was able to work and ride my bike to the pizza place for a couple of slices.   Watered and weeded the flower beds and got mosquito bites on my bald head! The nerve of those darn bugs!   My oncologist isn't sure if he will give me Taxol, once every week for 6 weeks or Taxotere, once every 3 weeks for 3 months.  Reading your posts has relieved a bit of my anxiety. He said the decision will be ultimately mine as to wether it will be Taxol or Taxotere. Any suggestions or input will be greatly appreciated.",

YAY... then I'll get taxol or taxotere.  The port saves much trauma to the veins/arms.  You can still see it tho... it is like I haev a stack of nickels under my skin.",

I am not sure why my surgeon didn't give me that option.  At any rate, I have some bruising and some muscle stiffness.  Other than that, there is no pain or discomfort. I am very relieved that I can't feel it at all... just a mild awareness of something in me, but it is not intolerable. I see it as my port to good health.  the chemo will heal me of this shit called cancer, the radiation will insure eradication of all cancer cells and then I can move on with my life. To live, to love, to laugh. Be well fellow breast cancer survivors. I am thinking of you. hugs, Lori",
