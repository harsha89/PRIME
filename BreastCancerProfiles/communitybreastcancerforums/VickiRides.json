During the immediate healing period I wore a mastectomy camisole that had pockets for a \"poof\" -- just a soft breast form filled with stuffing like for a stuffed animal. The poof gave some protection to the surgery area and filled out my shape so I looked fairly normal. My insurance paid for two camisoles. That's what I wore when I went back to work two weeks after surgery. About 3-4 weeks post surgery I got fitted for a mastectomy bra and a lightweight foob (prosthetic), then I got a silicone foob about 10 weeks after surgery. I am really pleased with how I look with the prosthetic -- my husband sometimes has to ask which side is the fake boob! Vicki ",

Everyone reacts to treatment differently so it's very hard to predict when your mom will start to feel better. I had different chemo (AC+T) followed by radiation that finished at the end of March 2016. I would say that it's just in the last month that I've really felt my energy coming back. Be patient.

SeekingSerenity, you have given me hope that my skin will start feeling better soon. My RO gave me a prescription for Silvadene this week. I find myself getting more tired and cranky. We had to move all of the furniture out of our bedrooms last night because we are having carpet installed today. I was pretty much useless and that frustrated me. barbe1958, I am sorry you've had to much to deal with. I hope you have a wonderful weekend! ",

He told me that the radiation departent had been boughtby another company, but don't worry, they are going to follow my original treatment plan. I sat down in the waiting room and a woman sat down next to me and I noticed that we have the same wallet. I turned to tell her that and it was my mother who came to surprise me. (Because the hospital was part of the airport ) They told me to go back and change and i got lost in a maze of hallways and food courts of all junk food. I finally found the dressing room, which was full of kid's toys and had no lockers, I was supposed to just leave my purse and clothes in there. This is when I started getting nervous. They take me back to the radiation room, which has two conveyor belts of tables with patients on them sliding into little tunnels where they get zapped. The patient in front of me is a naked Asian man (Mr. Chow from the Hangover ??!!) and when he slides into the treatment tunnel he bursts into flames!! At this point I am crying and run out of there! Who wants to analyze that??? The open blister in my arm pit and my clavicle are super sore. I did too much yesterday, so I am spending today resting. I have been taking the leftover pain pills from my surgery, which are almost gone. Thank goodness I see my RO tomorrow. (Oh, yeah ... in my dream they wouldn't give me any meds. Boo.) Happy Easter!",

Nothing showed up for me on the regular mammogram or the diagnostic ultrasound, but one tumor was visible on the 3D mammogram. That led to an MRI, which showed multiple tumors in my right breast. Even with the MRI to guide them, the doctor had a hard time finding the tumors with ultrasound when I had my biopsy. One of the characteristics of ILC is that it is hard to detect. MsYelv - FISH is the type of test that was used to determine HER2 status. There's good information in this booklet that will help you understand the pathology report: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/pat... Good luck to you both.",
