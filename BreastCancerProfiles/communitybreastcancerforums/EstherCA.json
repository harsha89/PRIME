If anyone has had a power port installed in Southern CA, that would be really great to know as well. Log in to post a reply",

Sounds like not all power ports are equal, or that not all facilities are willing to use.  I will have to ask more questions, it does seem that Bard makes quite a few different ports. My veins have become so impossible to find, that I end up getting stuck over and over again every time I need to get dye injected for a scan.  Since at stage 4 this will continue to happen, I am hoping there is a version of the power port that can be used for ALL dyes and scans, including PET scans.",
