Have followed doctor's instructions on desensitizing the breasts for the nerve pain, but just yesterday & today it was pounding pain & itching on the reconstructed side & constant itching on the other breast. I had a few low dose hydrocodone pills left from surgery so I took one with Benadryl & used an ice pack all night. The intensity is about the same today, so I tried the same dosage mid-day. Late day & things seem to have improved a little. I can only empathize with those fellow sufferers & hope not many of us are still suffering with this years from now!! I am going to try scratching the back opposite the painful front spots & hope that works for me. If any one else is monitoring this discussion, have you had any response from topical creams or anti-itch products? I picked up a generic Walgreen's hydrocortisone cream with other lotions to try tonight. After looking at all of the different products I wondered if any anti-itch creams would work since the pain is real but there is no outward sign like a rash, redness, etc. Also has anyone had pain from the base of the prosthesis on the bottom next to the rib cage area? It feels uncomfortable when sleeping. I use extra pillows to try to prop the weight from that breast up and away from the side. It almost feels like a thick roll of rope [tissue] that goes from under the breast to the back. Per doctor's advice I have massaged that area & the pectoral muscle in front, but feel little change in these uncomfortable areas. Has anyone else experienced this after effect? I tell myself not to complain since my chemo & surgery outcomes were all clear, but as I say to my family 'that phantom pain is real. Blessings & prayers to other breast cancer patients. ",
