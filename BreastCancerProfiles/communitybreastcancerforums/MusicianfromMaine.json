The back story: 61 yo BRCA 2+, oophorectomy 1999, finally made the decision to do the pbm after many years of surveillance. Did the research, found the bs and ps of my dreams, went to surgical ward on Dec. 28 for pbm with immediate direct to implant, nipple-sparing surgery. Pretty straightforward, right? WRONG. So here I sit 9 days later, with cellulitis in my right breast, the strong possibility of returning to the OR tomorrow to lose my implant and nipple. I went in with a healthy body and breasts, and I'm coming out with, well, maybe no right breast. I count my blessings that I am able to have prophylactic surgery and that I'm not facing cancer. So many of you have/are. But, nonetheless, I'm pretty devastated by this turn of events. I'm trying hard not to second-guess my decision, but that's hard, too. I'm going to wake up tomorrow with hope that there's less red on the right, which will buy me some more time this weekened for more helpful cocktails. If not, I'll be going into the OR on a Saturday in Portland, Maine with a doctor who is on call (and not MY surgeon). Please send good thoughts for a less-red right breast. THANKS!
