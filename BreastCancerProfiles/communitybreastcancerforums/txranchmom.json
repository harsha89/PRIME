They gave me my pathology report. I have been about run around the Bush with no answers, so need some help.  Just how bad is it? And is it safe to wait a week or week and a half to get in with the breast surgeon? A local surgeon at our small hospital wants to do a lumpectomy, but I'm guarded and would preferr a surgeon skilled in this and more importantly a hospital that is more than a Podunk one. Lol  I'm 34. My report said I had invasive mammary ductal (E-cadherin positive) adenocarcinoma. (Doc right? But I don't know what the positive is?) Historic grade is 6/9 (medium right?) Angiolymphatic Invasive is not identified (good or bad?) Associated DCIS is not identified. (No idea) It's estrogen + (95%) and progesterone + (30%) Her2 negative And the Ki-67 proliferative index is high(25%) Someone please help me figure this out.  On a scale how bad? What the prognosis?

Covered everything except cholesterol.  Anyways my white cell count was normal.  Now I've always heard if you have cancer your white cells are off. BUT I can't find anything to support this.So ladies, any help?
