Here are some things that helped me.  Make sure they give you Ememd on the day of treatment - it really helps. Also, take the med befroe you feell the nausea- especially the Zofran. The week after chemo I can barely move. I am off for three days adn then go to work, but I think I am going to take the fourth day off, since I have the sick time.  The week ater chemo NOTHING appeals to my appetitie, so I eatwhatever I can get into my system.  Mac and cheese has become a staples.  I also have started eating a small piece of beef (organic) becasue it seems to give me energy.  Of becasue I had really gotten away from beef.  Ensure has been greaat becasue I owrry about weight loss.  SOmetimes I mix it with coconut milk (which has less glucose) and ffruit into a smoothie. Ask yourdocs for sleeping pills - you really need to get sleep (unless you are not working and can nap all day) and you can deal with the withdrawal issues later. On constipation , I use stool softeners twice a day and they really help. The week after chmo I can't stand water, so Vitamin Water and Gatorade help. Nosebleeds just staerted - yikes!- frm loss of nose hairs I guess, so I need to ask my onc aobut that. Hang in there - especially you AC/T ladies -it's a drag, but we'll get through together.

She said that they would give me an MRI along with the mamm every 6 months - esp  since my BS likes MRIs.  The problem of course is that the MRIs give lots of false positives.  But as Dr Susan Love points out, you can decide whether you want every calcification biopsied or not.  The good news for me is that the FDA just approved a new type of 3-dimensional mammogram that two hospitals in Philly are starting to use, and my hospital is one of them.  This 3-D mamm is supposed to have NO COMPRESSION of the breasts, more accuracy and fewer false positives.  I hope I can get to use this soon. It sure made me feel better knowing that this is around the corner. Ladies - you are all BC Goddesses!",

So it's good that you are getting the test.  Hope you can avoid chemo, but if you can't - I had it and you will get through it.",
