For her pancytopenia all they are really doing right now is transfusing with platelets or RBC when her number drop below a certain threshold. They can\u2019t find any cause of her levels continuing to drop. They haven\u2019t said to much about the kidney failure. Other than it could be from all the antibiotics and medications she was given at first to treat the pneumonia. It\u2019s so frustrating because I jut feel like I\u2019m not getting gettjng all answers I need",

My mom was diagnosed with stage IV MBC just three short months ago with mets to the bone and liver. She has been pancytopenic for about a month now with constant of platelets and blood. Her doctors are just now doing a biopsy of bone marrow and we are awaiting those results. She has been to I\u2019ll for treatment other than a few weeks of radiation in a few weeks of Letrozole. We were told yesterday that her kidneys were failing and they started dialysis. She also has a hospital acquired infection in her lungs (pneumonia) from being placed temporarily on a ventilator. I guess I\u2019m just hoping for someone with s similar story that could shed some hope or light. I\u2019m devastated and don\u2019t even feel like I have had tome to even process that she has cancer. I just want more time with her. Log in to post a reply",

My mom is the strongest person I know and if anybody can fight this it's her. I'm just feeling so discouraged by everything her providers are saying. I wish someone would just try some type of treatment her chemo. What do we have to lose?",
