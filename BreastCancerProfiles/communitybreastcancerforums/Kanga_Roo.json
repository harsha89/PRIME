If the CT shows the cancer has been reduced further they could operate and get rid of any evidence of it. If it grows again I would be classified as de novo again, and eligible for first line treatments. If I continue with kisqali/femara until the cancer starts growing again, i would be looking for a new treatment with the possibility of the cancer morphing to something more aggressive. This would give me fewer long term options. I don\u2019t like the idea of invasive solutions, but I think I will only get one chance at this, so I need to make the right decision. Any one out there been faced with a similar decision, would love to hear your thoughts or ideas. Jackie ",

Felinemum, I know how petrified you must feel. Initially, with my diagnosis, I didn\u2019t think I would see Xmas 2018. What I have learned from my journey so far is don\u2019t consult Dr Google (usually too out of date to be relevant) and there are always new drugs and treatments being discovered that can prolong our lives or improve our quality of life. Initially my surgeon suggested a mastectomy and chemo, but my oncologist suggested I go on the Kisqali/letrozole combo instead as I met all the criteria (denovo, post menopausal, no prior treatments) I had my yearly tests last week. My bloods are normal, sugar is good, can't measure my liver met it is so small and my ultra sound findings of left breast mass have gone from 28 x 27 x 67 to 17 x 11 x 16. I hope the Kisqali combo will keep working for me in 2019! The only real side FX I have is lethargy and an occasional hot flash. Hoping 2019 brings some innovative treatments for us all so we can get off this roller coaster ride! Jackie ",

I was on blood pressure meds, don\u2019t need them any more. I feel my quality of life has improved 200%! I researched the diet carefully before starting, and found many of the requirements go against what we are taught about what is OK (eg, you need to consume a lot of salt and potassium) but the results speak for themselves. My oncologist says my liver is in great shape and to keep on with the diet. I don\u2019t know if it will help with my cancer in the long term, but meanwhile, I feel great and my doctor and onc approve - hope this helps. Jackie",

In ketosis, the body can convert protein to sugar if needed but functions very efficiently on ketones Ketosis reduces inflammation reducing stress on the body. Cancer cells cannot use ketones. There is a lot of misinformation out there, but also plenty of reputable research studies. Cheers, Jackie",
