We had a pool at our old house and the plan since we moved in 4 years ago was to add a pool here. Now with that said...it took 3 days to fill the pool and after letting the water warm up a bit I got in. Big mistake! The water was 75 degrees which felt ok. Much to my surprise my LE arm and boob swelled so much I gained myself 5 weeks of PT. I didn't wear my sleeve I had ask when I was fitted because I knew we were doing the pool. I didn't even think about the water being to cold...duh! I got really mad at myself and at BC! Also if you have had radiation I was told no pool or swimming 6-8 weeks and after that to be sure to keep the sun block on or a cover.",

Of course I'm moving a 106 pound girl around, lifting grandbabies (still have 2 little ones 1&3) and doing all the housework. Plus sneaking a little outside work when DH isn't around to give me the evil eye! I also skeep in a night jacket.

I have a separate glove that DH refers to as my ove'glove and wants one for my other hand because my hands are always cold. I wear that get up 6 nights a week. One night a week I reward myself and have (drum roll please) naked night! (TMI) it's the little things that make LE doable for me. I wear my ugly bras with the chip bag everyday. If I have a rare occasion were I get to dress up I have a Victoria Secret bra I pulled the wires out of and I will wear that for the event. My PT once told me I was the perfect patient.

I have done all the good things...Kiefer, yogurt with probiotics, soaking in a tub of warm water with organic vinegar and using organic coconut oil as a topical. Today I call my NP and got a prescription for Diflucan. This is just another reminder the my immune system isn't up to parr. It makes me so mad! Now for LE talk, I got my new night garment. I have slept in it for 2 nights now with no issues. I like the the arm part does not have the thumb/ hand part. It makes my 2 am trip to the bathroom to pee so much easier. ..lol.

That breast always feels so heavy and all my bras leave deep impressions on it. I also can feel the \"fluid\" pooling around the center of my chest. My chest massage exercises help. It was also my radiation oncologist that sent me for PT. She took my look at my boob before my rads started and said I needed a to get started before radiation due to radiation sometimes making LE worse. I also have a puffy armpit.

I have some goals I want to reach and I feel that I am heading in the right direction after the slowest come back in my life!! Surgery was in February 2017 and I am just now feeling like moving again. I was very active before BC. Zumba 2-3 times a week and walking at least 5+ miles a day. I have been to Zumba since diagnosis. I feel that the LE and Tamoxifen held me back. Which I was going to post a few things here..is is possible the Tamoxifen made my LE worse? I was in PT/OT every week from March last year until mid February this year. I was switched to Anastrozole in March and my LE for the first time since diagnosis is not an issue. I' doing nothing different which makes me wonder about the Tamoxifen. Since I have switched to Anastrozole I'm not hungry all the time. I've lost 8 pounds and my muffin top is shrinking! I didn't realize how hungry I was while taking the tamoxifen. So...here's my goals...within the next month I want to get back to zumba at least once a week, keep getting my 25,000 steps a day and get back to my arm workout and possibly start running again. I have an adult child with multiple handicaps in my cate 24/7 so I do have so limitations on accomplishing my goals a little bit. I have a treadmill so I can run there as long as I get to it before she wakes up. If my DH is home early enough I can make zumba class. My oldest grandson always stays with us through the week so while school is in I drop him off each morning he rides the bus home. How's that for a start??? I can do it right? ??",

Every to do my hair...hahaha! I have a little folding step stool in every closet and one in the kitchen under the sink. I can only reach to the second shelf in my cabinets. I gained weight after I finished rads. I had lost and was feeling great all the way to the last boost. Then about 2 weeks later I started getting sick. From the end of radiation until this past June I was on antibiotics 6 or 7 times. I lost track...definitely 6 but possible 7. That's when I gained all my weight. But I'm kicking it to the curb now!!! I live in the Smoky Mountains! Bears are in several neighborhoods but that was the first one to cross my yard that I actually witnessed with my own eyes. My neighbors have watched bears walk down our back drive way to DH garage. My cell phone was charging by the time in grabbed it a ran outside to try an get a picture it was gone. Delivering Meals in Wheels today. Fingers crossed the weather stays sunny so we can hit the pool again today. With the nights getting down to the sixty's pool season will come to an end soon....booo!

(I think I bought it in January) what is the life expectancy of the bra? I wash it about 3 times a week. I place it in a lingerie bag and wash all my delicate items on a gentle cycle with detergent only no fibric softener. I then line dry in on a rack downstairs. I usually start the washer right before I use my Flexitouch that way I can lay it across the rack and it is dry by morning. The elastic is unraveling and the wide band at the bottom has no grip left. So how do you girls care for your bras? The other thing I'm dealing with is boob sweat! I've never been a sweaty girl but with this compression gear it's taking it to a whole new level. This will be my first summer with the compression bra, compression cami, and the wraparound chip bag. Last year they just had me in a sleeve and because I was still doing radiation. The recommendations for a good safe deodorant would be much appreciated. I've always use something general like Tom's this sweating is a whole new ballgame. My body is changed so much in the past year just trying to figure it all out. ",

I am hoping when I do it goes as well as for me. Minus showing my boob..lol I did go by my PCP office yesterday. I have some nasal drainage and it is making my throad sore. I got some black elder berry syrup and echinacea. I asked the doctor if that was okay and he said yes he highly recommended it. I took two doses of Echinacea yesterday and one teaspoon of black elderberry syrup. Then this morning I look at my pre-op sheet and it says no herbal treatments 2 weeks before or after surgery! Freaked me out just a little bit! They clearly told me no aspirin Tylenol anything like that two weeks before but they did not tell me vitamin E or herbal supplements. So I'm a little mad at myself for looking at the sheet closer. So now shit fairy is running wild and free in my head! I keep telling her come on...it was 2 capsules 2 times and ONLY a teaspoon of syrup but that bitch will not let it go! To all you girls who have an occasional break down. We all are entitled to one when we need one! To all you feeling foggy...I brush my teeth with someone else tooth brush! Not even close to the same color or even one that's close to where I keep mine. Then I looked for my Fitbit (I'm a bit of an addict ) and couldn't find it! I'm frantically searching then I think maybe I threw it down the laundry shoot with my clothes. Nope....it was in my hand the while time! SMH! Feel free to chuckle at my foggy times! Freezing cold here today and tomorrow. Had just a dusting of snow but it's gone now. Sending love to you all!",

At that initial meeting I was under the influence that I had the most treatable form of BC. That I probably would not radiation, I asked then about drains. I was told I would not need them. He also told me that I would have one incision that the BC was in perfect line for the lymph nodes removal. So yesterday I go for my pre-op and I meet with the NP that works with surgeon. I get to a small conference type room and wait with my husband. When the NP get in there she pulls out my path reports and things seem so much worse than what I had originally told. She pull out a drain with the long tubing and basically said I was coming home with at least one, that the radiation would start after the pathology report..(WHAT?!?) and if I need chemo...IF?!?! I asked if I would need chemo and from the breast biopsy report I was told no. I was also told at the time of the breast biopsy that my lymph nodes looked good. I did expect to have 2 removed so that was not a surprise. I asked about Brachytherapy like I have read in this thread. The answer was we don't do that here. So I asked why not? I never got an answer that really answered my question. Then I was told no driving for 2 weeks and no lifting for 4 weeks. I asked about that to because I have a special needs child that weighs 116 pounds. She was with me at the first appointment. She and my husband both were so there was no doubt what my life is like. I asked about my down time and 2 weeks taking it easy was what I expected. The actual hospital part was long but easy. I'm sorry if I made you worry it just wasn't what I was expecting.",

Its lIke no big deal you have radiation and new medication. Oh yeah and I have some lymphedema and cording from doing to much to soon. I had said to a sweet friend that sometimes I felt guilty because my cancer wasn't as bad as another friend's (she was herr+) that sweet friend stopped me in sentence and said cancer is cancer!

You always have positive things to say ♡ Tonight when I got to radiation I noticed a car with balloons tied to it in the radiation parking area (there is spots marked for rad patients only right up front ) when I got around the corner next to the car I saw a few people standing and sitting there and I realized it was someones friends and family waiting on them to come out. There was a bubble machine blowing bubbles, Celebration was playing and there was a big sign that had THANK YOU JESUS on her windshield. It was the most precious celebration right there in the parking garage. The family had been waiting 2 hours! The sweet young receptionist cued the family when the women was on her way out. It was her last day of radiation. If I could do this for each and everyone of you for your last treatment or surgery I WOULD!  ",

Last time I was in that waiting area was after my wire lock procedure. I almost wanted to walk in circles like I did before surgery! The tech that did the scan said I was so lucky the BC was found in December. She said that it was so deep that it could have been over looked. Thanks be to God that it was found early. I go back in November for my regular scheduled mammogram. Then in June for my right breast. I'll get 2 a year on the right and one on the left. You girls are all always in my thoughts!

Have you been to a PT or OT during this journey? I think it should be standard treatment for BC patients to receive services. I truly feel if I had received services earlier that my LE would not be as bad. I knew I had cording by the first of March but it was the end of April before I got the referral.

Then I foward you girls on the 24th. This December was mammograms, ultrasound sounds and cellulitis! 3bears, the only reason I got cards in the mail was because the coldest night this month our furnace had a switch go out at 10:15 and ot started making a loud banging noise and woke me up! DH and his heating and cooling guy worked on it untIL 1 a.m. and I worked on cards. I'm not sure if they made it on time but \"their in the mail\". My house is full. DD and family are here (even though they only live 3 miles away.) I can' wait to see the 2 y/o find his Santa stuff. He will be the fun one this year. My heart is full and my life is so blessed. I have found a true group of friends here who will forever light my darkest days. I'm in for any FB group if we get one started. My FB page is cancer free.

Then what should have been a 20 drive home took a hour and 20 minutes! I had to hussle the rest of the evening! Are you back in the USA? Good news that your care team thinks it's nothing to worry about. Then I have to say I worry about every thing now! I agree that the closer we get to the 5 year mark we will have a the feeling of peace! (At least a little) I'm not on tamoxifen anymore. I have blood work in March and I'm POST MENOPAUSAL..pissed me off!! I was still having periods every month until I started the tamoxifen. I was so angry. I didn't want another change but now I'm on Anastrozole and doing fine. The only SE I have noticed so far my fingernails have deep ridges and break real easy and my eye lashes are thinner. Of course the could be from the menopause. DCBC, my blood pressure was out the roof alot when I was on Tamoxifen. I would be 155/108 numbers like that. It was a constant thing but frequent. I have not had high numbers in 2 months so that makes me wonder of it was the tamoxifen. ..who knows but that's the only things that's changed. Shoregirl- you have had a lot on your list! Glad the back surgery went well and you are adjusting to the new ta-tas! Cowboyup -how exciting!!!! Please post pictures if you can! When my DD got married she was very pregnant (Shotgun wedding you should see the pictures! ) and they got married on April Fools Day. That girl has alway kept me guessing!

I physically didn't have any real SE but it forced me into menopause and now I'm on Anastrozole. My LE has been better the passed 2 months which makes me wonder of the tamoxifen was keeping it flared up. What set backs I have had are due to me over doing it. The pool is finally almost finished! The railing is all that needs to be done and if the weather holds out it should be done this week. Are you back in the states? I sent you a card and got it back in the mail this week.

I can relate to the feelings and doubt about all the decisions we are making right now. Then throw the future in the mix and BAM! Come on over shit fairy!

I have such brain fog lately I'm can't even keep up with all the post. I believe a few of you have said the samething. I'm usually were clear headed and have an excellent memory but not these last few days. I got a few bills starating to come in the mail. So far I owe $48.59. I was so excited! You know the initial rip in the envelope and look at the amount owed line. I even thought I can go shopping! Then thought better not! So I get home and open it all the way and there is $855.00 pending. That's just from the biopsies. That doesn't include the facility bill. The hospital will have a bill to. That comes separate then the doctor will send a bill. When my DH got home I told him we got the first bill he was taking his coat off he started putting it back on and asked if he needed to go back to work. Love that man! Annoyingboob, are you the one who suggested The Book of Joy? I looked at it and I think in will order it. I'm not much of a reader. Last book I read was The Fifty Shades of Grey collection. That a a bunch of kids books with the grandkids. I can't sit still long enough to read! So the post surgery will be a challenge to stay in one spot. I'm getting the car serviced now I had a few mintues to check in. Hope all are well! Oh! I am music junkie! I rather listen to music than watch TV. Mary J Blige is a favorite!",

I consider myself a lucky girl to find all of you. I hope that I will be a comfort to any of the girls that might join after I have my surgery. You women are so strong and have so much knowledge. I would not have a clue where to start without this thread. The love, laughter and honest responses have connected us all together! We have never been on a cruise. We love to travel but have never attempted a cruise. My husband and I are both so over protective of our AFL daughter (like a foster care) that we worry about needing medical care and not being able to get it quick enough. She has seizures (well controlled) and has several gastro issues and she aspirates which can make it tricky to feed her. We travel anywhere by car with her and have flown with her before 911. I wonder if all her medication could be carried on a flight now. No way I would check it in. When I say I work 24/7 I mean it lol. I love my Victoria Secret high impact sports bra. I have 3 and love them. I wish I could wear them post surgery but they are pull over racer back and TIGHT! The girls do not move while I'm at Zumba and I don't have uni-boob either. I got 2 Danskin zip front bras from Walmart a few days ago. I also got luck and found 2 soft button up tops that have a flannel look but are a warm jersey type material. Not what I would typically wear so glad they were cheap. I will make pj's out of the after this show is over. I imagine I will be living on yoga pants for a few days. So glad to hear everyone is getting good news and feeling so well. I wish I could hug you all!",

I just get overwhelmed when I start to research and then can't do it. My one appointment with my BS said no chemo, big maybe on radiation and medication for 5 years.

You are our biggest cheerleader and we are all cheering for you now. Win-chimed, your suga is the best! Thanks to all the girls who have checked on after surgery. We all look for those post. I need to know how all you ladies are. I might not be able to name you all but I honestly do check this thread every couple of hours. I check in and speed read and most of the time am not able to comment, I usually have a kid attached to one arm or both! My pre-op made me want to puke! (and I typically am not a puker) Was all they really necessary????? I have decided I shall call it FEAR-OP due to the fact that it scared the living hell out of me! Much love to the warriors of this group!",

I have been reading along and checking daily (sometimes many times a day) I still obviously need lots of support. My circle in real life is so small. The one friend I talk to the most is notea supportive with my choices. Doesn't think I need radiation or tamoxifen. Its all a money racket and I can do things a more natural way with natures medicine and clear thinking blah blah blah. I wish I could just throw caution to the wind and risk it. I can't. My FIL had a sier die from breast cancer a few years ago. She was mid 50's and lived in FL. She chose to not do radiation or medication. Just had a LX with clean margins and a tew years later the cancer returne and she passed away. With tears in his eyes my FIL said please do all they ask.

You will have your ROM back in no time. I'm going once a week now and have a compression sleeve. With all the lifting I do my RO and PT felt like I needed to stay on top of the lymphedema risk. If you are going to need radiation next definitely check into PT. My cording was not to bad. I was stretching and doing exercises before rads but I still got tighter during radiation.

After months of not being able to sleep (before the cancer diagnosis ) I was finally sleeping so well it was scary. I was afraid I wouldn't here my girl if she got up during the night. I have been on the tamoxifen a little over 3 months and have had only a few things I might consider SE. I have had the odd acne. It reminds me of when I took birth control pills in the 90's and I feel forgetful. Not sure of that's get this while crap journey or if it's the tamoxifen. Annoyingboob - I know that feels miserable! Sending you vibes to deflate soon! PugsMama - I am thankful you had a fabulous cruise! What a way to celebrate the end of chemo! Beachbabyk - I am grateful to you for starting this thread. This thread kept me sane when I felt like I was losing it...emotionally and physically. I turned 52 on Thursday. I was a bit of anews emotional mess. Thankful for another year but still a bit of a wreck from the past 6 months. DH went above and beyond this birthday and my card made me cry. I really scared the hell out of him. Our pool is almost finished. The deck is all that's left. I got in on Sunday with the kids. It's very hard to lift a 116 pound kid to toss in a pool. My girl can't climb the ladder that we are using the deck will make it a breeze to toss her in. That will happen after the propane tank is moved and buried on Tuesday. When we got in last Sunday the water was only 75 degrees and it put my lymphedema in over drive. I feel a little stupid for not thinking about the cold water causing as much damage as hot water...duh! My surgery boob is HUGE! My forearm is rather swollen and I have a golf ball size waders of fluid in my arm pit. The swelling under my shoulder blade looks nice in a tight top to...NOT! I am wearing a compression sleeve at night now and there is talk of a compression sleeve for my trunk to. I said like Spanx??? I might enjoy that one if it smoothes thing out! Holding you all close and missing you to! I wish we could all get together and celebrate the stromg women that we are!♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ Much love . Teresa PS baby Charlee is doing great! She up to 12.6 pounds. She is showing no signs of damage from the cord being wrapped around her neck. She will have a PT evaluation next week. If she needs it early intervention is the key! She is a very happy baby and wants to to talk already.",

I can't weary pretty bras and I am tired of hiding this dang compression sleeve. That's like waving a flag \"I had BC\" so many people don't know (like my parents, still haven't told them). Anyway, I started just researching LE. I'm a little embarrassed to say I know so little about it since my background is OT. I focused mainly on pediatrics (not surprising huh?) So in my late night Google search I found tamoxifen and radiation connected to LE. Radiation I knew could cause some LE so that wasn't a surprise. The tamoxifen piece was news to me. I'm just curious if anyone else taking tamoxifen is having LE. Plus...I have had a period since January. My oncologist said that tamoxifen will not cause menopause or cease my cycle. My PCP is worried that if my hormone levels indicate I'm not in menopause then I should be \"bleeding\". I will be addressing all this in the next few weeks I guess. I see both my RO and Oncologist the first of September. I am rambling now so I with hush! Much love to you all! Thank you each and everyone for what you bring to our group! Teresa",

For the first time yesterday I pulled my pathology report out and really read it. I was so close to needing chemo! No way I could have hidden that from anyone. I think if I had taken the time to go over it before now I would have been a basket case! Now I count my blessings (I count this thread and you girls TWICE!) and try to live in peace! Just breath and enjoy life! After a long summer of pool drama we are heading to Pigeon Forge for a few days with 2 of the grandkids and our girl. Going to stay at the Wilderness of the Smokies for a couple of days and go to Dollywood (we have had season passes for 15 years ) . My DH went and ordered the materials for the pool deck and it takes 21 business days to get! He had been working with the pro-desk at Home Depot for a few months and no one informed him that the kiln dried lumber in 20' pieces would take that long! He would have ordered it a month ago but didn't want it laying around while the repairs were being made to the pool liner and floor. We have had the coolest July on record in like 72 years...lol I am sitting out on the veranda with a jacket on this morning ! The weather has been so wonderful but not to heat up 17,000+ gallons of water! Have a blessed weekend! XOXOXO Teresa ",

Dcbc-I did not realize you had failed lumpectomies! Bless you my friend! Yay for having your daughter home. Last weekend when we had the surprise snow that came with lots of power outages and my DD and family didn't have power so they were here with 4 of the grandkids. I was in heaven!! Seeing that baby first thing in the morning was pure joy! Annoyingboob - Love the picture! What a cute Santa suit on an adorable dog! Not to mention the setting... Now for my brief whine secession. ..my surgery was easy, radiation was uneventful, tamoxifen has not been an issue but this LE is about to push me to the edge! Sunday my elbow was a little sore. I noticed it was tender when I did my Flexitouch pump on Sunday night. Monday morning I found a lump on my elbow. Great I thought. .I have lymph fluid pooling. I had a full week of appointments so I didn't worry. I had my 3D mammogram on Monday..all clear. Tuesday was ultrasound (the one were the machine sits on your boob and smushes deeper and deeper can' remember what it's called) then off to therapy. I was referred to OT now for the laser/infrared therapy. Get there do the paper work. I tell the OT about the lump. Take my compression sleeve off. The OT sent me straight to urgent care. Apparently it's not fluid. Since I'm on tamoxifen time to rule out blood clot. IN MY ARM???? I wasn't even worried about that. Urgent care decided I need to see the oncologist. Oncologist office calls and says \"you have an appointment in 9 days. We will check it then\"...uhhhhh no you will see me now. I got an appointment the next day. The lump was puzzling to the oncologist so I was sent for an ultrasound. I get a call that night. I have cellulitis. I guess the location and the perfect roundness made it feel like an enlarged lymph node. Since I wear my compression sleeve all day I didn't realize the lump was red and hot. I always have a garment of some kind on that arm. The shower is the only time I don't have one on. If I had waited to see the oncologist on my scheduled appointment I probably would have ended up in the hospital with this cellulitis. Now I'm on mega antibiotics AGAIN! My va-jaja does not like antibiotics. This is my 3rd round of them since finishing radiation. I am thankful that the cellulitis is treatble but dang! Thank you for letting me whine. I truly want to cry but I don't allow myself to. My DH is a trooper for watching the kids and helping out without me asking. When we figured out were the cellulitis came from I think it shook him. He realized how fragile I am now. I have always been the tough girl. (Even though I'm small) the cellulitis came from a poke under my thumb nail. When I was decorating the Christmas tree I stabbed under my thumb nail in the LE side with a pipe cleaner. I didn't know I should be wearing plastic gloves when I handle raw meat. I had handled, beef stew, pot roast, top steak, chicken, bacon and sauage. I am always cooking! That's what a southern girl does! With the kids being here I had cooked more than normal. This is hard. I am a do it my own damn self girl. Whine over... much love to all my surgery sisters. We have all had ups and downs on this journey. I couldn't do it without you.♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡◇ My tree that has had a 2 y/o all over it...lol it is not a pristine as it normally is but I love it anyway .",

I see the NP who specializes in women's health at the practice so he shocked. Anyway, he was a great comfort to my DH and was truly \"YOU GOT THIS\" that we needed not to stress.

I think we all have some struggle preparing for this road no one wants to travel but to have just went through your previous health issues is just not fair! (Only way to put it!) I recently read an article (on this site somewhere) about PTSD and BC and I truly never thought about PTSD after a diagnosis. Then I realized how real it is and that this anxiety and shit fairy visits (crazy thoughts that we have at night) are the exactly that....PTSD in the making. You will find amazing support here. I haven't had surgery or actually much of anything other than a diagnosis and lots of fears! I have more anxiety about after surgery. I just want the crap out of my body and back to my so called normal life! Hope all are feeling well and have small celebrations today. I might start my boon selfies today. I hadn't thought of that!

Wow I last checked in just before I picked up my grandson and I had quiet a bit of checking up to do. Shellybeans, first off, your name makes me smile. Our oldest daughter, Michelle who died unexpectedly in 2013 was always called Shellybean. When I see your name I think of Michelle's gypsy spirit and her love of nature. Your story is so beautiful. I have been slow to post anything about me because I'm so afraid someone local will see my profile and tell everyone that I have BC. I just posted my picture last night. Taking a real leap of faith. I to have a child with different abilities. She is 27 and she us the love of my life. She is always by my side and I have an audience for everything I do. She is not actually mine. I have had her for 17 years. She was only 10 years old when I met her. She is like a toodler. Always happy and curious about everything. She will always be \"our baby\". My grandchildren love her and she is always the first playmate they have so they grow up with her. Your daughter is so fortunate to have a Mom who is a fighter! I know you are probably thinking you are fortunate to have her and knowing what really matters in life. So when I was freaking out about missing work now everyone knows why. My work is my life. In 17 years I been away from her 11 days. I will be away from her 2 days after my surgery. I have been stressing out about her care not mine.. 3bears, you are beautiful! This is one group of beautiful ladies inside and out! So honored to be apart of this group no one wants to be in! Much love and \"shuga' as windchimed always gives us (freaking love that)",

She always been a little out there with her thinking and inner peace stuff but I love her anyway. She will be my biggest support with my child to BUT....the other day she said...I open myself up to cancer because I think it's real. That cancer does not exist unless you believe in it.....REALLY????? she's said I shouldn't have surgery that I should try alternative methods. What the heck do you say to all that?!?! She also said I shouldn't spend so much time with this group because it is allowing the vibes of cancer to stay active in my mind and spirit. All the radiation and chemo is a huge don't do that with her to. So I'm sending you extra love because I get it! My BC is at 11 oclock in my right breast. I had a biopsy done on December 20 and according to that it's small. I didn't even bruise from the biopsy and the incision was gone in 2 days. I had just a fibroid removed from the same breast in 2006 It was actually bigger than what I have now. It would have been located about 3 o'clock. I guess I'm expecting to have the same after surgery results. ...sigh I didn't have my girl for 2 and half days. I had half my thyroid removed in 2010 (Elem you had a total thyroidectomy right) and I didn't have her for 4 days. Guess that's what I'm expecting this time to. To all you beautiful ladies...I want to hug you all have the we're going to be ok cry then celebrate at the bar with a sweet frosty drink and laugh and tell boob stories.. the ones that start...you aren't going to believe this....",

I get so over whelmed with all the reading. I just can't sit still most das and now it's worse than ever. I had read about a little pH levels and how they relate to cancer. I found that super interesting since my hair dresser told me 10+ years ago I had a high pH that I need to use a different shampoo. She asked of my head was itchy and it was but they was no dandruff my head was just tingly itchy. I switched shampoo and my hear hasn't itched since. Then I read about drinking the water with Himalayan salt and organic lemon. Things that make you go...hummmm...could it be that's what my deal is???? Especially since I crave salt badddd! Ok...what exactly is a mammaprint? I asked at my pre-op and was told we don do that??? Is it important? I guess I'm scared to research to much. You know...denial....I guess when my reality check bounces I'll know I need to get out of that state of denial! I eat healthy all the time usually. The ice cream thing has been all for comfort these past few weeks. I have gave it up that past few night to. I did eat part of a funnel cake at the circus. First one I have had in 20 years! I'm glad it wasn't that good to me or I would have ate the whole thing. Tomorrow is alost here. I have done everything I can to be ready for this journey. My DH is amazing and it now his time to shine! I have cooked and shopped for 4 days now. Let's hope I can give clear instructions on how to turn the microwave and stove on. Lol. My boob is hurting...not throbbing not usual getting ready to start sensitive either. It's weird.. like a bruise. Not sharp pains just a sready sore type pain. I had no pain after my biopsies either which were December 20th. This started a few days ago and I am trying to pay more attention to my body. I ignore pain and just push forward. That's why my thyroid surgery was so bad. I just thought not being able to swallow, breath and choking while I slept was my new normal hahaha. Boy this is a long post. Sitting in the car rider line to pick up my grandson. Oh how that boy loves me. What is he going to do when Gowa (what my grandkids call me) won't be able to get him for a few days. Really what am I going to do???? Any advice what to eat the night before? I am not a good puker. I do not have a strong gag reflex so throwing up is more or a dry heave thing. TMI....

Maybe that's why I felt a little crazy the past few days. I still haven't told my family that the procedure was actually a lumpectomy for cancer. If I miss the chemo train I should be able to pull this whole charade off. I still wonder of I should tell my niece's. They are in their late 30's and I have 3 great nieces 16,13 and 8. My daughter will know when the time is right. I loved all the post of the normal days! It brings me big smiles to read about you girls doing the things you love!

Youngest grandson and parents came over last night. He is 22 months and a big boy. He cries because I couldn't pick him up and it broke my heart. I was able to sit and hold him so that helped. I know it will take a little longer for my normal. The average person doesn't drag a wheelchair in and out of a minivan. The chair is only about 32 pounds it's not that heavy. Maybe I will be told today I can lift it. Finger crossed! Bevmomduc, extra hug for you and a prayer for your brother! To all my other girls. ..we could use a does of windchimed suga!",

I have made it through day 2! DH just had cookies and milk . I didn't even want them. I had Greek Yogurt today and it satisfied my sweet craving. In the past if I wanted something sweet I could eat a pickle and mess my craving up lol! I have been meaning to tell you were an adorable little girl! Your mother is beautiful to! One more question. Since surgery I am up 2 times a night to pee! This is not normal for me. It's making me so mad! I am not doing anything different than before surgery. It's around 1:30-2:00 and 4-4:30. If I could just fall back asleep I might not get as well...pissed about it! It's takes forever to get back to sleep then it's time to pee again!!! Good night beautiful ladies!

She's starting to stay awake more and is eating more. She's a sweet baby and only cries when she is hungry. The boys seemed to cry more than she does. It's finally spring in the mountains! 78 degrees today! DH and I are taking my 11 y/o grandson and our girl to see Steve Miller Band tonight. This is grandson's first real concert.

I had been asked several times who my navigator was and my answer was gezzh I don't know. Apparently I slipped through the cracks and she just now found my file and called to talk to me about my BC and what to expect, treatments to expect surgery. Really? I let her talk for awhile before I said....I'm on day 7 of radiation. Silence from her side. Oh well better late than never. So now I have a list of all the local resources and support groups. So glad I found you girls or I was have been alone until today! Time to celebrate 3bears and pugsmama! Drinks at the cabana! !",

I am always doing more with this arm than I should. The one I ordered looks like a tattoo to! I have always wanted a tattoo. ..careful what you wish for! The night time one is kind of squishy and soft. I was told on a really busy day I should wear it at night. So that means everyday I guess. I'm always busy and the surgery side is my dominant hand. Plus I have an old hand injury from 2004 that doesn't help the lymphedema and cording. It just adds more \"back drag\" to my stretch.",

I haven't read one post that I considered whining! Every emotion, thought and feeling is justified here! Come on back anytime. I check the post daily. Now that it's summer I'm a lititle busier with the grandkids but I try to respond as soon as I can. Annoyingboob - the biotene spray is the bomb! I am pretty sure the tamoxifen is making me have dry mouth now. I use it every night before I go to sleep. If I don't I wake up feeling like the Sahara Desert! I also read that lemon drops are really helpful for chemo patients. I have made 2 care packages now. For my friend who had the BMX I put the biotene, small tube of Aquaphor hand lotion, a travel size pillow and pink Mardi Gras beads. After all the people who saw my boobs, wrote on my boobs, moved my boobs and photographed my boobs I felt like I had earned some damn beads! So I got my friend a set. The other person I got a lipsense kit \"kiss for a cause\" it's a bright pink lip tint and part of the sales goes to cancer research and a pretty bracelet that has the \"hope, strength and courage\" in it.

I seriously worried about the whole poop thing because I know what those pain medications do to your digestive system! Keefer helps keep me moving now. I will have to double up after surgery I guess. ....***sigh**** Fightygirl, really no bra?!?! I can't go without one lol. I wondered what you lumpectomy girls do anything besides a sports bra. I'm a 36 DD so I need to have a plan for what to wear after surgery. Pugsmama, I have pretty long hair. It's the middle of my back and I'm wondering how I will manage it???? I will probably end up going to to the salon just to get my hair washed and styled. I have thought of so many ridiculous things. I'm right handed and my right boob is the issue so this list of how will I goes on and on haha. Like I have never changed a tampon with my left hand or wiped my butt?!?! I'm telling you my mind is losing it !?! Itching is good! Healing is happening! Did all or any of you have biopsies? Just curious. I did and I didn't bruise and the incision spot healed so fast. Talk to you girls soone....you are my FB",

I prefer the racer back pull over kind and have several but could not imagine squeezing into them after surgery. Thanks for the chuckle as well. I needed it before I went to sleep last night.

I took a couple of round of prescription strength Vitamin D and was supposed o bee taking a daily dose but would always forget. I jut read all data on Vitamin D and BC yesterday.

The staff were amazing with my girl and the advances in diagnostic procedures made it quick to get the pneumonia diagnosis. There had been absolutely no signs! No fever (dropped her off about 1 at guardians happy, smiling and no breathing issues ) excellent appetite, sleeping well no wheezing. We are home now and she is fever free and coughing some. I haven't been in the hospital since my surgery and preop. I almost felt panicky. If you girls could send some good vibes or say a little prayer for quick healing that would be awesome. Much love!",

I have silent reflux it was discovered when I had the right side of my thyroid removed(large nodule that had grown on the right side and around my misplaced carotid artery). Then the antibiotics, then the probiotics and tamoxifen and more antibiotics! My goal is to get off the blood pressure and reflux meds.

My scars from previous surgeries I wouldn't be able to find if ididn't know where they are but I think this one will be different. Not that I care of you can see it but I want it to heal quickly. The one on my throat from my thyroid surgery I was told to keep sun block on for a year even in the winter or keep it covered in the sun. This scar will not be exposed to any sun lol unless those drinks at the bar take me back a few years. ..

Figthingirl, I wanted a few more button up tops to because all the ones I have a pretty fitted and I would need good ROM to put them on. I found 2 'eh ones at Walmart . No luck at other stores. So then I get it in my head I want pink button downs. My MIL suggested the Goodwill and BAM found 4 small men's button down shirts! They are all different shades and some are striped. They are small to! I think I can wear them with leggings and skinny jeans. I know it's different since I do.not have a real job. I could wear my pj's while I'm working and healing .

Bevmomduck - so good to hear from you. Glad you are doing well with the extra tug at your heart. You are in my prayers. We lost our oldest daughter in 2013 and my sister in 2015. Shellybeans - you made me think of my dear friend who had BC 9 years ago. The only thing she could eat was biscuits and gravy from Bojangles. The penny comment made me think of how her cuz that's what she said. Good luck with the next treatment. Annoyingboob - you are our biggest cheerleader! I get the arm thing to! WTH! it did not have that big of a break how could I get so weak so fast??? I had my low maintenance 11 year old grandson this weekend and for the first time in my life he wore me out! For the first time in my life I feel my age and it doesn't feel good...lol Elem- I'm right behind you with radiation. I have my first appointment on the 21st for my tattoos. I should be on about the same treatment path as you. Any information is welcome! PugsMama- can you believe I don't have a new granddaughter yet??? That girl is being stubborn. Hope that you have an ease round with your chemo this week. I have stayed away from the sugar to!! I did get a head ache the 2 day. I am feeling so much better. Not a sluggish or gassy! (TMI) ;o) Much love to all you beautiful girls! Got to get my DHs cobbler out of the oven.",

I feel so lonelyat times. I have kept my distance with my friends because of the BC. My husband was by my side for almost 3 months. No he is back to work doing double time and here I am...lost without him. Now that the weather is starting to warm up I hope to be outside more shaking this feeling off! I know when the rads start I will be back is rush mode again. DD is managing the 2 babies so well. I couldn't be prouder of her! I just I'm in tbe what now phase of all the BCBS! I hope you all have a lovely weekend. I have a women's banquet at church and am looking foward to it. Oh yeah, the cancer center has a few excellent classes coming up. The survivorship one I have read about in some post, a nutrition class, an exercise class and a few others. There s a total of 6 weeks one night a week. When I signed up I was told NO.... your not done yet? !? WTH! I have to be completely finished with everything before I can take the classes. When they actually start I should only have 2 weeks of rads left. I wouldn't care that they told me no except the next group of classes is in the fall! Really? Why wouldn't they offer them every 8 weeks? I don't know that I will even know when the next round starts. I shouldn't have any reason to be at the cancer center. (Fingers crossed )",

There's been a few times my chest has gotten hot and I can feel it creeping up my neck and I kind of get this oh hell no attitude! Then it stops LOL so happy that you are almost done with the chemo train! When that train hits the station there will be a celebration! ! I have felt fine up until this point. Nothing's really bothered me not even the SNB. All of a sudden I feel like I have a golf ball in my armpit my boob hurts and I think I've got some cording going on. Pretty sure it's a seroma. Thank goodness for the ladies on the lumpectomy Lounge thread they are a big help with things like this. This is the first time since surgery that I'm really tired and really don't even want to get dressed. I want to play the C card to get out of everything kind of hard to when nobody knows you have the C. I still have not told my parents or very many people. I called the cancer center last week's about my arm because I knew it was the start of cording. They never called me back. Their message States please do not leave multiple messages so I tried to respect that. I thought I would just wait till my appointment today with my RO and have her look at it. Now I'm sorry I wasn't a pain in the ass cuz it's hurting all the way up my shoulder! Thanks for listening girls got to get busy got to deliver Meals on Wheels and get to my radiation appointment. Have a cozy day! Cold with a chance of flurries here today.",

So next week for spring break with the kids I get to do PT and my radiation. Then to add to it I burnt my SNB arm a little on the oven rack tonight. I am just tired and needed to tell someone and there is no one to tell but you girls. Did I mention my favorite sweetest aunt passed away to?

I have a church friend who has just gone there 7+months of BC. She is herr+ and has one heck of a journey. I was surprised that she was put on tamoxifen while she was doing chemo. She had a BMX a few weeks ago after chemo was finished and I had fixed dinner for her and her DH a couple of nights. We were able to talk some while in was there. She was not able to take the tamoxifen due to side effects and was put on something else. I can't remember what now. But either was I was shocked she was put on anything during chemo. So I agree with PugsMama! Now all about me. I just finished day 5 of radiation. No issues ....yet. I also just finished my first bottle of tamoxifen. I have lost 7 pounds, sleep sound and have no SE so far. I keep waiting on the rug to be yanked out from underneath me! Easter is at my house so I have lots to do to get ready for all the grandkids, parents and inlaws. Have a beautiful Easter weekend. The stone is rolled away! #feelingblessed",

I ended up at the hospital thinking it was something to do with the tubal. I haven't had a problem with them since but boy do I remember the pain. Ali- I think I will always worry!! I just read the other day that 30-40% of IDC will reoccurre! I did not research the source I just want to forget I read that! When friends share BC article and stories on FB like an idiot I have to read them. The fear is there without all the reminders popping up around us! Life is almost good her under the Carolina blue sky! Our pool was finished and we were working on the deck. I was putting beautiful river stone around the outside and DH was building the deck. There was a problem with the liner and we had to drain the pool (17,000 gallons of water!) So the linet could be reinstalled. That put a halt to all the work because the liner would not be easy to get to with the decking (I requested a big deck and I'm getting it!) The reinstalled took place Friday and we had it filled back up by Sunday morning. The kids have been in several times. DH put the ladder where they could at least crawl in until the deck is finished. I got in last night and the water was 84. It was so nice. There has been a few bumps in summer but LIFE is still good. XOXO XOXO Teresa",

I see her every 3 months. Is that what most of you ate doing? I see my RO every 3 months to. Maybe it's because of the LE. Which is getting so much better!!! I think the supplements are helping. They are ripping my stomach up a bit so I have taken half what was suggested hoping that stomach will settle down. Doesn't help that I'm now on Augmentin we all know what that stuff does to your \"gut health!\" Hugs to all! Teresa",

What a difference a day makes!! What a good doctor to get you set up with someone she knows. Sending good vibes for an easy transition ti the new plastic surgeon. My hospital system went out of network with BCBS for 3 months is was a nightmare! I was still having many appointments and had cellulitis during that time. I had sign all the continuity of care papers but apparently they got missed filed. I'm still trying to get some of the bills worked out. Like my cellulitis, all my tests for December 14th that bill totals $840+! The hospital system went back into network with BCBS December 15th! I see my oncologist every 3 months. I go this Tuesday. I saw my radiation oncologist on Thursday. Not planned. That's who follows my LE and I got stung by some ugly little bug on my LE arm and chest. That happened on Monday. By Thursday I had an orange peel feeling rash under my skin from my chin all the way down my body to my ankles. I'm on antibiotics for 10 days...sigh this LE has been a HUGE issue for me! April and May were the 2 best months I have had since this storm started! Then came June...I had not had a period in 17 months. Oncologist did blood were in March those results were post menopausal. Stop Tamoxifen go on Anastrozole. I have lost 13 pounds and have loads of energy! Then...I started spotting and more blood work was ordered the results were perimenopausal! So stop Anastrozole and go back on Tamoxifen! The spotting lasted 15 days and that earned me a pelvic exam, a pap smear, transvaginal ultrasound and a endometrial biopsy. I should have the results of the endometrial biopsy next week. I feel like it's fine because I have no symptoms of any kind of a problem. Just the spotting for 15 days and my oncologist referred to that as a period...my PCP said we are going to be proactive and check everything. What a journey this has been. When I look back on the night I got my diagnosis I immediately started to Google search any info I could find on BC and I found BCO and this thread of the amazing women. What a blessing to not have to walk this alone and have someone understand what we feeling or fearing. Hugs to you and good vibes for easy recovery and 100% satisfaction when you are done with surgeries! Teresa",

I have had constant cording since my lumpectomy is February 2017. I recently just had cording from my ribs to my bellybuttom (all from a colonoscopy ) I didn't even know you could have cording there. Apparently it's anywhere in the quadrant of your body where you have the lymph node biopsy. What makes me think cording is you said when you sleep a certain way or reach. My cording would wake me up at night it wasn't really painful just annoying. Heat and ice will not help you need to stretch it out. It would be worth it to see a certified lymphedema therapist see if you can get your doctor to make you a referral. Hope that helps! I get freaked out about everything!

I have not told my family that I have breast cancer and I'm so afraid that someone will figure out who I am, especially since the blog is easily accessed through Face Book. It was a big step for me to create an account and post. I'm so glad I did! I need the support that I receive here. My husband is amazing but no one understands my emotions, fears and anxiety like the ladies in this group! Now for a few questions...I finally got my pathology report and have spent the afternoon trying to figure it all out. My report is Right breast core needle biopsy: Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1 vs grade 2. Intermediate ductal carcinoma in situ with focal comedo necrosis and dystrophic calcifications. I am ER+ (>99%) PR+(>99%) HERR- I am scheduled for a lumpectomy in February. A mastectomy was not suggested at all and I see diagnosis close to mine and mastectomy was the surgery. I'm so confused! Also the genetic testing??? it was not suggested but I am pretty sure I am the first person in my family with breast cancer. Should I tell my nieces about the cancer? I will tell my daughter soon. She is very pregnant and I do not want to stress her out. Any input is welcome!! I just want to make sure I look at this with my eyes wide open.

Pyrrh, so glad you are doing so well! Hope that FightingGMA checks in soon. Annoyingboob, my parents are in their 80's as well. They have lost 2 children out of the 5. My sister just passed away suddenly (pneumonia and a insulin pump failure, she only had it 2-3 weeks!) August 2015 and she was 51. The same age I am right now. When my sister died I watched my parents fall apart. These 2 individuals who always support everyone and do so much for everyone else were helpless. My mom got really sick from the stress. My Daddy was so nervous and he has always been so grounded. I ran myself crazy trying to keep my house and their house together. Plus put dinner on both tables every night. We live 3.7 miles apart so to hide everything will be difficult. We go to the same church and talk daily. I will have to tell the about the surgery. I had a fibroid removed in 2005 and I will tell them and everyone else that I am having the same surgery. I allowed myself 4 days with that surgery. The only difference was that fibroid was not cancer and it was close to the surface. My right boob truly is my annoying boob! It's slightly bigger than the left, had mastitis in it, its bumper than the left and now has cancer...Annoying it is! To all you ladies returning to work, hope that its a smooth transition back. I will take as little time off as possible. I to work from home and will tell the office I contract will as little as possible! Have a good evening!",

Hope you are all home soon and check in when you can. Cocktails will be at the bat when you arrive. Welcome to the new girls. This group keeps me going. The support, the laughter plus the unconditional love that we share with ladies we only know by diagnosis and code names is pretty amazing. Which I wasn't to original with my name...duh it would be so easy to figure out who I am if anyone I actually know looks there or if the FB page posts any of this blog. DCISinAZ- so sorry about your furbaby! Pets are family to! (((((Hugs)))))) Maya15- for your gap in your resume. You took the time off to care for a very close family member while they were recovering from an extended illness. So much truth in that! Goingon75- I LOVE your quote! My faith is strong! Thank you for sharing. That will help keep me focused on my faith. We all have been programmed to fear. The media keeps that instilled in us. Annoyingboob- as PugsMama put it...YES ...long live Annoyingboob as King of BC! Cowboy-up- DANG! Those medical expenses! I got a bill after my ultrasound for close to $500. I couldn't believe it so I calles...nope ot was right that was my part. They did discout it to $387.50 since I paid it in full. That was for the first ulira sound that came back all clear. I was told your good keep your regular mammogram. Which was in 2 months. Go for mammogram get a call I need an ultra sound! I've already had one! It was clear! No...it's a different area. That ultra sound didn't do the whole breast just that are of concern and that area is fine. So here we go! I've had another ultrasound, 2 mammograms and a 3D mammogram plus the biopsies. I'm afraid to check the mail at this point! No bills yet but I know they are coming! Its another rainy day here. I have the need to clean and organize. While cooking dinner last night I blew the leaves out of the carport, blew the driveway off and mopped my breezeway and area in front of the front door. If everything is clean and organized I look like I have my shit together right? Have a beautiful day ladies! If you are returning to work today...good luck and the force is with you! ( that's us!) ",

So your Mom is so right and by you sharing that gave so much power to the conversation with my friend. I actually told someone that I am having surgery. No BC details just fibroid/small cyst removal.

That's right ladies who doesn't love a trip to Target. I had not been since before Christmas so it was a long over due trip. I just strolled around the store with my Starbucks chocolate smoothie like I had all day. I wanted to make sure I got my DH a Valentine's card before my surgery. I wasn't sure is if I would be able to get a card after the surgery. I'm still in nesting mode like several of you girls. Bandyrose, I hope to hear from you soon! Healing vibes going out for you from NC. 3bears, ((((((hugs)))))) I agree that some dark days are to be expected but I am so proud off all the girls following this thread. From all the posts it I think that there is a good balance of respecting our own feelings and taking the time to process the dark days. I know I have had my share of dark days and this thread has been a bright spot for the dark times. Docmama, I saw that BMW and I was like lol there's a procedure that's BMW. DUH! There are so many abbreviations I haven't a clue what they all stand for. YAY for showers! Another one of those wonderful milestones. Hope all goes well with the echocardiogram today. Love the picture you shared! I love Florida especially the Gulf Coast area. Dcbc< so good to hear from you!! Rest up and catch up when you can. DaniCalifornia, thanks for checking in. Sounds like you are on the mend. I think my surgery will be much like your except the right side ( and I'm HER-) Your DH does sound like a dear! Wanting to stay next to you while you slept! Jinmo, the elephant imagine..LMAO! Yes we get it! The no headlights is so something me or my husband would say. I tell everyone faith and humor is all I got! FightingGMA, good to see you are having a better week. Excellent news from the surgeon to! I will keep my fingers crossed for no chemo. Friday seems so far away but it will be here before you know it! Leftcoastie, three cheers for no drains and a shower...a real shower! Think pink! ;o) Pugmama, hope you got good news today to! Shellybeans, I just looked at the calendar yesterday and said...shit! pre-op is next Tuesday! How did this time go by so fast?? I could have had my surgery as early as Jan 2 but chose to have it later so I could get prepared. Are we ever really prepared??? If you are still adding music to the playlist I have a few to add: Kelly Clarkson, Stronger; T.L. C, Waterfalls; Katy Perry, Wide Awake; Janet Jackson, Alright; Alicia Keys, This Girl is on Fire, Cee Lo Green, F*ck You; Charles Hamilton, New York Raining; Fergie, Glamorous and Fergalicious; plus a little DMX, What's My Name and Ludacris, Get Back. Now when you make to the bungalow there will be a whole new playlist! Bdagal, I plan to be back to work A.S.A.P just like you! On my surgery day I need to be at the cancer (hate to even type that word) center at 6:30 to have the \"wire\" inserted then go straight to the hospital for surgery. My husband will be with be for the wire then drive me to the hospital. My DMIL wants to ride along. She is the only one in the family who knows I have BC. When I get to the hospital I know that my husband can stay until they wheel me to surgery. I have had 3 other surgeries (right side of my thyroid removed, tubal and a fibroid removed from my right breast) and he got to stayed with me until the wheeled me to the OR. Fightingirl, I can't remember shit! I will be paying close attention to your radiation info. I was told that I would not need chemo and they was a good chance I would not need radiation. I cant hope for to much now can I? As much as the shit fairy show up so does the fairy from Lala land. She tells me that when the surgeon gets in there he will say...cancer...what cancer...this girl doesn't have cancer....I think I need a pill for both those fairies! This is a very long post I never have time to just sit down and read and post but today my girl isn't feeling well. So I have been in the recliner cuddling with her catching up. Much love to you all!

Annoyingboob - we haven't even talked about our taxes yet! We just filed last year's this past October! My DH is self employed and with his rental properties I am glad he takes care of all the tax return. My income is not taxed so it's not included. How is the tamoxifen going? I think I almost had my first hotflash! I started to feel hot them it went away! I'm always cold so I was like oh hell no! I might have talked myself out of it! Haha Have a great weekend!

My RO called me today and I only have to do 4 weeks. At first I was told 6 but after all my scans two weeks ago the team feels I am a good candidate for the 4 weeks not the 6. If at any point the 4 is to much ot will go to six. I have not clue what to expect but I have made my radiation Playlist and will try to be ready to tackle this next phase of BC.

I have my moment and thank God for his many blessings and try to move on. I just wonder how long this will go on? This LE is a constant reminder the I had breast cancer! If it weren't for that I might not get stuck in my thoughts of where I have been. HAve you got your appointment with the nutritionist yet? I see someone every 3 months. My radiation oncologist and oncologist. I have scans every 6 months the RO has ordered some new ultrasound for December to. Makes me nervous! She described it a scan that fits around your breast and makes multiple images at many different angels and depths. That's scheduled for December. Annoyingboob - when I had my scan I was walking around the waiting area like a caged animal. Just like before surgery. Same damn room! Thank goodness it was nothing to worry about. I had DCIS and IDC but was told the IDC trumps the DCIS so it was never mentioned again. I was also told on 3 different occasions by different people that I had won the breast cancer lottery. ( for real) that my cancer was treatable. How comforting is that?!? Then there was the nurse on my LAST day of radiation that looks at me and said \"I would have had a mastectomy if I were you\" . You can imagine were my silly little brain went with that! I asked her why and her response was she just would have \"so she wouldn't have to go through it again\" REALLY?!? so after rads I was a basket case thinking everything wold come back. My life (and body ) have changed so much in 9 months (atleast with pregnancy you get a prize at the end...lol ) I am trying not to be a whiny mess but sometimes I really really want to be one! Again I think this LE is what causing it all. Maybe the tamoxifen has a little to do with it to who knows. I got my new night garment and I love it! I am sleeping so well with it. DH says it looks like a bullet proof vest. I was afraid it was be scratchy on him because I truly sleep under his left arm and across his chest so my LE side is on him. Life is still good. The g-babies make sure of that! The 2 y/o always wants to come to \"Awh's house\". Baby Charlee just smiles all the time and the big kids keep me busy to. Much love to all you ladies!!!",

The day of my biopsies my husband forgot and didn't remind him because I truly didn't think it would be cancer. I had to get our daughter ( who is 6 months pregnant and has a 19 months old) to drive me. He did drive me to the surgeon appointment. No need or reminders there! I wish I had found this group before my appointment. I still am confused about all the letters, abbreviations and numbers! What I do know is my cancer is grade1 (slow growing) and smaller than an earser on the end of a pencil. I might not need radiation. That will be determined after the lymph nodes biopsies come back. I was excited to read that down time is only about a week. I am a busy housewife with 5 soon to be 6 grandchildren. My husband and I are very active as well. I love the feel of my girls and my husband dislikes implants so I doubt I would have rushed into another surgery. I don't have alot of time to get on here there's always kids at my house! I a neat freak and have this crazy idea that if my house is in order so is my life! Prayers for quick healing and peaceful",

My first Depo shot really did change anything and at the of the 3 months I got another. Well, my boobs went from a 34B to a 34D and I felt pregnant. I actually had people ask me if I had implants. The bust size was very noticeable. I didnt get anotherdepo shot and I did not have another period until 9 months after the second shot. I also had to take a mega dose of progesterone for 21 days to make my cycle start. So things that make you go hummmm?..... Fightgirl, did you have implants already? I have heavy boobs. I am uncomfortable without a bra and my headlights are Always on. I am so afraid I'm going to cancer my husband out! We have had a rough few years.

So many worries! Thank goodness for this blog! REAL women who get it!",

Welcome to the group that truly no one wants to join. I have not had my surgery yet and have only told a total of 5 people about my BC so this group of girls are my main support system. Edge of no return, you are one step ahead by being able to tell us about your feelings. Trust that the ladies hear to listen and offer words or encouragement. I'm not fimilar with all the boards (I'm kind of new) but if one was suggested I bet you will find someone who has been there and will relate Annoyingboob, moose tracks is vanull ice cream with a chocolate swirl and chunks of chocolate covered peanut butter. That was my dinner last night. Have any of you looked at you labs from blood work? My sodium is low which it never has been before. I had half my thyroid removed in 2010 so I get blood work every 6 months. (Suppose to anyway) my blood work is always very good except with my Vitamin D being low at times. Just curious. I do know that for the past 2 months I have craved salt so bad! I never use salt and I have been salt! I also noticed if I got a headache that sea salt overload would make the head ache go away. ..odd",

Thanks to you all for the support. It truly does help. Even just hanging out at the house yesterday I walked 6 miles. I contribute several of those steps from forgetting what I was doing like Fightgirl said. Four trips downstairs for a can of tomato sauce before I actually brought one upstairs...smh! YAY! For all those with good reports and for checking in. I was told I would be on one of the medications for 5 years as well. I havent even began to look at all that! As far as menopause goes, I'm not showing any signs. I assume that possibly that was part of my blood work. Thanks again for all the support! I would be fine if it were just me and my husband that had to know. ",

I have to get mine at the cancer center then go to the hospital. That's a 20 minute drive, plus parking then walking in the hospital. So depending on the traffic for the drive there and what parking issue I might run into it could add up to 45 minutes Is it safe to assume I won't be able to wear a bra after I get this \"wire\".

I still can't believe it! I wanted 6 kids and my husband said no way! We had 2 girls who swore they were never having children. Looks like I'm getting my 6 after all ;o). Lamamama, welcome to the group. I haven't had surgery it is coming in 9 days. (About to get real!) So many of the ladies in this group are a highway of information. They make it so easy to understand and at least one of them can personally relate to whatever you might need. I love these girls and they have accepted every whine ounce of me!
