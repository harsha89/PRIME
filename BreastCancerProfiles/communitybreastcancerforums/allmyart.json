      "Content": "allmyart wrote: Hi Everyone, My week started with a routine screening mammogram on Tuesday.  Wednesday I received the dreaded \"call back\" call from the radiology center.  I went back on Friday for more/different images, and finished with an ultrasound of my left breast.  About two hours after the ultrasound, my PCP calls with the news that the radiologist found two nodules at the 1 o'clock position, with one nodule \"dominant\" and that a biopsy was needed. My PCP has referred me to a breast surgeon.  I don't have an appointment yet as this mostly transpired on Friday afternoon.  Hopefully, I'll have one soon.  BTW, I'll be 64 in October. I've been researching and haven't found anything that specific to nodules, and what the heck does \"dominant\" mean in this case?  I had a surgical biopsy for micro-calcifications in 2003 with negative results.  All my mammograms have been good up to now. I've become absolutely useless with a brain that won't let me think of anything else.  If anyone else has had a similar diagnoses, I would appreciate any info or experiences you would not mind sharing. Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",
