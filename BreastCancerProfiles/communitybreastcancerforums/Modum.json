Good luck. I hope the bee situation gets sorted out- honey dripping down the walls doesn't sound fun (delicious but not fun!) Hope they do t have to tear your place up too much to fix- what a hassle! Suzanne, I hope they figure out what they need to do for you! Sorry you were in the hospital. It's strange that they are giving you heart meds...that would definitely lead to dizziness if you HR is too low. My husband is also a former Respitory Therapist! Too funny. my family doc wants me to get an ekg and a holter done, but my heart has been fine too. I soemtimes think she doesn't know what to do with me, so she tries things on me! I'm not too keen on physicals anymore either- not really looking for any new issues at present! Glenna, hope you are enjoying your grandson this week! Hope your energy levels are waaay up too! : ) I am two weeks on one week off, these past two weeks were rougher than I expected. I may be wishing for the two weeks off if it's like that next time as well. My scans are on the Wed the 9th. I \"see\" my oncologist tomorrow and they told me she will call me with the results next week. I really need my confidence back up and hope for decent results. It's been more of a mind game this round! I hope everyone has lovely weeks! Maureen",

Too funny. Woodburns, I work for the same reasons- to stay sane and to keep the insurance! I have a new med onc as well, my beloved MO for the last 3 yrs has moved across the country to open a new cancer center. He was amazing, always had time to talk, always got my results to me quickly so I didn't stress too long, etc. This new one is smart (and he recommended her) but she flies in and out, and last appt i only saw her fellow- even though I saw her walk by in the hallway. Not too sure about this....my scan is early March and technically my next appt is 3 weeks after that! I will be tracking her down this Wednesday (my day 1 approval appt) if she doesn't make an appearance! Ugh My hair is taking on a life of its own- very wispy thin but still there, half wavy/half fly away. Really have to fight it to lay down. Not feeling the wig yet, but it might be easier than what I am doing. Sigh Gatorgal, I'm glad you had an \"interesting\" visit to Toronto - I'm glad you got the hotels figured out! Lol I am actually from the U.S. and married a Canadian. My family lives all down the eastern seaboard. Just visited my Mother and a Sister in Atlanta last week- managed to be there during the cold spell of course! I lost a very close friend to this last June and I guess I've been angry ever since. I really stopped being on-line and have kept to myself. I'm ok about my situation, but cancer really reared its ugly head and took a 5 yr survivor like my friend who was doing great within a month- so angry about that! It is every where, I just got my genetics test results back and they found nothing- so mine is caused by the environment.... I'm starting to ramble now, best I say talk soon! Hugs to you both!

Because of work- I usually have my chemo on wed or Thursday's but had meetings this week. I was exhausted- had three full day meetings Tues, Wed, and Thurs, I guess I had been taking it easy at work and working around my fatigue (or not), but couldn't avoid this past weeks meetings. I have been going back and forth about going on disability, but I enjoy my work and it keeps my mind busy on other things. It sounds like we all had similar weeks, I was nauseous, tired, and had low appetite. I had started to take a stomach med (pantoloc) after the first round when the stemetil didn't touch whatever was bugging me. I believe it was severe heartburn, not nausea. So far it has helped, but this weekend was weird. May have to come up with a new game plan. My scans are actually next week- wish they were last week! This is the first scan on this drug and I am just not confident. I had been on taxol for 9 months with good results and I guess the progression on it was a bigger blow than I realized. This is the first time I didn't feel \"resilient\"! Gotta get my groove back! : ) I also worry because the MO wants me to go on to Ibrance next, but it's not available in Canada yet. Hopefully only a few more months. I've peeked on that discussion board and the se's don't seem too much better, so for now, I hope to stay on Halaven for a long time! I think it's great that your doctors are trying to keep your trial options open, Suzanne. Thank you both for being there, I really appreciate knowing how you are managing things. You are right Suzanne, this is a relatively easy chemo as they go, but there are still se's to manage. Some chemos have se's all over the map, but so far we seem to be in a tight little group around fatigue and stomach stuff! Glenna thanks for your prayers, I hope your two weeks off is fun! I almost want to shout, \"Fly! Be free!\" Lol Take care of yourselves- sending big hugs your way! Maureen",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2015 10:36PM - edited Dec 7, 2015 10:44PM by Modum Hello Halaven ladies (hello SoccerMamma3!), I have started Halaven (Dec 1) and have my second dose of 1st cycle is Wednesday. I have just come off of Taxol which worked well for 8 months, but slight progression in my liver and lungs have become active again (after being silent for over 2 yrs). So on to Halaven! I guess I have been very lucky so far, of the several treatments I have had so far, I haven't had any se's that have stopped my treatment or caused me severe problems (ok hand and foot from Xeloda sucked). I even have thinned hair left while on Taxol..............but Halaven and I don't seem to be getting along so well! To add to my frustrations, I also have my trusted Med Onc moving across the country and am getting a new one that doesn't know me. If anyone can help me with some info, I would appreciate not feeling like I am going crazy! I have read a bit back on this thread to try to get a good overview and everyone's contributions are much appreciated! So here goes: I am having terrible heartburn- my centre thinks it's nausea but the anti nausea drugs barely touch it. I have read on here about heartburn, took some of my husbands Nexium and felt so much better. The centre doesn't seem to think this should work..... I have been taking a half dose of Celexa (5 mg) to \"take the edge off\" and only use Ativan occasionally for sleep, otherwise I use melatonin with no issue. This weekend I was extremely anxious with heart racing, feeling depressed (truly not normal for me) and sad. I truly do not feel like myself from 1 week ago! Again the centre thinks this is odd and not Halaven related.....is it me? I want to keep taking this drug as I am ever the optimist that this might be the one, and I'd hate to come off of it if I can't get this all figured out. Anyone with similar experiences? My best to you all, Maureen",

I just got my genetic test results back from my biopsy and they say \"no actionable mutations\" so no targeted therapy options I guess. I will have to discuss with my med onc when I see here next.

What we put up with. Glenna, be sure to send a picture of your halo when it's finished- very exciting! The Xgeva is no biggie injection-wise. Tiny needle, feels like a quick bee sting then done. I get it in my abdomen alternating sides and my bones have been the only thing that have remained stable during this crazy journey. Wish my liver would pay attention! I will be interested to hear about the Ibrance\\ Faslodex combo for you....my new MO says she thinks I am too heavily pretreated now- whatever! We will be in a battle after this current drug stops working. She also had me meet to Palliative Team to \"start getting to know them\". They were great, she has no bedside manner! Suzanne, hope your tooth/ dentist situation goes well! Hang in there. Your grandsons are going to love their lovely gifts. As for the bug robots...have fun, I can see those popping up everywhere! Thanks for the good stories re Cis/gem. I have had a heavy cold/flu this past week- started right after my first session so hard not to feel miserable about the combo right now. I am starting to feel better again so now I am not as doom and gloom. Such a knife edge sometimes. I send warm loving thoughts to you all! Maureen",

She was ok 2 months ago and deteriorated until passing last night. She was 5 yrs from diagnosis. Stupid cancer you took another great and lovely person. Then I saw my med onc today and got the good news bad news results. He gave me an 8.5 out of 10 after 3 cycles of taxol. I am stable (again) in lungs and bones, but my liver...keeps on giving me grief! 3 out the 5 lesions have decreased, but 2 have increased a bit- what a crazy disease! Still asymptomatic. The good news is (?) that they did get cells from my biopsy and my receptors have not changed, still ER+ HER2-. Because of positive tissue, I can now go on for molecular testing and see if I have any other mutations going on. Sending my prayers and thoughts out to my fallen friend and to all of you ladies here. May we continue on in decent shape. Not much else to say today- Maureen ",

I live in Toronto and was also planning on going down to Atlanta to visit my 91 yr old mother. So the day after my scan I happily showed up at the airport, went through all the checkpoints and then got to the Border Guard check in. I actually had a good guy and we were chatting, when another guard walked past me and his gieger counter goes off! My guy looks up and then his goes off and then 2 or 3 more around us went off. I am totally clueless as to what is going on, but they are all looking at me! He finally says,\"have you had any tests recently?\" And then then I realize- I just had a Nuclear Medicine Scan! I am radioactive! I got pulled back I to the \"room\", I had no documentation about the scan except luckily I had my appointment card...they let me go with a warning, but after using the C Card- he kindly said as I left, \"I hope you get some super powers with all that your doing!\" That made me laugh. So now I will get paperwork in the future and I thought you might enjoy a small laugh today too! Btw Georgia was lovely, my mom is awesome! Have lovely days! Maureen",
