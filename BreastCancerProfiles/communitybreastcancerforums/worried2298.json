It feels the same as other side, just thicker and more raised. Its hard to find laying down but when standing up without a bra i can feel it. Its on the outer quadrant..feels like tissue. It does get harder around my period and more noticeable. But it never fully goes away. Had a mammo and ultrasound two months ago. They saw a few tiny cysts but the tissue mass didnt show up at all. The ultrasound took 30 minutes. Tech did it and then radiologist cane in and did it. He said that it was just alot of denser tissue and that it is probably just how im built. They found absolutley nothing. I am going to see a breast specialist tomorrow and am terrified. I made the appointment because i felt unsattisfied. Can anyone give advice. Has anyone felt a similar type lump that wasnt cancer? Can a fibroadenoma not show up on tests? I dont want to be afraid. Has anyone had this happen and results turned out ok?

Also...i guess i just get nervous because i read all these threads of people who had cancer but it didnt show up on their tests. I guess i wonder how the tissue mass doesnt show up at all. Sorry..just scared. Thank u so much for your info though. Its more info then i got from my own research.",

Half regretting asking for a second opinion on my negative results. Knowing most posts on here are from breast cancer patients and not people who ended up being ok...should make me feel better but it doesnt. Life is so scary...i wish i could just be reassured.",
