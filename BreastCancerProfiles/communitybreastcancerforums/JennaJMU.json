It's hard not to think It could be the cancer when you feel so crappy but I keep telling myself I didn't feel like this before treatment and its unlikely something new would be manifesting while on chemo.",

That makes more sense than an MRI at this stage in the game. An MRI is usually the first step after a biopsy confirming cancer. It just checks to see if there are other spots in that breast or the other one.",

I understand where you are at, I was diagnosed in February at age 33 and with a 14 month old daughter. I cried every time I looked at her that first weekend after diagnosis. But then, if it is cancer, you get a plan in place. You have surgery, chemo, rads, hormone therapy, whatever you need to do to kick its ass to the curb so you never see it again. It's likely a year worth of hell, but it will be worth it. I'm right in the middle of chemo, and its doable. I wonder why I didn't find my tumor earlier when it was smaller but I will never wonder if I did enough treatment. You can and will do this!!!",
