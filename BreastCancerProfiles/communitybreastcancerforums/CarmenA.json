That was about 10 years ago. Very selfish/ self centered man and that's just one of the sicotic qualities, example; yesterday was my oldest B/day and his dad didn't talk to him for about a month now, cos the day he was moving to a new place my oldest didn't go to help as agreed upon with dad.  So I called the ex up in the evening and asked him if he sent B/day greetings to his son.  His reply no and will not this is a rude kid and selfish and if I can't find him in my time of need he's dead to me.  I'm a sick man, I've got diabities to deal with, and a high blood presure, I don't need to deal with this.  Here I am kicking myself thinking what was I thinking calling him asking him to be a dad and above all be Human and loving towards his kids.  I don't think he heard any wisde/ parenting words I said.  I worry to death, what will happen to the boys in the case something happens to me, specially the 17 years old!  but I guess as mothers we will never stop worring till we hit the board.",
