Just my humble opinion, take it with however many grains of salt you'd like, Sue ",

Start looking for a chemo thread for people that are going through it now or starting at the same time as you.  If you can't find one, start one.  It really helps. I think you are going to have a lot more than 10 years.  Don't worry about how you are supposed to feel. I saw a study that feeling positive made NO difference in long-term survival.  You feel what you feel. Don't apologize or be mad at yourself.  It's okay to be scared, mad, helpless-feeling, anything you are feeling.  You are not alone. Take care and come back often, read everything you can, and don't go anywhere else on the internet--there's a lot of stuff out there that's out of date and needlessly scary.  Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book is excellent.  Buy a big notebook to write down stuff you need to remember and to take to the doc with you so you remember to ask all your questions.  What kind of chemo are you getting?  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  It's hard at first for some of us, but it gets easier.  Feel free to PM me anytime. Blessings, Sue ",

The sentinel node was positive, so the surgeon took the next cluster out and the pathology will be back later today.  I had excellent medical care as my sweet Aunt Charlotte, a retired RN, spent the night with me in the hospital and gave me a bed bath this morning and rubbed me with lotion, I felt like a baby.  I asked the dr. what it would mean if the other nodes were positive and she said they would want to do six weeks of radiation, but that she already know I was stage 2 from the size (2.8 cm) of the tumor. So, there it is. Waiting for results again.  I do realize how many people love me, and how truly blessed I am.  And I think everything will still be fine.  Sorry if I rambled, I blame the hydrocodone.

Hope you don't need this advice. I went back to the rad onc a weeek ago tomorrow in intense pain and today is the first day I've been able to wear clothes all day...",

I am thankful for all of you.  This is a wonderful group and you have ALL been a wonderful blessing and support through this ordeal--and back into life! I am definitely \"changed, stronger, more insightful...\"......and HAPPIER!!!! Cris, thanks for the prayers for my sister....they are doing well today.  Otter, I just can't say enough about how much you have calmed my many fears with good information and your unfailing support. THANK YOU. Noelle, REST. Your Siouxsie wishes you the best today. Love,Sue",

We had Thanksgiving yesterday with my son and his gf.  They are getting married December 20th.  They are going to the courthouse in Austin, not a big church thing.  They have been living together for three years and I think one of two things happened: either her Dad said, \"You've been living with the boy for three years, I'm not paying for a big wedding\" or my son went to her Dad and said for \"X\" amount of dollars we will elope!! Anyway, they want us to be there, and there will be a lunch after.  Life is good, I really love her and want her as my daughter (in-law)...... So today I have lots of cleaning and laundry and catching-up to do even though it's Sunday--we've had five dogs in the house since Wednesday and carpet needs a good cleaning, I have to go back to work tomorrow so laundry must be done or I have nothing to wear to work...It's great to have energy, but kind of sad to have to spend it inside doing housework.  Oh, well, sooner started sooner finished, here I go....

Hunkyd--Isn't it great to know you don't have to act like everything's hunkydory here?  Isn't it wonderful to know you can let the scary, horrible shit out and not worry about anybody's feelings because everyone here either has felt or is feeling the scary horrible shit anyway? (Oh, Gracie, what a way with words to call them the gory feelings--glad you're here with us.  Sorry for why you are here with us, and for all that is going on with you that is hard.  Blessings on the grand-boy!!) And the Mom stories--we all wish. Debbie, sorry yours is so needy and me-first.  Take care of DEBBIE first, even though it probably feels counter-intuitive after all these years.  Sable--Glad the 'lil hottie made eye contact.  It really makes me angry when people won't do that, even though in my kinder moments I realize it's out of guilt--they see me, they think, \"oh, thank God that's not happening to me\" and they feel guilty for thinking that and MUST look away.  They don't bother me as badly as the ones who just refuse to look but I figure maybe they have recently lost someone who went through chemo and just can't go there yet.  (All this patience only happens about once a week or so, I want you to know that.  Most of the time it just makes me feel angry, invisible, as if I have a stain on my crotch or vomit on my shoe. And I want to say, \"Helloooo, there is still a person in here who needs and deserves your simple human contact\".)  LisaO, thanks for the understanding. I feel for you too.  This whole thing just kinds of knocks all our comfortable props out from under us, doesn't it?  I have a friend in Brisbane, we grew up together and she moved down in 1986--she loves it there.  She was widowed in her 20's and in a way has been seeking for lots of things ever since.  She's never really found real love again. I imagine it's really hard to compete with love in one's 20's that was new and happy. She's my age (I'll be 50 in November) and has done lots with her life down there--bought a house, rented out said house to live in a sailboat for three years or so, sold the boat, moved back into the house and paid it off, changed careers.  She's looking for a long-term crew slot on a sailboat now to travel. We are yin and yang in many ways as I married in my late teens and am still married, had children and traveled a bit for our jobs but not much.  My life sometimes seems ho-hum compared to hers but I have experienced so much love and happiness with this one man and our two children. And it is still really good.  Our friendship started when we were both 13, and when we get together it is as if we were together only last week, even though our lives are so different. Anyway, I rambled, but LisaO I am sorry about your chemobrain.  I hear it goes away, eventually. Love you all and a better day today I hope for everyone. Off to walk, Love, Sue ",

Roxi, I haven't had a period since March either, which here's the weird thing: I had my mastectomy on April 2nd, my period was due on about the 11th, I started chemo on April 24th--no period. I guess from the surgery? Weird....I, too miss the baby soft skin, but will be perfectly happy if I never have another period...Have to take Tamoxifen for two years, then Femara for five.  Need to buy stock in Aveeno as I am slathering with the stuff when I get out of the shower. Hubby is making a pot of delicious chili---I'm going to enjoy it, even though I will probably pay for it tomorrow!  My Aunt Charlotte is going home tomorrow...we have had such a wonderful visit. It's very odd, but the older I get the more I feel sisterly toward her as opposed to feeling like she's the adult and I'm the kid..she was the first person in my life to treat me as an adult and gave me a lot of the confidence I have that I can do hard things, just because they are there and need to be done..she's really a wonderful, caring lovely person and I am so lucky to have her in my life.  Hope everyone has a great evening......CHEMOOOOOOOO!

If i go missing today or tomorrow, it's because we had/are having thunderstorms and the internet is iffy--there's a whole reset procedure that I have been too lazy to learn because there is nearly always someone else here to do it.  See, I already started missing them, being here alone is not all fun and games. Besides, I decided to clean out my closet today as I woke with scan anxiety (scanxiety?  I'm sorry but if you say it phonetically it sounds like I am worried my husband is being seduced by passengers of loose morals wearing tight, scanty clothing..and while we're here in these parentheses, isn't that a great word, scanty?) Rock--Did I mention you are heartily wonderfully HOT in the pole dance photos?  Who said you were a bit prudish?  And the part of what Karin posted about better cosmetic outcome and avoiding radiating the tissue around the breast sounds like a good thing, even though the overweight part doesn't apply......I\"M SO GLAD YOU\"RE FINISHED!!! How are you feeling?? (BTW I think your upper back is safe.  They would target the beam to only affect the part of the breast where your lump was.) Sable, celebrate all week, heck celebrate all month!! But I, for one am done with birthday cake for a while.  I am thinking of going to see a naturopath after radiation is done.  I need to lose some weight, and my hubby and I need to change our lifestyle--more to concentrate on healthy eating and exercise, but also getting good, authoritative advice on which supplements/herbal things we should be taking.  I have now decided to live at least well into my nineties and would like to be physically active for the rest of my life. It's not a use it or lose it thing yet, but it will be eventually. Oh, yeah, about the being home alone thing--it didn't occur to me until this morning that I would probably be alone today when I get the scan results--at least I am hoping it is today.  Is there any way you guys could stick a little close today, just in case? Please? Can I say how it fills me with gratitude to know I can ask that? Coffee tastes brackish, like one of those tannic rivers in Florida.  Oh, well. Came back to edit after I noticed a whole 'nother page of your wonderful posts....I love you guys.  We are a group of wonderfully talented, eclectic women...Rock, glad you had the convo that was looming, I know how good that feels to have one of those behind you. Tell me about SA--I missed thaT!  What kind of research?  You are so multi-faceted! Noelle, I exfoliate, full body, twice a week.  My products don't have an ingredients list that I can see, perhaps they were on the cardboard package which  I have discarded, I will look. I use mostly stuff from Origins of the unscented variety as I can be quite sensitive. (my skin, I mean)  (although I can). Hope everyone has a good day!! BBL!! Sue ",

I said, I had a CT scan of my chest on Tuesday, and don't have the results yet. She said, \"That's because the doctor hasn't reviewed it yet, she will be in tomorrow.\"  I said, \"You know, it would have been really good to know that in advance, because the technician told me to expect the results \"In a couple of days!\"  She said, (wait for it) \"I'm sorry.\"  My crazy cat, just out of nowhere, BIT me on the foot!  And I treated it to prevent infection, but at work yesterday it got sore, warm and had a red circle around it, so I called the onc.  They put me on antibiotics, and I ran a temp of 99.6 last night.  It's like chemo just doesn't want to let me go...... So, I have an appointment today for my simulation and will get the results of the CT scan while I am there. Thank you guys so much for worrying, although I am sorry I didn't check in, I should have.  CHEMOOOOOOO to anyone having tx today.... Rock, I know what you mean about feeling vulnerable here.  But here's the weird thing.  I took a course this year for work and one of the things that was tested was openness---and according to the test, I am pathologically open.  So I don't feel that vulnerable as I tend to say what I feel and give people credit that they will handle my secrets gently and faithfully......that's what I appreciate about you guys.  I, too think we are lucky to have found each other.     Hope everyone has a great morning, back with scan results later..

Noelle, congrats on finishing the race! You are my role model. Jean, I haven't decided about reconstruction yet.  I initially wanted a prophylactic mast on the other side, and think I still do. I have decided to wait until I am not taking any drugs at all before I decide, I want to know I made the decision with my true mind.  What I am eventually considering is a DIEP flap--the one that uses abdominal fat with no muscle...there is a PS in San Antonio that is covered under my insurance plan.  Does anybody know if insurance will cover a prophylactic mast?  I know they are required to cover reconstruction with surgery on the other breast to achieve symmetry, thanks to the Women's Cancer Treatment Act of 1998 (Federal Law).  I think I will call my insurance co. next week to ask.  Cris--hope you get what you want schedule-wise...sorry a delay is proposed, that's got to be frustrating,  We yearn toward the day we willl finish, and to have it yanked out from under is just depressing. You are in my thoughts as you and your docs figure this out, and I hope you get what you want. Kristy, send some of those baked goods my way!! I need to keep my abdominal fat!!!

Cristine--It's a bit late, but you have my permission to meltdown, and I have my shovel ready if you need it (nor for dd, but for anyone else who may run afoul of you). Shovel friends are the best, don't you think? (I'd like to see that sentiment on a welcome mat). Glad you are feeling better and less pressure--it's guaranteed to blow if you hold it in!  I hope you get to finish chemo as originally planned, as it feels like such a tragedy to be delayed... ROCK--It's such a pleasure to read your posts again.  I missed you so much.  It took me weeks after my diagnosis to figure out I was mostly angry at myself--because I found the lump in December, I have always had lumpy breasts and it wasn't that different from what I had been feeling for years, but I waited until February to see my GYN about it.  I was so afraid that it had spread and that would be my own stupid fault.  It appears I dodged that particular bullet, and I am grateful for that.  I'm so glad you got to spend time with your sister. (I'm hoping she's the sister you like)...I remember when I was 10, my very devout and non-cursing mother called me an \"overbearing little bitch\"--and I was!!  I knew everything, and would argue with anyone.  I was that way until I joined the Navy and that particular quality was beaten out of me. I start rads tomorrow.  I have mixed feelings, but have made my decision, and I am trying to just let it go.  I've also decided not to decide about reconstruction until I am totally drug-free (I'm still taking pain meds for bone pain)...(and Ativan to sleep at night)...I just want to know I made my decision with my real brain.  Speaking of my real brain, before chemo I could remember numbers really well, it was my gift and served me well at air traffic control..we wrote over 200 pilot deviations in 2007, and if you asked me who was involed in, say, number 87, I could usually retrieve one or both of the call signs involved, and remember the controller.  Some of you may remember my meltdown at work with chemobrain where I couldn't find this file I was looking for and someone followed me up and found it where I had looked already.  Then, five minutes later he did it again, and gently teased me about it.  Well, poor guy, I burst into tears, because I just felt so disabled.  Point of the story, MY MEMORY IS COMING BACK!!!! It feels so good!!! And I am feeling just that tiny bit better, every day.  I feel really happy. (Hope rads don't send me back to that dark pllace where I was, because I never want to go there again.).. Julie, this is probably not timely, but YOU NEED A FEDORA.  Go to Target or Walmart, believe it or not, and check in the young men's section--they are in style again for young men.  A fedora, if you don't know, is a hat like Bogey used to wear.  I have a large collection going!! It's too hot where I live for a wig, I never even considered it. The great thing about my fedora is it's a hat, and a fan!!!  Also, as Rock noted, it's fun to say (fedora fedora fedora) Karin, how was school today? Did you get lots of germy hugs?  Love all you guys!  Hope I didn't miss anybody! Sue ",

Karin, nope, not bras.  Don't wear them anymore.  I wear camisoles, without the shelf bra, thank you very much, as any band irritates me and seems to bring on the \"heavy\" feeling I get before lymphedema.  I wear camisoles which are not loose, and on days when I want to look like I have two boobs, I pin the puffy foob inside the camisole.  This also eliminates the problem when wearing a mast bra of the fake one being higher that the real one.  I can just look where the real one is, and pin the fake one right beside it.  It works well for me. (I am between a B and a C cup).  I hope you continue in your efforts to enjoy the day.  I think you know you can be as sad or depressed or self-pitying here as you need or want to be, but I am like you--I try to find the good in things, if I can.

Somethng along the lines of pain is unavoidable, but misery is optional. The smoking thing--what a hairy, horrible monster!  I quit New Year's Eve 1999, but that was after six failed attempts through the years.  And you mentioned prayer, so i will tell you this story--I was sitting in church, during a pastoral prayer, and feeling really remorseful about starting smoking yet another time, and it was almost like I heard God's voice, saying, \"What, you don't think I can forgive that, too?  Shut up and listen to the prayer!!\" Otter--so good to \"see\" you again!  Do you know of anything that will help someone's sensitive skin who has had three treatments and is already feeling and looking sunburned?  I am using steroid cream after treatment and at bedtime, and 100% aloe vera gel in the afternoons when I get home from work.  It was scary today when the technician said \"That's very interesting, we seldom see this degree of redness so early in treatment.\" Jean, prayers for you and your Mom.

And I can never help thinking of Karen Anne Quinlan--anybody remember her?  She supposedly mixed barbiturates and alcohol in small amounts and won the unlucky lottery, was in a coma for years and years and finally died from it.......so, no alcohol with any drug for me.  Not worth it.  I am still having issues with bone pain and still taking pain meds for it.  It hurts a surprising amount because I guess I didn't expect it to still be bothering me, but when I saw my onc on Thursday she said some women hurt for 2-3 months following Taxotere!!!! Otter, are you far enough from the Gulf that you'll just get leftovers? (From Ike, I mean)... Batten down the hatches, woman! Eddie, glad you got to see nekkid people, and glad it made you smile.  That steroid crash is the worst, it made me cry all day every time.  Especiallly bad is when loved ones say, it's just the drugs, as if you don't still have to feel all that painful emotion.  It hurts just as much, even though \"it's just the drugs.\"  You are in my prayers for peace and feeling better soon.  Hope it helps knowing it's the last time.... Noelle, sorry about your hands.  I considered a tattoo for the back of my head too, but with my luck my hair would never grow there again, and there I would be.....

Linda, I can see us all, bald and assymetrical, instead of a high school marching band we could have chemo nurses and IV poles and syringes filled with neulasta..... Anybody heard from rock?

Complaining about not being able to do that is not petty and selfish.  I start every morning with a book, 45 minutes, and a cup of coffee NO MATTER WHAT.  I got up at 4 a.m. for years just to have that time, so I totally get what you are saying!!",

RanD--here's me with a basket of cool washcloths.  At your service, mum.  Hope the Xanax helps, it helped me.  As Otter says, better living through chemistry...you are always in my prayers.. ..which leads me to Eyes, Dana, Tawanda.  Spots, FECK.  Want to meet me in Hillsboro for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie? (I'm SO not kidding, I am retired...) Otter,  Eddie, your posts are such an encouragement. Cris, I'm STILL d.a.t. and have been off work since April 1...I am almost all the way well from surgery, though, so I am expecting my daily increase in available energy to continue.  Have to start getting ready to move now, even though the house hasn't sold, so that we can be ready when it happens.I am excited.  We are looking at house plans and I have started an \"I like this\" notebook--when one of us sees something we like, we put a photo in the binder.  Gives us somewhere to start this whole housebuilding process.  So far we have a 10--foot porch around at least two and possibly three sides of the house, and bun and turned feet on the kitchen cabinets, and a screened porch, which has a doggy door.  And I am collecting old crystal doorknobs to use.  I literally cannot wait to start this process! Karin, sorry I missed your birthday, I had to go to Tennessee my stepdad was in the hospital.  He is 73, has a lot of small things wrong but nothing big.  He is stubborn and doesn;t like to take medicine.  He has never had to consciously take care of his health before. I am trying very hard to both be supportive and not treat him like a child, to realize I CAN'T CONTROL THIS and just be there for him. Roxi, Jeano and Kerry, hope you are healing well.  Take your time and rest and don't demand too much from your tired body.  I had to pay attention to any increasing pain--for me, that means I did too much.  Still having this occasionally almost eight weeks out from surgery.  Everybody is different. Julie, here's a prayer of patience with the space invaders. I love all of you and miss you when i am gone.  I always read your posts, almost every day, but feel the need to back away a bit from all but this thread.. Love, Sue",

Cris, sorry about the LE and tooth pain.  Whomever is running 40 miles a week has my unending awe.  I have started an exercise program that is at one of the local hospital fitness centers, and is only for BC survivors. I am going on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  It's 30 min. of aerobics, 20 min. of weights and 10 min. of stretching, but it's never the same and the instructor has the knowledge to go to each person and help them modify whatever the class is doing, tailored to each person's strengths and weaknesses.  I am the youngest there by ten years or so but everyone has been really nice and welcoming. It's free, provided by something called the Texas Chrysalis Foundation.  I am seriously enjoying it, feeling stronger and losing weight. And my whole body hurts, but in a good way. Noelle, sorry for the craziness with the store and financial difficulties. I wish I could help. I will buy some birthday presents from your store at the beginning of September! (I have to wait until I get paid). Kerry, glad my new boobs were inspirational for you.  Also glad you are done with that fecker cancer, so am I. Mary, Linda, Julie, Jen, Dana, Karin, Jean--I miss sharing my days with all of you (I know I have left some out, please forgive me and know that you are included). My one-year  chemoversary has come and gone, it was August 7th.  I almost totally forgot about it, I thought about it at bedtime. That was a good thing.   Love to all of you and a good week next week! Sue",

Here is a picture of my left one.  The moderators may delete it, but here it is:   Feel free to PM me with questions, or ask them here.  The skin for the nips came from the ends of the abdominal incisions.   I hope everyone has a wonderful Monday.   Love, Sue",

Sorry, all, that I am only posting pretty much on the weekends now, but rads and work combined, kicked me in the nether regions.  Still taking a nap every day, and dealing with a pretty impressive burn.  I started using pure cocoa butter on it yesterday, and that seems to help. Smells really good, too.  I used it during my pregnancies to prevent stretch marks (and I don't have any)...when I put it on yesterday my dh told me I smell pregnant. ;O) Church Fall Festival and Auction tonight.  With dinner.  We go every year and have gotten some fantastic bargains over the years.  I had promised Christmas pillows and placemats (I'm a quilter) but didn't get them done.  Actually, didn't even get them started.  It's the first year I have promised and not delivered.  I guess they will just have to understand. You know, it's weird, but I find myself loving myself a lot better than I did before cancer.  Isn't that interesting?  I had self-esteem problems going back to high school, grew up with an alcoholic father with all the attendant issues, dealt with sexual abuse (and had treatment)....all that seems so small now.  It definitely showed me what was important, having cancer.  And it showed me what I have, and how blessed I am.  As for siblings, one was attentive and one was not.  The one who was and is attentive, we were estranged before cancer, and now we are not.  So that is very good. The other one, we are there for each other in crises, but there has never been a lot of contact otherwise.  She called me three or four times during chemo, which is a lot for her.  It is very, very good to have all of you here.  You have saved my sanity on several to many occasions! Something fun this weekend, huh Rock?  Well, the festival and auction today, and hanging my covers on the line to dry tomorrow---I have a boring life, don't I?  Oh, I know, I will go the expensive grocery store on Sunday, where I can get clean food, how exciting is that?  Seriously I will try to think of something to do just for me on Sunday, and let you know what it was. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. Love, Sue",

Feeling pretty good today, washed the bedcovers and hung them on the line to dry, that's one of my favorite things.  Noelle, glad to hear you are glad for the return of reproductive function, I seem to remember you left the possibility open for wanting another child? Good on ya, then! (TMI alert here) My DESIRE is finally returning, hallelujah!!!!  I haven't WANTED sex since I found out I had cancer back in March.  And my dh, believe it or not, hasn't pushed or complained, in fact I think I may have to convince him that he won't hurt me and it is fine now.  Guess I'm off to Victoria's Secret for a slinky something to let him know what I'm thinking.  We are going to Tennessee week after next to see family, then three days in a cabin in the Smokies, just he and I.  I am really looking forward to no phone, no TV,  no computer just he and I and walks and fresh air and good food, companionable reading and maybe a good cigar and a bottle or two of wine---the return of normalcy, or closer to normalcy, anyway.  I do feel just that tiny bit more energetic every day, and have started counting down my Mondays until retirement--about twenty to go! Roxi, who told you no more that 5 pounds ever again? Is it because of lymphedema risk or some other reason?  I saw an LE therapist and he gave me exercises to do WITH weights, and said I could increase with time as I saw fit--but he says people either tend to get LE or not and if not you can do a lot of the stuff they say you can't ever do again....and that working the joints and muscles is also a way to efficiently move the fluids around. Anyway, just a thought. I don't seem to be one of the people who tends toward it--I do the massage every day in the shower, and am careful about how I carry things, of course immediately and aggressively treat any injury to that arm, but haven't had any trouble at all with LE. I only had nine lymph nodes removed, though, so that is probably part of the difference.  Anyway, it's a curious thing, that LE.  I did buy a sleeve for air travel, and wear it each time I fly. Hope everyone has a wonderful Sunday and a really good next week. CHEMOOOOOOOO! P.S. Am back up to three miles on my daily walks, for the whole past week.  It takes me 15 minutes longer than it did pre-bc, but it feels really really good.",

Fess up..... I had the fluid thing after Taxotere.  It took about TWO MONTHS and then I lost 15 lbs. in about a week and a half.  Still losing slowly, walking, I weigh only four pounds more than when I started chemo.  Getting there and feeling happy.  Is anybody else taking zoloft or effexor for hot flashes?  I have been taking zoloft since I was diagnosed (it's an antidepressant and an OCD drug) and I just realized last night how much happier I feel--like, long-term happier, about everything.  I can't decide if it's the drug or just having cancer and realizing what's important.  And if it is the drug, and it makes me feel happier, why the hell not just take it?  I never took medicine, I was an air traffic controller and if I took a Benadryl I had to allow twelve hours to elapse before I worked airplanes.  I have always felt like I am basically a happy person, I am happily married, but there is just this sweetness now and I am saying what I feel to the people in my life and they are doing the same.  It sounds really weird and I hope this doesn't make anyone feel bad in any way but it occurred to me last night that cancer has some beautiful gifts, as long as we get to survive it! Anyway that's my ramble.  Eddie, your hair looks great.  Rock, I might have to come and see you in early January--I know it's going to be a crazy time but what would you think about a whirlwind weekend visit and can I sleep on your couch? (How's that for having issues?  That woman is just WEIRD). Count me in for May 2010 and the bringing Lamb to U.S. fund drive.  Actually, we picked out our land when we were in Georgia last week.  It's on a hill beside a 4,000 foot grass runway, and it's going to be a fly-in community (without the pretensions of HOAs, etc.)  And I am building us a front porch, ladies, and if it is there by May 2010, which it should be, that is where I want us to meet.  We will have lots of room, and you can see the east Georgia mountains off the front porch, and there WILL be overstuffed chairs and hammocks and sunsets and wine and cigars and a pool and a hot tub. Who's in?  All you have to do is pay airfare, I will run back and forth to/from Atlanta or Chattanooga airport, you don't need to rent a car unless you just want to, the Smoky Mountains are two hours away if anyone wants a side trip, and I am deadly serious here.  I'm thinking a 3-day retreat for the May Chemoooooooo ladies would be about right. May 2010.  Just pray my house in Texas sells, because the plan is for me to retire in April and us to move over there and start building.  My husband wants a house that looks like the one on \"The Walton's\".....Hope everybody has a great day and if you read all the way through this post, you're the best pals. Love you. Sue",

Eddie, thanks for the wisdom (twice), glad your pain was nothing to worry about, let Adam help.  He's doing it for the right reasons.  I have been asked by a very close friend to do the breast cancer 3-day in November.  I said yes, for her more than any other reason--she was so THERE for me during chemo, as well as the last 15 years or so.  I know it's commercialized and the money doesn't go to bc sufferers.  But I'm doing it anyway, and I've decided when I retire I will become a mentor to those newly diagnosed.  My breast care practice has a program for that.  (And you know the first thing I say will be to tell them about this site)... Kerry, chooks...I love your enthusiasm.  Maybe I'll get some chooks to country up the Georgia house. RanD, glad to hear you reached a compromise and are researching...more POWER to you and you are in my prayers every day. Rock, I miss you.  Sounds like an amazing time in your life.  Glad you still have both boobies. I really miss you. I worked the longest shift ever yesterday--I went in at 6 to earn flexi-time because I am taking some time off next week, worked until 5, but right before 5 one of the satellite towers had a serious error--they basically almost ran two airplanes together.  So I said I would go over and help the manager with paperwork, conference calls with Washington, etc.  They paid me overtime but I didn't get home until 10:30 p.m.  It made me think and realize something about retirement--I am looking forward to it, but I have had this glamorous, bragging-rights job for most of my life and I will miss feeling so important (being brutally honest here)...but I am important  wothout the glamorous job, it's not what has made my family love me or where I get my self-worth...just interesting. Otter, I am having those sad times too.  I think we are all thinking about where we were a year ago, maybe a little PTSD along with the hormone deficit. Just let it happen and don't try so hard to figure it out--let it out, and it gets smaller.  Love you a lot and hugs. Jean, Adrienne, Noelle---miss you.  Noelle, do tell us about the purple juice!

I have a PET scan Thursday and I see my onc on Friday. The biopsy says it's no longer estrogen-positive, and I've been HER- since the beginning although i know that can change too. This waiting stage and figuring out the treatment is so hard! Today is the day I get to talk about this all day on the phone--oh, joy! Normally I have an excellent attitude but this morning I am PISSED. At the same time I believe that God is still God. Just feeling massive fear and sadness. I know our thoughts and mindset are so important but HOW do you turn off the dark thoughts and move forward?",

Dana/Eyes--northwest of DFW about 20 miles.  We bought an old farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere in 1992 and now there are McMansions all around us.  We have fun with it.  None of our neighbors will speak to us, and when someone is coming to the house for the first time and I am giving them directions, I say, \"Just look for the little slice of Appalachia in the midst of all the McMansions\".  I LOVE my house, it has a certain charm, there is a dinner bellin the front yard and an old round rock well house.  Definitely bring Blue Bell.  Or, we can meet in West at the Czech Stop and I will buy the kolaches!! Otter--hope yor road trip is effortless and you get a nice cool evening on the boat. I love sleeping on boats.  Can somebody 'splain about the destination?  Is this where we go during chemo? Rock, how ya doin?  Is Lulu gone yet?  Is she as weird as you thought she would be?  Does the bitch have hair longer than yours? (Insult to injury.....) Hope everyone else is well.  Just because I didn't mention you by name doesn't mean I don't care.  I do, I just have chemobrain.  And swollen ankles and a chemo belly. The nurse today said it's from the Taxotere.  Could somebody please quickly reassure me that it's not congestive heart failure from the Adriamycin? Anybody know the symptoms of that? I can't remember who asked about uploading their avatar--go t my home, click on edit my profile.  There is an option that says upload avatar.  Click on the browse button and go get your picture (I assume its stored on yor computer). I am making a statement with my new avatar, in case anyone has wondered.  It's my kitchen window.  I don't have a dishwasher, and I spend much time looking out that window as I do dishes. This chemo shit is the hardest work I have ever done, and I feel like I am near the end of my endurance some days.  Just, dog. ass. tired.  I will upload a bald picture again soon.  ",

It is fascinating work and I get paid to be nosy.  I work at Dallas/Ft. Worth in the radar room, and up until breast cancer, still stayed current on the boards.  Because of all the medicines, I am now medically disqualified, but luckily can still do the investigative work and therefore, still have a job.  I LOVED working airplanes, it was a great career, and I guess I choose to look at it as I went out at the top of my game.  The only sad part was that I didn't know the last time I worked airplanes was the last time.  So that's what I do. I have been able to work about half the time during chemo, and I plan to retire in January. At least that's the plan right now. So steroids are the drug of choice for breast cancer and mountain climbing. What a bizarre coincidence.  Love you guys, going to bed.  Thanks for your help through my difficult day today, maybe I can give back tomorrow. Sue ",

Hope everyone has a good restful night's sleep tonight--off to bed early again for me. Love you all. Sue ",

AND, watched sappy movies all day while I did it.  Other than the quilt square, I got nothing accomplished.  But, I have to go back to work tomorrow, and must have needed the day off.  The cleaning and laundry can wait.   I miss Rock's posts.  Eddie, you could never alienate us, but I can so relate to how you are feeling and wish I could make it better.  MissS, sorry your body hurts, and that you are feeling robbed.  Kimberly, so sorry your family isn't helping.  I Hope going on strike with clean socks helps to get their attention because you deserve better.  RanD, can you send some of that pie down here? Not that I need it, I had to buy a couple of pairs of pants for work, and had to buy a bigger size than I have ever bought before.  But, I am working on it, mostly right now concentrating on resting and recovering, the weight loss will come later.  I'm not going to hate myself about it. Karin, I can see that you are pissed about Rock's friends coming here and reading, and that you miss her.  But she'll be back, soon I hope. Hope I didn't miss anyone--Crisitine, hope your first Taxotere goes well.  Can't give you any advice as I had my Taxotere with AC.  But, I know you are strong!  Hope everyone has a great week with no SE's--back to work for me and I may not have a lot of time to post, but I will read.  And, Wednesday I fly to Pittsburgh, fly home Thursday, and I will have my dog babies back!! YIPPEE!!!!! Love you ladies. Sue ",

And YIPPEE for last chemo!! Noelle, I also did a lot of my Mom's palliative care.  She died December of 2002 of lung cancer.  She actually died of dehydration, I believe.  Once she was unable to get out of bed, she stopped eating and drinking--I believe she decided to go ahead and die so it would be quicker and more painless.  that was very hard for me to admit for a long time, but it was her choice. She wanted to die at home, her way, and she got to do that. Of course it was very hard, but the \"luxury of notice\" was a wonderful thing, you are right.  It taught me to tell people how I feel about them. Rock, I saw my onc today too.  I am considering having my ovaries out as well, even though I am BRCA negative.  If I am in menopause (from the Tamoxifen) do I really need them? Anyway, I don't start the Tamox until after rads.  I am sunburn-y already after only two tx....Not good.  I guess very fair, sensitive skin and rads are not a good mix. Sable, WOOHOOO back at you for your last chemo!  Cris, sorry about your feet! Elevation, and Ice (or frozen veggies) work really well...just tell yourself that chemo is wanting to kick you a$$ while it can. because once this is over, it will NEVER have the opportunity again!

I am also undecided about reconstruction.  When I was first dx, my intentions were to have the mast on the \"bad\" side (left), which I did, have chemo, which I am doing, then have a prophylactic mast on the other side with reconstruction then, but I don't want implants.  I'm leaning toward the DIEP flap, IF i even have recon, I am wavering on the prophylactic mast because it is nice to have one nipple with sensation...I'm in the middle of drug-laden chemo and still have to have rads...I basically don't know what the hell I'm going to do. Luckily I don't have to decide right now.  I think my first reaction was to give up all the body parts I could to feel safe but I am realizing that I still won't feel safe, in a way, ever.  I am hoping that feeling will get less with time, and I am starting to realize that all this worry will not affect the final outcome, but is ruining the moment in which I am doing the worrying.  And that that's all I have control over, is what's going on internally, emotionally.  Anyway, I'm a small 'C'--and I'd like to be able to look normal in clothes, sure, but as you said at what cost?  I'm thinking I may end up staying flat on one side and actually being okay with it long-term--and I can put the fake one on if I want to, or not.   I was standing in the shower this morning and I just felt a wave of, this can't actually be happening to me, I didn't really have breast cancer, I'm not almost done with chemo, this can't really be real.  Does that ever happen to you? How can it still seem so surreal? The last four months have been some of the hardest of my life and I have gotten many good gifts, too, but I still on some level can not believe this is happening. I always felt I was lucky and charmed, childhood was a bit difficult but once I became an adult it was like all the obstacles just fell away, marraige, job, children, I've gotten everything I wanted.

It's sad when you need unconditional mothering and the person is not capable of giving it to you.  I am sorry you have to go through that.  I do what rock says, just wrap up in a quilt and cry.  I rub my own belly and say,, Susie, it's all right. Onc sez lump in remaining breast is same ole' fibrous cystic changes, at which point I stated I feel I deserve a lifetime pass from same.  Ha. Ha. Don't really feel like laughing about being afraid forever at the slightest thing. I am struggling with decisions about do i want recon, do I even want to keep the other breast, do I want a hysterectomy--my first response was get rid of these organs, they have done their job but now they are trying to kill me--and I don't need them!!  I was blessed with two babies, I got to breast feed for four years, I am ready to say goodby, remaining breast. I am strongly estrogen positive, so they are going to shut my ovaries down, so why do I need to keep them since I read my chance of ovarian cancer is doubled now that I have had breast cancer? Does all this sound paranoid and like a weird reaction to those of you who can relate?  I have felt this way since the moment I found out for sure I had breast cancer. I just don't want all that hanging over my head.  I'm too obsessive and fearful. I know this is very honest but it's the day after chemo and all my shields are down.  Does anybody have some superpower I can lean on today?  'Cause I'm feeling pretty tearful and down. Love, Sue  P.S. Welcome Lisa O--glad you found us, but sorry for the reason.  Enjoy! ",

Glad you are okay.  Cris-LOVE the garbage truck.  I am going to write it down and tape it up on my bathroom mirror, that's how much I love it.  Roxi/Mary--you are beautiful without hair.  I, too have to make the decision about rads...although my onc has told me I need to have them, but I am \"right on the border\" whatever that means.  I will probably have them, since she knows way more about cancer treatment than I do, but boy, isn't it scary to think about?   Karin-loved your pole dance--congrats on being done with chemoooo. RanD-glad that first infusion is over without any major problems--hoping minimal to no SEs for you and sending happy vibes your way. Eddie-Hope your wrists are better.. Otter, Noelle--I keep imagining this chemo journey as swimming across a wide river.  And I can see the two of you, who swam across before me.  As soon as you got to the other side, you turned right around and started shouting encouragement to me and the rest of us who are still swimming away, and getting tired, and thinking maybe we can't do it after all.  You two are still shouting encouragement to all of us, and as each of us gets near enough to you you will hold out your hands for us to grab onto.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!  Jean-looks like a lot of us are having rads. Hopefully what they say about much less se's compared to chemo is true...  (WARNING:Whining ahead)  I haven't posted much this week as I went back to work on Monday and worked a full week--which seems to be getting harder and harder to do!! I am exhausted. I have taken a lot of naps, but did manage to work my full 40 hours. I have been, I think the lone holdout on the crocs thing as my feet really didn't start bothering me until this last tx (#5)...but I am buying them tomorrow!  My feet hurt.  Wearing heels is now officially over for the duration of the summer, at least.   I was probably stupid for wearing them as long as I did...but they look so good!!  Anyway, I am pretty miserable.  I have gained like 20 pounds in the last six weeks. My onc says most of it is water, but I feel really ugly, ya know?  I know being fat doesn't make me unworthy or a bad person or even ugly--but I have battled with weight for most of my life and learned, finally, that I must exercise to keep in under control and I AM JUST TOO TIRED to walk most mornings....so not only do I feel fat but now don't have the benefit of those early-morning feel-so-good endorphins. Tomorrow I am getting up and walking even if I am \"too tired\"--I'll just walk as slow as I need to. My ankles are swollen again tonight, too--and interestingly enough, it's the same exact day in the chemo cycle that I had problems with them swelling last time. I have them elevated and iced and I am drinking lots of water...last time they were okay the next morning. As the day of my last treatment approaches (August 7th), I am sensing that will be an emotional roller-coaster all over again. I am SO ready to be done with chemo, I have been counting down to this for the last four months--but every time I think about going in there for the last time, I start to cry and don't even know why. I can't tell you how much I appreciate you all.  This is where I am safe, I can say anything and know I will be understood.. Sorry if  I missed anyone. (Oh, yeah, Sable! Glad your first day back at work went well.  Also, very glad you get paid for petting kitties and dogs.  What a dream job!)  My son, who just left home for college, took his two dogs with him, and I miss them so much!  Once I am sure his keeping the dogs in his small apartment is going to work out, I am going to have to get some more dogs!  I love having them, they love you so unconditionally, but also my husband is an airline pilot who is gone roughly half of every week--and having big dogs, in the house, helps me feel safe. Just when I get that irrational female-home-alone-at-night fear,all I have to do is observe the dogs, and if they are acting normal, I know there's no psychopath outside trying to get in... Love all of you.  Hope everyone has a great evening/ Love, Sue ",

Noelle, I hear you on the from-the-neck-down thing. For whatever reason, I have gained about 20 pounds in the past 7 or 8 weeks--onc says a lot of it is water, and will come off once chemo is done, but I am eating a lot too.  Seem to crave carbs and sugar--but I'm being as good as I can and having a lot of salad and fruit.  I am going back to work Monday, and don't know if I have anything to wear! (Wait--I think I have some fat pants way in the back)....Anyway, I can't wait to get more normal, for chemo to be over, you guys all know.    Randie, I also started out this journey wanting a prophylactic mast on the other side and a hysterectomy. I remain undecided now, and will wait until chemo and rads are over to decide. I was told that no PS will touch you until 6 months after rads, anybody else hear that? Eyes,  I am getting TAC X6 but know I am in the minority. It could be a regional thing, was your original TAC tx in Texas? I did have 2 positive nodes and \"extracapsular invasion\" and \"abundant lymphatic and vascular invasion\"--my Aunt Charltte, retired nurse says TAC is old and proven--so I have high hopes.  Yesterday at the grocery store I was standing looking in my purse for my keys and a guy comes up beside me and asks \"do you have cancer?\" What lines rolled through my head--No, just wanted to save some money on shampoo, Yes, why the hell else would I be bald, I just said, Actually I HAD cancer, but I am going through chemo......He said, well I was diagnosed 5 years ago and I am still here..I know where you are....I know he was trying to help me but does anyone else find this incredibly intrusive? My son is leaving home in the morning.  We are taking him out to dinner tonight. Pray for me, ladies, because I will need it tomorrow. Love, Sue P.S. Sable, I love your expression too.

I am waiting for the other shoe to drop---not much nausea this time, the neulasta/taxotere pain is here in force and I am taking all the drugs I need.  That's probably why I'm not able to nap--those pain meds wire me sometimes. Anyway, just chilling in the recliner in the air conditioning....got dinner going in the crock-pot and the bread machine (Corned Beef and Cabbage and rye-onion bread)...can't wait. Cris, thanks for the prosperity words, I needed to read them.  You have a knack for posting just what I need. How are you feeling?

I know some of the tangled, strange, wishful, sad things you are feeling, and all I can do is say I wish it was different.

I had a scare earlier in the week when I went to see the radiation oncologist.  She gave me the results of the chest CT scan.  She said the granulomas are unchanged, therefore they are nothing to worry about.  As I was taking the deep breath to heave a HUGE sigh of relief, she said \"there is something on your sternum that we want to look at.  I am scheduling you for a bone scan tomorrow.\"  I was pretty scared.  I came home and didn't want to talk to anybody.  I didn't even tell you guys, and I hope you understand, but it was like if I said it out loud it was real. So, anyway, I had the bone scan and it was clean, completely negative. So, I DON'T have cancer.  I hope you can forgive me for telling you the CT scan was clean while I had the bone scan done.  Then today I had an echocardiogram and the tech said, \"Don't tell them I told you, but your heart looks fine.\"  So, I am going with that.  The chemo didn't damage my heart.  I am feeling very lucky and blessed and happy.  I feel like I have my life back, and am thinking about the future again in a way that I didn't even realize I had stopped doing.  I still don't feel coompletely recovered, of course, and I am still bald with one boob. But I realize now how many people love me and what a full and wonderful life I have, and what a beautiful man I am married to.  And on top of all this, I get my dog babies back next week! Karin, I have my simulation for rads on Tuesday.  How long does it take?  And how are you feeling?  Hope everything is fine. Sable, daulink, how you doing? Roxi, as I said, guts over glamour, but I think your picture was glamorous as well. I can see your spirit shining out of your beautiful eyes. Noelle, if a washcloth counts, I exfoliate every day!  Who knew? Otter, good to see you and I agree with every word you said.  Tried to do some research today about soy and estrogen positive cancer. Conflicting opinions, some say it is preventive, some say it causes tumor growth. Some say it's a good thing as long as you started eating it before puberty, some say a small amount is good but a large amount causes tumor growth. Some say totally avoid it (meanwhile it's in everything), some say soy in moderation is fine, just don't take the supplements.  Any opinions?  Love you all, Sue ",

I am going with the insensitive professionals theory as it is logical and believable.  Thank you all for being there for me.  I am so grateful and blessed by the connection we have. Both of my sons called me yesterday, and they don't even know about the scan....what fine young men they are turning out to be.  My oldest wants me to help them buy a refrigerator for his birthday--he said' \"I can think of any number of toys I  would like and enjoy, but we just have a mini-fridge and it really limits Melissa in her cooking (she's finally learning to cook after four years of living together)...what a grown-up request for a birthday gift! So I told him about the scratch-and-dent place and that I would pay half. My youngest told me about his latest find by the curb \"a perfectly good coffee table and leather ottoman!!!\"  He was thrilled.  His living room is now furnished from things he was given and found and a tiny bit of money at IKEA.  I tell him he is channeling his late grandmother who was the queen of yard sales. Sable, if your sister doesn't show up for you, she is missing out, daulink.  Cris-Couldn't agree more about the good company here and the sniff, sniff.  If I try to talk to people about this site and you guys and start to tear up they look at me funny.  I don't care, I have gotten more real help and loving support here than even I can believe and it is precious to me, you all are.  Hope your lip is becoming less Quasimodish. Eddie--I \"know\" you are right about the scan, just really, really need to see it in black and white.  The good thing is I have an appt. for my simulation on Tuesday and can bitch to the doctor about it while it is still fresh. Rock--I am doing the same foot regimen--gentle scrub, excellent moisturizer...Origins has one called \"reinventing the Heel\" which is lovely.  I love the names of their products--their doedorant is called \"No Offense\", they have a moisturizer called \"Constant Comforter\"..I asked about the names and they have one lady whose job it is to make them up........what a great job!! \"Waiting for results of a look inside my lungs Is worse than being outside picking up doggy dungs.\" Love you guys.  Love you heaps.

So, any spare prayers for my son traveling to Pittsburgh tonight and tomorrow would be appreciated. He is traveling with a greyhound and a husky, in a Mazda 626 which also contains everything he owns now--clothes, bedcovers, books, dishes.....

I did burn my left arm pretty good on the iron about a month ago, and just aggressively treated it to prevent infection until it was  completely well.  That was a big hurdle, because I knew an injury to that arm was inevitable, and nothing bad happened.  Just because something CAN happen, doesn't mean it WILL.  P.S. My husband calls it \"nymphodema\".  ; O )  Eddie, your being a political analyst doesn't surprise me.  You strike me as a THINKER.  I am sorry you are afraid about the HER2 thing.  Here's my personal philosophy (which I admittedly can't maintain 100% of the time):  No matter how much I worry, that will not change the outcome.  It will only ruin the moment in which I am doing the worrying.  If it's not too personal to say, I will pray for you to have peace from worry. Linda,  good to see you! Your pole dance pictures were great!  Sorry it took me so long to say so, I've been soooo busy.  Either busy doing something or napping for energy!  LOVE the shoes. Jean, you win Miss Coconutboob for 2008.  What's your position on world peace? Seriously, I bet you made some scared, sad or sick people getting chemo give out a belly laugh, whcih everyone knows lengthens your life! (I miss that great belly-laugh that three-year-olds have.  If anyone has one that young out there, could ya go \"nose tickle\" their belly for me and then send me the laugh? And while you're at it, send me the \"doo-GAIN\" too). Noelle, wonder woman. Bicycle races, swimming, taking your kids on a great, fun but strenuous day of excitement...where are you getting your energy? I am checking out your website, tonight! Kristy, congrats on thinking of a reason to make birthday cake! Our family's birthday cake has always been the recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tin...extra chocolatey with cream cheese chocolate frosting..let me think, how can I work in a birthday cake?.... Adrienne, how goes it? Cristine, great swimming!  How are you feeling? Any good dd stories? (I love your dd stories).  Has shovelgirl made an appearance this week? Otter, thanks for your welcome home.  The dogs are home, and fine.  The greyhound had lost three pounds, and she had worms.  My dh took them both to the vet today.  They are both fine.  They are SOOOOOO happy to be home.  Sam had no place where he could let them run off the leash, so the only way they could run is if he ran with them.  And the greyhound only needs to run five minutes a day, but she REALLY needs that five minutes. I am so glad to have them back, I didn't realize how much I was missing them until they were back. My son and his gf are so happy, it makes me feel so good.  Sam has completely furnished his apartment from craigslist and things he has found that people were throwing away.  I am so proud of him.  We met his gf's grandmother.  We went to her house, and sat in her kitchen and drank (very good) coffee and ate cookies and got to know each other a little bit.  You can see in Sam and Tielle's faces how happy they are together, and that they are soulmates.  I am breathing sighs of relief and thankfulness for my son.  His heart has totally changed from two years ago, and he is really a grown man. To anybody I forgot ( and to She who shall remain nameless, for now), I wish you good things! Ms. Karin, where are you? I think that is all I have for tonight.  Love you all!  Chemooooooooooooo!!

My appointment to have the port out was at 9 a.m. and I still went to rads at 9:45! I am SO glad to have the port out--it was a tangible reminder of chemo, and this makes it real that I am really done with chemo.  It feels great.

I know, Adrienne, it's hard when you think of only being able to do it once...but I think I need it.   My med oncologist did say I was \"right on the border\" for radiation. I just want to get it started and get it over with.  I want to be finished.  I am a little anxious about the CT scan.  My initial report said the following: normal chest CT scan except for four areas which are highly suggestive of granulomas (Granulomas, from what I understand, and Otter, please chime in here if I have it wrong, are where one has inhaled something or there is otherwise \"debris\" in the lung and the body has encapsulated it in scar tissue).  The next line of the report says, \"With the history of breast cancer, metastatic disease must be considered.  Repeat in six months.\"  The oncologist says the radiologist is just being conservative and covering his a$$ by saying that and if he wasn't 99% sure the areas were granulomas he wouldn't use that word. Well, I have to admit that it is keeping me awake at night and I have asked for the scan to be repeated before I do radiation because otherwise I will have to wait until two months after radiation for things to \"calm down\" enough for the scan to be repeated.  So what I need from you ladies now is support and the belief, I guess, that my chest CT will be the same as it was before chemo, which will mean they were granulomas or at least not metastatic disease in my lungs.  I don't know when the scan is scheduled for but it shouldn't be long.  I am trying not to think about this too much, because it is scary and has caused me many dark thoughts.  Most of the time I \"know\" it's okay, but sometimes late at night the monkeys start chattering in my head...... Anyway, thanks for listening. Sue ",

My prayers are with you and your family.  Once the rituals are over, you will find yourself needing a good cry.  All I can say is, give yourself the space to have that good cry, it's so healing.  And I'll add my personal experience that even with the \"luxury of notice\", on some level it still came as a surprise--some small part of me still didn't believe my Mom would really die.  Funny Mom story: Her name was Evelyn Ruth, but she went by Ruth.  I went along with her on one of her doctor visits, and they were all calling her Evelyn.  I waited until we were alone and asked her if she wanted me to tell them to call her Ruth.  She said, \"No, because it is Evelyn that is sick.  Ruth is healthy.  I don't want them calling me Ruth.\"  I just thought that was so great! I have been negligent on posting and I apologize. I agree with everyone who has said it before: I couldn't have gotten through this without the support of everyone here, and I am so grateful.  I am working full time again, leaving work daily for radiation (it's going well) and I am once again, dog-ass tired by the end of the day.  I am still having bone pain from the chemo, and now deep muscle pain from the rads (actually from the positioning and having to be still)....but I am still walking every morning!  I'm still here!! Just most days don't have the energy to post.  Rock, try to be patient with yourself (NOT telling you how to feel). You've been through a major trauma. All your brain cells will come back.  Meanwhile, I understand the feeling of just not being able to get stuff done.  I paid some bills twice by accident and had to take money out of savings to live for the next two weeks!  Glad you got some girly-stuff time!  I am having a lunch-spa-antique shopping day with my friend Vicki Saturday, and am really looking forward to it--but I'm hoping for extra stamina that day, because I have trouble keeping up with her on the best of days! By the way, I MISS YOU! Eddie, I don't know what to say.  What your dh said is so disappointing.  You are NOT impossible, you are going through a horrible, traumatic experience!  You and your husband will be in my prayers...  Noelle, you sound so good to me.  I read your posts and think, \"just a couple more weeks and I'll be feeling better..\" (then I go for to a doctor's visit and she says sometimes the bone pain can last three months, and the swelling for six...moan, groan!) Sorry your hands are bothering you. Ice? Frozen peas? CAKE?!?!?  Hope it gets bettter soon. I have almost perceptible stubble!  I mean, you can almost see it!  Still haven't had to shave my legs, so that's good, I guess. I am off to bed so I can get up in the morning!  Sable, thanks for doing the pic, I'll PM you for the link. Ms. Karin, glad you are enjoying school.  Linda, hope all is well with you.  Cris, hope your chemo goes well this week.  Anybody I missed, I am sorry. Love you all, Sue ",

I am going out of town next weekend with my son's girlfriend--I will fly to Austin on Friday, then we will drive about 50 miles north to a little, artsy tourist town called Salado and spend two nights in a beautiful B & B--she wanted a girl trip for her birthday. We did it last year in San Antonio, and that's what she asked for this year.  Makes me feel good.  We don't get a lot of alone time, so every year we get closer.  I really love her, she and my oldest son have been together for 8 years--since they were 17 and 15--but I don't pressure them to get married.  They live together, and have three dogs, and they seem pretty happy.  We'll see....it's really difficult when you have this person in your life whom you love, and you have no control over whether or not things stay the same....here's my control issues rearing their ugly head again!!! Noelle, you sound so good.  I used to have curly hair, but it was not natural--I got spiral perms twice a year for years.   I loved it because it was so easy.  Maybe my hair will come back curly now, post-chemo, I hope so.  My hair is naturally straight as a board but thick and healthy (or it was before it all fell out).... Eddie, Cris, Jen, Adrienne, any one I missed, hope you are feeling better every day... Hope everyone has a great Saturday, I am off to the library... Love, Sue ",

What a great improvement over stage IV!!! Noelle, hope you have a wonderful time in Vermont! Send pictures of the fall colors, please, as we do not have them in Texas.

Glad I can still excite!  ;0) Love, Sue",

I am too, except for the \"Wound Healing Issues\" I am having with my right nip....and the fact that I am scheduled for another revision surgery on December 11th. I guess it's actually pretty common to need one more, but I thought I was signing up for  two surgeries, not three...*whine*...oh, and the fact that when I whine to my dh, he says, \"It will be nothing compared to what you've already done\"...when what I really want to hear is something along the lines of \"don't worry, my Queen, you will be pampered and waited on hand and foot (whatever that means)\". I haven't called you yet, Dana, I think I may try tomorrow...I told you I've been lazy.  Over the last few days I re-read our entire thread.  I highly recommend thiis activity as it helped me to acknowledge and feel some \"leftover\" (unprocessed) emotions about this whole journey.  It also helped me to realize, again, how much you all mean to me and how much of my progress on this journey was due to your support and friendship.  It is different now that most of us are not in active treatment anymore, but it's still very, very good.  Please keep checking in every once in a whiile.  Cris, rock, otter,Jen, Eddie, Jean,  Angels, Roxi, Noelle, Robin, Dana, Karin, Jackie, Adrienne, Kerry, Kristy, Linda, Julie, RanD---I love and miss you all.  Got to get over to FB to see what's up with the reunion, I can't wait. I don't know if I will walk the 3day as I planned to this year as what I thought of as a no-brainer source of contributions has failed to materialize (the economy?) and I don't know if I will make the minimum fundraising goals.  Also I havven't trained as I should--been doing the regular walks but not the distances....and I am soooooooo unmotivated it is sickening!! I think I am in the post-treatment I-don't-know-how-to-feel-and-nothing-feels-good phase. I've been taking Zoloft for a year and am taking tamoxifen, I am sure it is related to those.  I try cutting the Zoloft down but it ups those ugly hot flashes almost immediately...exercise does help, and I know that, but see previous statement about my lack of motivation..it's all I can do to force myself to walk a few days a week and get my housework done every day.  I think maybe I am lonely. Well, this turned into a ramble! I miss our times together and hope the reunion really happens. Love you all, Sue",

Building a VIRTUAL house in Georgia now (preselecting materials. finishes etc. and researching systems..solar, wind..hobby farming..) I am so uplifted to read that I am not the only one who has sit-on-my-ass-itis. I thought I was the only one, and that was because almost everything became my lowest priority there for a while.  I wasn't even reading here, although I thought of you every day.  Cris, I am so so sorry.   Meanwhiile, though, your measured wisdom and maturity really took my breath away.  I will hold you and your girls close in my thoughts and you have all the hugs and shovels you need.  I think I was depressed, the anti-d I was on had stopped preventing hot flashes, my estrogen levels went up so all the menopausal symptoms came back, it was like chemo again they were fast and furious...it was horrible.  So, we changed the anti-d, then went up on the new anti-d, and everything seems to be balancing finally.  Living in an almost constant state of hot flash sweatiness gets oldt pretty fast. So,  I just wanted to check in.  Very glad of red bras and a cruise and autumn and loving being alive and new boobies and finally being aable to stand up straight--it gets better every day!  Ilove all of you and miss you. I guess I really miss us.  I wouldn't want to go back but I sure am grateful that each of you was with me. Love and hugs, Sue",

(Talk about coming across as crass).. It's so good to be home. RanD, Dana--prayers for youse both and stay in touch. Rock, benign biopsy! Im-mee-jut-ly, please! Saw the PS today, all good. Small area of abdominal incision \"under stress\" but no infection and it is healing, just slowly.  Off all pain meds except Tylenol.  Have started to actually use my abs again, such as they are.  I actually have time to keep my house clean, instead of catching  up on the weekends!   My hubby is out mowing and I am doing laundry, he goes out on a 3-day trip tomorrow.  So it will just be me and the girl dogs.  Life is just feeling so, so good.  We visited the land we want to buy while we were in Georgia, it's beside a 4,000 foot grass runway.  I thought we were just getting in early on what was going to be a fly-in community, and we are, but it turns out the owner wants to build a house on one side of the runway and us to build on the other side, and all the \"development\" will be on the other end of the airport.  This is a man that my husband taught to fly 25 years ago when he was flight instructing, just a really nice person, and it's a high compliment for him to ask us this. We've met his wife and we all get along well.  I just need this house in Texas to sell!  Can we add that to our prayers and good wishes? Karin, I am very impressed (but not surprised) to hear the passion in your words when you speak of your work.  I've decided I 'm going with you to the interview, but I'll be very quiet and well-behaved and my job will be to give you strong confidence....because this is your job, already!",

      "Content": "Jun 12, 2009 10:51PM - edited Jun 12, 2009 10:53PM by sueper13 Well, I am back.  Good to be back, too.  I had to go to Tennessee because my stepdad was in the hospital (no big thing and he's well now)...then when I got back I focused on getting my house really clean and starting on the clothes thing--I am the proud owner of a full work wardrobe, in a bigger size and a smaller size. The smaller size fits now.  I have found a lady who wants all the bigger size clothes.  I don't need all the smalller size clothes as I don't have to work anymore.  I am only keeping the favorites that I love and that I feel great in. (It is possible I could need to wear a suit for business).... My job now is too get us ready to move.  That will entail cleaning out my boys' bedrooms and keeping stuff for them--I'm going to try to get their input on what to keep, and am willing to keep and move a limited amount of stuff for each of them to be given them at a later time, for instance when they start having children. (I still have EVERY book they ever owned). And then, a little downsizing--my dh is a pack rat.  We have books and magazines about flying like you wouldn't believe.  Our new house will have a library just for these.  My dh has always had to keep the magazines in plastic bins--I think if he had space he is actually organized  enough to get those big binders and have them on a shelf--what a  concept! So, lots of memories coming up for me, being in this house when the kids were 7 and 3 and every age up from there.  Lots of reflection and sweet memories and warmth. I am so lucky to get to do this in a leisurely way.  Our place has now been on the market for 16 months.  It's with a commercial real estate broker and the land is what is for sale-so thank God we don't have to show the house.  It will sell, it's just a matter of when.  And the longer it takes, the more we'll  end up getting for it.  I am trying to surrender the house selling and to know that it will happen when it is supposed to, and just be ready. I don't know how I made those letters so big and therefore don't know how to fix it. Technologically challenged, I always have been. So, I am feeling a bit disconcerted by retirement now.  Just that I still have this highly specialized valuable knowledge and it feels a little scary to let it wither away.  If ANY of you need questions answered about air traffic control, all you have to do is ask! I know this is a \"life passage\".  I know I have made the right decision.  People just keep asking me \"So what are you doing now?\"  And my answer is \"Whatever I want to.\"  I know I had recon only two weeks in to retirement and have spend the last 8 weeks recovering.  So it's sort of just now hitting me that I don't have to work. I don't miss the job, I was ready to go and that has always been the plan (and I worked my butt off to get to this point) but I do miss the people, and the quick, ruthless, gallows humor, and the cameraderie of having worked through a difficult situation together. I am glad everyone seems fine and am waiting to hear from RanD... I am home alone now until Sunday.  My house is clean.  Today I will finish sorting through my clothes and cleaning out my closet.  This is a good day. Love,  Sue",

Linda and Cris, sorry for LE issues.  Cris, I found when I had to wear my sleeve to work that NO ONE noticed.  I do get how bad it feels to have to wear the sleeve.  Linda, I think we all have to \"find the boundaries\" where our own LE is concerned. Last summer when I got my sleeve, the PT suggested I wear it once a week, and I had to increase that to twice a week.   Now, I only wear it for air travel and during my three-days-a-week exercise class. Anyway, I hope all the LE issues are resolved soon. Tomorrow is nipple surgery, scar revision, etc.  I am ready to be DONE with this process, and this should finish me up.  I can't help seeing it as the END of treatment for me, and it feels really good.

The rest was to \"revise\" the scars so they are not as big.  If you didn't have the tummy-scar tissue, I think they can take skin from the inside of your thighs high up or in back just below your bottom.  As to the sensate-but-lonely vs. perkily-symmetrical-but-numb discussion, I want to say just two things.  The first is that I had no idea how RESTORED I would feel with two boobies again.  The second is that my dh seems somehow to have memorized areas around the new, pretty, insensate boobies that are still sensitive.  I guess he's just paying attention, eh? One more decision I have to make is if the color of the nips is okay or if I want \"medical tattoos\".   (I don't think I want medical tattoos.) Who besides myself and my husband is going to SEE these nips??  No one.  So do they need to be perfect?  I don't think so.   I love you too, Kerry. Sue",

I have been very busy and scattered, discovering what retirement means for me, cleaning closets and getting rid of stuff.  Gave away most of my former work clothes because I won't be needing them and someone else does. It was funny seeing all those suits again--it feels like, \"did I really wear stuff like this\"? (As now it is likely to be workout togs or pajama pants and a tank).. I find myself moving away from this site a bit--this has been my main thread for quite a while and I will probably always check in, but I just have too much to do, and am looking to the future so gratefully. A woman in my church was just diagnosed with breast cancer, she is only 44 and has a 3 yo daughter. I gave her my Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and let her borrow my prayer quilt, have been answering her questions and showed her my reconstruction.  Her name is Donna and she is in that difficult not-knowing-what-the-plan-is-yet-but-researching-madly-and-scared stage if anyone has prayers to spare... Hope all are fine with colds/allergies, lung bacteria (it's HELL when you have to MAKE the medical people treat you correctly) and all that I have missed.  Eddie, me too--and still processing the emotions from \"this time last year\"... I love and miss all of you. Sue",

(Have to go back in Sept. for a filling) Rock, love Gemzar Guy! Dana, I am so sorry that you have to do chemo again, that TRIPLE sucks. Otter, thanks for the post card!  I am loving reading about the  cool temperatures, it is SO HOT here that we just stay inside all day.  Actually started an exercise program at one of the local hospital/fitness centers that is free, and is only offered to breast cancer survivors.  I went twice last week and am looking forward to going again tomorrow--I needed a small amount of structure back in my life, and this class meets monday-wednesday-friday and saturday. I forgot how good it feels to exercise really hard...and how your whole body hurts the next day but in a good way.  It is so glorious to be healthy.  And kerry, I totally get \"Oh, to have two again\".  I  told my PS 8 days after my surgery that I don't just feel reconstructed, I feel restored.  I had no idea that having two breasts (sort of) again would make me feel so healed. Noelle, sorry the store is having such a hard time. I'm going to call and order birthday gifts for my niece and sister this week! Rock, when are you coming home? Miss you guys and love all of you.

Otter, your hair!  It's glorious!!!  I'm sorry your dh doesn't seem to always realize what a gift he has in you. Jean, my rad onc moved the field a bit when my esophagus was impacted.  Don't know if that's possible for you.  She also prescribed something called carafate that was incredibly soothing and coated the sore area. Eddie, good to see your real posts again.  Love them. Noelle, again, glad you had a nice break. Mary, isn't it incredibly fulfilling when our teenagers give us a glimpse of who they really are... Rock, you forgot to add that your face had been compared to a supermodel, because that's how I think you look. Karin, thanks for the permission to enjoy the silence.  I am.  My dh, too, who is a silent type of guy anyway.  It's great being here and it being just the two of us.  Love all you guys and hope I didn't forget anyone,   Sue",

Just quiet time, reading on the front porch, a bit of shopping, dinner out, walks by a creek--and lots and lots of girl talk.  It was a really good weekend. Today after I got home from work I was outside with the dogs, and I felt this weird sensation on the back of my head--and it was the wind in my hair!!!

My sister is the best mother I know and I am so glad she is willing to do this.  Anyway, just wanted to share that---could the pray-ers among us pray for her to have strength, please? Hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving!!! Sue",

Colonoscopies.  I turned 50 and I know when I see my PCP later this month he is going to order one.  So I'll join the test-of-the-month club.  Oh, well.  Better to get it over with than to put it off, right? Work has been crazy stressful.   If I get really  stressed, so stressed my stomach hurts, I will take half an Ativan and that makes it bearable.  I just don't deal with stress well, the way I used to.  I talked to my onc and told her I am retiring in April and want to keep the Ativan scrip until then, she agreed. I find myself letting go of things and passing them on to my trainee---and it feels GOOD. Rock, Dec. 23 for a colonoscopy?  Do you have to wait for results or are they immmediate?  I'll be thinking of you, but not in too much detail ;O) LOVE YOU ALL Sue",

Today I will just be checking out and returning keys and ID badges (badges?!?) and hugging people goodbye for now.  Everyone says keep in touch but I wonder how many really will.  Another opportunity to find out who your friends are?  I am always surprised. I feel reflective on my life's work so far, and calm, and  ready for the next adventure.  I can't wait to see what happens next. Yesterday one of the controllers asked me if I wanted to come down and work airplanes this morning and I said, No thank you.  I lost my medical a year ago because of bc, and I did not know the last time I worked airplanes was the last time.  That's how I want to leave it, sort of, I went out at the top of my game. I will miss feeling like I am one of the few who can do my job (feeling important).  I know I am still important, just not sure how it;s all going to fit together now, I just know it WILL. Thanks May women for listening. My cousin, Mary Ann, who had been an alcoholic for as long as i can remember, died in her sleep night before last. She was 46. I am so, so sad.  We grew up together, she always looked up to me, we talked on the phone every couple of weeks, and every time I went home she made time for us to get together just me and her. I will miss her forever. And I am angry at the waste. I will be traveling tomorrow thru Sunday for the  funeral and will probably be out of  touch.  Again, thanks for listening.  I love all of you and wish we could do a group hug this morning, I could sure use one. Love, Sue",

She had very little bleeding during the operation and didn't even have to receive any blood.  Doc says she has great anatomy and they accomplished their goals of the bilateral reconstruct with a tummy tuck as a bonus! I havn't been able to see her yet, but she wanted me to post when I could.  Tonight: morphine......for her,  none for me, thanks, I am on sentry duty to fight infection. Mike",

My husband goes back to work tomorrow until Sunday. I can't swim in the pool until Sunday. (Whimper). On a good note, after moving twice in fifteen months, we finally found our church!

I was also afraid the port would hit right where a bra strap goes but it doesn't hurt even if the strap moves over on it once its healed, I'd say about a week post-surgery.  Good luck and peace with your decision.

Turns out they make wonderful pets--they go outside and run like the wind for five minutes (and it's a JOY to watch them run) and then they are ready for a three hour nap!!! And she is sossosososooo silky.  She's technically my son's dog but it's turning out that where you see her in that picture is where she really likes to be....don't know how that will turn out as he is nineteen and will be leaving home soon and thinks he is taking her with him. We also have a husky mixed with we don't know what--she is about 1/2 size, with husky markings, medium thick hair and a tail that bends back out over her back--and beautiful ice-blue husky eyes.  Her disposition is sort of like a small, angry Latina, but she is sweet.  TAC is Taxotere, Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  I am getting that as well.  I think it's one of the more aggressive chemo regimens, but my cancer was grade 3. But, I am only having six treatments so I guess it all averages out?  Roberta, I also miss my morning coffee, and Nancy, I miss all kinds of food. I just figure if I can't taste it anyway, it's a great opportunity to eat healthy--lots of steamed veggies and lean protien. I have also pretty much been able to walk about four days a week or more and that seems to really help me with my particular emotional symptoms.  I haven't had a period since before my surgery April 2nd, which is kind of weird since I had one due between surgery and the start of chemo--but I can really tell I am in chemopause, I guess that's what this is, and where a lot of the emotional symptoms are coming from for me. We are all going through a very emotional and trying experience anyway, as women we try to do everything and are usually quite able to pull it off, and losing that ability is hard enough without adding mood swings and hot flashes to the mix.   My heat tolerance is ZERO and my poor son and his girlfriend are lying around the living room in blankets all the time while I am nearly perishing of heat. Anyway, bcs glad your cold is better and hope you  got back to sleep, I am off to work today and actually get to argue the ATC rules with theorists in headquarters on a conference call this morning.  I have the advantage because I have worked in the field for thirty years and have a better grasp of the rules......so cheer me on girls as I fight for the poor beleaguered understaffed air traffic control ranks today!!! I hope I win the argument!! (Please, God, don't let chemobrain make me forget what the argument was about...) Love, Sue ",

(They are taking turns, not all at once).   How did I ever get so lucky to have this many people willing to give me their time and company and care?  I am very blessed. Love, Sue ",

Anyway, rest and be good to yourself and don't try to work two jobs (work and home) like you can when you are not doing chemo!!

I saw the oncologist today, whom I loved.  I will be having TAC X 6 every three weeks starting on April 24th.  The thing I didn't expect is she wants to then do six and a half weeks of radiation.  I was PLANNING (man plans, God laughs) once recovered from chemo to have my preventive mast with reconstruction and was considering TRAM flap.  Hadn't done a great deal of research because that is down the road and I have plenty to keep my obsessive, anxious brain busy right now.  The rads have implications as far as recon goes.  I don't want to do the saline implants because they are in a silicone envelope and the idea just feels creepy to me.  Anyway, the onc said she has seen a lot of women be unhappy with their results of TRAM flap and there is a 30% rate of permanent complications.  So I thought I was really attached to this idea of reconstruction with a tummy tuck, but now I find myself feeling--I just want to be here, I don't care if I just don't even have any reconstruction done.  Also the onc wants me to have the BRAC test.  I talked to my sister who discussed it with her GYN (she has always had lumpy breasts like I always did and has had several biopsies through the years) and her doctor told her she needed to have the BRAC test now and if it's positive she wants her to have a double mast and full hysterectomy.   So it's been an eventful day.  I also have long hair which I have always considered my best feature--I'm probably not doing the wig thing because it will be Texas in the summertime for me and it gets VERY hot.  I may change my mind, I have never even had my hair colored and I find myself realizing I have always wanted to be a redhead..........we'll see. Roberta, you and I are having the same treatment and we start the same day.  So, hello April chemo buddies!!! Sorry we all have to be here but glad we have each other, Sue ",

But you do have a treatment approaching and need to keep your strength level as high as possible.  So--all those people who said, if there's anything i can do, let me know? Call and let them know you can use a little house cleaning help.  Or if you go to church, call the church ladies!  People love to help, and it makes them feel good, like they are actually doing something when they feel so helpless to make a difference in your burden right now. I was able to afford to have house cleaning help and I can tell you it makes a real difference in how I feel--I live with two men (husband and son) and it bothers me a long time before it bothers them when the house is not clean (this may be a universal condition). Cindy, my dh told me that my eyes are always going to look the same.  Be at peace, if you can. Blessings and healing wishes, Sue ",

Lauren, I got my hair buzzed to day and I was so dreading it but it turns out I have a pretty head.  I am going back to work tomorrow if my white count is back up, just for a half day.  Will the stubble fall out? (I guess that's a stupid question).  I did buy an electric razor today and got some advice from my hairdresser about \"grooming\" a bald head.  I can't wait for the hair under my arms and on my legs to fall out!!! That happens, right? Angie, glad you are feeling good and looking forward to Mother's Day.  I am right there with you.  My dh and my thirtieth wedding anniversary is the 13th, we may go away, just for the night.  I sure didn't plan to spend it bald, but now that its done, it's really not so bad. Tigwin, I also think you should go bald and flat on one side, if you are. (Don't know if you've had a mast or not).  But that's just me. You should do what you feel comfortable with but there's a big part of me that is feeling, this is what it looks like, deal with it. Cheers, hugs, hope you all have a nice evening!! Sue ",

ATC is a young person's job, it always will be.  So when I got to work yesterday, my colleagues had prepared a replay of my last three sessions of working live traffic---which I didn't know at the time were the last ones.  (You can't control live traffic and take any drugs at all--I am now what is referred to as medically disqualified because of the bc diagnosis and the treatment).  It was a really sentimental, keepsake-y thing to do and it made me cry.  Also they had put the following sign on our office door, which we keep closed--\"One of our workers is immunosuppressed.  If you or someone in your family is sick, please visit this office at another time.  Thank You.\" Keep in mind these are low-tech, cro-magnon men who talk about football and guns.  I feel so special.  So that was my first day back at work. Nancy, good luck with PET scan.  Hope everyone has a good Friday!! Sue ",

We went to see a movie together tonight and when we said goodbye she couldn't stop crying--that was saying goodbye to myself and my dh, not my son, that will be in the morning!

I am having coffee right now, and this is my week where I can drink it, and milk too because they taste almost normal.  And my foot symptoms from the taxotere seem to be resolving or at least not getting much worse.  I put ice on them last time during the infusion--the doc said there's no evidence that helps but also no evidence that it doesn't. So between chewing ice during the Adriamycin and forcing water and peeing every ten minutes during the Cytoxan, now to add icing my feet during the taxotere, getting chemo is becoming a pretty active thing.  Plus I think all that gives me a small sense of control, which you have all heard me say at least 47 times is something I need..Glad all you good stuff is happening in your good week, Roberta. Glad you are enjoying the superpowers saga--I am too.  As to my imagination--you know that phrase \"Idle hands are the devil's workshop\"?  Well, that's my brain.   It has to be engaged, or I can get in trouble!!  Noelle, hope you have few se's and the bloating/bitchiness is gone when you wake up. Hope everyone else is feeling fine this a.m. and has a great day--I woke up late and don't have time to walk, besides it's raining. I'll walk tonight when the Texas heat is gone or at least less....

And in less than FOUR weeks, you will have had your last chemo!  By the way I think you look fabulous.  Love shines out of your face, and that's what makes any of us beautiful, I think. I get head stubble evey time but have my dh shave it as it annoys me.  Guess this will be the last time I have him do that, as next time, once it falls out again, I will be waiting for it to grow back!  What a novel idea!  But what does a person do who usually hasn't worn much makeup and has no clue how to draw in eyebrows?  Start learning now while they are still there to copy?  I am lost-ish.

We went in the bathroom and closed the door.  I took off the bra, and removed the gauze which was just lying on top, and we both looked.  I don't remember exactly what he said, (morphine pump) but he touched me, and I believe it was one of the most beautiful moments of our almost 30-year marraige.  He was all for the eventual bilat mast with eventual reconstruction, I just had the left one removed and we are waiting for chemo.  I have also been going around flat on one side with loose clothing, I am only 6 days post-surgery (My best friend refers to this look as \"gypsy casual\").  Otter, I'm going for the IPEX bra with a puffy as well, I think.  I'm only going to wear it when I need to power-dress, though.  I have this feeling of, \"here it is, deal with it\". I am also going this weekend for a haircut, as short as I can stand.  I have always felt that my hair was my best feature, it is long, curly and a darkish red-blonde. The haircut will be a baby step.  The most wonderful part of this sh&*tty experience so far has been all the support from family, friends and co-workers. I work in a male-dominated field (air traffic control) and all these tough, silent guys have been calling my cell phone to check on me and tell me they hope I'll be back soon and they are praying for me--it's a real wakeup call to realize one is loved by so many people. I also have the weird underarm thing and a surprising amount of pain still.  An area down the back of my arm that was numb got feeling back yesterday--and IT HURTS! But so far my BS has been generous with the pain meds. I will see her on Thursday.  Did anyone else get a sheet of exercises to do?  I did, but nobody told me how many to do or how often--I went for it right away and did too much, woke up in the night in EXTREME pain.  I've toned the repetitions down and started walking again, just 30 minutes helps so much.  I live in Texas and the weather is perfect right now.  Anyway, that's my accepting the new me so far.  The support and information on these boards has been invaluable to me. Thanks, Sue ",

Anyway, I just wanted to encourage you that you have come to the right place for help and support.  The ladies on this web site are amazing. Hugs to you, Sue ",

Worth airport), and here is what I am used to--when I say the words, immediate action happens.  I have had to learn through the years to turn that off when I am dealing with people instead of airplanes, but letting go of that CONTROL is what I am so struggling with in this.  I KNOW in my head that the sooner I can let it go the faster I will feel better, but my instinct, my reflex, my conditioned response, is to reach for that ILLUSION of being in control of events.  My youngest son was involved with drugs and a year ago we sent him to rehab, got through it with lots of family counselling which has made us a stronger family.  We discovered through this counseling that I have lots of issues around---wait for it---BEING IN CONTROL.  My son, Sam has been clean and sober for one year just last week, I am prouder of him than I have ever been of anyone, and I have so much to be thankful for. Usually I am so good at finding the good side in things and looking for the silver lining and it's not as if life hasn't handed me some hard times before.  I guess it's just different when you feel you have lost your health, your very ability to just feel good and as much as you tell yourself it is temporary, it becomes like chronic pain and begins to wear on you. But  I just woke up, had a restful night's sleep, it's a brand new Saturday and I actually feel like maybe doing some light housework and inviting a friend over to spend some time this afternoon--thanks for listeining I would go nuts if not for these boards.  No one who hasn't been through this can understand the feelings. Thanks and hugs and a beautiful Saturday to all, Sue ",

It really sucks that nothing tastes excellent anymore.   About the mouth thing--I'm getting Adriamycin, and they have me chew ice the whole time it is being infused.  This is supposed to help with the mouth stuff.  But i think the Taxotere also causes a mouth thing with my taste buds that starts about day 8---and lasts through about day 13 or 14.  Just a burny feeling like Sandy described, and no taste buds. Really am sick of it after only 2 tx.  I wonder if keeping a cool mouth during the taxotere would help? New se--insomnia.  Do I add another drug,  or just suffer and adjust?  I know, I'm whining, but I am a great sleeper when i am not doing chemo.  So another thing I have always taken for granted is just gone--whine, whine. I didn't win the argument, but I forced a very high member of management to put his arbitrary interpretation of the rules in writing instead of just making a verbal pronouncement with no accountability.  It was very technical and dangerous, but I find that since my priorities have changed and I sort of realize what is important that all of a sudden I am fearless and effective in this arguing--because I could care less what they think of me.  I have decided to retire at the end of November and I JUST DON'T CARE like I used to!!!!  Puts one in a unique position of power.....and I confess that I have ALWAYS enjoyed a good argument!!!

(Can you tell I'm feeling lazy today?)  I can't face the idea of radiation yet.  I still have one more chemo to get through.  I am taking it one moment at a time today.  Only one meltdown so far, but it's early. I have what I believe is a rectal fissure.  It hurts. And, it is bleeding.  And, I think my hemoglobin is low, and have called the onc nurse to see if I can come in before Thursday and get it checked, since I am bleeding every time I poop and feel somewhat short of breath like I did when hemoglobin was low before. I am feeling a bit paranoid, but yet concerned. I think one is allowed to be a little bit paranoid...this is some scary stuff when you really stop and think about it.  My youngest is leaving home in just a few days.  Part of me is going \"Oh, holy sh-t\" and part of me is saying \"Hallelujah\".  Very strange.  We are going to spend some time together today, just do some errands as I wait for the onc nurse to call back. Did any of that make sense? Can you tell I feel like warmed-over dog crap? Sue ",

This operation was relatively easy, although waking  up afterward with the full pain (you know how they have to wake you up first before they can treat your pain?) was pretty painful.  I didn't cough if I could help it, although holding a pillow there if I absolutely had to cough helped.  I was in the hospital for two days. After I got home I was in bed for another three days, but I am 52 years old, retired, with few responsiibilities. And I have dogs, so  they make me walk, which makes me get well. Turns out they want to do 28 rads and treat the entire sternum...and the mediastinal lymph nodes. That was a bit of a surprise. Had scans today. Trying not to think about them until about Tuesday.
