I was also wondering about a 'lump' I can see and feel under my armpit is actually a lump or muscle? It stays the same even if I flex my arm, but I can't tell if it's a lymph node or not. I've never had an US done on my breasts. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

I have been dx with the dense breast tissue but they have never done an US. I am having the diagnostic mammo. No- my primary doctor does not know about the lump. I also have lines that are indented on my breast that are on the far right upper side of my right breast and that is the armpit that has the lump. I'm sorry I'm being so 'needy'... I am thinking too hard about this. Your help and calmness is helping me. I thank you for all your advice.",
