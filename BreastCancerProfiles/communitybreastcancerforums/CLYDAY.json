I started a Pilates with stretchbands Dvd so I was sore this morning before treatment. It is so uncomfortable still how my arms are propped up! I had to make them stop. They suggested I take Motrin or something prior. Been lubing and free boobin as much as possible. Praying it helps! One more sleep and treatment in the morning then head home! I was in tears yesterday talking to my lil guy....he doesn't understand where Mommy is...breaks my heart! But tomorrow I will get home in time to pick him up from Preschool....can't wait!! Hope everyone has a great weekend. Congrats Betsy for being all done!!",
