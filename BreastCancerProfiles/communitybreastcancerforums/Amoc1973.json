I do not believe this type of study would be permitted in the US (thank god), but id have to look into it. Im not sure on that one. I've spoken to Chang & skoracki as fortunately we have mutual friends. Both made it very clear that it is NOT a cure in most cases. They truly want to help pts. They are Both extraordinary physicians with the very best intentions. The fact I was told I didn't need the surgery spoke volumes to me. I have no idea of others motivations, but those guys are cutting edge & ethical. Of course that's my opinion. But I also know about 30 docs & nurses that work with them and I've been told amazing things. I just don't want people to think all physicians are out for themselves. The vast majority really really care. And if you're at a place like MDA....you're top of your field in the country & prob the world. ",

I worked w an awesome breast surgeon who a couple years ago started getting very verbal about \"toradol before incision\". So I picked her brain. I hadn't heard of it & I do anesthesia for breast cancer ALL the time. When my diagnoses happened I went to her. She then informed me about the blocks showing same thing. I then read about it. Lots of surgeons & anesthesia providers aren't even aware of these things. The big cancer places are I'm sure. I had an ax node dissection because we already knew I had pos nodes. But I guarantee you I would've asked for the block for just sentinal node too. I do understand why in a pain perspective it might not be deemed neccassary w snb. But....sometimes you have SNB then pathology walks in & says 'it's positive' then you end up w/ an ax node dissection that wasn't planned. That is ALWAYS  as possibility. So.......yes they're done for SNB. But again. Don't focus on 'what ifs'. You're Gonna do great. The odds are def in your favor! ",

It should be given before incision. Also ask about a Paravertebral block. Looks like it may reduce recurrence too. It's also amazing for pain post op. I did both the toradol & the block. Definitely ask! Some don't like toradol because it inhibits platelets---so could cause more bleeding in surgery. So it is usually used at the end of the procedure. From what I understand it needs to be before incision. google. Print the studies. Take them to your surgeon. Also show your anesthesia provider. ",

The number one cancer hospital in the country supports these procedures on CERTAIN patients. I've read about 3 studies published from MD Anderson on the bypass surgery. I was also provided w several more (from other universities, countries). I was also told the surgerywas unnecessary  for me at this time. But we are monitoring in case I have any progression. When you work for a large university/state institution your pay as a surgeon is set....you don't make more money for doing unnecessary surgeries. Private practice is a diff story of course. But I am VERY thankful that insurance providers cannot dictate what my physician deems as necc in my particular case. That is a decision between a pt & their doctor. I was fully informed of the risks & the benefits. Also, if there was a study where someone was given fake/sham surgery then that is disgusting. That IS NOT ethical. First do no harm. You don't PRETEND to do a procedure on someone & expose them to the risk of anesthesia, infection, complications & death. That's hideous. I've never heard of such a thing. Disturbing.",

Alls been the same as with compression: occasional mild flare up that calm down after a week or so. I swear these got less frequent when I dropped the sleeve.

I prob need to wrap 24/7 for a while but I'm an anesthesia provider & it's very hard to do my job wrapped. I find I can use my arm better if I don't use padding when I wrap but not sure that's a good idea. Seems everything I read says padding. Anyway....I'd like to hear what works for people.

I know everyone is diff but just wanted to post as I know I was always desperate to read good things on here. Hope everyone is well",

He said most people still have to wear their sleeve after. 17% don't after LNT & around 10% don't after bypass. But he said there was usually improvement. And less than 1% chance of either worsening the lymph or developing new lymphedema from donor site but there was a very small chance. I live in Houston. These 2 docs who did study are at MD Anderson. I'd imagine there isnot a lot of controls in this type of study. But who knows if the edema would've improved over the same time w/o the surgery....? Mine has improved over time & I don't wear my sleeve much anymore. I do wear it w workouts, flying, & other high risk times. ",

But mine seems so random. Sometimes I'll swell even with the sleeve for no reason. Other times I won't. Then I won't wear my sleeve & it will look soooo much better...then other days not so much. It's frustrating as hell. ",

I measure everyday & seems to be stable except on occasion will flare up a little. I'll wear my sleeve for a few hours & will go back to 'normal'. I also pump before I go to bed.

In ya'lls opinion what do you think my treatment should be at this point? My therapist is an OT, CLT & LANA certified....she has over 10 years exp & only deals with lymphadema. She did MLD & I can have more but like I said she didn't think it was neccassary. I'm super worried of this worsening..esp w rads. I haven't yet met w my RO but my OT says he is very proactive & sends her pts all the time. She said he does his own measurements before, throughout, & after rads.",

Initial one was custom made (I think) from lymphadivas. This one is Juzo. I'm to wear that one tomorrow & see if better. She's a very reputable fitter...recommended by Baylor & MD Anderson here in Houston. Thanks Kira for the info as well. My LE therapist told me this protocol showed to reduce the swelling or bring measurements to normal after 30d in majority of people & then garment w high risk times only should maintain.....? I'll ask her about the protocol u mentioned & see if it in fact its the same one u cited. My arm measurements are only 2% diff but I def have LE. I initially went 2 weeks after surgey & it was 0.5% (around 10cc)....3 mo later 0.6%....now I'm 7 mo postop and it's 2% (41cc). Its mild but I'm super freaked it'll get worse. I'm not gonna tolerate the wrist swelling as I had none before. My swelling seems to be forearm close to elbow crease...all my underside forearm veins have disappeared. Man....I've been wearing this for 3 days & wondering if it's really helping anything.",

I had wore it above the bones yesterday & noticed my wrist was swollen at end of the day when I removed it....I don't usually have swelling in wrist. Also, I was told the edema can initially worsen a bit when first using sleeve. Any thoughts???? Thanks!!!

I'm wearing the garment smooth but using my hand the material creases. Im always making sure all material is smooth. Do you experience the wrist bumpyness?",
