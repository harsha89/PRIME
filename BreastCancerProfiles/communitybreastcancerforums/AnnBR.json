It's been comforting to me to read about your journeys and to know that indeed, we have each others backs. I had a UXM in Dec. of last year and am having my remaining breast removed on May 22. At the time I had my UXM, I made the decision not to remove my other breast. I consulted with an oncologist of course, but not with a plastic surgeon. The PS I chose for reconstruction is 3.5 hours away and I saw him in Feb. of this year. Prior to my appointment, I was required to send him my initial MRI which was read by one of their radiologists. A follow up mammogram and ultrasound were clear, but my first BC was not detected by those tests so I decided to forgo a biopsy and have it removed. In hindsight, I wish I would have made the decision for a BMX in Dec., but I am not going to beat myself up. I know it was the right decision for me at the time. I'm not sure why I am sharing all of this, maybe just to say that BC forces you to make some tough decisions (as many of you know!) Thanks ladies, you are all so wonderful! Ann",

My surgeon had been keeping an eye on a slight indention of my left nipple for awhile but he never felt anything. After six months he said, \"let's get in there and put both our minds to rest.\" When he called me two days later with the news, I was shocked. It became all consuming until I began to educate myself, making me feel like I am in control. All I know for now is that it is Stage 1, grade 2-3, ER+, HER2-. I had an appointment with an oncologist last week who ordered an MRI, which is scheduled for this Friday. For the most part I am calm and am trying not to dwell on it, but then I have surges of panic where my mind races to worse case scenario. I meet with the oncologist next week and she will recommend which surgical option would be best for me. This waiting game is so hard! I am so glad I found this site, reading through the posts has been very comforting and I know I am not alone!",
