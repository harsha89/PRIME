      "Content": "Catob1969 wrote: Good morning, I am newly diagnosed with iDC(invasive ductal carcinoma).3.8 CM right breast. I have had two ultrasounds, and MRI and a core biopsy. I met with an oncologist on February 20 who recommended that due to the size and a recent *concerning* PAP smear, i see an ob-gyn surgeon who deals with all women's cancer types. I had blood drawn, and am E/P positive and HER2 negative, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 negative. They have sent out oncotype testing as well. I went to the surgeon and had a culposcopy. I meet with the ob-gyn surgeon tomorrow 3/12/19 for results of the culposcopy, treatment needed or options and more discussion about the breast tumor. I was also asked to speak with the medical oncologist at the breast center to determine two things: Should we do neoadjuvant therapy to shrink the tumor before surgery? What kind of therapy (before or after) am i able to receive as I also have an autoimmune disease. I take immuno-suppressants for that. There for immuno-therapy may not be an option. My head is spinning, I can't even say for sure what stage I am because they are planning on doing the node biopsy when they do the surgery. This feels like some sort of weird limbo. I see the medical Oncologist on March 27th and have more questions than clear thoughts. Is there anything specific I should be asking him? I feel like I am in a tunnel and all i can hear is bits and pieces of information, Catherine Log in to post a reply",
