Your input appreciated. Mimi Log in to post a reply",

(missed the 6 mth due to no ins.) In 2005 had mammo and again they called me in for u/s. Said I had \"matted lymph nodes\" in right br, should follow up in 6 mth. (again family issues didn't get back to follow up till last week)  These were palpable to me too.  Now just went Friday had exam, doc felt the nodes in right br said felt like either two nodules or two hard lymph nodes, sending me to breast specialist (waiting for appt) to get me into mammogram (long wait) so she felt like the specialist could get me in ASAP.  She asked me if I had noticed enlarged nodes over my right clavicle bone, told her no, but really didn't think about it much till afterwards when I noticed I do feel a small puffy area over my clavicle bone... anyone know why this would be linked or had the same experience?  Also... should I push for a lymph node biopsy  since this has been going on so long or be settled with the usual routine of mammo and ultrasound?   Thanks for any input.

Thanks, Mimi",
