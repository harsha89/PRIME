And Congratualtions to you being 3 years out.  It really helps me to describe my experiences in the present tense.  It brings it to life and to the present moment.  I actually have a writing collection of many of my bc experiences and most of them are about my return for a follow-up dr. visit/test.  And I will keep dancing and perhaps do a dance on behalf of NED (I love to dance!)  To health and healing and all the best to you.

Tears fill my eyes.  I am so thankful.  My husband takes me out for breakfast for the best blueberry pancakes ever!  Okay, only 243 pills (tamoxifen) to go, but who's counting?  It will be another important day when I swallow that last pill. Peace and Blessings! ",
