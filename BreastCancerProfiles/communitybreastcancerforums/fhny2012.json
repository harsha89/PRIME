Wishing everyone a wonderful, healthy day!",

I have no signs of lymphedema right now, but I had 21 nodes removed in the ALND during my BMX, and I know that radiation would only put me much more at risk for LE. How much of a risk are the rads?  What have been your experiences? Thank you so much in advance for your insight!

Thank you all!",
