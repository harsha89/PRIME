During self examination I found a lump and was referred to a breast surgeon who decided on a biopsy...pathology was ADH. I had a lumpectomy along with the excisional biopsy recommended. Healing was pretty quick for me. I have a sister who at 35 had advanced breast cancer. My surgeon recommended genetic counseling at the City of Hope...this genetics team was wonderful and explained my risks. I went for BRCA testing and came back negative with a variable of unknown significance at the BRCA 2 level. It was recommended I have a prophylactic hysterectomy. I ended up having the hysterectomy because of severe bleeding due to polyps within my uterus. As far as ADH, I decided to go with my breast surgeons recommendation of being tested every 6 months. My protocol was Mammogram, Ultrasound, MRI. Unfortunately, In 2006 I fell into the category of layoff which means I also lost my PPO health plan. I now have an HMO, which means I have to really push to get further testing past the mammogram. I am so glad I came across this forum...when I was first diagnosed with ADH I felt I had nowhere to turn. Take care ladies.",

As far as breast density goes, I am a scale 3/heterogenously dense. Currently, I filed a grievance through my health plan and was refered to another breast surgeon. I'm hoping to finally get an ultrasound. KSD- I questionned why women who are shown to have dense breasts not referred for a different method of screening...U/S or MRI. My healthcare plan took the information, but also requested I speak to the breast surgeon regarding this issue.",

I was screened every 6 months with mammogram, ultrasound, mri. Now, seven years later, I have not had anymore lumps...some calcifications which required more magnified views turned out benign. I was screened at the City of Hope with a specialized MRI-Rodeo which screens one breast at a time. It's difficult to go have this done two days in a row, but I did. During this time I was told I have several areas of concern. To this date, I have not had another biopsy, lumpectomy. I did however take Tamoxifen for two years after my excisional biopsy. Could be the standards have changed for tamoxifen therapy. Although at this point in my life, I feel that my healthcare provider is not monitoring me well enough. I have an HMO-Kaiser...they do not monitor well enough in my opinion. If you would like to discuss this further, please private message me. Take care, Maggie",

Request a copy of your medical records and keep a personal file for yourself. Also, once you make an appointment with your new place, request your mammogram and ultrasound prints and take them with you. Always remember, you do not deserve to be treated this way. Your concerns are valid. Keep us posted.",
