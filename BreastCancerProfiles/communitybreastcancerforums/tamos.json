(I wish I had found this site while I was doing chemo and before surgery).   And for that I thank you all for sharing your personal journey.   I started rads Jan 20 so today was #4 of #31. I do however have a question about radiation.  So many are afraid of mammograms etc in part because of the radiation.  So then why do they give us radiation to kill cancer cells?  Can't seem to wrap my head around that one....",
