To meet the criteria, the oncs had to confirm that I COULD die within 12 months. That's the stink news! I am choosing to focus in the COULD, it is my intent that I will be one of those 'miracles' that people write about. In saying that, I am feeling rather ick and aware of my mortality. I know that HER2 is aggressive and I am hoping that X and T cocktail will keep me above water for a loooong long time. As such, Im looking for hope. Any ladies with the same onc type and liver mets who have outlived 12 months? Pae xo. I surrender to God and the Angels and I choose PEACE.

It had been scheduled for an hour instead of the normal 30 minute session. I can't help but worry that he is going to cancel or change things, or tell me my expiry date. The schedulers have told me its a 'continuance' and don't have any additional information. Why would they have a longer session? It's too soon for scans. Next appointment is 11th Feb, I fear in going to drive myself and my family batty with anxiety. Help, please. Pae xo. I surrender to God and the Angels and I choose PEACE.
