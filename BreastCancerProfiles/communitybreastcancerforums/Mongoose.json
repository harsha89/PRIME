    "Content": "Mongoose wrote: I am very young (21) and im not worried about breast cancer but on a routine papsmear, my doctor found large lump and referred me to get an ultrasound. Today, I go in, I have the tech locate the lump, and then she does the ultrasound. The doctor (radiologist) says he sees nothing in the ultrasound, but refused to give me a breast exam and tell me what the lump is (cyst, gland, fibrous tissue, ect). Me, my doctor, and the tech all felt it but the diagnoser wouldnt touch me. My insurance wont pay for another ultrasound with a different doctor. Should I let this go, b/c of my age,assume its a gland or something, or pursue this? Log in to post a reply",
