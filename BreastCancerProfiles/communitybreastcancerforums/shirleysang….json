It has taken mt almost 6 months to feel good. I had such bad pain in the chest area. It felt like there were 10 ace bandages wraped around my chest. The pain was really bad under my left arm were the 2 node were taken. I was taking over the counter pain meds 4 or 5 times a day. All of the sudden one day last week my husdand came home from work and I told him I had NOT taken any pain meds that day. From that day on 8 days and counting I have not taken any pain pills. Keep doing your exercises every day. It really really helps. Trust me it will get better. One day at a time. Your sister in pink, Shirley",

My husband was in NY at the time all this was going on. I was sure I would get the same answer from my G. P office. I got a call two days later on a Friday morning from the Nurse Pract and was told OVER THE PHONE ( you have stage 2 breast cancer ) here is a phone number to call for a Breast Surgeon. WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I called to make a appointment for Monday afternoon. Thank God my husband came home from NY that Saturday. I choose to have a double mastectomy w/o reconstriction. I don't regret it at all. I wish they would have called me in to tell me. I think being told over the phone is just about the coldest and meanest way to treat a person. I will never forgive the Nurse Pract for that. Your Sister in Pink, Shirley",

I went on line to John Hopkins Hospital @ questions and answers forum about 2 weeks ago and one of the breast cancer nurse's said to get Rehab Medicine Therapy. She said it's tight scar tissue.  I'm not a small person. 5 ft 190 lb. It looks like I'm 9 months preg. The Dr's don't know anymore than we do about what's happening to our body's. I had a Breast Surgeon and I still have the rubberband feeling. All we can do at this point is take it one day at a time and pray for a better tomorrow.  It does help to know that I'm not alone with this rubberband feeling and that it's not all in my head. At least the nerves are now using they're inside voice. LOL. May God bless us all, Your Sister in Pink, Shirley",

With the help of my husband and daughter we decided to have them both removed without reconstrution. If I were to have just the tumor removed or a mastectomy of the left breast I would have to have radiation treatments. My husband didn't want me to be in anymore pain than I had to be. One surgery was enough. Besides it takes about a full year for a new set of boobs. I have heard some really bad storys about reconstructions that went bad including infections and do overs. No Thank You. I just put my fake boobs in and away we go. I just have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years. No problem. Don't get me wrong. It does take time to recover from a double mastectomy. I would say about 7 to 8 weeks. There is a tightness around the chest that feels like a rope being pulled tight. Best of luck to you. Yor Sister in Pink, Shirley",

The reason I chose it was 1) Cancer in left breast didn't want it to go to the right side.2) If I just had the lump removed I would have to have had ratiation.3) I have heard more times then not about after having the lump removed it comes back in the other breast or another spot is found..4) Infections from the expanders that are put in. 5) One surgery was enough for me.6) Didn't want to go a year getting expanders put in then have another surgery to have silicone ones put in.
