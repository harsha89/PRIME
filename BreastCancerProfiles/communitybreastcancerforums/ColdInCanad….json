Bawled my eyes out right in the middle of the hair salon. Made the lady in the chair beside me cry too. And my stylist. HOWEVER, I ended up LOVING the pixie cut. It was SO easy. And getting all that emotion out of the way before chemo took the rest of my hair was really helpful.  Thirteen days after my first infusion, my hair started coming out in handfuls. And it was pretty gross. I have this \"THING\" about loose hair. So, I was SO glad it was short hairs falling out and not long strands. I shaved it the next morning - with an electric razor with no guard. My scalp HURT when the hair started coming out, so shaving it was a huge relief. I didn't cry at all. I wasn't even unhappy about it. Just relieved that there weren't any weird birthmarks or scars underneath my hair. lol! Honestly, this was the least traumatic part of the whole chemo experience for me. The really crappy stuff came later, but that's a whole 'nother story. Oh, and I used a lint roller to grab the little hair stubbles that continued to fall out over the next few days. Which amused me. A lot. :)   I never bothered with a wig - it was summer and really hot - but I did do hats and scarves to protect my scalp from the sun.  Good luck with your treatments.",

I finished up 6 rounds of Taxotere and Carboplatin on July 18, and I pretty much had every side effect and reaction imaginable. So I'm either the best or the worst person to respond to your question. :) I can't speak to the effects of taking drugs for other conditions along with chemo, but I can give you the run-down on the types of SEs your mom can expect. I had (in no particular order): nausea (the BIG one for me), muscle and joint pain, fatigue (lots and lots of naps), numbness and tingling in fingers and toes, hair loss, brittle nails, swollen sore mouth/taste buds (to the point that I couldn't eat anything expect mush), water retention (17lbs worth), constipation, diarrhea, stomach cramps, memory issues (i.e., Chemo Brain), watery eyes, and runny nose. Whew. I also had an allergic reaction to both the Taxotere (landed me in the hospital when my WBC tanked) AND carboplatin (in the last round).  NOW, let me just say that EVERYONE reacts differently to chemo, and not everyone has EVERYTHING like I did. My MO considers me an anomaly - I say I like to be different. :) In spite of everything, however, I made it through, and your mom will too. The oncology nurses in the Chemo Lounge are AMAZING and are FULL of information. They've seen it all, and I often find them more helpful than my MO when it comes to side effects.  I hope I've been a little bit helpful. You might have a look at this thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/... Best wishes to you and your Mom!",

My story is fast-paced. I'm 38, wife, mother of 2 (ages 8 & 11). I found a lump in my breast in late Oct/early Nov., 2013, had it checked out my my family doc, had a mammogram (which was CLEAR) and an ultrasound (which showed something suspicious), and then a biopsy. On Jan 27, I was diagnosed with 3.5cm of High Grade DCIS-MI. I met with a surgical oncologist a week later, had a right mastectomy on Feb.11. Pathology showed 0.6cm of High Grade IDC long with the DCIS but since all the cancer was removed with my breast (and part of my muscle - Ugh!), we THOUGHT we were finished.  HOWEVER, the final pathology came back as HER2+, ER/PR-. So it's 6 rounds of chemo and a year of Herceptin for me. I has a Port inserted yesterday (and THAT is an experience I NEVER want repeated. Yowch!), and I start chemo on Friday, April 4. I confess I am rather nervous. I cut my beautiful curly locks off this past Saturday and went to a pixie cut, which, after the initial tears and horror, I actually LIKE. I've decided to forgo the whole wig thing for now, and I've been hat shopping. MAN, that is FUN! I'm amassing quite the collection. :) It is lovely to \"meet\" all of you!",

Sending hugs and healing your way. LovieLovie: THANK YOU for your wisdom. I confess I am worried about side effects and eating and vomiting and mouth sores and all sorts of nasty other things. My 11-year-old daughter today finally said to me \"MOM! GEEZ! Why are worrying about something that has NOT even happened yet?!\" Ah, yes, and the student surpasses the teacher. At least I know she's listening to me, right? :) Truthfully, it is just so hard to know what to expect, and the unknown is SCARY.  clarrn: I have the same thinking as you regarding the nausea and vomiting (although my oncologist assures me that they \"have meds for that!\"). I spent TWO pregnancies vomiting. Throughout the ENTIRE pregnancies, from start to finish. The second one was worse than the first - I used to get up in the middle of the night to throw up the remainder of the food I had eaten the day before. And I would choose my meals based on what they'd be like coming back up. Gross, I know. I was there. EW. But I figure if I can endure THAT, I can totally, without a DOUBT endure THIS. If it happens, because, well, my daughter makes an excellent point. ;) Blueberry4: You are STRONG. You are STRONG STRONG STRONG! You ARE! You are a WOMAN! Women give birth - even if you haven't, you CAN. Because your BODY and your MIND are STRONG. And when you feel you are not, you JUST KEEP SWIMMING, because the people around you, physically, and in spirit, we have GOT YOUR BACK. And truly? SHOWING UP is STRENGTH. It's all in the definition, Friend. You are amazing. *high five to you* Tomorrow is THE DAY. Chemo begins. I have a bag of goodies packed, bought some new games on the ipad, and I'm...ready. One day at a time, right? BTW, I started Dexamethasone today, and WHOA, that stuff is potent. Especially for someone who gets a little loopy on extra strength Tylenol. A little dizzy, and a little giddy. Plus, it's giving me a headache. And that's all I have to complain about, so, YEAH, I'm pretty okay with that. :) Saying prayers and Waving my pompoms for you all! ",

For someone who isn't on ANY medications (and can barely remember to take a multivitamin once a week!), it was a bit disconcerting to suddenly be someone who could open her own pharmacy. My 11-year-old daughter got a look at my stash and said \"MOM. Whew. Good thing we're not flying on any trips, cuz those drug dogs at the airport would be ALL over you!\" Oh yeah, she's a barrel of laughs, that one. :) SharonDe, I'm in Canada, so I don't know how different things are here versus in the US. Here in Alberta, there is a Chemo Class you can take that answers all your questions about meds and the process, etc. My treatment started so quickly, there wasn't really time for me to take the class, so my oncology nurse spent some time with me, going over EVERYTHING. I have printouts too, so I can refer back to them, but I did have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Except for the port. I knew the port was coming, but as for the process? My surgeon for that was an idiot with a staff of idiots to back him up, so I had NO idea what to expect, even while the port was actually being put in. My questions were all brushed off as I asked them, and I was virtually ignored. But I digress. In answer to your question, YES, I was provided with quite a bit of information from the oncologist and his nurses and assistants. However, I also found quite a lot of information here on this site - there's really nothing like hearing it from people who have been there and experienced it. :) If you need more info from your doctors, ask. I am PERFECTING the art of asking questions. I'm sure I'm annoying the heck out of some people, but hey, I have cancer, so they should suck it up. ;) clarrn, I hope all went well today. Rest, rest, rest!  lilyrose53, Welcome to the club no one wants to join. Good luck on your port insertion tomorrow. If the nurse tells you you don't need anything for the pain because it's just like going to the dentist, she is a LYING LIAR WHO LIES. Just saying. ;) P.S. Take the drugs if they offer them to you.  LovieLovie, THANK YOU for your advice. You are so helpful! I DID contact the oncology nurse on call regarding the \"Zapping\", and she assured me that it was pretty normal. She was very sympathetic, told me to take Tylenol, and told me to call back if it didn't help (it did), because \"they have meds for that.\" It seems they have meds for everything, but I just get all wacko on them. I feel like I have to chose between gross side effects and feeling like I've sucked back Happy Gas. It's lose-lose, really. I'd LOVE to chose the Happy Gas, but I DO have two children to take care of, and it's much safer for them if I'm on Planet Earth. Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right dosage of the right meds? ",

I have never been so tired in all my life - I actually fell asleep in the middle of EATING A SNACK. True story. :D I wanted to comment on the whole hair thing. Three weeks ago, I walked into the salon and told my stylist about my cancer. And I told her to do the pixie cut thing. And I gotta say, if you're thinking of getting a pixie cut before chemo takes your hair, JUST DO IT. Seriously. Don't get me wrong, it is HARD. I cried. I had finally, after YEARS of fighting with it, made peace with my unruly wavy hair. I had finally figured out how to manage it. I was attached to it. But in the end, I found that I really really REALLY liked the pixie cut. It is so EASY, you know? And, personally, at the risk of sounding completely and utterly vain, I think it's adorable. I can sleek it back, or spike it up, or do a combination of the two. I may just decide to keep it this length afterwards too. Here's an \"After\" photo:  Today, two weeks less a day from Round 1, I woke up to a scalp that was HURTING. And it didn't take long before my hair started falling out in handfuls. SUPER GROSS. Like GAG gross. And I am SO HAPPY that it is SHORT hairs falling out, and not long curly locks. Because that would be even MORE super gross than it already is. The Big Shave is happening this weekend. It's kinda scary. Because YOU JUST NEVER KNOW what's going to be under the hair. Like, what if there's some freaky birthmark? Or a weird tattoo your mom never told you about? If I find anything really cool, I'll definitely post photos. ;) In conclusion, don't be afraid to go short BEFORE the chemo takes your hair. Choosing to cut it all off myself made me feel like I was in control. It wasn't easy - I found it harder to say goodbye to my hair than I did my breast (because my breast was TRYING TO KILL ME), but I can honestly say that The Big Shave feels less traumatic now.  Nana: I have a headache EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. It's managed with Tylenol and a disgusting amount of water, but it's always hovering. I'm thinking for me it has to do with sinus issues. The chemo does attack the protective lining of the sinuses, which can aggravate allergies. I'm just guessing though. I hope your headaches improves.  LongIslandl8y: You are my hero. 90 minutes of exercise! Woo hoo! I, alas, can barely make it up the stairs to bed some days. I was so active before chemo, so I really thought I'd be able to at least go for a 30 minute walk every day. But, NO, that tires me out even more. Add that to the need to keep my stomach full at all times in order to manage the nausea, and I think I'm going to have pounds to drop when this is all over. Eeep. :O P.S. They never did find the source of infection. Apparently, they rarely do. Whatever. I'm still on some crazy big-dose antibiotics that make me nauseous and a bit loopy. Good news: while I was in the hospital, my fantastic husband hired a housecleaning service for the remainder of the chemo. Yay me! :)",

I've been trying to lurk and catch up on everyone, but the SEs this round were a little harder to deal with. The NAUSEA was awful. For five full days I was on the verge of vomiting every time I opened my mouth. A slight cough led to a gag, which led to me lying down and being as still as I could be. I HATE vomiting. I am a HUGE Nausea Baby (it comes from spending two ENTIRE pregnancies suffering from severe nausea and vomiting), so we'll be once again tweaking my meds, and hopefully we'll find the right combination next round. Also the fatigue was more severe this time too. I slept and slept and slept and never really felt rested. The GOOD news is that I am exactly one week out from Round 2 and there is no sign of fever or infection! Hooray! That Neulasta shot I gave myself in the stomach is CLEARLY doing it's job. :) Sharon: I, too, have to cancel our annual family summer vacation to visit family. :(  My children are SUPER disappointed. We've rescheduled for late August/early September (we're homeschoolers, so we can get away with this), but \"It's just not the SAME, Mom. Grandma's garden will be all finished by then. Our cousins will all be in SCHOOL.\" *sigh* Cancer really STINKS, you know? On the upside, I am planning a trip to DisneyWorld for the end of September, just to GET AWAY and enjoy some family time outside of the HOUSE. Plus, DW is my Happy Place, so when chemo is finished, it's where I want to go to play. :) MakeLemonade: HOORAY for going home! My children were SO worried about me going into the hospital again this Round (my DD was in a panic), and I kept having to reassure them that the hospital wasn't a Bad Place. It was mostly just BORING. I am SO happy for you! :) LongIsand: I am so sorry you hit the DARK PLACE this round. I was there too. Maybe you saw me weakly waving at you? In the midst of it, I, too, kept thinking \"FOUR more times? Seriously? I CAN'T do FOUR more times.\" But then I came out the other side into the LIGHT, and I realized that it's just FOUR more 10-day periods of feeling CRAPPY. And only five of those days involve nausea and feeling REALLY crappy. I can DO this. I don't WANT to, but I can. WE can do this. We ARE doing this. Even if we hate Every. Single. Minute of it.  merg: Welcome! I would't say the SEs get WORSE; they're just different. For ME, anyway. Everyone is different and everyone reacts to chemo in their own way. And your MO should have a wonderful, magical bag full of DRUGS to treat every SE out there. I love that bag. :) Regarding the chemo tongue - YUP. It's nasty. I feel like I'm wearing a sock on my tongue. Ew. I've been rinsing with Biotene mouthwash, but honestly? Nothing really seemed to help. Kazzy: Feel better. I hope the nausea/dizziness clear up ASAP and the rest of the SEs are minimal.  Timbuktu: I'm not sure what chemo regime you're on, but I had the horrible bone/muscle/body pains last round too. My MO said it was a reaction to the Taxotere and I've been taking a Claritin every morning this round and it is helping a lot. Paired with Tylenol, it's been much more bearable. Also it helped a lot with the Neulasta SEs. Definitely mention it to your MO. You shouldn't have to suffer.  brigadoonbenson: YES! An hour off! Wouldn't that be amazing if we were all allotted some \"SE Free Time\" for each round? HEAVEN, I'm telling you! :) And LADIES, I have to say that you are all ROCKING the short hair/shaved head look! Bald really is beautiful, am I right? I am LOVING my hats and scarves. What I have discovered is that there are many, MANY more people out there that have been where I am than I thought. Not only do I get a lot of compliments on my super cute headcoverings, but I also get a lot of \"I've been there\" comments and looks, and loads of encouraging words from complete strangers who have either battled cancer themselves, or who have a loved one who has.  You know, there are SO MANY of us out there, and this makes me SAD and ANGRY and SHOCKED and so very, very SCARED for future generations. For my daughter and my son and my nieces and nephews. In my family, the \"family history\" starts with ME. What can I do about that? How can I stop it? *sigh* Things to ponder while I'm cooped up in my house waiting for my WBC to rebuild... Next weekend is my Birthday. Also, it marks the beginning of my week of NORMAL. So I'm throwing myself a party. Woo hoo! :) Always, ALWAYS make sure you have something to look forward to!  Hugs and Blessings to you all!",

For me, it's the FATIGUE that is hanging on . I swear I could sleep all day long if it wasn't for, you know, LIFE. And my muscles seem to tire out more quickly too. I walked 2 miles on the treadmill last night, and my muscles were crying by the end. In my \"Before\", I used to RUN 3 miles as a WARM-UP. Now, as Lemonade pointed out, walking up the stairs exhausts me. I feel like an aged version of myself. My husband's 100-year-old Grandmother could probably take me in a race right now. :) Footballnut & EverForward: You Ladies, look AMAZING. You beautiful, beautiful women! Isn't it remarkable how much bigger and striking our eyes look when the hair is gone? :) Regarding periods: I got mine THE DAY AFTER Round 1 (I KNOW, right? Blah). It was much heavier than normal, but it only lasted 7 days, and I haven't see it since. A word of advice, although maybe you all already know this. I was told NOT to use tampons - apparently they are bacteria factories. Which makes me hope EVEN MORE that my period will just stay away until chemo is done. Cuz heavy bleeding + pads only = annoying and gross and all-around pain in the rear.  Sunshine: THANK YOU for the response regarding the eye twitching. I thought I was going crazy! It has almost disappeared now, but Round 3 is this Friday, so I'm guessing I'll be all twitchy again next weekend. I'll take that over the nausea though.  Well, I'm heading into my \"Good Week\", and the weather looks like it's going to be beautiful! I'm TRYING to enjoy it, but pre-chemo anxiety is setting in. I DO NOT want to do this again. Bah. I think I'm going to go watch some guilty pleasure TV (Ghost Whisperer) and knit something silly. Like a fake boob for myself. And then I'll embroider my husband's name on it and call it a tattoo. ;) Have a great night all! ",

I might as well have been taking Tic-Tacs for all the good it did me. The nausea set in late afternoon on the day following chemo and hung in there until Day 5 or 6, let up for about a week, and then settled in again (albeit a milder form). Plus, I really, REALLY don't like the Maxeran - it makes my whole face twitch (add this to the eye twitching caused by the Taxotere and OY!), and makes me feel...funny. I'll ask about the Emend.

I hope those of you who spent today in the Chemo Lounge found it as boring as ever, and that your SEs will also be incredibly dull. :) Thanks for all your lovely compliments on the scarf! It was a gift from a friend who lives in Florida and shares my love for all things Disney. It's so funny though - at the Cancer Centre I see all these beautiful women in their late 50s and early 60s wearing scarves. And they all look so GLAMOROUS and Hollywood CHIC. And so I try it, and all I see when I look in the mirror is a little girl who tries to play dress-up and ends up looking like a pirate! LOL! Speaking of GLAM and CHIC, EverForward - WOW! You look AMAZING in the scarf! :) Oh, and YES to the intense hunger. Every round so far. What gives? I swear I'm going to gain 20lbs even with the nausea. Blah. Brigadoon - I was super worried about what I was going to find under my hair - like a misshapen skull? Or some weird scars? Or a freaky tattoo my Mom didn't tell me about? In the end, it was pretty anticlimactic. There is one teeny tiny chicken pox scar, and that's all. My kids were actually a little disappointed there wasn't anything cool under there. ;) Linda - the wicking nightwear tip is wonderful. THANK YOU! I have been hot and cold every night since this last infusion, and no sleep means more nausea for me. I told my husband about it, and he promptly went online, found a store that sells the stuff, and ordered me to buy some. Spend your money on new clothes? OF COURSE, Darling! :) Dkath70 - For this round (Round 3 of 6), I was given Zofran for Chemo Day and the 4 days afterwards. I also have Stemetil to take as needed. The Zofran is working...MOSTLY. I definitely feel better than last round, but improvements could be made. I HATE the Stemetil. It makes me feel...\"wrong\" - light-headed, woozy, super tired, unfocused. Basically I sleep through the entire day on it. So I stopped taking it, and used Gravol instead, which isn't as effective, but I'd rather be queasy than feel what Stemetil did to me. My only advice with regards to nausea is to keep pestering your MO until he/she gets the meds right. I have 3 more rounds, and next round I'll once again be pushing for something better. The GOOD NEWS is that the nausea (for me) doesn't last weeks and weeks. It's really only about 4 or 5 days that it's bad, and then it fades.  clarrn & footballnut - I've got my pom-poms out and ready for you Ladies tomorrow!  jhodro - Oh my goodness! Number 4! It's awful, but I laughed my head off - it's funny cuz it's true!  Regarding the whole anti-oxidant/vitamin thing, what I'm getting is that for those who were doing it before, carry on as usual. For those of us who could barely remember to take a vitamin once a month, probably during chemo isn't the best time to start. It makes sense to me. I know I'm definitely going to be looking at it more seriously once chemo is over, and I'm taking all your tips and recipes with me. :) About the acne, I know that the steroid can definitely cause it, but so can the Taxotere. My MO was super upset when I had my HUGE breakout (think WORST ACNE EVER) all over my face and neck, and no one told him about it. The onco nurse on call told me it was from the steroid and sent me on my way. My MO said NO, mine was an allergic reaction to the Taxotere. Just something to keep in mind and mention to your MO, just in case.  Anyway, after writing a novel for you all, I'm off to enjoy some more sunshine. I've finally emerged from Round 3's Dark Place (man, it is UGLY in there), and I'm sitting in the Light. Whew. Just 3 more times. And can I just say that I love you Gals? No matter how awful I feel, someone here always has something kind or funny to share, and it makes me feel better. So THANK YOU Chemo Buddies. You all ROCK. :)",

Mompv - Homeschooling is one of the best decisions we ever made. And we sort of fell into by accident. :)  Once we got started though, we never looked back. We learn together as a family, and get so much quality time. And NOW, having to worry about germs and viruses, etc, it is just so much easier than having to send them off to school every day. :) Well, it's Round 5 for me on Friday. Blah. I KNOW it's my second last round. And I KNOW that a week from today I will have crawled out of the Dark Place for the second last time. But I. DON'T. WANNA. I really, really, really, REALLY do NOT want to do this again. The mental temper tantrum is taking over, complete with curse words and kicking and screaming and fist pounding. *SIGH*  I envy all you ladies who are able to exercise so diligently through this. The chemo is doing a number on my leg muscles - every day I wake up feeling like I've run a marathon the day before. I'm so STIFF and SORE and stretching said muscles almost brings me to tears. All I can manage is a walk. Sometimes only every second day. A slow, shuffling walk. Like people with walkers pass me. I miss being strong and fit and being able to walk up the stairs without stopping to catch my breath. Also I miss FITTING INTO MY PANTS.  And that's today's whining. Thanks for tuning in. :) Does anyone else notice the Pity Looks when you go out in public with just a scarf (or sans headgear - though I haven't been so brave yet)? I mean, REALLY, I like a good Pity Party as much as the next chemo patient, but do we need to go there even when it's OBVIOUS I'm having a good day, smiling and shopping and hanging out with the kids or friends or even solo?  Like, HIGH FIVE me or telling me I'm ROCKING THE SCARF, but leave the SAD EYES at home. They're annoying, and they make me want to punch you in the throat.  And NOW, you all have gotten to see my violent side.  I've taken photos of the children delicately holding the butterflies on their fingers and I can't wait to show my MO the JOY he brought into our household by allowing the caterpillars. And I confess they have done wonderful things for me too. No matter how awful I feel, no matter the anxiety or the pain, every time I walk by that butterfly cage I am reminded that the BEAUTY in the world far surpasses the UGLY. :) Have a wonderful day Warriors! Hugs to you all!",

Is there an after-hours number you can call? Here in Calgary, for evening or weekend problems, we're instructed to call Emergency and ask for the MO on call. I would try to reach someone soon - just to make sure there's not a serious reaction happening. And even if it's not something serious, you should NOT have to suffer like this. Swissmiss - I have pain and pressure around my port for a couple of days after infusion. Every time. I was told it's normal. The good news is that I think I've finally gotten used to the darn thing. Other than the post-infusion pain, I hardly even notice it anymore. Which is good, since I'll have it until next Spring. :) Longisland - SO SORRY you're having such a rough weekend. :( I totally know how you feel. I missed out on all the Canada Day festivities this year, and my last infusion is THE DAY BEFORE my 17th wedding anniversary, so I'll be missing out on that too. HOWEVER, I comfort myself with the knowledge that losing this ONE summer should give me AT LEAST 40 more to enjoy with my family. So BRING IT. :) Everforward - Just. Awesome. :) Timbuktu - I love your comment about brushing your teeth being a major accomplishment. :) I read about my FB friends doing all this STUFF everyday, and I'm all like \"Oh yeah? Well, I took a shower and DID NOT take a nap afterwards. So there. \" :D In other news, the hair on MY LEGS is growing back. I'm not sure if I should celebrate this or not. ;)",

And it's funny, because while you're in the midst of chemo treatments, time moves along so SLOWLY, and you feel like it will NEVER end. And now, as I'm reaching the finish line, I look back and think: \"WOW. I can't believe I'm already here.\" And also: \"WOW. I did that. I survived it. I am SO much stronger than I thought.\" I'm high-fiving myself a lot lately. :) Holly - That saying with the crown and the boss was originally shared on my FB page by a friend of mine who recently battled skin cancer and won.

It about sums everything up, doesn't it? :D MommyQ - The PS wait time is because it takes that long to get in to see him. Unless you're a priority, which I am not. And I understand this - \"Disfigured Face After an Accident\" should come ahead of \"Needs a Fake Boob\". But my referral SHOULD have gone in right after my surgery in February, and since it didn't, I've lost 6 months in the queue. Truth be told, I'm not sure I WANT reconstruction - I'm not terribly keen on more surgery - but I feel I can't make any kind of decision until I've explored all my options. And after living with just one boob for 6 months, I can see the convenience of having an implant. At least I wouldn't lean to the left so much. :D Regarding the muscle fatigue: I have been told that a Vitamin D deficiency can contribute to muscle and joint pain. My MO ordered me to start taking Vitamin D supplements, as well as Calcium/Magnesium. It's only been a week, so I can't say it's making a huge difference YET, but I am hopeful. I also have a friend who is currently studying Naturopathy, so I'm going to quiz her as well. There has to be SOMETHING we can take that will help these muscles heal. I counted backwards and I've been dealing with constant muscle pain since Round 3. That's about 13 weeks of PAIN, and quite frankly, I've had enough. I was at the store the other day, needing to look at something on a bottom shelf, and I had to SIT ON THE DIRTY STORE FLOOR because my muscles couldn't hold me in a squatting position. *sigh*. And MommyQ - I have my very own Butt Groove on my couch too. :D Found this the other day and thought it would make a lovely t-shirt. Or a wall hanging. Or perhaps a billboard?  Have a great day Ladies! ",

How awesome to be a Chemo Grad! :) :) :) Ddkath - Regarding weight loss: I found I started losing weight when I STOPPED exercising so much. True story. I found that the more I pushed myself, the more my legs would swell, and the less weight I would lose. SO, I decided to take days off - I walk for a couple of days (some days 10 minutes, some days 40 minutes - whatever I feel up to), then rest for a day. I elevate my feet whenever I'm sitting or laying down, and I drink disgusting amounts of water. I also limit my sodium intake. But the thing that had the most impact was slowing down my work-outs. Who knew, right? Sandra - I think we all worry that the chemo has failed, that we have completely wasted our time with all the CRAP that we put ourselves through. That little voice in our heads that whispers \"what if?\" is nasty, and has the potential to cause so much damage to the life we've been fighting for. I tell it to SHUT UP and BACK OFF and LEAVE ME ALONE every morning, before it even speaks. Because I know that if I let it get a foothold, I'll never be free of the fear. Ever.  Here's the thing. Not one of us here expected to hear the words \"You have cancer.\" And now that we have, and we KNOW that it CAN happen to us, we are naturally going to worry that it WILL. Which is perfectly rational. Now, I can't speak for anyone else, but for me? Chemo was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. And the way I see it, I did NOT put myself through 4 months of HELL just so I can live the rest of my life in fear. So I TRY, every day, to NOT worry, to have Faith in God, my doctors, the treatment. Which is, of course, easier said than done. But I'm getting there. Just like all the other lingering side effects, the fear fades a little bit more each day. So HANG IN THERE. And, as always, we have your back. :) Oh, and P.S. I am SO OVER being bald. And it is so NOT FAIR that my lashes and brows continue to fall out 6 weeks PFC. I have exactly EIGHT lower lashes left - 3 on one eye and 5 on the other. Yes, I counted. Even worse are my upper lashes - each eye has only HALF remaining. As in, only ONE SIDE of each eyelid has lashes. I look ridiculous. And also hilarious.  :D",

I can't count the number of times I've had the \"No, YOU shut-up!\" conversation with myself. Too funny. :D VeraAnn - I think I'm in the minority here. I had a unilateral mastectomy on the right side. I had 3.5cm of DCIS and only 0.6mm of IDC (that was HER2+, but that's a whole 'nother story). I was given the choice of lumpectomy versus mastectomy, but NOT a choice of single or double - my BS was in a hurry to get the cancer OUT, and I agreed. I had my surgery just two weeks after diagnosis. Looking back, if I had been given the choice of both (and some time to think about it), I probably would have opted for the double mastectomy. I now spend an awful lot of time looking at my remaining breast, and wondering if there's cancer hiding in there. My 4cm cancerous lump, that you could physically SEE, did NOT show up on the mammogram. So now I worry....Also, since I haven't had any reconstruction, I lean to the left a little. ;) Well, Friends, I am 9 1/2 weeks PFC and I FINALLY feel like I've reached a turning point. This is SUCH a long healing process, yes? Whew. The Glutamine supplements have helped TREMENDOUSLY - I can now walk long distances and climb stairs and even SIT CROSS-LEGGED on the floor with my kids! My muscles still stiffen up more quickly, and a squatting position isn't quite there yet, but MAN, oh MAN, I feel better than I have in a LONG time. :) My eyelashes are coming back. Hallelujah! The bottom ones ALL fell out, and I had about 2 dozen TOTAL left on top, and I totally looked like a chemo patient at 6 weeks post-chemo. And this was NOT FAIR. But then, this past week, I noticed teeny tiny baby lashes growing in! There was some happy dancing going on, I'm telling you! My eyebrows are nearing normal status too - I actually had to pluck a little yesterday. Hooray for the little things! :) As for the hair on my head? *sigh* It is a shadow of it's former self. I used to have THICK, curly, BROWN hair. And now I have baby soft, thin, straight, hair that is more grey than brown. I'd say it's about a 1/4inch long already, but you can't really tell because it's SO THIN. Even so? I've been going out topless. Oh YES, I HAVE. And, curiously, it's the WOMEN who stare and make rude-eyes at me, as though they can not believe I would be seen in public that way. The men? Smile and nod. The children? Don't even notice. But the WOMEN, who should be lifting me up and celebrating a VICTORY? They pretty much SUCK. So, I made a Note To Myself: When you see a bald woman who is brave enough to publicly go topless, give her a high five, and tell her she's GORGEOUS. Speaking of GORGEOUS WOMEN, *High Fives* to ALL of you! :)",

I am LOVING this - sitting on the deck, under a sunshade of course, enjoying the WARM. I totally feel like a WINNER, because Cancer did NOT steal my Summer JOY. :) lena-lou - my \"babies\" are ages 8 and 11. They'll always be babies in my heart. :) Wendy - Welcome to this amazing group of Ladies. :) footballnut - My tummy troubles with Taxotere ALWAYS follow the same pattern - The Big C for the first 5 days, followed by The Big D for Days 6 - 8. It doesn't really matter if I consume copious amounts of fibre and drink Senekot tea or do nothing, it's ALWAYS the same. By Day 9, everything is back to normal. After the first couple of rounds, I started taking Imodium (with my MO's approval) at the the first sign of The Big D. I give it a couple of hours and if there's no sign of it leaving me alone, I take the pills. It is SO HARD to be a pill popper when you never even took extra-strength Tylenol before. But you gotta do what you gotta do to be comfortable, right? Taxotere is NASTY stuff. Oh, and also I found that dairy irritates things a little - so I limit myself for that first week.  As for the bone/muscle pain, yup - I often have to remind myself that Taxotere is HELPING ME. My first round the pain was so severe I wept and wept and wept. I was told I could alternate Tylenol and Advil as long as I didn't have a fever. Epsom salts baths helped too - just drink LOTS of water. The thing that made the biggest dent in the pain, though, is the daily Claritan. Again, BEFORE I never took anti-histamines unless I was DESPERATE, and now? I'm popping those pills EVERY SINGLE DAY. MommyQ - THANK YOU for the suggestion of the Zoku! Such a great idea! :) My furry mouth is still hanging in there. Blech. It not only makes everything taste terrible, it also HURTS to chew and swallow. Bread and fruit are especially nasty, so I'm drinking Veggie Juice, which I never liked the the taste of before. But now I kinda crave it. Who would've thought? Isn't it funny how everything is now categorized into BEFORE and NOW? When people get excited about my last chemo in a couple of weeks, they say things like \"Oh, and then things can get back to NORMAL for you!\" Ummm, I'm not sure I know what \"normal\" means. There's a New Normal now, and I have no idea what it's going to look like. But still I say BRING IT. :) Hang in there Ladies! For those of you in the midst of The Dark Place, we've got your back, and The Light is coming.  Hugs to all! :)",

My MO told me to take a Claritin the day of chemo and about 5 - 7 days following (and to continue for more days if I need - which I usually do), and it completely cleared up the headaches and the nosebleeds.

Way to power through it all when faced with side effects that would have caused many women to quit after round 1. You're seriously a super-star in my books! :) Tomorrow morning at 8:45am, I will hit the chemo chair for the LAST TIME (after that it will only be the Herceptin Chair, and I'm cool with that). And I'm EXCITED. Practically GIDDY. Bring it ON. Because no matter what the SEs bring me this time, there will be no next time. I WIN. Woot! Woot!

EverForward - I am now 5 1/2 weeks PFC and the muscles are still sore. But they're slightly better than they were last week, so I count that as progress. My friend, the Naturopath, suggested Glutamine - 1mg 4 times a day. It's an amino acid responsible for tissue repair. I'm off to find some today. I figure it's worth a try - anything to help with the constant pain and weakness in my legs.  jhodro - WAIT! You have 1/4 inch of HAIR??!! I am so super jealous over here! I have baby fuzz. Soft, WHITE baby fuzz. Which FEELS cool when you touch it, but doesn't LOOK like anything but a bald head. Still, I've (mostly) quit covering up too. Too hot, too much work, and I just don't care anymore. *High Fives* on the hair regrowth! Sandra - I've been noticing my vision is kind of wonky too. I'm told it will go back to normal in time. Once again, it's the whole PATIENCE thing for me. I just want to be normal NOW. Jaimieh - HOORAY on one left! I'm waving my pompoms and cheering you on! Regarding nails: mine were discolouring too. And then they stopped - so now the TOP of all my nails are browny-yellow, but the new growth at the bottom is completely normal. Hopefully, yours will follow the same path mine did.  Taste buds - at almost 6 weeks PFC, my taste buds are STILL acting up. Pretty much everything still TASTES right, but my taste buds swell and get sore and then eating can hurt just a little. I will say that the \"flare-ups\" are becoming less and less frequent, which is positive, but every once in a while I have to live on mush for a day. Also I'm finding that my digestive system STILL doesn't get along with certain foods, like spinach (which I LOVE). Everyday is an experiment in the kitchen. :) Who knew it would take SO LONG to heal, right? In other (GOOD) news - I have managed to drop 8 of the 17 pounds I gained during chemo. It's amazing how much water the body can hang on to! Just a few more to go and MAYBE I'll be able to fit into my pant before winter.  Take care Ladies!",

And even WE think we should be, and then we try to do a whole bunch of stuff we're not ready for, and THEN? Then we sleep for a week to recuperate. I plead guilty to overdoing it every day. After a few days, I wake up to feeling like I did today: EXHAUSTED. I seriously contemplated staying in bed all day. I feel like we constantly have to remind ourselves to take it easy - which is like a foreign concept to most of us, right? If we curl up on the couch with a book, or take a 2-hour nap, or indulge in an afternoon movie, the GUILT starts to seep in, and that little voice in our head whispers \"Lazy...\". It's like we have to completely re-program the way we think about things. Taking care of ourselves IS okay, and NECESSARY.  In other news, tomorrow I'm going Foob shopping! I haven't decided on reconstruction yet, so this is an external prosthetic I'm looking at, and I am SUPER excited.

It's actually pretty fun to try something completely and totally new. I can't wait to see pictures! HollyHope: No oncotype test for me. Here in Alberta, Canada, it's not covered by health care or insurance, so I think I'd have to pay out of pocket. Chemo, for me, was a must because my IDC was HER2+. My MO was sad about having to recommend it, but happy that he could confidently say CURE. Longislandl8y: YES to going toxin-free. My daughter has terrible eczema, so we started using organic skin care products a few months ago. Once I started looking into what we were using before I was SHOCKED at how many ingredients are skin irritants and \"potential carcinogens\".

The oncologist told me NOT to drive myself to and from because (and I quote) \"you will be so full of drugs that driving wouldn't be safe\". But honestly, I felt FINE at the end of the day. I found that it was during the \"After\" that I really needed someone around to help me out, and that's really only because I have two children at home, and all I felt like doing was sleeping.  Sharon: The chemo beanie is beautiful!

Good thing I caught that before I sent it. HA! Oh, and FYI, the auto-correct fail of \"amazingly\" is \"camacho fly\". True story. :D Regarding veggies: I second what MakeLemonade said. Be careful on your low WBC days. During that time, I eat only fruits and veggies that can be cooked or peeled. Which is annoying, but at least I know I'm safe from infection that way. I sure do miss a green leafy salad though. Although, I keep reminding myself that this is NOT the time to worry too much about diet or weight gain. Obviously I'm not going to run out and order myself some KFC (because EW, that would definitely make me puke), but if I have to avoid fruits and veggies during my queasy days and live on crackers and pasta, then so be it. Do what you need to do to GET THROUGH IT. Aw Sunshine, the MOMMY GUILT is overwhelming, isn't it? I can't even think of anything wise or uplifting to say, except that I'm right there with you. Hugs to all the wonderful mommies out there who are fighting and missing time now so we can give so much more of it later. And as for seeing yourself bald, I PROMISE, you do get used to it. The first couple of weeks after The Big Shave, I kept jumping whenever I passed by a mirror. I kept thinking I was seeing a stranger in the house. Now, it's no big deal. Just what I look like. Pretty darn cute bald woman coming through. ;) MakeLemonade: Regarding hair loss? Mine started falling out on a Thursday evening, I woke up the next morning with bald patches (EEEEK!), shaved it that afternoon, and by Monday a good portion of the stubble was gone too. It didn't take very long. Sorry. :( MommyQ: Welcome. I find that I have a temperature that hovers between 99 and 99.5 starting about Day 5 through Day 10 post infusion, especially in the evenings or if I've done a little too much during the day. It completely freaks my husband out (I ended up in the hospital with a fever after Round 1), so I get relegated to Couch Potato Status during those days. Also, I've found that my vision is a little off, particularly in the left eye. I'm told these are normal things, but ask your MO about ANYTHING that concerns you.  brigadoon: I have chemo on Friday, and my nausea usually starts to settle in Saturday evening. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday it's full-blown and I feel like I could vomit every time I open my mouth. Wednesday it lifts. We are going to tweak my nausea meds AGAIN for the next round. Here's hoping the third combination is the winner. chknfeet: Well, SHOOT. I hope they find the source of infection and send you home soon. Hospital stays in isolation are boring and crumby and absolutely no fun at all. :(  Welcome Spunky! Hey, footballnut, thanks so much of the lovely picture of Spring you posted! I thought I'd share my own picture of our weather here in Calgary on the morning of Saturday, May 3.   In conclusion, it makes me very, VERY happy to hear that Spring has come to other parts of the world.

Weather here can turn on you in a second, I'm telling you! And for the record, I can remember times we've had snow for EVERY MONTH OF THE YEAR. Yes, that includes July and August. The good news is that it doesn't last very long (most of ours from this last blast has already melted). The bad news is that it can show up AT ANY TIME. :O Know what I get to do today? I'm practically GIDDY about this. I get to LEAVE THE HOUSE. For something OTHER than a medical appointment! Woo hoo! It's just a trip to take my daughter to her violin lesson, but STILL. It's LEAVING THE HOUSE! I know you all understand. ;) MommyQ: I've been laying around a lot too. Which led to a bit of dehydration for me as well - it's easy to forget to drink when you're nauseated. And also when you're doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Yesterday I drank so much I was practically floating. But it helped - I feel better today. And now that my mother-in-law has left (God Bless her! I KNOW she was doing what she thought was best for me!), tonight I'm hopping back on the treadmill. What she doesn't know won't hurt her, right? And I MISS exercise.  Have a wonderful day Ladies!

It's intimidating, isn't it, to read about those women who train for marathons during chemo? And re-reading my comments, I think I've left the wrong impression. Let me explain. When I said \"exercise\" BEFORE cancer/chemo, I meant hard core, working out until I was covered in sweat and barely breathing and all-out exhausted and muscles aching the next day because I was a work-out MANIAC. NOW, when I say \"exercise\" I mean a Workout For People in Their 90s. Oh, I TRIED to do it all like I did BEFORE. But my heart rate went WAY up, I was short of breath, I got super dizzy, and my muscles were screaming at me to STOP, OH PLEASE STOP! And then I realized that my body simply isn't capable of healing from chemo AND, say, training for a marathon. In conclusion, you do what you can. And if all you can do is a 10 minute stroll around the block, where you wave at the snails as they pass you by, the so be it. :) Good luck today Nana, and all those heading to the next round! Our thoughts are with you. *hugs* I have ONE more week of good, and then next Friday is Round 3, and I DON'T WANNA. I have perfected the mental temper tantrum, complete with kicking, pounding fists, screaming, and even throwing and smashing stuff. It's pretty amazing inside my head, actually.  ",

When I was first diagnosed, I was told I had the \"good kind\" of breast cancer, and would likely only need a lumpectomy. Here I am a few weeks later getting ready to begin Chemo treatments in a couple of days. Hang in there Friend! LngDstncNuWife2012, my port is feeling a lot better this morning. The worst day was the day of surgery, which for me was Monday. When I got home I was in quite a lot of pain, and I could barely move my neck. The next morning (Tuesday), it was my CHEST that hurt. My husband took the day off work to make sure I followed the nurses orders and RESTED. And I did - I sat around all day doing absolutely nothing except play on the ipad, read, and snuggle my dog (who somehow thinks she can \"fix\" me by laying her head beside the surgical site - awwww). And it worked (the resting, not the dog \"helping\", although one never really knows...); the morning after that (Wednesday - today), I feel a lot better. Still some pain in my neck and shoulder, but nothing some Tylenol won't cure. And I'm still taking it easy. The WORST part is trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in. Sitting upright is the best option for not pulling on stitches, but my back gets sore and my butt falls asleep. And then my husband starts to snore and I'm all like \"HOW can you SLEEP when I'M so UNCOMFORTABLE.\" Share the pain, right? :D You will be happy you cut your hair. My doctor said no showers for a few days after the port insertion, so it's bath in a couple of inches of water, and wash my hair in the sink, which is totally EASY now that I only have an inch left all around. Awesome. :)  Oh, and I'm not going to lie - the port is very visible under my skin. I'm rather thin up top, and it's this round LUMP sticking up. And you can see a tube as well. It's totally and utterly gross - I feel like some sort of freaky lab experiment. I'm SURE I'll get used to it, but for now, it's pretty EW. And I can't stop looking at it. HA! :D Hugs to all!  Nita",

BUT how AWESOME are the free head-coverings! ? :) mmtagirl & Sunshine: My scalp started tingling around Day 5, but I didn't start losing any hair until about 2 weeks post infusion. More on that in  a bit. linda: Your MO sounds fantastic! It is so nice to hear about medical professionals who encourage second opinions. :) mlpoarch: Welcome to the club no one wants to join. SO SORRY to hear about your husband. I confess I am ultra paranoid about mine - he was scaling ladders the other day and I was all \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT IF YOU FALL AND BREAK YOUR LEG OR YOUR ARM OR YOUR NECK. GET DOWN FROM THERE RIGHT NOW!\" I was being a TAD unreasonable, I know. :) I hope you have other friends and family that will step in and help out.  applepop: I hope your side effects are well-managed, and you're feeling good. You've started, so you're THAT MUCH CLOSER to being done!   HollyHope: I can address your hair loss question. I'm doing Taxotere and Carboplatin. My scalp started tingling at about Day 5, but it wasn't until yesterday (Day 13) that it started to hurt, and by evening my hair had started falling out in handfuls. And then.... I woke up this morning, exactly two weeks post-infusion, with BALD PATCHES. EEEEEK! So I handed my husband and kids the razor and said have at it. I now look like this:  I totally rock the bald look, I think. :) It was not at all traumatic. It wasn't scary. I didn't cry. In fact, I smiled through the whole thing. It was completely and totally LIBERATING. My scalp doesn't hurt anymore and showers are much, MUCH shorter. The worst thing I can say about it is that it's COLDER than before. But that's what scarves and hats are for, right? And summer is coming (I HOPE. GEEZ.), so I'm all set. My eyebrows are still intact, as are my eyelashes. And there's still copious amounts of hair on my LEGS (TMI?); I can hardly wait for the chemo to take care of THAT for me. :) Oh, and P.S. No weird scars or tattoos or ANYTHING interesting under my hair at all. :D",

After Round 2, my MIL was staying with us (and she was a HUGE help!), and she INSISTED that I sit around all day and \"rest\", because back in her nursing days, that's what Chemo Patients did. I TRIED to reason with her, but she remained firm and stern, and ushered me off to bed. Now that she's gone, I've jumped back into working out, and I have no plans to tell her anything about it.  Tonight I did 20 minutes of Turbo Jam (the old school stuff, not the new crazy \"Fire\"), and I feel FABULOUS. I was KICKING and PUNCHING and MAN, you just feel like a TOUGH GIRL when you do that stuff. Awesome. Clarrn: Sending some big hugs and prayers your way for tomorrow. Keep your eyes on the May long weekend. That's your prize, your LIGHT. I wish I could offer more, but I generally lean towards mental temper tantrums rather than jitters.

My husband, on the other hand, has no qualms about telling people NO and TOO BAD and GET LOST. :D  So, mostly I just let him deal with people who, while they MEAN WELL, just DON'T THINK.  Nana: My MO prescribed Claritin for my headaches and it seems to be working. I take one every morning. I missed ONE day and ended up with a HUGE headache by the afternoon. I did NOT repeat that mistake. It seems to be helping with the nosebleeds too. Only two this time, and they were the day I skipped the Claritin. It's worth asking your MO about. I was never one for taking daily pills for ANYTHING prior to this, but really, I'm pumping my body full of poison every three weeks. What's a daily does of Claritin in light of THAT?   footballnut: You know what I did? I ordered some guilty pleasure TV shows on DVD so I could watch them on the treadmill when the weather gets bad. Obviously, I prefer outdoor walking, but when I can't, at least I have some fluffy television to look forward to, right? :D QUESTION: Does anyone else on THC have eye twitching? Mine are all twitch! twitch! twitch! and it's driving me crazy. Just wondering if this is a normal side effect or something I should be worrying about. ",

Also my upper lashes and my eyebrows. :(  I have never worn make-up, but I think I may start with a little eyebrow pencil and some liner, just so my eyes don't disappear entirely! That's a look I'm pretty sure I can't pull off. Ever. For what it's worth, Ladies, regarding the whole antioxidant thing, my oncologist firmly told me NOT to go there. He said it can interfere with the chemo treatments, as can adding a bunch of vitamins. He said to eat WELL, and eat HEALTHY, but eat NORMALLY.  Anyway, I'm not putting on my Smarty Pants or anything, just sharing. Take it or leave it. :) We have a long weekend here in Calgary, and it's relatively sunny, so I took a 2km walk with the family, and now I am heading to the back deck to enjoy the sunshine on my face...through layers and layers of sunscreen and big floppy hat. :)  Have a wonderful weekend!",

Swissmiss - I, too, have issues with blood work. The lab techs here are NOT certified to access the port, so all they have to use is my left arm. After bruise upon bruise, and then an idiot tech taking blood from a bruised vein and causing a whole heap of trouble, I was told by one very experienced lab tech to ALWAYS \"order\" a butterfly needle, and if the tech refuses, then ask for a different tech. Apparently the butterflies are more expensive (by mere cents), so some will be stingy with them, but I've found I get my way on this with little to no arguing. :) Oh, and as to constipation, Senekot tea is helpful. Also bran crackers and muffins, Activia yogurt, and scads of water and gatorade. I find I deal with C the first few days following chemo, and then D for a few days after that. Although, this time around, those two side effects have been pretty mild. *crosses her fingers* clarrn - *Love* the story about the speeding. :) I'm always telling my husband to \"play the chemo card\", especially while shopping for a vehicle. \"It might even help if you take the kids and they cry a little,\" I said.

The Highlander was nice too, but is really more of a 4-seater, given that the back row is virtually unusable unless you're a hobbit, and the middle seat in the second row is really more of an armrest. Clarrn - what are your thoughts on the Nissan Murano? Today I woke up with the \"burnt tongue\" as well as burning ALL the way down my throat. Ugh.

Your little Batmobile has some serious AWESOME going on.  mompv - I give myself the Neulasta shot every round, and it turns out it's not a big deal. My oncology nurse gave me visual and written instructions, and then my mother-in-law (who is a retired nurse) talked me through the first one. Honestly? My husband has a harder time with me doing it than I do. Even sitting down and NOT WATCHING, he gets light-headed. Which is pretty hilarious. :D So, yes, I say save yourself the time and the money. And regarding fluids - have you tried freezing fruit juices in cubes and then blending them into ice chips to suck on? I also spend quite a few days each round just sucking on regular ice chips, but the juice chips make a nice change. :) Aw Ladies, we have lost so much, haven't we? I try to stay out of That Place as much as possible, but sometimes it just creeps up on you, right? Here are two ways I pull myself out of the I've Lost So Much Zone: 1). Find the humour in every situation. There is always a Ridiculous that will make you smile. And if you're laughing, the Bad doesn't seem quite so bad. 2). There are WORSE things in this world than what is happening to me. This doesn't lessen what is happening to me; it just puts it into perspective, like \"Whew! At least I'm not THAT GUY\". Examples? One of my children could be going through this instead of me. Or one of the many Monsters in this world could have targeted one of my babies and hurt them in UNSPEAKABLE ways. Oh yeah, I'll take breast cancer over THOSE options ANY DAY.  The thing is, what has happened to me, to US, really, really sucks. It DOES. And we NEED to mourn everything we've lost. But this morning I woke up and I thought \"WOW. I am not the same person I was BEFORE.\" You see, Before, I had reached a plateau in my life. I wasn't UNHAPPY, but I wasn't HAPPY either. I was restless. And I remember getting down on my knees and asking God to \"snap me out of it.\" And He DID. In a big way. And now, I feel Better than Before. I feel I am now somehow MORE. Refined through the Fire. A better person, no longer restless, LIGHTER, and HAPPY. As someone else commented a few pages back \"the good days seem SO GOOD\". I take nothing for granted. I smile more, laugh more, hug my family more, tell them I LOVE THEM several times a day. Life is fleeting, and I want to enjoy every single second I have left (which is going to make for a very busy next-40-years!)  Do I wish it had happened in a different way? OF COURSE. I see Round 5 looming (just one week away) and I want to CRY. And, yeah, I am SO AFRAID that cancer will come sneaking back into my life just when I think I've beaten it. But that fear, while normal and completely fair, will NOT rule my life. Because then Cancer gets the power. And NOPE, not gonna happen. I have done everything I can to be cancer-free, and the rest I have to leave up to God. Faith plays a big role here, and mine will not be shaken. This is MY CHOICE. And it means, I WIN. :) Something Ridiculous to take with you: I had a right-side mastectomy back in February, and I still haven't been fitted for a foob. So a wonderful friend of mine KNITTED ME ONE. I opened up the gift bag, pulled out this ball of knitting and THEN? I realized what it was, and we had a huge LAUGH. Seriously, it's AWESOME, and super comfortable, and I giggle every time I wear it. I'll have to post a picture of it. BEST. GIFT. EVER. :D Hugs to you all!",

SO, when I last left you all, I was celebrating my grown-up potty chair, which actually turned out to be kind of a let-down. I mean, it SOUNDS cool, but really, it was just kind of gross. And that's all I have to say about that (I watched Forrest Gump on my private TV last night). Saturday night, I had the WORST headache. I told my nurse (who is SO nice, but she just doesn't LISTEN) that I thought I was dehydrated, and if I could request a saline drip. She laughed and said that NO, my blood pressure was fine, so I was not dehydrated. She offered me a codeine for the pain instead. Now, I KNOW better. I KNOW what codeine does to me, and it is NOT pretty. But the nurse said that she would give it with an anti-nausea drug so I would be fine. My headache was so bad that I caved. Three hours later the vomiting began. By the wee hours of the next morning, I was so dehydrated that I woke up with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. My headache was beyond bearable, I was nauseated, light-headed, and I wasn't really thinking clearly. THIS was my rock bottom. At that point I was seriously considering ending the chemo treatments and taking my chances with the cancer. THAT is how badly I was feeling.  FORTUNATELY, my nurse that morning was someone new, and she not only listened to me when I explained what I KNEW was happening with my body, but she HEARD me. She nodded and said \"Let me see what I can do.\" Less than half an hour later, she had paged the doctor, gotten an order for a saline drip, and was hooking me up. It took FIVE hours of IV fluids before I felt normal again. That's where I was all day yesterday. This morning a medical oncologist who works with MY medical oncologist stopped in and assured me that steps would be taken to ensure this doesn't happen again. He lectured me about not eating enough (I pointed out that hospital food is YUCKY), and asked me whether I felt well enough to go home. OF COURSE I said YES. My blood counts are all back to normal, and I feel better than I have all week, other than feeling really tired. I was given a prescription for two different types of antibiotics, and instructions to take it easy for a few days. I am SO happy to be home. So, so, SO happy. Also it's nice to be able to hug my family, and to see them without medical masks on. AND it is most wonderful to once again use a REAL toilet. ;) swissmiss and mikishelley: how are you both feeling now? Those side effects are so much nastier than expected, right? But apparently they have meds to help with EVERYTHING, so ask! ask! ask! your doctor.  Sunshine36: I, too, was really fatigued, and I pushed myself to walk, do housework, etc. Everyone is different, but it just made me MORE tired. I had a talk with one of the experienced nurses during my hospital stay, and she told me to TAKE IT EASY for those first 10 days following chemo. Do NOT overdo, she said. Give your body a chance to recover, and THEN get back to life after that. So when you feel fatigued, take a break. Just some thoughts. I hope you're already feeling better and you can completely disregard everything I've said. :) ChrissyLB: Awesome picture. Thanks for sharing - you're adorable! :) Keep us posted on how everything goes.  Footballnut: YOU are going to be fine. We are ALL strong simply because we're showing up. For me, I try to find the ridiculous in scary/unpleasant situations, because the alternative is sinking into despair. And I can not go there - it's too hard to pull myself back out. One day at a time.  P.S. All you ladies who work through chemo are AMAZING. Seriously. Just, WOW. A big round of applause for you all. ",

Don't you just love how the pixie cut takes weight off your head and years off your face and offers up some SASS to go with it? ;) lillyrose: I am so happy to hear you're feeling better. :) mompv: Linda gives great advice. One of the first and best words of wisdom someone gave me after I was diagnosed was \"Stay OFF the internet.\" There is just so much outdated and misinformation out there. Dr. Google isn't a very good doctor, I'm afraid, and he just causes more anxiety. blueberry: I can not wait to see your new cut! Sending courage for you tomorrow - I know how hard the initial cut can be. You'll look gorgeous- I know it! linda: LOVE the story about the girl who cut your hair. Thanks so much for sharing - it makes me feel better somehow to hear about wonderful things like that. :) shellbell: I am so sorry you have to be here. But this group of ladies is amazing, and we are all here for you. We've all been there with the crying and raging and wailing and gnashing of teeth. Chemo is scary. I was super nervous, and it turned out my first chemo treatment was super-duper boring. And that's all. Just boring. I'm told that severe allergic reactions are rare, but the oncology nurses are very, VERY prepared for anything that might happen. And they'll go slowly and monitor ANY reactions at all. Bring a funny book or trashy magazine along. Or buy yourself an ipad with your husband's credit card (Take THAT honey! HA!), and load it up with ridiculous games to keep you occupied. For me that was the hardest part of Chemo Day - finding things to keep me amused while I just SAT there for hours. I'll be thinking of you tomorrow and sending prayers your way.  Oh, and P.S. Make sure you all have a sleep hat for when your hair falls out. It gets COLD at night. I don't know how bald boys do this in Winter...  ",

I got to take my daughter to violin and to run errands, and buy STUFF. Gosh it was nice to go out to something other than a medical appointment! So what I'm saying is that THERE IS SOME LIGHT within the darkness. Now I know that regardless of nasty side effects or hospital stays, there are GOOD DAYS to come. This makes me HAPPY and much more confident about getting through this. :) Now, first, I HAVE to say that HOLLY, you gorgeous, GORGEOUS woman! Your cheekbones, those EYES, and that SMILE - Girl, you are STUNNING! When I shaved my head, a friend said to me: \"If you were on America's Top Model, they would have done that to you on purpose!\" And I am passing that compliment on to you. You look AMAZING! :) Nana, I, too, had the body aches and pains. My MO said it was from the Taxotere and that I could alternate Tylenol and Advil, as long as I monitor my temperature. It did help, and the pain only lasted a couple of days. And as for nosebleeds? Yup - had those for the first time ever too.  Welcome to the new posters (and all those lurking, as I did for a few weeks!). We wish you didn't have to be here, but we're glad you found us.  mikishelly: I am SO SORRY to hear about your job. That is NOT FAIR. Is it even legal? :S  And P.S. On a completely unrelated note, I, too, had PAIN in the scalp when the hair started to shed - the shave helped immensely. Dare I ask you to share a photo of your cute little bald head? Cuz I KNOW it's cute. ;) I had my appointment with my oncology team yesterday, and we've tweaked my meds and added a couple of things to combat all those nasty side effects I was experiencing. Apparently, the on-call oncology nurses I spoke to were IN THE WRONG, and should have paged my oncologist as soon as they heard about the acne-like rash - this was a sign of a Taxotere reaction. Add that to the shortness of breath and the \"electrical zapping\" pain, and my MO was super annoyed. He got THAT LOOK on his face - you know, the one that says SOMEONE is going to be in TROUBLE. Anyway, he's added some anti-histamines, AND a shot of Neulasta to prevent any further hospital visits. So, I am hopeful that Round 2 will be easier than Round 1. Speaking of Round 2, it started this morning around 9:15am. No troubles AT ALL. Everything went smoothly, and the worst I can say is that I am tired. I will confess that at about 6am, I woke up to a temper tantrum in my head, complete with kicking, pounding fists and screams of \"I don't WANNA!\" But then logic set in, I steeled myself, put on my new headscarf that a friend sent me from Florida (it has hidden Mickeys on it - so fun!), and headed out with fists raised. Take THAT cancer! Something I ponder: Is it weird that I like the feeling of normalcy I have at the cancer centre? I mean, no one looks twice at my bald head or my thinning eyebrows, and the looks of pity are absent - I sort of feel like I fit in. I mean, I can't yet say that I LOOK FORWARD to being there, but it IS nice to be in a place where we're all in the same boat, right? I kind of expect the theme song from Cheers to play when I walk in. :D",

On the upside, I still have my eyebrows and eyelashes (even though they have thinned a little), I don't have to shave my legs OR my armpits, and I've been getting LOADS of hat compliments. :) mmtagirl: Your awkward moments list CRACKED ME UP. And also, totally accurate. I feel like an aged version of myself. And my MEMORY, GEEZ. The other day I walked into the DEN to get SOMETHING, forgot what it was I needed, walked back out, and then realized that what I needed was in the LAUNDRY ROOM, not the den. DOH! jhodro: Your Hair-Free Benefits are AWESOME. :D I *love* #1 - freaking out staring strangers. My husband suggested that I scare misbehaving children by whipping off my hat and asking if they've ever read Roald Dahl's book The Witches. ;) Ddkath70 & babygoose: Welcome. So sorry we didn't get to meet at a coffee shop or on a beach in Hawaii, but you'll find lots and lots of support and advice from the lovely folks on these boards. Ddkath70: I hear you about the nausea. I am VERY prone to it as well - on boats, on planes, in the car, during pregnancy (I puked through two entire pregnancies - from start to finish - and that's the story of why I only have two children), when I eat certain foods, and sometimes just because my body decides it's going to be nauseous. It was the only thing about chemo that made me cry - I burst into tears in my MO's office during the consult when he was going over side effects. He was very reassuring; they have lots and lots of meds and different combinations of meds they can try, he said. I've done 2 rounds of THC, and we still haven't found exactly the right stuff - there's no vomiting, but I'm more nauseated than I'd like. I have my day-before-chemo appointment on Thursday and I'm telling him to pull out the BIG STUFF now. The thing to remember is that everyone responds to chemo differently, so once your team knows how you're going to react, they can tailor your meds accordingly. And you might be one of the lucky ladies that doesn't have any nausea. It does happen (and I would SO envy you). MommyQ: Those BLOODY snails! They're MOCKING me. I bet they're the same ones that challenged me to a race and then LAUGHED at me when I had to decline. I'll show them when Chemo is over. Can you say escargot? ;) Blueberry4: YES! Buffs! Although I had no idea what they were called. My Mother-In-Law bought me one, and it turns out it is my FAVORITE thing to wear. It's light, it doesn't slip off or sideways, it's super comfortable, and it's totally cute. :) Footballnut: I love the Goth idea. *grins* I was thinking about getting a spiky pink-haired wig, sticking on some temporary tattoos, and adding a couple of fake piercings in my nose and eyebrow. We moved into our current neighbourhood 3 years ago, and discovered it's very snooty (we SO do not fit in here) - I'm kinda thinking I would REALLY enjoy seeing the neighbours' reactions to my new \"look\". :D Everforward: I am SO MAD on your behalf at the person who stole your wallet. What an awful thing to happen! *stomps foot and makes an ugly face* Ladies, I am EXHAUSTED this round! Phew! And to top it off, chemo is doing a number on my mastectomy scar. It started stretching after the port went in (there's only so much skin to go around, you know?), and the chemo has made it worse. It's been dry and a little flaky, and my BS kind of blew me off, saying it was normal. Then, on Sunday, a little area on the scar under my arm split, so now there's an open sore there. It was bleeding and oozing a little, so I called my BS on Monday and he BLEW ME OFF AGAIN. Seriously. He said to \"do nothing\" and to \"expect things to continue like this for awhile.\" Awesome. Thankfully, I can show it to my MO on Thursday, so if there's an issue or a risk of infection, he can deal with it. Meanwhile, I think my BS may be fired.  ANYWAY, I am going to sleep now. Again. Because I swear that's all I want to do lately. Thank goodness for coffee - even if it does have a slightly charred flavour now (thank you chemo!). That's what Mocha Coffee Creamer is for, right? ",

Sending hugs and prayers for minimal side effects this round.  Timbuktu - I hear you on the heart palpitations! Stairs are my NEMESIS now. I made it half way up the other day and needed to stop and rest. My son came up, sat down beside me, and said: \"Whoa, Mom. We might have to call a TOW TRUCK to get you off the stairs.\"  HA! That little Smart Mouth cracks me up! :D EverForward - Sending you hugs. We HAVE given up so much, and we have the right to mourn the losses.  I've had an EPIPHANY Ladies. And I thought I would share it with you. I think all these crazy emotions as we reach the end are NORMAL. I mean, really, we've all been through SO MUCH to get to this point. We've powered through the UGLY and the MEAN and fought off the Dementors, and \"Others\" keep telling is how tough and strong and amazing we are. And we protest and say that we are weak and tired and just didn't have a choice, but those \"Others\" don't really understand. They see a strong woman who endured a cancer diagnosis, gave up a breast, made it through 6 grueling rounds of chemo, and came through it all with a smile. The reality is that I spent just as much time WEEPING as I did smiling, and most of the time I really didn't FEEL strong or amazing.  HOWEVER, I decided that I'm going to try to see myself like those \"Others\" see me. And if I squint a little, I CAN kind of see it. I mean, I DID that, what they said. I DID make it through all those things. And I DID smile more than I thought I would. And even on my worst days, when I was simply too weak to even get out of bed, I still mustered up the energy to whisper \"I love you\" to my husband and children, and to catch the kisses they blew to me from the doorway of the bedroom. So MAYBE, all that strength and amazingness \"Others\" saw in me IS there. Even when I don't FEEL it. MAYBE I AM that person they think I am, even if just in part. And MAYBE I should be proud of ME for getting here, to this place, this place that seemed so far away just a few months ago.  And YOU Ladies, should be PROUD of YOU too. :)",

Here's what the lymphedema PT told me, and I hope it makes you feel better about it all. Basically, I've had some mild swelling and pain in my arm and hand since my surgery in Feb. My BS blew it off saying it was \"normal healing\", claiming that HIS patients RARELY get lymphedema (insert eye roll here). After some pushing on my part, and a couple of \"there's nothing there\" ultrasounds, he FINALLY referred me to a specialist. The specialist was AWESOME, and completely reassured me that while YES, I do have some swelling and YES, it looks like a mild case of lymphedema, it is still very early stage and easily treatable. In fact, she thinks we can likely CURE it by getting full range of movement back in that arm.  I had been faithfully doing my stretches until I found out I needed chemo, and then the port went in, and then chemo started, and suddenly it had been a few weeks since I had stretched out that arm, and it is still pretty stiff. The PT is fairly confident that getting that arm back in shape will solve the whole problem. IN ADDITION, she told me that chemo causes swelling. Lots of it. So expect to see pain and puffiness throughout your chemo treatments, and don't panic. I was given some stretching exercises, and a follow-up appointment, and a big thumbs up for making it this far. I hope this helps a little. And I really hope your appointment with the specialist ends the same as mine. :)",

I will see my BS every 4 months for the next two years, and then every 6 months after that until the 5 year mark. Basically it involves examining the mastectomy site and my remaining breast (and surrounding areas) for any lumps, bumps, puckering, etc. I get asked a WHOLE SHWACK of questions, and there is an ultrasound machine in the room if I have concerns, or if we discover anything suspicious during the exam. So that was yesterday's screening, and we found absolutely NOTHING of concern. :)  In December I will go for a full mammogram and ultrasound, and a more thorough exam, UNLESS I have some concerns before then. And THEN, I have a complete physical with my family doctor in January. As to any further screening for mets, I have no idea. I think it might be something my MO will deal with? I haven't even thought to ask. EverForward & nancybel: I *highly* recommend the Glutamine. I can NOT believe how much it has helped in such a short time.

As you said, we are none of us doctors, and many of us were initially told \"no further treatment needed\" only to be sent on the chemo train once the final pathology came in. In my case, I had only 6mm of grade 3 IDC, but the HER2+ result changed everything. My advice to you is to prepare yourself for the worst case scenario. As mmtagirl said, chemo is scary, but absolutely doable. And there are a truckload of women on these boards who will support you through it. Best of luck tomorrow. Regarding periods, I got mine the day after Infusion 1 (SERIOUSLY? is what I said). It was heavier and more painful than normal, lasted one full week, and then...NOTHING. At all. Since April 11. I'm celebrating that, by the way. Happy Dancing and Woo-Hooing CELEBRATION going on. Of course, NOW I have hot flashes and cold night sweats to deal with, but I will take them over the period. :) Longisland - I NEED that t-shirt. Love, love, LOVE that. :D mmtagirl - my skin is only drier on my face, and I seem prone to breakouts near the end of each Round. But everywhere else, my skin is softer than before - even on my hands, which are normally very, very dry. I thought maybe it was the all-natural organic soap I'm using, but if others are experiencing the same thing...A Chemo Bonus maybe? A roundabout chemical peel for the skin? :)",

Turns out that most of my weight gain was actually WATER, and the more I exercised, the more I would swell. Once I slowed down a bit (1 day of exercise, then 1 or 2 days OFF with my feet up), the pounds started coming off. I've officially lost about 14 pounds of WATER, and still have about 4 pounds to lose. I think these last few pounds are actual WEIGHT, and not so much water, so it's taking longer. But whatever. I can fit back into some of my pants now, so YAY for progress! Sharon - we're heading to Orlando in December for a post-chemo family celebration. Can't wait! You look FAB, by the way. I was thinking I would be wearing a hat the whole time I'm there, but you have inspired me - Disney will be done Topless. :D",

I think the Taxotere body pain combined with the Neulasta bone pain just made everything worse. And I took Claritin EVERY SINGLE DAY up to RIGHT NOW, which is Round 4 Chemo Day for me (BLAH).  In the Chemo Lounge in 3 hours Ladies, waving to all those who join me.

And the rest of you all, I can not tell you how much it helps me to log into this board and read about how you all are faring. Life goes on outside the Dark Place, right? Thanks to all of you for always helping me to remember that, even when the Dark Place is trying to suck out my soul.  So, THC gals, Round 4 is a doozy. I WILL say that the Emend helped A LOT with the  nausea, but the FATIGUE? Oh man, that's another issue altogether. Physically, mentally, emotionally, I have never, EVER been SO TIRED. I literally slept through yesterday. ALL DAY. I just slept and slept and slept. My husband woke me up to feed me and make sure I was getting some fluids, but mostly, I SLEPT. And today, I feel better. I do. Although I can NOT IMAGINE what Rounds 5 and 6 will be like if the fatigue is cumulative. Eeek!  clarrn - Coincidence! We're SUV shopping too. After being housebound for much of last winter due to incredible amounts of snow and not being able to get out of our driveway, and then being housebound for much of this spring and summer due to feeling like CRAP and being immuno-compromised, we decided that I will NOT be doing \"housebound\" again this winter. Plus, the one of the first things my husband said to me when we found out I needed chemo was \"I am SO buying you a car after this.\" I thought he was joking, Turns out he was not. So YAY! for me. :) Keep us posted on the SUV hunt. Footballnut - SO happy you had such a lovely vacation! Also very jealous too. More happy than jealous though. :) EverForward - \"The good days feel really good.\" YES. THIS. Exactly THIS. :) Aaaannd, now I'm ready for another nap. Whew. Typing on the computer keyboard really wipes a person out, right? ;) Hugs and Healing sent your way Ladies!",

      "Content": "Apr 8, 2014 11:13PM ColdInCanada wrote: Hello Ladies! I really, really, really meant to post something sooner and share more details of my very first Chemo experience and aftermath, but the AFTERMATH has been much rougher than what I was expecting. Whew. I am finally feeling a little more myself (an AGED version of myself), so I thought I'd give you the quick run-down.  So, Chemo Day (which I call Day 1) was on Friday April 4, and all in all, as I said previously, it was not so scary. I checked in, they brought me to this fabulous chair that reclined or sat up or laid flat (so NIFTY, this thing), hooked my port up (which was not at all painful - more of a pinch, really - in spite of the fact that it hadn't even been in a week), and away we went with the Herceptin, which was 1.5 hours. Then there was an \"Observation time\" for about an hour, where they watched for any signs of reaction with the Herceptin. For me? Zip. Then came the Taxotere for 1 hour. Again, not much to report. My face turned a lovely shade of red near the end (about the last 10 minutes), so they did a longer saline flush, and once again observed for about 15 minutes. Finally, Carboplatin for half and hour. This stuff made my stomach cramp, so we're going to go slower with it next time. And then I came home. It was totally weird just walking out of there like I hadn't spent the day injecting my body with poison. A little surreal, honestly. Regarding a reaction I had to the steroid I have to take the day before, the day of, and the day after Chemo. I took it as directed the day before, and by that night I had a POUNDING headache, my sinuses were ON FIRE, and the left side of my face was getting tingly. For me, these things equal an allergic reaction. I took it again the next morning, as directed, but brought up my reaction to the first nurse I talked to. By this time, the left side of my face was numb and starting to get a little twitchy (this is how I react to mushrooms, so even though it sounds alarming, it's something I've experienced before, so I wasn't in a panic). After a call to my oncologist, I was pumped full of Benadryl and \"observed\" for about half an hour. Within 10 minutes of the Benadryl hitting me, I felt sleepy, but fine. I've been instructed to HALF the steroid dose for the next round, so hopefully we'll avoid the nasty reaction, but not lose the benefits. Fingers crossed. Be aware of your own allergic reactions. That's all I'm saying. ANYWAY, Day 2 (the day following Chemo) was not too bad, honestly. I has some nausea, which was treated with metoclopramide, which helped, but it appears I have an allergy or sensitivity to that too (I KNOW, right? This is what happens when you spend your life avoiding meds - I rarely even take regular old Tylenol without getting loopy!). Day 3 though? And Day 4? Those were TOUGH. Again, some nausea which was controlled with meds, but also burning, bleeding sinuses, and a horrible, ugly, PAINFUL acne-like rash all over my face and neck and chest and back. Ugh. It LOOKS awful and it feels even worse. Also, Day 4 (which was yesterday for me), I started to HURT in my bones or muscles or joints or SOMETHING. Basically, I felt like someone was zapping me with an electrical wire. OW.  And do NOT even get me started on TASTE. Blah. I can not believe how quickly everything started tasting like CHALK. Ick. Of course, my kids were all \"MOM, how do you even KNOW what chalk tastes like?\", and I concede, they do have a point. :) There is really no other way for me to describe it though. Suffice it to say, very few things taste quite right. Even coffee (oh, how I already MISS coffee!). Although SOME stuff, like Greek yogurt, is still the same (Praise the Lord!). Basically, mealtime has become one big experiment.   Today, Day 5, started out horribly. I was exhausted from being up all night with the Zapping Pain, I was reacting to the anti-nausea meds, and my allergies were taking a hit (it's GORGEOUS weather here, so we're been walking outside). And I had a big old pity party for myself, and wondered WHY OH WHY this happened to me, and I tried to cry about it, but I was just TOO TIRED. True Story. BUT, as bedtime approaches I'm starting to see the light. Tylenol is helping with the pain, the nausea has let up, so I no longer need the meds, and Reactine has taken care of my poor sinuses for a time. Phew.  I gotta say, Ladies, I FEEL OLD. Seriously. My daughter informed me that my husband's 100-year-old Grandmother moves faster than I did today. And she was completely and utterly correct. :)   Oh, and at the risk of TMI, be prepared for either the Big C or the Big D. I, lucky girl that I am, am waging the war against the Big C right now, and it's just one more annoying thing to have to deal with. I will win though - Metamusil, All Bran Buds, and I just added half a jar of Baby Food Prunes to my smoothie. Oh. Yum. It is amazing to me how varied everyone's reactions are to this stuff. I am hoping that all of you starting up this month just breeze on through this. :) Hugs and Prayers to those who start days are soon!",

The HER2+ pathology changes everything. I try to keep telling  myself to be thankful that this is happening to me NOW and not 20 years ago, when there was no Herceptin, and Chemo was a much scarier thing, and my prognosis would have been very, very poor. And I'll be honest, sometimes I tell myself to SHUT UP. :) Hang in there. The ladies on these boards are very, very helpful and very, very supportive.  Longislandl8y: \"it was far less troublesome than I thought it would be\". I KNOW, right? I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but it all felt pretty...ordinary.  EverForward: I sincerely HOPE that the side effects for the next round will be a little easier. For me, I'm not very big, and I don't normally take meds for anything, so when I DO have to take something, even just an antibiotic, my body REACTS in a big way. So I am hoping that once we adjust meds, and my body gets used to the idea of me being medicated, things will smooth out. I could be totally wrong though. Plus, this is all so individual - everyone reacts just a little bit differently. I, personally, was hoping I would be one of THOSE WOMEN who just went about her daily routines without a blip. But, since I'm NOT, I'm now hoping to be one of those women who gets all the kinks worked out in the first round and feels great for the remaining five. Always need to have something to look forward to, right? :)",

It started off as red bumps, which quickly turned to white heads, which quickly \"burst\" themselves. They were itchy and painful and I was covered in them from my head to my neck to my chest and back. AWFUL. Turns out it was a reaction to the Taxotere and, because I also had some shortness of breath and some serious \"zapping pain\", my oncologist has added Claritan and Zantac to my drug regime. I ended up needed a steroid cream to clear up the rash/acne, and I still have some scarring that I hope will eventually fade. I would definitely mention it to your MO, just in case.  Ladies: The HAIR. Logically, we tell ourselves: \"Oh, it's just hair. No big deal.\" But emotionally, it's our HAIR. OUR HAIR.

Too funny. :) Nana, Yay for the LAST ROUND! :)  But I totally get the whole \"not being ready\" thing. I have two rounds left, and while I'm super excited to be done, I'm also worrying and worrying about whether everything I've done will be enough to keep me alive to watch my babies grow up. Cancer is just so unpredictable, and really, just so UNKNOWN. So, YEAH, I get you. Excited to be done, dreading the side effects, and SCARED that it all will be for naught. Sending hugs and prayers your way. Praying especially that the last round will be totally anti-climactic and that cancer will leave you alone from now on. :) Ricanbabe - I second what Linda said. Her2+ cancer is not something to mess around with, and we are so SO fortunate to now have a targeted therapy to treat it. Herceptin is a God-Send; it really, REALLY is. Chemo is a matter of personal choice, so get a second opinion if you wish, but it sounds like your MO has given you pretty good advice regarding the standard treatment. My cancer was also HER2+, and chemo was a no-brainer for me. I just turned 39, I have a husband and 2 children, and there was NO WAY I was going to give cancer the upper hand. As hellish as chemo side-effects have been (and I have had them ALL!), it is DOABLE. And in the end, I will know I did everything I possibly could to win the fight. Good luck with your decision. Ah, Ladies, the TUMMY TROUBLES, right? I feel like my entire digestive system is rebelling. It not C, then D, then back to C, followed by D. And then there's the ever-present queasiness, stomach cramps, and BLOATING. Plus the dry mouth/burnt tongue and food aversions - makes eating kinda tough. Oh yeah, good times, right? ;) Speaking of food, you know those little apple sauces you can get - they come in a whole bunch of flavours, all of which taste like baby food? WELL, if you FREEZE them, they taste not so bad AND feel awesome on a chemo tongue. WIN! :) I discovered this weekend that I only have SIX WEEKS left of chemo! In just SIX WEEKS, I will have crawled out of the chemo fog for the very LAST TIME. And six weeks really isn't so long. It's NOT. And now I'm getting all excited. :)  Oh, and we test drove the Honda Pilot yesterday. I think I'm in love. I told my husband I want it delivered in SIX WEEKS. With a big bow on it.

We started with nine (and the children NAMED then all), got nine chrysalids, and NOW we have nine beautiful Painted Lady butterflies.

So is today, actually, so if what I'm posting doesn't make sense, you all know why. ;) In terms of the other SEs, with the exception of the nausea, which is GONE (another YAY!), they were all THERE, but really muted this time around. They all set in earlier though. Like, Friday night my tongue was tingling. And by Saturday I had the whole burnt tongue/throat thing going on, as well as numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. And The Big C (which has already turned into The Big D). But these things are all LESS than last time. Even the bone/muscle pain is so much LESS. If it wasn't for the MIND-NUMBING fatigue, I really wouldn't feel all that bad. The Dark Place? Not so ugly and not so mean this time. It's like those Dementors have realized they have no hold on me - they can NOT bring me down. I gave them all a nasty RIGHT HOOK and said \"LET ME SLEEP\", and they did. And now I feel better. SLEEPY, but better.  A new side effect (because I didn't even KNOW it could be normal - WHY don't they TELL us these things, right?): My tongue is turning black. Or maybe a dark grey. Definitely in the charcoal hue anyway. It's pretty gross, though my children think it's cool and asked me to look up WHY chemo can do that. So I did. Apparently it has to do with swollen and irritated taste buds and bacteria. Blech.  I am LOVING the Chemo Lounge photos - you ladies are all so beautiful. And the SMILES.

It's actually pretty refreshing and nice change from plain water (which tastes like SLIME right now - ew). I'm pretty sure there was more I wanted to say, but POOF! Its gone. Darn Chemo Brain.  And now, I'm off to enjoy an afternoon in the sun with my babies. Hopefully I don't fall asleep. ;)",

How wonderful that someone else gets to enjoy one too. :D And even now, when I hear the word \"commode\" I giggle a little. Thanks for sharing your photo and making me laugh today! :) I hope you're feeling better! Well, I MADE it Ladies. I made it through the final chemo round. But the day was not without its blips. For the past few rounds the oncology nurses have been warning me that Round 6 of carboplatin is when reactions can happen. I asked my MO about it and he assured me that while they CAN happen, they are not common. The nurses are wonderful, he said, and they know what to do, so don't worry about it. Total foreshadowing there. So, I marched into the chemo lounge this morning with a SMILE on my face. Seriously, I could NOT stop grinning, knowing that after today I don't have to do this again. We started with Herceptin for 30 minutes, then Taxotere for 1 hour, and then carboplatin for 45 minutes. Unfortunately, half way through the carboplatin, I got a little nauseated. I thought it was because I had just eaten lunch and maybe I had eaten too fast. A few minutes later, I started to feel...WRONG. I hit my call button, and with only ELEVEN MINUTES remaining for the carboplatin, we stopped. My face, neck, and chest had turned a lovely glowing RED, and I felt AWFUL. The nurses were AWESOME, as always. They did a saline flush, then some Benadryl, then some Hydrocortisone, and THEN some Zantac, and THEN some more saline. Then there was a 20 minute wait, and I totally zonked out for a little while.  My nurse informed me that typically they don't \"challenge carboplatin\" once there's been a reaction. But because mine was a minor reaction ( I would hate to see what a major one looks like - oy!), and because I had so little left, my MO wanted to try to finish it up, but at a slower rate. So 11 minutes became 22 minutes. And guess what? I took it all like a CHAMP. And then I got to RING THE BELL. Now THAT is an awesome feeling. :)  I walked out of the chemo lounge much more tired than usual; which was expected, considering how many extra meds I had pumped into me! But I feel like a Super Star. If I had ever learned to tap dance, I would have tappa, tappa, tappa'ed my way out of there. :)  Isn't the sign amazing? My son made it.  I'm keeping it forever. :) In other news, my daughter was diagnosed with Strep Throat this afternoon, and my son appears to be following in her footsteps with a fever and a sore throat developing this evening. *big sigh* When it rains, it pours, right? The worst part is not being able to go near them. Mommies are supposed to snuggle with their sick babies - it helps them get better. And I CAN'T. AAARGH! NO FAIR. *stamps foot* And my husband (and Mom - the traitor!) thinks I should be quarantined to my room until the children are better. WHAT?! I can't even argue with him about it too much, even though the idea SUCKS. Because he's probably right, the big Smarty Pants.  Ah well, I am FINISHED CHEMO. And that's really all that matters here, right? One more visit to the Dark Place, and then I'll shake the dust off my feet, straighten my crown, and walk away like a boss. ;)",

Nausea still hovering (albeit MILD nausea, so I can live with it), EXTREME fatigue, all sorts of digestive issues, body aches and pains, low-grade fever at then end of week 1, and new this time, mouth sores and a constant burnt tongue. I'm like the poster child for getting every single SE you can get, right? :D And Ladies, the whole bald thing? Isn't it UNFAIR how men can wander around all bald and no one suspects THEM of being \"sick\"? I see all your bald pictures and all I see are gorgeous women with big, beautiful eyes, striking cheekbones, and brilliant smiles. It's a SHAME that bald on women is such a social no-no. People are missing out on such beauty. BOO. footballnut - I love your comment about lodging a complaint. Wouldn't it be great if there was a Chemo Complaint Line? Ha ha ha! That would be one busy call centre, right?  As for all those ridiculous comments people around us make? Some people don't know what to say, so they fumble. But they mean well, and we can be the ones to teach them the best way to react and respond. But SOME people are just STUPID. And NOSY. And we should feel sorry for them, from afar. ;) A few posts back, Longisland mentioned that no one had told her they're proud of her for the way she's handling this. And that STRUCK me like a bolt of lightening. I am so blessed to have friends and family tell me that on a regular basis, and I completely took it for granted. But no more. SO, like Longisland, I am passing those words on to all of you Ladies. I am so PROUD of YOU. I am PROUD of US. We are FREAKING AMAZING!  Sending a Virtual GROUP HUG to you all! ",

I'm in what is SUPPOSED to be my \"good week\", but I'm still battling mild nausea (it just never went away!), and the FATIGUE. Geez. I've never been SO TIRED. And my muscles are always screaming at me. You know that feeling the day after a really good workout, and your muscles are sore and tired and weak? That's me ALL THE TIME. GAH! And don't even get me started on the dry mouth and chemo tongue. Blech. AND, I have gained 8lbs so far! EIGHT POUNDS in just 3 rounds! I know, I know, better to have chemo-induced weight gain than cancer. But STILL. EIGHT POUNDS. And most of it appears to be water retention. I haven't been this puffy since pregnancy - even my ankles are swollen. And my pants don't fit. Which annoys me more than anything. Stupid pants. It's a good thing cancer patients get a \"Wear Yoga Pants All the Time\" card, right? ;) Footballnut - I have a friend who is a cancer survivor who keeps throwing the \"don't eat this and don't use that product and avoid these things\" lines at me. If I followed all the \"advice\" out there, I think I'd have to live on lawn clippings. Seriously. And in all honestly, I've been a very healthy eater for a long time, but I still got cancer. So I say enjoy your weekend away, eat delicious foods, and be sure to tell us all how fabulous it was when you return. :) mmtagirl - I haven't had so much the emotional SEs, but I do forget things. A lot. Like VERY a lot. Losing words is the worst. It's common for me to start a sentence and then forget what I was going to say a few words in (trying to carry on a conversation with me is a HOOT). And during certain weeks, I really don't even like driving anymore, because my focus is just GONE. It's like my brain just decided to let me handle the whole chemo thing without it.  Ddkath - Your husband is a rock star. Give him a big HIGH FIVE from me. :) And regarding the bone pain? Taxotere can also cause some serious body pains, and in combination with the Neulasta, it can get pretty nasty. Be sure to mention it to your MO. If he thinks it's due to the Taxotere, there are things he can do to help. :) Anyone else's nose run ALL THE TIME? Seriously, it's too bad there's not a market for snot. I could totally cash in.  ",

Such a long journey we've traveled already, and still it feels like we have miles to go, doesn't it? Whew. Ddkath - I think I mentioned this previously, although my memory is NOT what it was, but I have had terrible swelling in my legs and feet. Also in my arms and hands and STOMACH, and a wee bit on my face. Seventeen pounds worth, in fact. My MO tells me this is NORMAL water retention, and it will all disappear in time. Over the past couple of weeks, I have lost 6lbs, so I'm inclined to believe him. :) I drink lots of water, and I try to take a walk every day, even just for 10 minutes. The activity seems to help a lot.  Linda - HOORAY for a clear scan! So, so SO happy for you! :) :) :) MommyQ - Congrats on reaching the Finish Line! So, SO scary about the delayed reaction. I will say that I did have my light-headed moments in that first week following the final infusion as well. Some fluids, some sugar, and a nap seemed to set things right, but still, more than a little bit terrifying, right? So glad you're on the mend.  Sunshine - I second what everyone else has said about the mastectomy. Compared to chemo, that's the easy part. I kept having to remind myself NOT to do things. My MIL was staying with us to help out at that time, and she actually LOCKED ME INTO THE RECLINER so I would rest a little. The Tyrant! :D  I couldn't operate the release mechanism, so I was completely stuck and had no choice but to take a nap. Too funny. :) Still dealing with some serious muscle pain. My legs ache ALL THE TIME, and my arms aren't far behind. And stairs, AAACK, stairs about kill me. Again, staying active seems to help a little, but WOW, I wish I had known how much I would HURT after chemo. Yesterday I almost got stuck in my shirt because my arms were too sore to cooperate. Oy! Actually, as frustrating as that last part was, it was also pretty hilarious. :D Some annoying  news: my surgeon seems to have forgotten about me. I had to contact his office to remind him that I'm due for a screening, and SOMEHOW, no one bothered to send in my referral to the plastic surgeon, so I now have a year-long wait from TODAY before I even get a consult. Grrrr. My knitted boob is lovely, but I was kind of hoping to get some information about something more permanent. Ah well, thinking of getting fitted for a silicone friend for the time being.  Enjoy your day Ladies! :)",

My first round of Taxotere, I had the kind of pain you're describing, but only for a  couple of days. Even so, after my WBCs tanked, and I ended up in the hospital, my MO and I talked about it and he said that pain THAT severe suggests an allergic reaction. We added daily Claritin to my cocktail and things are much better now. HOWEVER, if things had NOT improved, we would have replaced the Taxotere with something else. I'm just wondering why your team isn't more concerned about this. Have you spoken to your MO personally? I would push for this. Some of the nurses I have dealt with have been WONDERFUL, and others pat me on the head, say \"That's normal. Sorry.\" and tell me to suck it up. My MO, on the other hand, always tells me that severe symptoms are NOT \"NORMAL\" and can, and SHOULD, always be dealt with. I dunno, maybe my MO just goes above and beyond. But I'm worried for you. :( Swissmiss - regarding the port? What EverForward said. :)  At first I was horrified that I had to keep the thing so long, but being in the Chemo Lounge, and witnessing so many poor women whose veins are damaged, I am thankful for it. For one lady, it took 3 nurses and five tries to get an IV in. This poor woman was in so much pain, and she still had several rounds of chemo to go. Poor thing. :( My pants have reached an all-new level of TIGHTNESS today. Super annoying. Carbs really settle the stomach, so I consume WAY too many of those, and I can't even exercise because too much exertion (as in, doing more than walking from the couch to bathroom) leaves me short of breath and nauseated. No one tells you going into this that chemo AGES you. When this is all over- I have it marked on the calendar - I have a date with my running shoes. We are gonna have ourselves a GOOD TIME. :D Timbuktu - It's true - there are no guarantees about recurrence. But you CAN NOT let your Sweet Self go there. I was told that by going through chemo and Herceptin, I reduce my risk of recurrence to 2-3%. Which sounds great, but still a little scary. I mean, I just turned 39 - I have years and years left for that recurrence to happen. So YIKES, really? That HIGH?  But you know what I heard on the radio not long ago? An ad for the Alberta Cancer Society, stating that ONE in FOUR people will be told they have cancer this year. ONE IN FOUR. That's INSANE. But it also means that my 2-3% isn't really so bad. Basically, chemo and Herceptin will give me the same (or perhaps better?) odds as EVERYONE ELSE in the general population.  Ladies, you all HANG IN THERE. There is an end coming. We're ALMOST there. And then we'll look back and be like \"YEAH. I did that. I'm a ROCK STAR.\"  I'm thinking I need to buy me a CROWN. ;)",

I have a trip planned to visit family (my husband's grandmother turns 101! WOW!) at the end of August, and I am hoping I'll be relatively close to normal by then. Or at least have the ability to fake it. clarrn - sending some comforting hugs your way. Wish I could do more or say the words that would make it all better. :( Well, I am now about 10 days post Round 6 and I'm FINALLY feeling mostly human gain. FINALLY. The fatigue and the digestive issues have been, BY FAR, the worst this time around. Also the swollen, sore taste buds, and the whole tongue turning black thing were back, so eating was an issue. I am SO looking forward to eating things that are not mushy and bland. Like STEAK. Oh, how I miss me some steak. And fresh garden salad. Basically, any food with FLAVOUR and TEXTURE - I miss it. I have some BIG MEALS planned for later this week - YUM. Sending all those in the chair this week hugs and prayers. And to those in the Dark Place right now, we're right here cheering you on. ",

As always, my thoughts and prayers are with those in the chair and visiting that awful Dark Place. I am a little over 3 weeks PFC, and I'm happy to report that the Chemo Brain is nearly gone. Hooray! I also have some very fine, very WHITE stubbles all over my head. It's very little, but it's there! It's also all over my legs, which means I'll have to start shaving again. Dang. :) Also my taste buds are back to normal - so coffee and I are BFFs again. So Awesome! UNFORTUNATELY, I am still dealing with the deep muscle pain. Every single morning I wake up feeling like I've competed in an Iron Man the day before. It got really bad after Round 4 and hasn't let up, so basically I've been in pain for 9 weeks and counting. My MO tells me this is normal and to give it time. Apparently it could last for another couple of months. Yowch! To make things worse, I've gained a total of 17lbs throughout chemo. I was told that half of it is likely water weight, and again, it will \"just take time.\" But some of it is the result of carb overload and no activity. And I can't exercise because of the muscle pain. I've been taking tortoise-paced walks, but that's all I can manage. SOOO frustrating. Some lingering tummy issues too. GAH. Why did I think that the end of chemo meant a magical transformation to feeling fabulous? Can you see how impatient I am? I KNOW it takes the body time to heal after pumping it full of poison for months. But I WANT IT NOW. Like Veruca Salt: \"I want an Oopma Loompa Daddy! I want it NOW!\"  ANYWAY, I had my first Only Herceptin treatment this past Friday and everything went well. I can honestly say there were no side effects. I was a little more sleepy that night than usual, but other than that...nothing. What an amazing feeling to walk into and out of the Chemo Lounge knowing that the Dark Place wasn't waiting for me!  A friend shared this with me on FB, and I thought I'd pass it on to you. We are SO much STRONGER than we think.  Run like a Girl, Swing like a Girl, FIGHT like a Girl. Damn straight!   Take care Ladies! ",

I've said it before and I'll say it again: the mastectomy is so much easier than the chemo. You've got this Girl! Thinking and Praying for you tomorrow! A little something that helped me out: Remember how I complained of some serious MUSCLE PAIN? It just was NOT letting up, so I asked a friend, who is studying to be a Naturopath, what she would recommend. She suggested Glutamine supplements - 1mg, 4 times per day. So I tried it. I took my first dose this past Friday (Sept. 5), and today, just 4 days later, IT'S WORKING. Seriously. Last week I had to brace myself on a wall or table in order to sit in a chair. This afternoon I SAT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR. And then? I got back up. ALL BY MYSELF. This is miraculous, Friends. Truly. :) In other news, I had my first post-surgery/chemo screening today. And everything is CLEAR. Woo hoo! :) :) :) Next screening will take place in December. Isn't it amazing how many medical appointments we now have? Whew. Oh, and I will also CONFIRM clarrn's report of SNOW in Southern Alberta. Calgary is now under a Heavy Snowfall Warning. True Story. And I can't even say it's a Shocker. This is kinda the norm here - you just never know when the snow will show up. Keeps things exciting. ;)  Wishing you all a wonderful week Ladies! :)",

APPARENTLY I was mistaken in how much (or rather, how little) I have. It's super thin and soft, but there's lots of it. In the BACK. On top I look like I I have male pattern baldness. Sheesh.          Also there's A LOT of grey in there. So maybe that's why it looks like Grandpa's hair? Here's hoping that one day soon I'll have enough length for a comb-over.  ",
