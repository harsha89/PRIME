I did this to help with healing after surgery, hoping to minimize scarring. ( I did not do reconstruction after a bi-lateral). Each packet provides 7g L-Arginine and 7g L-Glutamaine, and Abbott recommends 2 packets a day. I do not know if it helped with wound healing, but my nails grew like crazy, and I have had weak slow growing nails most of my life. It is spendy ($81/ 30 packs) , but you do get a price break with setting up repeating orders. I have been using it for about 7 months. Initially I used 2 packets a day, but often only use 1/day now. I also started taking biotin very recently which another poster suggested. That is to help my hair. I do not know if it is doing anything. I did ask my oncologist to prescribe a glutamine/arginine product, but have not investigated with my insurance will pay for some of it. Last year I took it off my taxes since my medical was high enough to deduct some of it. This year it will not be high enough, so I might see if I can get insurance to pay for some of it. 2016 Left breast, 4 rounds TC, starting August, ending October. Bi-lateral end of November (my choice, vs single). Anastrozole starting 4/2017 ( I delayed 1-2 months, concerns for side-effects. I am having joint pain, stiffness, trigger finger). Probably a new cancer rather than recurrence, but no way of really knowing. 2009 -Left breast. Lumpectomy; Radiation; Tamoxifen 5 years ",

Check out the Forum on this site , \"living without reconstruction after a mastectomy\" for tips, and posts questions there. Somebody may know the SD area and have recommendations. Someone on that formum \"living without reconstruction after a mastectomy\" posted another website which looks like it has lots of information , https://www.flatclosurenow.org/ . Do the stretching/arm reach exercises your surgeon shows you to help prevent stiffness in shoulder area. Not to alarm you , but if lymph nodes are removed, ask and search out information on preventing lymphedema. I do not have a problem with it, but only 2 were removed, and I exercise/stretch a lot. I did not have dog ears. When I asked the surgeon about dog ears, she told me that she was a good surgeon, and did not expect it to be a problem. That if it did occur, she would fix it. No dog ears. The left side seemed to heal better as far as the scar goes, than the right, even though the cancer was on the left side, and lymph nodes removed on that side. I went the full circle on the reconstruction question. Went to a plastic surgeon prior to any surgery because I thought that was what you did. About the same time I found out about DIEP (not available at the clinic or even in the state). I found out I was not a very good candidate for DIEP (consulted a surgeon who did them) and that the surgery was more intense and recovery period longer, so I opted not to do that, and eventually decided no reconstruction. I am still shy in the locker room, but feel comfortable swimming with a regular swimsuit, do not use prosthetics. Still thinking about getting a torso tattoo ( Tattoo shops said 1-2 years afer surgery, so I could do it now. But I've never had any tattoo, so feel kind of nervous). Good luck to you and hope the surgery goes well. Supplements: GAIA turmeric-joint; glucosamine-chondroitin; magnesium glycinate; biotin; potassium-iodine; low dose calcium; C; B-complex ; D; Fish oil. For a year or so after bi-lateral used Juven Nutritional therapy for wound healing with 7g arginine, 7g glutamine. Often add turmeric to meals. Ran out of fish oil supplement that I liked, other brand caused fish burps, so have not taken for a while 2009 ER+ left breast. 52 yrs. Lumpectomy, Sentinal node removal, negative. \u2013 1. Radiation 6 weeks, tamoxifen 5 years. Dense lumpy left breast, normal right. Acupuncture offered at facility as part of integrative medicine. It really helped with anxiety/stress during radiation treatment. 2016 ER+ left breast. Probably a new cancer, but unknown. 4 rounds TC Aug-Oct 2016, Bi-lateral (my choice) Nov 2016, no reconstruction. 2 sentinal nodes remove, negative. Cold Capping using Chemo Cold Caps (DIGNICAP not available). Anastrozole 1 mg starting May 2017. Joint issues noticed immediately. Stopped Anastrozole after 3-4 months do to joint stiffness in. After several months of no AIs, fingers were feeling better. Started tamoxifen March 2018 10/2018 noticed stiffness and some trigger finger again. Was eating meat a lot more (daily) than normal. Usually 1-2 /wk. Have cut way back on the meat, seems to help, but one finger still very prone to trigger finger. 2/2019, trigger finger and stiffness much better.",
