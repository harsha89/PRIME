It has been at 190/90 all week, we finally took her to the hospital yesterday and now they're giving her a few medicines (not sure what kind though). I'm concerned about the blood pressure. She's only had one dose of the chemo almost 2 weeks ago (corrected from a week ago. sorry). I realize it could take a couple weeks to completely leave your body. But will the allergic effects such as high blood pressure be temporary or permanent damage? Log in to post a reply",
