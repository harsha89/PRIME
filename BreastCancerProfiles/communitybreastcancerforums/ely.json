I thought if I was not on the boards here then I would not think about it, but that is so untrue. I don't think you ever stop thinking about it. Maybe once it is over that can happen. I do like being able to connect with others in the same situation-you guys are great! I see there are quite a few of us starting our treatments soon and we will be beginning another part of this journey that will get us closer to putting this behind us. I do wish everyone a blessed Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah and a very Happy Healthy New Year! Janetanned- I was in your area in September when we took my son to visit Swarthmore College. Beautiful school and area!",

The only issue I have is just feeling a little uncomfortable in a short sleeve shirt- like everyone would stare at it. The reality of it is that no one is really paying that much attention to me, let alone my arm-lol So sorry that.your daughter had to witness such a terrible and sad thing. What school was this?",

When you go to to this website click on the right to request a wrap. They sell head accessories, but want to help out those who are losing or have lost their hair.

The actual treatment was uneventful. Just sat there with DH playing some word games since they did not have wireless Internet. We both brought things to do on computer, but had to resort to my book of games. We had fun though. I was the youngest one there at 44 and it seemed as though everyone kept to themselves. My treatment center is the open kind with the nurses station in the middle. There were tvs on all three sides, but ours was on the CW channel with court cases and it was turned up very loud for this one lady. I might try a different spot if she is there again. I did ask about assigned seats and they told me some people do like to,have the same seat, but she did not tell me which ones, and just to go to any vacant chair. They did offer coffe and maybe juice and water along with blankets, but I came prepared with my own blanket, drinks, and snacks. Not sure how often the blankets are washed and would just prefer my own if needed. Got home around 3:30 after quickly going through SAMs club. Had dinner by 4:30 and was starting to have a headache and feel a little nausea and very tired. Took tylenol and fell asleep from 6-8:30. Woke up still with headache and a little more nausea-by 9:30 I took Ativan and did not feel any different from taking it. Fell asleep,by 11. I woke up at 6 still with a headache and slight nausea. Tried going back to sleep and was able to get up and have some breakfast by 8:30. I'm hoping this day gets better. I have an appointment to see BS just for a follow up and then Neulasta shot after. I didn't think the nausea and tiredness were supposed to start that quickly-ugh! Hopefully that will be the extent of the SE for now, but I'm thinking that is not the case lol. Have a great day everyone!",

We can surely keep each other company as we go through this.

My second tx was last Tuesday and I don't feel like I had too many SE but one that did occur was that my stomach became very hot and slightly uncomfortable and I burped a lot-lol sorry! I tried tums and Pepcid and they did not seem to work. It also seemed as though I needed to keep something in my stomach to try to prevent this. Did anyone else have something like this? I am so glad to have this board here so we can unload, whine, and try to feel like we are normal. You are all very special, and I feel like I have gotten to know many of you through your posts. I may not post a lot, but please know that I am wishing all of you minimal side effects.",

By 3:30 I was asleep until 4:45. Once I woke up I was feeling a bit of nausea and was still very tired. I could not eat anything for the rest of the night and I kept dozing off. 6:30 ish I took an Ativan which did not seem to do too much. I was in bed and asleep by 11. Today however was a different story. I felt good and was able to eat normally. My MO did tell me to keep up with Motrin and Tylenol to ward off the headaches I had for at least 10 days last time and to take Pepcid or something like that everyday for the stomach issues/heartburn. She said the chemo can be terrible on the stomach. Imagine that-lol. I'm hoping the side effects for #3 are not too bad for me and everyone else. Have a great week everyone :)",

CharB22- it was as Jennt28 said about studies showing lesser side effects and having a higher percentage survival or success rate. It still stinks that it will extend it one month and now I will need to take off from work at least one day a week for 3 months. Hopefully I won't need to take off other days due to SE with Taxol. Jennt28-did you know from the start that you would have the. 12 weeks of Taxol? I wish i had known from the start that it would be 12 weeks and then I would not have gotten my hopes up for an April completion. I guess an extra month in the grand scheme of all of this is not really a big deal. Jenn did you say your hair started falling out 6 days after your first treatment? Janetanned-I was wondering about the shaving too. I was also wondering why there is a need to shave when it will all come out anyway---I guess I really don't want anyone to shave my head because then they will see me bald-lol. I was hoping that even my family would be spared from seeing the bald me. I guess I have a little more time since I am only a week out of my first treatment- but it will be here soon enough!",

I knew it was going to happen, but I kept hoping that it wouldn't be until a lot later. I'm hoping it will be ok for a few more days without being too noticeable so I can get through a few more appointments without needing the wig. In addition to the 2nd treatment tomorrow, on Wednesday I have an appointment with the plastic surgeon for a follow up with the reconstruction and then I will have the Neulasta shot. I really am not ready for the wig. I tried it on again and I don't like it. It is not my natural color-it is similar, but with highlights that I am not used to, it is also a bit shiny for me. I was told I could spray it with some dry shampoo to take away some of the shine. I do have some hats to wear that my 17 year old son picked out, but I'm just sitting here feeling sorry for myself. I know it could be worse and I thank God that it is not, but it just sucks! I don't know about shaving my head yet and I guess I will see as this progresses. I'm going out to lunch today with a friend I haven't seen in awhile so I'm hoping she will make me feel better. I hope everyone has a great day!",

I hate sitting in my recliner, but there are days when that's all I feel like doing. I am so used to being on the go that it is hard for me to just sit there. I have, however, come to the realization that it is OK for me to just do nothing. It is hard, but if it will help me have a better treatment with minimal SEs then that's what it has to be. I am one week out from my first treatment of A/C and really only felt bad days 3&4. I am waiting for the hair loss which I agree is probably the hardest part because then people will really know you have cancer. What really stinks for me is that I have always hated my hair, but just in the past year or so, I have actually liked my hair and how it has progressed. Now it will be like starting all over again. It has taken me 40 some years to get to this point and now I wonder how long it will take for me to like my hair once this is all over? LOL Today I saw the MO and she just informed me that when I am finished with 3 more A/C instead of getting the taxol for 4 treatments every 2 weeks I will now be getting it once a week for 12 weeks-ugh! I already had it in my mind that I will be done in April now it will be May. that's such a bummer:( Best wishes to everyone!",

There is a group that is able to provide general cleaning for cancer patients for 1x a month for 4 months, for free. I'm sure many of you are like me and would greatly appreciate a little help. It's not that everyday is terrible and I can't do any cleaning, but it just would be a great help. They are throughout the U.S and Canada. Check out the website www.cleaningforareason.org",

I will be starting on Jan 10 with 4 treatments every 2 weeks of A/C and then 4 treatments of Taxol every 2 weeks. I am very anxious about starting this treatment, but I know that it is necessary. My family and I know a little of what expect since my sister is currently going through chemo now. She was diagnosed this summer about 2 months before me and had a lumpectomy in Oct. Her chemo plan is different so our SE might be different. My children ages 17 and 15 as well as my husband have been wonderful as I recover from the BMX and I am sure they will continue.
