Our dear old NHS provided me with my prothesis, after 12 months I requested contact breast forms and I loved them. Unfortunately the adhesive is not so good now and I will have to purchase my own. I haven't found a good supplier and decided to treat myself while on holiday. We will be staying in Irvine CA can anyone recommend a good supplier Log in to post a reply",
