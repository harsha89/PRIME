I have a huge family history of breast cancer and honestly just want my breasts GONE. My father was dx with BC stage 4 at 58 and fought for 5 years. My grandmother had breast cancer twice. One time in her 50's and then again after 11 years. She also passed away after 5years of fighting stage 4. I am BRCA negative and am awaiting results on a panel of 21 other genetic Cancer mutations. I get mammograms yearly and am supposed to get an MRI every other year but I skipped the last one, damn it! My husband noticed an indentation on the underside of my breast two nights ago. We took pics and I can see it although it really isn't that noticeable. I did notice that below the area is a ridge and then an area that seems to lack tissue. Upon inspection I noticed that while leaning forward my nipple is pointing to the left when it never did before. It is very slight but definitely different.  I have an appointment with a breast center Monday so I guess right now it is just me and my thoughts. Thank you for all the wonderful knowledge I have gained from these boards so far!   Any input or prayers greatly appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
