Fatigue and bone pain primarily. Trying to stay on top of my anti-nausea meds and prn meds. Feel miserable really, like the flu with no fever. Question: When are the worse days supposed to be? Is the second recovery week better as far as side-effects? Thank you!",

Like I said, I finished taxol last week. My main side effect has been the fatigue. Even if I sleep the entire night when I wake my body is still tired. I'm anemic, so that doesn't help. I have stage 2b breast cancer. 2 positive lymph nodes with the sentinel lymph node biopsy. I had a bilateral mastectomy, chemo, and will then have 6 weeks of radiation.  Did anyone of you need an echo before starting AC? Also, does anyone know why there is a lifetime max dose of AC? What are the main risks associated with taking the AC? Thank you.   ",
