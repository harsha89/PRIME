I had my first chemotherapy treatment on 12.10.2008.  My next one is on 12.31.2008.  My hair started falling out on 12.24.2008.  My regular stylist gave me a crew cut and I've already decided that \"Bald Is Beautiful\".  I wear hats outside just because it is winter outside and I don't want to freeze.  My question today is what to do with what's left of my hair.  It's still falling out and with it as short as it is now it's harder to clean up the fall-out.  I am not sure if I should just go back to my stylist and have her literally shave my head completely bald, or should I let these short hairs continue to fall out on their own.  Right now my head looks kind of funny 'cuz the hair is not falling out consistently across my entire head.  In some areas I am bald to the scalp.  In other areas, the hair seems to be slow in falling out.  The hair is really patchy looking.  So, I'm curious what others have done at this phase of hair loss.  Should I just shave my head bald or continue to let it fall out?",

When I asked my DH what I should do (not that he would understand anyway), he said maybe it would grow back faster if I left it alone.  I am not feeling as comfortable with my hair with it looking so patchy so I am really leaning towards having it all shaved off. My eyebrows started falling out today also along with my pubic hair.  Do eyelashes fall out too?",
