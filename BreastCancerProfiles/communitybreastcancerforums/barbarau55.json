My 4th (last) AC infusion is scheduled for this coming Wed (9/28). I want to get it over with so I can get on to the Taxol (12 weekly infusions). But I have been so miserable since AC #3, I am really reticent. My mouth sores have \"soared\" to new heights. First time they responded fairly quickly but this time, it's as though there are no treatments(including Pink Magic Mouth) -- none that work. Each day it gets worse. I have been unable to swallow anything without extreme pain. Sore throat, open canker sores on both sides of tongue. Two days ago a knot formed IN my tongue. Today it is some smaller but the \"bottom\" of the knot has popped through and now there is a big canker sore there. Left ear aches, too. Part of mouth sores--I don't know. I have bunions on both my feet, and have dealt with blisters on my great toes due to that for several years. A few days after AC #3, I found a huge clear fluid filled huge blister forming on the inside edge of my left foot. No injury, just this growing thumb-size blister. It hurts. Pretty soon my heels were painful. My feet feel like I'm walking on sharp rocks. I did some research and found the blisters are a side effect of chemo, too. The last two days my fingertips have started swelling and turned red and hurting (like they are burned). I think this is related to the blisters. And my fatigue is so bad . . . You think it can't get worse, but it can. Obviously walking and eating are \"out.\" Typing has been non-existent, too. I have a long list to \"share with\" my MO Wednesday. I need to get through this--to either live or not--but feeling worse than death is a pretty heavy sentence. I went to bed last night telling my DH that I hoped I didn't wake up. He has been very supportive but he has a long list of health problems and, waiting on me, is not helping him.   ",

For those who have had problems with chemo, I'm so sorry. I have had so many SEs that have been so bad, I've seriously considered calling this all off. I told my family at the very beginning that I wasn't real sure if I wanted to do chemo and the 4 AC DD infusions have led me to question if I made the right decision in the beginning or not. And I'm not done. I have 12 weekly Taxol facing me. I was supposed to have a normal 2 week time span between the last AC and the first Taxol but my labs changed that. Everything was bad so I had another week delay. I'm scheduled for Taxol #1 on Tuesday if my Monday labs are improved enough. These three weeks I've felt like I was in a pit. My energy level is still at zero, and my mouth is still messed up, too. FIngers still have blisters and feet are trying to heal but only a little progress there. My vision is so bad, too, in addition to the dry eye/watering. Anyone else have that? Blurry no matter how many pair of old glasses I go back and try. I had foot neuropathy before this started so I can't tell if it's worse or not. I assume the Taxol will show me. However this finds you today, ladies, we are all warriors. The fight is real. The enemy is real and ferocious. May you be able to rest on this Saturday so as to fight another day. Best wishes, barbarau55 ",

I apologize again for the lapses in my contributions to being your cheerleader. You all do amaze me, however. One thing: BC makes us all stronger! I have finished all treatments. I say that with complete confidence because, come what may, I will not do THIS again. I did not do chemo well. I did not do surgery well. And I did not do radiation well. So if there is a recurrence, so be it. I've told my SLGD (sweet little girl doctor--local), my children, my hubby, and my small circle of friends. During this 14 month process, I had complications with every stage, delaying the next one, so I know I'm more apt to face this again. But, as I said, so be it. I have lost two brothers. My baby brother Jan 21, 2017 and my next younger brother Aug 21, 2017. Heartache on heartache. Only those who have furr-babies will appreciate it, but we lost one of our miniature schnauzers on July 21, 2017, also. My boobs came off Dec 21, 2016. I think I hate the 21st, ladies. I've been deeply depressed but just in the last few days I am feeling some lifting of depression. The change of physical seasons seems to be bringing me a change of emotional seasons as well. I am doing some writing and I bake bread for a weekly meal served to Children's Ministry workers at my church so I'm trying to find ways to be more involved again. In early January 2018 we will become great grandparents for the first time. A little girl named Olivia is expected by our only granddaughter and her husband. So there are some bright sparkles in the future. My prayer for you all is that you stay strong in this fight, that your families are well and that whatever comes next, we have endured together and are better for it. blessings, barbara",

A friend who walked this road 3 years ago brought me the most amazing treat. I want to share it with you (maybe I'm way behind on this). Blue Bunny brand sherbet cups. They come 10 in a package - the one she brought me, anyway! They are \"swirled\" with different flavors so they are both delicious and beautiful! Eaten with a plastic spoon, I can almost forget my troubles. Let me know if any of you are already on to this treat -- as well as those who give it a try! These are the last few days of my 2nd round. I fought the battle with the \"Puke Faerie\" this round and won. So my earlier days were better in that regard. Now there are new battles to wage. I am SO TIRED! I don't know how you younger ladies with families/children do it, and how anyone trying to work manages. My hat is off to you -- oops, no, I'd rather keep one on these days. =D But the fatigue is just overwhelming. I am a doer so this is so confining. Looking at 4 more months of it leaves me bewildered. I feel totally useless. I suppose everyone got the same information regarding SEs: there's something for everything but the FATIGUE!. My other big issue in the past week has been mouth sores. I have to admit I did not do the \"3 x a day rinse\" like I was advised (by my friend) and now I'm paying the price. I have 3 fingernail size \"canker sores\" on the left side of my throat starting just behind my wisdom tooth and my tongue has a few \"hotspots.\" I started the rinse three days ago. I will continue it. I am fortunate to already have in my arsenal the \"magic mouth\" stuff. I had canker sores that popped up right after my port was placed because mid-surgery I went from a MAC (monitored anesthesia) to general which requires the mouth/breathing tube apparatus Everywhere it touched \"skin\" left a whopper canker sore. This little fiasco and coming down with a fullblown \"sinus infection/cough/fever/just feeling horrible\" delayed my first Chemo by a week. I was given the Magic Mouth mixture which is 1: Lidocaine 1: Benadryl 1: Mylanta. It masks the pain, rather than completely alleviates it. but it does help. (I think I got sick because of the stress, the new diagnosis, not sleeping well, trips back and forth for tests/appointments etc. It'a a three hour one-way drive to the cancer center/breast care center/etc ) The body can only hold up so long before something gives. I hated not starting treatments on time but I think it was a good decision looking back now. My labs this week were horrible--so much that I need lots of improvement to do the next one. I go Monday for the lab and then the Onco RN will call that afternoon to tell me if we're a go for Tuesday. Praying I will be. I don't want this to drag out longer than it already looks (for-ever)! This has kept me shut-in pretty much. Lots of stomach bug going around our little community so my DH's doctor told him at his appointment to consider our home a prison--nobody comes in or goes out, and to speak on cellphones looking through our front glass door! He was really serious. So guess I am, too. That means no church again for us. These people are the ones keeping me going with their prayers so I had to send an email today with my specific \"requests\" for tomorrow. Praying for all of you dear ladies, barbarau55   ",

I've seen it on this thread but just want to reiterate about using Claritan if one is taking Neulasta after chemo. I have not had any of the bone pain and hate to hear how bad some have it. I don't understand how that little pill can help, but God, Thank You, that it does. I just took #3 AC treatment Tuesday. I was short on my zofran pills (until I got them reordered) so I didn't take them the way my oncologist had instructed after #2. I did so well then and now this time, I'm back to feeling \"gaggy.\" Yesterday (Day 2) I felt badly from the \"gaggy-ness\" and was so tired. There has been no pattern to my SEs. Each time has been different. (Fresh fruit seems to be the one thing that nearly always tastes good.) I am using my mouth rinse faithfully. Would rather not go through the mouth sores again. I too have experienced eye problems. I have psoriatic arthritis and my eyes have been involved as much as joint/back pain. The steroid pre-treat has done away with any body pain, but the eyes are still driving me crazy. They were under control til all this started. I have used the eye drops for it and am trying to get a refill through my regular doctor. With the encouragement of my younger son, I am writing a blog about this \"season of my life.\" Much like what we share here, I am finding it therapeutic. Ladies, I send you all best wishes and prayers for the journey! Thanks for sharing your lives. ",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2017 09:52PM - edited Feb 8, 2017 09:53PM by barbarau55 Sorry, I've been detained yet again. I know I sound like a broken record--I have felt like one, too. To recap, I had bilateral mastectomy Dec 21, 2016 and went back to see my surgeon 15 days later. One look and he was not happy. Necrotic tissue on my right side. He did a \"procedure\" right then in the exam room. Removed all the stitches on that side and packed and dressed it. Fortunately I've not had much feeling so I tolerated it well. He ordered a wound vac and a week later I went back to his office (it's nearly 3hrs one way) to get it started. Fortunately our little local hospital is able to do dressing changes for it in between visits to surgeon. Our DON is actually specialized in wound vac therapy so I am in good hands. Next visit to see surgeon and (you may have already guessed) there were two more places not healing well on my left side. So now there are three wounds. Two that my DH is acting as RN for and cleaning and redressing in between hospital visits for wound vac care. On those days the sweet nurses take care of everything. DH has always had a queasy stomach about bodily functions so this has pushed the envelope for him. But now he can restart a beeping wound vac (that's the alarm that goes off whenever therapy has stopped) and can change out a canister (of nasty vile STINKY stuff) quick as the nurses. We are now one month down the road with wound vac (and other dressings) therapy. I AM healing and, according to local nurses, spectacularly. That's good to hear because I was told we can't even think about radiation therapy until this is all healed up. I did call my new oncologist (to recap: other MO kicked me to the curb and stopped chemo way early in November) and he was upset to hear of complications following surgery but did start me on the \"5 year pill\" during this interim time. Last hospital dressing change there were \"bumps\" under the top dressing--all new--this upset the nurse. She called my SLGD (sweet little girl doctor) who was seeing patients in the clinic to come see it. Nurse thought it might be start of an infection and took swabs for a culture. My SLGD came from clinic (I have dressing changes done in ER at hospital--fortunately everything is under a common roof) and she agreed to the culture but she thinks I've developed a skin sensitivity to the adhesive top dressing. To be sure, though, she will be called over to see how it looks for my next two dressing changes. I have phenomenally bad \"luck\" physically, but I am so blessed with the people who are taking care of me. In fact, with the exception of the first MO, everyone has been awesome. On January 21, I got a call from my middle brother (I'm oldest of 4 children, only girl) to tell me our baby brother (59) had had a massive heart attack and passed away. It was totally unexpected. I have BC and my next oldest brother has end-stage COPD so a death in the family is not out of the question. But our baby brother. Absolutely heartbroken. So we've had a funeral and our lives go on . . . for now. But things will never be the same. ",

I have a number of SEs, one being hand-foot syndrome. Blisters on feet and hands, especially fingertips. Fingers swollen double in size. Very painful and keeps me away from the computer. Still suffering badly with mouth sores. I took acyclovir for a week but it didn't seem to help much and the rebound when I finished has been horrible. Even drinking water is too painful, let alone eating. I finally went to see my sweet-little-girl doctor aka SLGD (local/not in with cancer center 3 hours away) and she was appalled at all the SEs I'm fighting. She is looking into a yeast connection because I have never kicked the sinus infection that delayed my first chemo 2 months ago. I cough at night so badly (even with Bromfed Cough Syrup) that I can't sleep. You know THAT doesn't help. My SLGD also gave me two \"paste\" prescriptions, both the same basic med just in different forms: one for mouth sores and one for hand-foot areas. The mouth one helps but you have to stay on top of using it--it wears off. She also started me on Vit B6. Says she can't promise anything but said it couldn't hurt to try since I'm already so miserable. I too fight the watery eyes. Nothing seems to help. So depressed. Fatigue adds a whole new level to SEs. I had tinnitus before this began but it's changed. I hear my heartbeat LOUDLY, all the time. And this time I had no \"good days.\" Tomorrow I do my first Taxol (1 of 12 weekly) and dread what I have to look forward to. No recuperation time between them (my ACs were every two weeks). And since I never got to feel even sort of normal after AC #4. DH is not well either. His platelets are constantly too low. Now he is scheduled for bone marrow/bone biopsy in two weeks. He's always been the \"sick one\" in our family and I've always been the caregiver. Trying to switch roles is as painful as anything. Tomorrow is our 51st anniversary. Whoo hoo! Well, I'm headed to the hospital lab for weekly bloodwork. Take care, ladies. barbarau55 ",

I have not been good at keeping up routinely but when I do play \"catch up,\" I am amazed at your tenacity and your strength. So many stories. So many busy lives. Families and work. Struggles and additional physical illnesses. What complex beings we are. You are all incredible and I am humbled to be a part of this group. To recap, I am still healing after the complications of bilateral mastectomy surgery Dec 21, 2016. In January necrotic tissue had to be removed from both sides and a wound vac was placed on the larger wound right side. It was used for nine weeks until the depth of the wound would no longer accept it. But now a month later, healing is still not complete enough to start radiation. It's been nine months since my diagnosis, so this has been a long drawn out process. I have ceased to be surprised by any delay. It seems to be the norm rather than the opposite. Hair regrowth is happening but not in any attractive fashion. We have two mini-schnauzers and I seem to be favoring their hair-do's. Both in color and style. I am grey and white and longer on the back and sides than the top and crown. It has no body but it doesn't appear to be the \"pig-bristle grey\" I had in much smaller quantity before losing it all to chemo. I take Letrozole for my \"five year pill.\" I notice I have hot flushes again. I am well past menopause so thought this was a thing of the past. Occasionally I have taste issues but usually not too bad or for too long. My MO has alerted me to possible SE of joint stiffness upon arising but that it should loosen up as the morning progresses. So far I haven't noticed that. I have psoriatic arthritis so I'm aware of such things. I'm getting back to a mild exercise program. Treadmill for 20 minutes and recumbent bike for 15 minutes each day gives me a nice uplift. I can do both regardless of weather conditions and in the safety of my own home. To you dear ladies, I send my best wishes. Thank you for writing your stories. I will probably be more attentive (at least to reading) as I begin the radiation portion soon (I hope). Blessings, one and all.",

But I was near death at one point and really didn't feel like writing anything down. A quick run-down of where I've been: 1. Had 3 packed cell transfusions (1 at the end of Oct before hospitalization-2 while hospitalized in Nov). 2. My SLGD (sweet little girl doctor---local) saw me slipping away and cultured the crud in my lungs that I'd had since before I started chemo in early Aug, and caught that it was HIB. Yes, like babies get (vaccinated against). My oncologist had pooh-poohed my chest problems/green snot and phlegm as \"allergies\" for over two months. SLGD shut down chemo at the cancer center. 3. Went into local hospital Oct 30 from an ER visit for \"an overnight observation\" and didn't get out til Nov 3. Had the last two transfusions and (big gun) IV antibiotics while there. 4. Saw oncologist Nov 9 for what was supposed to be a routine check in with him before Taxol #3. He acted shocked that I had needed blood transfusions AND that I'd had HIB and been hospitalized. Now the truth was: I KNOW he was called and DID NOT RESPOND. He said, \"Well you're done. No more chemo for you.\" I asked what it would mean to have only 2 Taxol treatments instead of the planned 12 (following 4 AC treatments I had completed earlier) and he flippantly said, \"It means your cancer will return more quickly.\" That sucked the air out of the room. My kids and husband were there with me. He shook hands all around and left the room. We huddled in the cancer center's lobby. Family was furious. I was in shock. 5. Called my SLGD's office on the road home. She worked us in the next afternoon. End result was she got me in to see HER breast care provider for 2nd opinion. THAT oncologist was SO good to us--spent 1.5hrs going over everything then giving me options. 6. Called surgeon who had placed my port, set up consult (we agreed on bilateral mastectomy and he wanted to do it as soon as possible since I'd been more than 8 weeks out of chemo--and had begun to feel almost human) So surgery done Dec 21. Home the next day. 7. Feeling crappy again due to surgery. Drain tubes are so sore and getting stinky (we empty and record, btw). Scheduled to revisit surgeon this Thursday--2 wks and 1 day post surgery. Hair is beginning to be scruffy. Finally not itchy. Had some nausea since surgery so food is not a comfort yet. And the tenderness of areas most affected by surgery--well, it's pretty awful. Hoping he will remove the tubes Thursday. I am so sore. I walk like the Green Hulk so as not to \"touch\" any more than possible. My pathology reports are back and surgeon got \"all clean edges.\" He even called me at home midafternoon (Saturday) Christmas Eve to give me that \"present.\" We like him. But in order to do that--and I'm not looking to do any reconstruction--it meant \"scooping\" out the boobs. My chest is concave and very ugly. Swelling and bruising are still visible. And I still have to do 6 weeks (5 a week) radiation down the road. But the oncologist I saw for the 2nd opinion is going to order it for me so I can do it closer to home and be home every night. Hurray! And I won't have to see the other oncologist ever again!! So the new year is here and I'm boobless, with a scruff of hair. Hurting like a big dog but cancer free and thankful to be this far along. Ladies, I will spend some time soon reading the thread that I've missed. Thanks for not kicking me to the curb (for poor participation) like I felt my original oncologist did. Here's to US! 2017 is OUR year. To regain our health, our physical strength, get a renewed vision for what we want to accomplish. Kiss your family (and your furr-baby or babies) and know I'm onboard with you again. Blessings, barbara",

I've toted this \"knot\" for a while and, because I was busy taking care of my husband (who has lots of physical issues himself) I ignored it. Until it began to show on the outside. So . . . I am stage 3b, ductal invasive with at least 2 lymph nodes completely gone over to the dark side. Because of all the conditions I start with, my oncologist and surgeon agreed I needed aggressive chemo before surgery. Port placed 8/5/16 and ACT is my poison. Four rounds of AC at 2 week intervals, then 12 weekly Taxol rounds. Five months. Then surgery. Then more chemo and likely some radiation, too. Today my husband sheared my head. My hair was always short but this is really a downer. I have a wig--my daughter was way out front on that--but I can't get excited about it. Today I have a soft cap on and a blue scarf tied around it. Going to take our daughter and son-in-law to dinner to celebrate their 15th anniversary later today. Will be interesting. First round of AC I became really sick with nausea. I followed the protocol I was given about which anti-nausea pill to take and when but never got on top of it. Puked my socks up for a solid week. Got some relief the 2nd week and then back for Chemo #2. A visit with the oncologist before the 2nd round meant telling how bad I'd felt and he lined out a whole new regimen to stop the nausea before it began. Following it I have had relief. No actually puking this time although the feeling of nausea is never completely gone. And the tiredness. It permeates every thing but my actual sleep. I believe my nausea is related to the tiredness, too. If I get too tired, the \"Puke Faerie\" is in the background, taunting me. But Zofran has become my best friend. And . . . so far, so good. Ladies, I wish you all well and hope to tag along on this forum as we pass through this trial together. ",

My eye drops for PA are steroid, so they are short-use (less than 10 days, four times a day). I worked in a school nurse's office before retiring so I also have \"regular pink-eye\" (bacteria caused) drops, too. I have messed with my horrendously blood-sot, overly wet eyes from almost the beginning of chemo, so last week I decided maybe (by rubbing, washing, treating) it changed to bacteria-based. I switched to those eye drops but today I'm back to Lotomax (steroid). I think tonight there is a little improvement. But I've thought that before. We'll see. You're right, reading is almost out of the question. I work remotely for my CPA son on the computer and that has been difficult, too. Fortunately I have a great \"Boss,\" so I can work when I feel like it and rest when I need to. JANDJ: Your pictures are awesome. You will ROCK the wig/scarf - whatever you choose! VLH: Whoa, Girl! I'm no expert but I think you need more information. Can you get another opinion? You have SO much going on and there is so much at stake. Prayers for you. Also, if you're \"puking,\" you need to have help with that. That takes too much out of you and they should be able to help--I had the same problem after Chemo #1 and my MO gave me new instructions in how to use the \"prevent nausea\" pills. It has really helped me. Stay strong, Ladies!",

Well, I've put off another week seeing my surgeon (whose word will trigger the start of radiation) because I was given \"the power\" to decide how near completely healed I thought I was. I have cancelled and rescheduled two weeks now and, hopefully this week I will proceed with appointment as scheduled and surgeon will agree that we are finally a GO! I saw my MO last month and he left it to the surgeon's discretion. I live 4 hours from MO and 3 hours from surgeon and 1.5 hours from radiation facility. I'm kind of in the middle of a triangle from all three, actually. Hey, maybe I'm in the Bermuda Triangle and that's why all this stuff is happening to me. Maybe I'm just nuts, huh. What do you think? I'm old and forgetful and really truly could hide my own Easter eggs and then squeal delightedly when (and if) I could find them. Wanta be friends? VLH, I'm so sorry your journey has been delayed even longer. Hopefully you will be back on target soon. It does feel like forever though, doesn't it? Good wishes coming your way from me. We'll just play tag while others race by, ha! Dara, I'm so glad you are having less joint pain. That's got to be the pits! You deserve to leave that by the wayside and sprint to the finish. And Cali--you mean we aren't always on an emotional roller coaster? I can bawl at the drop of a hat and the next minute the saddest thing won't even phase me. It's like my \"meter\" is off, like way off. I only had 2 of 16 proposed Taxol treatments so I don't think I can blame it on that. Again, it may be that Bermuda Triangle thing. I may have to try that \"blame thing\" out on some other people and see if it plays well. Seriously, ladies, I want to wish all of you a blessed Easter. If you worship in some other way, then may you find peace and contentment for your soul in that. blessings, barbarau",
