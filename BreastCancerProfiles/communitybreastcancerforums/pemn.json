Tomorrow morning I'm going in for ultrasound and probable biopsy following MRI report of suspicious mass in left breast. My mom had BC about 10 yrs ago, so I'm also high risk. I'm scared, too. Anyway, I will keep you in my prayers. New mantra learned here from you...B9, B9, B9, B9....   Take care!",
