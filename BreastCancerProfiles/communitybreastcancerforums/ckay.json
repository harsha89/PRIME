      "Content": "ckay wrote: i was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with invasive cancer. the pathology report states that the affected area (one lump apparent) is 1.1 cm in size, stage 1, without apparent lymphatic involvement. my doctors and friends are suggesting that mastectomy is the best surgery to reduce risk of recurrence. after reading the materials available on this web site, i thought a lumptectomy with radiation would be sufficient unless subsequent pathology shows more involvement than the first analysis. how can i decide what is best for me? also is there any information which really defines risk of recurrence?
