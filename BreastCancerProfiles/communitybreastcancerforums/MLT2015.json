About a month ago I was doing a self breast exam and found a lump in my right breast. The next day I called my doctor to schedule an appointment. I couldn't get in for about 3 weeks. My appointment was this past Monday (7/18). The doctor did a breast exam and said he thought that it was probably fibrocystic change, but he wanted to do an ultrasound just to make sure, and depending on what was seen possibly a mammogram as well. I had a bilateral ultrasound while in his office. I got a phone call on Wednesday (7/20) to schedule a mammogram for Friday (7/22). I had my mammogram yesterday afternoon. I was told by the technician that the mammogram would probably be read that afternoon, and results should be available soon after via the online patient portal. I checked this morning and here is what the report said: MG FFD DIAGNOSTIC TOMO CAD BILATERAL CLINICAL INDICATION: N63 unspecified lump in breast COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Bilateral MLO, ML and CC views of the breasts. Breast Tomosynthesis and CAD. FINDINGS: BREAST COMPOSITION: The breast tissue is scattered fibroglandular density. MASS: There is a slightly irregular nodule in the 12:00 position of the right breast. This corresponds with the area of clinical concern. I do not see radiographic evidence of malignancy in the left breast. CALCIFICATIONS: No suspicious calcifications. ARCHITECTURAL DISTORTION: No architectural distortion. IMPRESSION: 1. I do not see radiographic evidence of malignancy in the left breast. 2. Abnormal soft tissue density seen in the 12:00 position of the right breast. Surgical consultation is suggested. SUMMARY: BI-RADS 4 - Suspicious finding- Surgical consultation and/or biopsy should be considered. A negative mammogram should not preclude biopsy of a palpable lesion since mammography may be negative in 15 to 20% of cases of carcinoma. I'm optimistic by nature, and have been trying not to worry too much or fall down a rabbit hole looking for information on the internet. I think I had myself convinced this would be over after the mammogram. I haven't heard from my doctor yet about a biopsy. I'm assuming they were already closed by the time they received the report. It was late Friday afternoon when I went, and I'm sure they'll call Monday. My question is, when they call, are there any questions I should ask about the results of the mammogram? Thanks again!
