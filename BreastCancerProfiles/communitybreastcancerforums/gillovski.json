I'll continue to have them done in Jordan when I visit!    Actually you have a point about does my GP know I had BC before.  I only signed up with this practice when I moved back to UK and away from my \"home base\", my Father's. His Doc knew me and I was registered with his practice (if I needed anything it was tho private), It may be as it was so long ago 95, the current GP does not know.  Can't remember if I mentioned it to him, altho I  did mention my Mother simply as he knows my other current issue is possibly an inherited condition from my Mother - chronic pancreatitis!   Interesting Roseamy, that you also have US as well as mammogram.  Never had that here in UK, (Dorchester).  Also no self referral.  Maybe worth checking that also.  Well thismornign I am off to X ray and see the result of that. If neg then I will suggest a bone scan.",

For example my consultant for another problem is in Poole. Blood tests etc are carried out at Dorchester, BUT Poole cannot access the Dorchester systems to see results. They are faxed!  Maybe all these discrepancies will be sorted with the proposed Cameron shake up and reorganisation.  However, having worked in NHS back in '76.... and the various reorganisations made  then.. I doubt it!  Anyway, back to GP.  I did mention and he concurred that he took on board my BC history. I also informed him that my Mother had BC and then bone CA, specifically ribs.  Had an X Ray y'day, but 7 - 10 days for result.. which I find amazing but I would assume if there was anything untoward on that XR, then I would rcv faster notification.  It is just that one has to wonder what the persistant ache/bruised feeling is...",

I am 57 yrs old. Having previously had BC I find this amazing.  But even if I had not, I still find it amazing... 2 friends had BC, one in UK where it was diagnosed too late.. the GP kept treating it as mastitis.  Eventually, it was a locum who was alarmed and sent her to hospital immediately...she only survived 5 months, 44 yrs old,  leaving a 6 yr old son.    My other friend lived in Jordan and went each year for mammograms and U/S.  At that time both of us lived 4 hr drive away from the radiologist, so as my friend happened to be there albeit a couple of months early for her regular appt, she had the exam.  A lump was found, operated on and she had chemo and RT.  If she had been in the UK, she too would have been a mere statistic.  5 years is too long.  For me, I return to Jordan regularly, so I will continue to get check ups yearly in Jordan, 5 yrs in UK is TOO LONG.
