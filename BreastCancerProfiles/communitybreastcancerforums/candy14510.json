(elma? something like that). So the next thing i remember is in the recovery room 8pm that night....crazy how you have no idea of time...that was nice!!  I did will Wed am....then becasue i was under so long, I developed seriouse gas problems...the pain made me nausas...having my belly cut from one hip to the other...throwing up...not good!! My caregivers were awsome!!! So helpful too!!!  Saturday I woke up @ 3 am.....and started texting everyone, that it was amazing but I felt great and was ready to go home!!!  I was amazed at how that hump ended and started so quickly. If it were just my breast, I would say, it would have have been the experience that I had....I think most of you are NOT having DIEP....so you really have nothing to worry about!!  My husband has been awesome....says I look great, even though I feel like Frankinstien!!  I've been up today since 6:30 am went to lay down for an hour once and besides feeling tight in the chest and tummy, I really feel good!!!!!  I did get my pathology report, haven't digested it yet...my one lymp node, was initially was \"clear\"....but  they ran more test and found Micro...things....my surgeon said its was 4.1 cm...larger then thought, but all margins were \"Clean\"....I will meet the oncologist in a couple weeks....I wanted to take one thing at a time....healing now....then figure chemo into the factor.  Sorry standing and typing...so I'm going to go for now.......sorry for typo's!!!!  Good luck to you all!!  I just want to say \"I'm GLAD IT's OUT!!!\"",

To All: I know our immune system is compromised during chemo....Have  you all had oncologist telling you to use disposable applicators for all your make up??  The look good, feel good program, was addiment about that!!!  I am a freak about germs anyway....lots of hand sanitizer.....but that seems too extreme..it's not someone elses make up its my own!!!!

I told you all about my boss at work...well it got better on my first offical day i the office for a meeting with everyone.....he quit!!!! We all started this office together....2 other great co-workers quit that day as well...and our previous head guy quite a couple months ago....there is something going on....So some advised to go on medical leave...i'm close to my LTD because I was out for 2 month already....The stress of everything...work, cancer...Hair...my blood pressure has always been low....last 2 treatments 155/105, 144/98....I a taking Blood Pressure meds now as well and monitoring my readings a couple times a day.  Without the worries of work....I can consentrate on me....not my sales ranking and wether I'm not going to have a job!!!  My HR person...told me after FLMA if I do not come back....I will have \"Voluntarily\" left the company and I will have to \"Re-Appy\".....I broke down....that sound too crazy!!! Called an attorney and she said it is correct for FLMA...HOWEVER....I am know protected by the \"Disablities Act\"....so they are a large enough company, that they should beable to make resonable accomidations for me.  However, they may still take my salary away when I do come back and I would have to file for unemployment......That's why my blood pressure is HIGH!!!

Gjlanders: So happy you can go to Rome!!! Enjoy!!! Lynn: Did you Shave or buzz your hair???  Mine is buzzed but has been coming out a lot!!! Lots of bald spots developing....what did you use if you shaved it ALL OFF???? I really want to do it...my scalp doesn't hurt anymore...just short hairs are annoying everywhere! Diane48 and Pam, welcome and good luck with your first treatments....don't overwhelm your self with possiable side effect....just let them come as they come....(well except the hair...I had a hard time with that, as you may have read!!)  I hardley had any SE worth mentioning....the OC remainded me that it should be identical to the first...except I will probley be more tired as i hit 2, 3, 4 of AC....thoughts and prayers!!!! Tom: Daine is strong...as other mentioned, it gives her the control over this....I was adiment about buzzing it.....people were like, why....I later was on line to a website for hair loss...they said the exact same thing....good for her...and good for you for being such a good support for her!!!  My husband  does ok too......however he did have a wierd delayed reaction to me not working for 8 more month!!! I do get 60% of my earnings through LTD....so that shoudl still work...I know its the money thing for him....but he's over it now!!!  He tell's me how beautiful I am with no hair...I'm like right!!!  But he's very sincere!!! Good-Luck!! Caroyln: Saved you for last!!!  I has cancer in one breast and made the decsision to have both removed....While it is completely an INDIVIDUAL personal experiece, I want to share with you why I had both removed.  My grandmother had breast cancer in one, this was the 70's(long ago before great meds)...was treated and some years later got it again in her other breast and passed away, becasue she went untreated...hated chemo!!!  That tells me in my fam history, that there is a strong possiablilty for me.  My beleif is \"Hit me with all you got\"  Whatever I can do with meds, surg and rad's....I will do to lessin that chance of this EVER coming back.  My surgeon never pushed...but after he told me that if i was his wife, that is what he would tell her to do!!!! Now...cosmetically there is an advantage too....I had the DIEP...they take tummy fat and recreat NEW breast.....so the will be the same size and texture....once i'm done with all my chemo and rads....he will lift, size and put the finishing touches on them....42 flat stomanch and great boobs!!!!  Again it is a personal decision, i just wanted to share with you why i did it....I'm soo happy about that decision!!!  Good Luck and let me know if you have any other questions!!!

A/C 3x4 and Taxol 1x12...so far for me things have really been great....3-4 days of being tired, slight headach and food turned my stomach...no vomitting....food didn't look good at all!!!  After that completely normal!! Was working out....running.  Then day 14....HAIR!!!  You start to think your normal and then reality sets in....your bald and everyone knows your sick, including yourself everytime you look in the mirror!!!  Did i say I was having a tough time with the hair?????  Anyway good luck Thursday, I'm sure it will be fine!!! Carolyn, I did searching online about hair coloring.....couldn't find anything about waiting a year!!! I'm going to ask my OC on thursday....My hairdresser said a couple months.....once your regualar hair comes in...not the first hiar....it should be fine.  I will have to check more into it. Diane, glad I could be of help....as you can see today...i'm the one needing some incouragement!!! I am having girls come over wednesday and we are going to play with the scarves and see if there is some style I can be comfortable with. Do you notice you see everyones hair now....I was jealouse of a girl who had cute hair...and thought....what would you look like with out hair???????? Not as pretty im sure!!!!  I will get over it....just not today!!!! Hey do any of you know on the Herceptin.....is that every week????  That's what I saw on line today...I thought it was every 3 weeks????

I had minimal side effects...slight headache (took Extra strength Tylenol) did take EMEND...that explained my dizzyness, as its a side effect. was sent home Prochlorperazine and Lorazepam...to take as needed....Lorazepam is also an anti-anxioty med...so they said to take if I had problems sleeping too...Day 2 and 3...TIRED....slight nausea...not throwing up...food just didn't look good...little foggy.  By day 4...Normal!!!  Walked 2 miles...Day 5..walked 2 miles...Yesterday RAN 3....!!!! I felt to Liberated...I cant even tell you!!!  I felt like \"Rocky\" running up those stairs in the movie....raising his arms over his head.....I DID THAT!!!  To kicking Cancer is the A??!!!! My husband, is like are you sure your allowed to do that??  My doc said so what ever your body allows you to do!!!  I have been Really drinking my WATER!!! I do probley double the 8 glasses aday...i'm doing about 16...FLUSH, FLUSH, FLUSH the system!!!  I couldn't eat well the first few days, so I bought \"Ensure\" for the protien, but my girlfriend toold me about \"Muscle Milk-Lite\" 100 calories and 15 grams of Protien!!!  I have also been taking \"Centrum-Silver\"...yeah I'm 42(next week) and I'm taking \"Silver\"!!! Just lots of Fruit too!!!  Just HOPING...this will all continue!!!  And my Doctor said, your first cycle, will reflect how your others will go....Only build up is \"Fatigue\"!!!  I'm going with that!!! Did get my hair cut yesterday...Thought it was going to be more dramatic....but my hair dresser is awesome....she gave me a very cute Pixie Cut....I think it looks a little like \"Kate + 8\"....SOOO CUTE!!!! anyway, I will only have it for a week or two...but I think it will cut down on the anxioty of 10\" hair falling out!!!  And Hey....Maybe I will be that 2%, that doesn't loose your hair???!!! Wishful thinking....but you never know!!!  I have a wig I got for Free, thru a progam at the hospital.  I also bought about 20 scarves....so I'm prepared physically....just not mentally!!! Good Luck Ladies and stay positive.....This will all be over sooner then we ever thought....I know I have 6 months of this...Nov 6th is my last treatment...seems long....but in the end it's only 6 months out of my life to ensure, this NEVER comes back!!!!!

Yes....however what if there was cancer somewhere else....I couldn't have handled that....I wanted to deal with one thing at a time.   The scan came back negative, which was a releif....I just couldn't do it prior. Anna, I am soooo glad to hear taxol and herceptin are treating you well.   Really, I am so nervous, even though everyone says it's easier then AC.  I too felt that AC, was tolerable, until the end and it became worse, but overall the SE were miniimal.  I'm just try to figure out how this is going to work, every week......do you constantley feel bad, dizzy, icky.....with something planned alsmost every weekend!!!! Please keep me posted!!! Pam, I really hope you feel well after your 4th AC and can enjoy the trip!!!  You have a sweet man to have planned a celebration trip!!! Stay Strong!!! Polly",

I wish I could say it will get better....but we know that until it's over, we are stuck in it....and I know tired of it, forsure!!!!! Suzie, I too like to be in my own bed...and tobe around someone who is so negative.....you made the right decision...you need positve people around you!!!! Last week was my bad week.....once I get my first Taxol under my belt, I will beable to see the end insight....it's just this 1/2 way mark, knowing another 3 months of this crap!!! Good news though, 2 weeks today I fly to Texas to see my son graduate from Air Force basic training....we are going to go to Corpus Christi for a few days, then back to San Antoino....hopefully I will get some inspriration from the \"Alamo\".....!!!! Pam, I hope your are surviving your 4th and Last AC.....I too am skeptical of the Taxol, but jsut as I approached AC....I will wait and see....I can't think of the possiable SE....just wait and see....maybe I will be lucky and it will be abreeze.....I certainly hope so, since I will be an Vacation in 2 weeks...for a week....not feeling well and being away from home...not my favorite thing....I like my own bed!!!! Tom, sorry to hear about your son....I can only imagine how difficult that had to be....but I'm sure as you said, the right dscn!!! I'm glad that I don't have to be in that position....I will be begging my son to come home since he will be stationed who knows where and will have to go to Kuwait or Afganistan in a year or so.  Hope Diane is doing better. Tom, how has Daine's hemoglobin been throughout this???  I know that is the \"energy\"....Mine is naturally high...and has remained high....I have only been tired  upto 6 days out of AC....then normal....I know as you do more of the Taxol, that will build....just curious.  My hemoglobin started in the 15's...dropped to 14. pjkappel are you taking taxol every week or every 2 weeks??  Sorry if I missed that. Sorry about yoru leg pains as well.  I ran 3 miles 4 times last week....I'm hoping to beable to run a couple times a week when on taxol....but the joint pain could hamper that....I feel so....whimpy...my muscle mass has practically vanished from my arms...I was at the docs office and he was checking my blood pressure....I'm like...where did it all go....so to run, I feel at least im keeping my legs strong....however, I can not run as fast or as far....but at least I get out there!!!!!! by the way....my hair \"fuzzies\" have also grown...... Alright....going to American Idol concert tomorrow, day before my 1st Taxol. Hopefully Friday I will feel good enough to go the \"Great Get together.....The Minnesota State Fair\".....Cheese Curds.....Fried Ice Cream....and maybe a beer....of course the people watching is the best!!!!  Good Luck Ladies and thank you agian for all your support!!!

I left my first ONC, because he left it up to me!!!!  They are the professionals.....They tell YOU....and may say there are options....but they tell you waht they think is the best!!!! DiDi, Diane Icmag-  Congrats to ALL of us.....YES I am DONE!!!!! Interesting with the Rads....Met with my Rad Onc.....Head of the Universtity of Minnesota....I'm looking at your diagnosies....and see some intersting things.....1st...I am IIb, Stg 3, 4.2 cm, ER/PR-, HER2+.....My 1st onc said., NO Rads....When I got my 2nd (from the U of M)...she thought YES, but would talk to others...a couple weeks in she said YES, becasue I am 1/1 for nodes....wierd I know but in surgery they took my Main Node and it was Negative in the OR...later test showed...minsuel cancer....too late to take more, not worth it either, according to docs....however, that left me in a wierd situtation...they didn't know forsure if the other nodes where infected....they ALL guessed and \"thought\" NO....well that's not good enough for my ONC and Rad Onc....so Diane, I see you have Neg in nodes and 2cm...Im glad they are doing it...and airing on the side of caution is defintaley good and a must for all we have been through!!! DiDi and Icmag,k didn't see your size....but clearly we are all going throught Rads too. I start next Tuesday...my counts have been good...and I have Mexico....so 25 at 200 vs 30 at 180..have a CT also for a small Node in my lung, less then a cm...many have these ...my mom and my sister did/do ahve them, so nothing to worry, just checking it.  I was surprised on the info I got yesterday....I thought because of my Bi-Lat Mx...that I would only have rads in my arm pit area.....WRONG......whole breast, arm pit and upper colar bone area.  3 small tat's only a poke of a needle...tiny freckle. My PS thought, because my ONC told me, no breast would be radiated...Oops...It make sence when she told me WHY, and clearly I  just dont want this to EVER come back....but part of my lungs, close to my heart (but not the nodes by my heart...it's controversial....and Chemo is hard enough on your heart...so just very close)...part of my tyroid....I was told by my Reg Onc I would n't have that and that is good not radiating your chest area...well that is not the case...so I cried a little...but realized I really didn't have a choice.... Intersted in your situations with rads...now that we are past the horriable chemo...I will be driving 50 miles...5 weeks....but I know i'm in good hands....My Rad Onc is meeting with her colleagues this am....to run my situtation past them, to see what they all think too....she called one yeasterday and they agreed with her....Keep in Mind..my first said NO to Rads.....crazy shit!!!! Good luck ladies, getting that last of Chemo crap out...and upward on onward to Rads...hoping they treat us all well!!!!! Polly",

It is a choice. pdaw - sorry for all the stuff happening this week, it does make it difficult to deal with your own, when so much is happening around you. Hope this week is better for you!!! amig1- sorry to hear about your meltdown....glad you got the courage up to go anyway!!!  I think all of our emotions are \"Normal\"...just not dwelling on it is \"Key\" and staying positive!!! Feeling ugly when looking in the mirrow is a very common accurance for me...it's just not the same staring at a bold person in the mirror.  I will soooo appreiciate my hair even more once it comes back!!!  Did I tell the story about my neighbor???  Many men have shaved heads now....I usually say...\"Oh, look....I look like you!!!\"....well my neighbor shot back....\"Polly, your hair will grow back...Mine WONT\".  He's right....I can hate it....but it will come back!!!! Met a woman at a local bar....myself just wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap....she told me her dad had stage 4 lympoma cancer last september.  Doc's said no chance, but we will make you comfortable. It had spread everywhere, but his brain and spinal cord.  He just finished in June and is in full remission!!!  Wouldn't you know he and his wife walked in shortly after...he is 79!!!  Hardley any side effects from chemo....had a full head of hair....looked so happy!!  He told me they \"Wrote my off\", but here I am!!!!  His daughter told me (which we all know)....being positve helped so much....her sisters where being negative...and she told them to stop it.  He was amazing!!!! Rinna- so sorry about your complications with your surgeries!!!  AND chemo....I'm soooooo Sorry you have to go through that too!!! I cant imagine!!! Hope it gets better for you!!! Keep in mind, the doctor at the end of all this will make your breast perfect!!! You have that right....my doc, when I asked when I could have the \"Finishing Touches\" done....He goes,\" Oh, you want that\"?....aahhhh, yeah!!!!  He will lift, put a small implant in if I need it once all the swelling is down....and YES they will be the same size and they will be perky!!!  I'm going to have the BEST 42 year old boobs around, damn it!!!! Bettina - Also sorry to hear about your SE with your chemo drug.  Everything I'm on is hard on my heart.  As long as you are healthy....you should be fine!!! Good luck with the new drug!  As I told Rinna, if we have to go through this, I personally am going to have the best boobs around.  For me, being bald and scared....I deserve to feel pretty....everyone is differnet....but getting older, we have seen things go south slowley over the years and if I can get those perky and lookin good....why not...and a flat tummy.....we deserve to have some good, posistive SE too.  It is however a personal decision.....I'm just sharing with you my rationalization of this whole thing!!!! 3rd AC of 4 this Friday....Good Luck to all who have treatments this week...hopw SE are all minimal!!!! My son leaves Tuesday for the Air Force.....I've been crying all morning!!!  I bring him down tomorrow and then we will see him off on Tuesday.....I'm soo happy for him, but am going to miss him soooo much!!! Sept 18th until I see him again.....That will put me OVER half way through this nightmare!!!! How crazy is that, that I'm gagging life by where I am in the treatment of all this!!!????? Polly",

A guy approached me the other day, overheard me talking to a mutal friend.  He has been doing a golf charity for the last 7 years...every year something diffferent, this year Breast Cancer....they have no employees that have had any health issuses this year, so he asked if I would take the proceeds from the tournament!!!!!  I didn't know what to say...i'm not used to taking things from people...it's not like i can't put food on the table....however not getting a pay check for 3 1/2 months, has been difficult...LTD helps, but is only 60% of my earnings....I did agree....sometimes we jsut need to take the help offered...It is an incrediable gesture and am very appreciative!!!!  Then my hair dresser said every october they have a breast cancer awareness week and collect donations....she told me it's not a lot, but had already decided that it was going to be given to me....very sweet!!!! Did I tell  you ladies about my HR dept, letting my go after my FLMA funs out the end of this month??  Well I call the dept of labor and was connected with a organization that works with \"American with Disablitlies Act\".....they told me I qualify for that and they have to give me a leave of absence as a \"Modification\"....it was funny in the email from HR...I mentioned ADA and doen'st that mean anything...she said NO.  Then I replied back to her with 2 eamil links that stated they have to comply....it was quit the Victory!!!!!! Good luck ladies...Hope all is well!!!! Polly",

I too shaved the fuzzies...with my husbands electric shaver...hair will not start offically growing back until I'm done with Taxol....fuzzies may grow....but not real hair!!!

Any questions you have, please ask!!!! I felt better knowing....having both removed, would put me at peace....my grandmother died of BC....but she could have survived.....she got it in one....10 yrs later in the other....She hated the chemo so much she refused it.....Personally going thru this....there have been times when I GET her ratioanlization of it.......I DONT want to go thru this agian.  However Carolyn it is toataly a personal decision!!! Good Luck...and please ask!!!! Read below as well...... PDAW- Read above as well.....so I dont' repeat myself and bore you. Here is how this all happened....My Doc/Surgeon....said here are your choices...you see my DX...I imediatley said BI-Lat.....He never incourgaged me....once I told him....he said...\"If you were my wife Polly....I would have her do the same thing\"......My best friend was DX 6 yrs ago.....never had to do chemo....but had a MX...single....she had the TRAM....it takes the muscle and puts it up in the breast area....complications down the road can be \"Hernias\"...simailar, but blugging  out in the stomach area.  She is completley happy....but ended up with an implant on the otherside, becasue they did not match.  The DIEP does not take muscle.....ONLY FAT!!!! Less downtime....it's amazing how they look...everyone looks at my breast, when I say I have BC....anyway,  had an excellent PC...ALL the docs comment about how great it looks....I have feeling that my girlfreind doesnt have....it was the best dscn I ever made.....and I can not wait until they \"fine tune\" the rest when I am done!!!!!  Please ask any questions.....I will even show you pics if you want....privately of course....Sorry to the Rads....My PS did have concern about having my procedure then possiabley having rads later....I cried and said this is what I wanted....he did it...and now he's so happy with his results...it's not a big deal that I will have rad later....potentaily it could harm the breast tissue....but the removed my breast...they are only doing rads on my arm pit...not my breast!!! And I go to the University of Minnesota....she said my Rads...are not a black and white issue...its a GREY area.....Studies showed that reaccurance is less in my case to have the rads....at this point.....why wouldn't I.....I have gone this far....And ALL my docs, becasue of the stageIII and aggressiveness....ALL thought that I didn't HAVE to do it forsure.....but would probley do it anyway as a precaution.  This is only MY situation....I just don't want to go thru this shit again!!!!!

Vickie, removing your breast is of course a VERY personal decision.  My grandmother had BC...had one MX, then 10 years later got it in the other and refused to go thru treatment (I can understand that now) and passed away.  There are a couple women on here that had a lumpectomy or a single MX a couple years ago and are going thru treatment agian.  Removal of the breast to me was just not having to worry about it coming back and certainly not having to go thru this again.  After making my desicion my Surgeon, who was about my age...said \"If you were my wife, I would have had her do the same, your making a good desicion\".  I still feel good about it....love my \"Flat\" tummy...they did an amazing job with recon...I still have acouple stages left, but my PS is really good. People always look at my breast, becasue they are surprised that I have cleavage!!! Good luck on your desicion!!! Polly",

I did not have short term, but did have long term that kicked in after 90 days. That will get me by until I'm ready to go back...that sucks that your company wouldn't have that.  They told me to apply for SS too...they will deny the first time, then you file again...it takes a few months. What a pain in the ass, i know!!!! Maybe try your state dept of labor....explain your situation....aske about being laid off, the potential of unemployment.....If that would even be an option for you....you can't get an extention on your state disability???  That seems crazy too....maybe there is an extention you can file????   I just know, if you don't ask...they wont tell you!!!!

Let me know!!! Vickie - How exciting getting so close to being done!!!! How has Taxol been for you??? Has your hair grown back while on taxol??? As far as the sential node....mine was negative while in surgery and found micro cancer when test with NEW tests, after they colsed me up!!!  My surgeon talked to 2 seperate ONC's and they all felt having another surgery to remove more nodes was not neccesary, also was not sure if rads was neccesary....however, I went to the U of M and she want's me to do the RADS, as a percaution.  She had just seen a study about situations like mine...and felt strongley it would be a good idea!! I will tell you, she told me I was not a \"Black and White\", yes or no.....I was a \"GREY\" area....I figure I've come this far....why not do everything I can to insure It doesn't come back!!!!! I'm meeting with the Rad doc next monday....I have questions...where will they target...my nodes/armpit...or breast....my PS didn't want to start my final nipple recon, until Rads was done. Deborah - Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! icmag - I have # 4 this week, last week I had to miss...so actually my last taxol was sept 21st, 2 weeks ago...i hope it's ok.....anyway, glad to hear hair is growing and eyelashes and eyebrows....i think my hair is growing...there is more of it, but i didn't know if it was going to fall out again!!! Hope the lump is nothing....I will pray! Went to a breast cancer event locally yeaterday.  It's was really great, but also scarey. Most women have survived...but there where a couple stories of women who lost thier battle and the main speaker has gone through this 3 times and it spread to her brain/spine....I felt horriable....but last night and today, really freaking out!!!!  While I know they are real stories....I'm not ready to even \"Think\" about this ever coming back!!!!! I did run into an old girl freind, who is a 4 year survivor...she was still very emotional about it.....which made me some how feel good...that, what i'm feeling inside may not really ever go away....and it is that emotional for her still, then what i'm feeling must be normal!!  Does that make sence???? We exchanged nembers, she was on the committe for the event and asked if I would get involved next year....I will!!!  She did say she had a scare last week...had a petscan and had some areas of consern...freaked her out, then had an MRI and came up clear....so I can imagine that this never really leaves you.  Thanks for listening!!!

I am having Reconstruction, but DIEP.....they take tummy fat and place it up to make a new breast!!! so not only will I have the breast surgery, but also belly surgery!!  My girlfriend had the Tram Flap, where they take muscle too.....the procedure I am having, doesn't compromise muscle tissue, so recovery is quicker and easier!  Very nervous, just found out 2 wks ago and Tuesday is right around the corner!!  Good Luck to you!!!",
