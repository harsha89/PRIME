While waiting for results, I researched what I would want to do. I had a plan. But then the biopsy came back negative for cancer and is totally benign. And now I\u2019m sitting here thinking \u2018ok that\u2019s great, but what do I do now?\u2019. Stress out over every little thing wondering if this is going to be the time? Waiting until it\u2019s my turn to get it? Screw that lol. I\u2019m currently looking into getting a preventative mastectomy. But it was so weird to be, not disappointed, but some feeling similar to it getting the all clear. I had to ready myself for that dreaded result that I didn\u2019t prepare myself for a good one.",
