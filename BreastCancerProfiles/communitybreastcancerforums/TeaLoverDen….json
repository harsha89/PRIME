I agree with you about the MRI-guided biopsy, although complications following my reconstruction were the worst thing I've gone through medically. If I ever have to do MRI-guided biopsy again, I'm asking for happy pills first!",

(Do you miss Charleston?!) Thanks for the support. I'm waiting on a telephone call with the results. It's hell ~ I can't concentrate on anything. I'm just glad I took the day off work today. Off for a cuppa, and hugs to you and yours ~ Denise",

With regard to my right (post-cancer) breast, the report just says that there is some skin thickening around the nipple region and diffuse strandy changes centrally, but enhancement did not suggest residual malignancy and are presumably related to prior surgery and nonhealing wound. BUT .... the report goes on to say that there is a small focal 5mm enhancinc lesion on the left breast that has kinetic curve analysis of rapid uptake and washout and that \"this in and of itself is suspicious.\" On the last mammogram I had (October 2006) no abnormality was seen in the left breast. The MRI report ends with the suggestion that I obtain a new mammogram and that \"if there is no abnormality seen by mammogram, the finding on MR in the setting of a prior history of lumpectomy in the right breast would warrant biopsy [of the left breast].\" The nurse at my oncologist's office never mentioned the left breast situation to me. I'm glad I asked for a copy of the report. They are scheduling my mammogram. Scary stuff.",
