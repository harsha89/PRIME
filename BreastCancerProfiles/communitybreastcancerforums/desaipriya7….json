      "Content": "desaipriya7 wrote: Hello everyone. My mom is scheduled to have a core biopsy done this Friday and I'm worried as to what the results will be. I'm praying it's not cancer. In her report it says that there is a 4 mm asymmetry in the left breast that is probably benign and she has to follow up every 6 months. However, in her left breast there is also a 9 mm lesion that they are concerned about and want to have biopsied. It is at the 6:00 position and middle depth. It is of mixed echogenicity. It was given a BI-RAD 4, but with no letter like a, b, or c. I think the radiologist will discuss her imaging results more in depth when she gets her core biopsy done. It does say that it is suspicious of malignancy but I'm thinking that is because it is a BI-RAD 4. Then it says there are no other significant masses or calcifications seen in the breast. It says nothing about the shape of the mass or whether there are any spiculations or not. I'm really nervous about her results and I'm just trying to be as strong as I can in front of her, but it is really hard to get my mind off this. Log in to post a reply",

I wanted to talk to her without my mom knowing and I asked her how things looked. Now this doctor friend has a breast specialist friend who she asked about this. I found out that there are no irregular margins and the breast specialist friend thinks there's a chance that it's benign because the lump didn't show up on the diagnostic mammogram, but showed up on the ultrasound. She said if it were the opposite or if it showed up on both then that's when to worry more. My mom's breasts are not considered to be dense. She is a BI-RADS 2 in terms of breast density with scattered fibroglandular elements and I would think that a cancer would be easier to find if most of her breast overall is fatty tissue. Everyone please pray for benign results. Her core biopsy is tomorrow.",
