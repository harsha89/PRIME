I was diagnosed with DCIS in May but had *two* tiny spots and the standard of care is Mastectomy when there's more than one spot. Had there been only one I still would have opted for Mastectomy over Lump+Rads and I'll echo what Calamtykel said. Even though the \"survival\" rate is statistically similar, my biggest concern being 40 was the recurrence rate, so Mx it was. If I opt to take Tamoxifen and the meds side effects don't outweigh the benefits, I'll further cut my recurrence risk.   As far as surgery, I opted just to do the DCIS side and keep my \"good\" one. The PS gave me a nice reduction/lift on the good side and it looks 20 yrs old again and pretty darn cute! Ha! ;) I did the tissue expander on the Mx side. I am only 3 weeks out from surgery and am doing GREAT-everything has been textbook and my recovery and healing have been swift and relatively easy.  It really was just a blip on the radar of my year, even though back in May at Dx, I thought it was the end of my world...   Good luck to you. The time between diagnosis and finding your team of doctors was the WORST, most anxiety filled time. Once I had a \"plan\" and a surgery date, it started to improve. And right after surgery, I cannot explain the emotional weight that was lifted from me. Focus on putting together a team of terrific docs that you have trust in and click well with. Dont be afraid to meet with as many as it takes. Michele",
