Except for when I was recovering from surgeries, I've worked out every day. I run/walk 30 miles per week, do weights three days a week and yoga a couple of times a week. After the surgeries, I laid off weights, but have been gradually adding them back in to the routine. I had bloodwork done when I started treatments, will have it done again half-way through and again when I finish. When my sister had radiation seven years ago, she had bloodwork every week, but I think her doc was a bit test-happy. Hang in there, ladies! I'm with you. ",

It doesn't feel any different, it just looks slightly different, as compared to the other side. I think it is due to the bolus that they are using on me every third treatment. The wonderful techs that I have told me that with the use of that, it is almost a given that my skin will get somewhat burned, especially as I am very pale. So, in addition to the slatherings of moisturizer I've been doing a few times a day to ward off problems, I'm adding a layer of aloe gel. Seems OK so far, and -- knock wood -- no other problems to date. Hope everybody else is doing well. I think about our March rads group as that machine buzzes away every day. ",

As soon as I was diagnosed, I stopped taking birth control pills, which I had been taking for perimenopausal symptoms. As soon as I stopped them, hot flashes and night sweats began! But I don't think they are the main cause of my sleep issues; I really feel that anxiety is what is causing the sleep disruption. I have been keeping active, too, and I think it's good to do that as long as anyone can. But, man, it was so hard to get up this morning and drag myself to the gym! It's never an easy thing, but some days -- lots of days lately -- it's harder than usual. Cherish these times with your pup. I said good-bye to mine over a year ago and I still miss her terribly. She was a wonderful companion to my two sisters when they were going through their treatments.",

I am not feeling well today, day 22 of treatment. I have no idea whether it is the rads or something else; I've been keeping up with my fitness routine, though I didn't run this morning, as I usually do. I would like to try to take a walk this afternoon, because I am reluctant to give in to fatigue. I sure hope that I won't feel like this for another two weeks. Ick. My skin is pretty red, but I have been keeping it well moisturized. Just yesterday, it began to get a little itchy. Nothing too bothersome yet. After today, six more \"general\" treatments, followed by six \"boosts.\" Can't wait until it's over! ",

I relate to guggerty's frustration with phone numbers and equipment failures! I don't have an answering machine at home and it really bugs me when people refuse to call any other number but that one. My mapping session got delayed due to an equipment failure, leading (obviously) to a delay in getting my treatments started, and therefore, in getting them finished. I guess one of the things that this whole experience is supposed to teach us is patience! ",

I can totally understand how it would be a day filled with all kinds of emotions. While I haven't been through nearly as much as you have, I have had similar thoughts about how I'll feel when this portion of the journey ends. Today, I am at the half-way mark in rads. Do what you need to do...and you go, girl! ",

I have my last \"regular\" treatment today -- then I begin a series of six \"boosts.\" My skin is very red, but it doesn't hurt. I have the occasional itch, but that's all. No peeling. I've been very conscientious about moisturizer, and the techs tell me my skin is holding up \"beautifully,\" so I guess they would know. I do feel kind of tired, but I rest every afternoon after treatment and that helps. I still think my fatigue is more from anxiety than from the treatments themselves, but no way to really know. I've been keeping up my exercise routine, which is good. After I finish rads, I have about a three-week break before I see the med onc; he will put me on some kind of hormonal therapy, but I don't know yet if it will be tamox or Arimidex. My guess is Arimidex. I have natural hot flashes now, but I'm a little worried about what they'll be like once I'm on the meds. The doc says that if someone tells him they're on tamox and not having hot flashes, he thinks the drugs aren't working the way they should, so maybe that means we should look forward to the flashes! Have a great weekend, everyone! ",

I fully realize that I've had it a lot easier than many, and for that I am grateful. But I will be glad to have a break from the daily routine of treatments. I admit -- to this group -- that I haven't minded leaving work early every day and going home for a little nap after treatment! The skin above, below and around my breast is very red, but it doesn't hurt, and hasn't peeled or even itched too badly. I've moisturized faithfully twice a day since before treatment began, and it really has helped the skin hold up. I have been tired the last week or so, but have kept up my exercise and tried to rest appropriately and eat well. For those about to enter the \"boost\" phase -- it's so much shorter than the regular treatments (especially since I was getting the bolus every third day) that it almost seems like the treatments are over! Hope everyone is doing well, and has a great weekend. ",
