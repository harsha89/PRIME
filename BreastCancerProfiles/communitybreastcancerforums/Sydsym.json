Mine thinned during chemo but I had pretty thick brows and never lost them all. I just wish the facial hair could have stayed away....grrrrrr",

I have to admit although I thought I rocked the bald look, I really was nervous about when or if my hair would grow back in. I also took a daily biotin pill and just used baby shampoo because my head itched a lot while the fuzz was coming in and it really helped a lot for me. So far I\u2019m happy with the growth rate but the \u201cstraightness\u201d of my hair is definitely hard to get used to. But they say it will probably go back to my normal texture eventually. Here are some before and current shots of me.",

I\u2019m big on mixing different moisturizers together so I have been slathering eucerin with palmers cocoa butter and/or shea butter on the area after treatment.

I\u2019m doing the deep inspiration breath hold as part of my treatment and was wondering if anyone else is also and what their experience had been with it? I haven\u2019t seen much info on the boards about it. I was nervous at first about whether I could sustain holding my breath for the 20 or so seconds but I think because I\u2019ve been doing yoga for years it hasn\u2019t been as hard as I expected.",

I'm starting TC treatment tomorrow every 3 weeks for 4 sessions and have been devouring information on this site since I was diagnosed in March. I'm still very confused about what to do for many situations. I've got a great group of doctors treating me but it's just so much information to absorb. My Onco nurse said the first treatment would be about 3 hours due to them starting slow. I was wondering if you're stuck in the chair the whole time or can you get up for \"pee\" breaks? I know I'll have lots of questions tomorrow but I tend to not ask a lot of questions on first appointments. My appointments will probably be early in the morning (around 8:30 am) and was looking for some advice on foods to eat before I head out. I keep plenty of yogurt on hand and was thinking of having that, a slice of homemade banana bread and some orange juice. Should I bring any liquids or food with me? Any info would be greatly appreciated",

I brought some water, banana bread, jolly rancher hard candy and cereal to munch on with me. I don't think I brought enough to drink (only a 32 oz. bottle) so I'll definitely have more next time. I also brought a light throw, some footie socks, a sweater, a book, my IPad and phone. They said the first time would be slow so I figured I'd overload rather than underload on stuff. I've been here almost 3 hours so far and they just started the first chemo drug after all the premed stuff so it looks like it'll be a loooooooong day. But I'm comfortable and have plenty to entertain me so it's all good.",
