So long before the forehead skin has sagged, there will likely be no tattoo ink (unless it was done with body ink, a no-no, or it was redone later in life, but then it would be put where you wanted it). Also, if the tattoo was done along the brow line and there is some ink still there in 20 years, the ink will be where the brow hair would have been anyway. That is to say, even if there isn't a tattoo, the eyebrows are a bit lower over the eyes as time goes by and any tattoo will just follow this natural progression.  This is why many women who lose brows do to age, ask to have them tattooed a bit higher than they would have naturally been. I recommend very light brow tattooing for women pre-treatment (chemo etc) so it will be there when the hair is lost, but not noticeable when hair grows back, and eventually it will fade to nothing or almost nothing.  And if hair doesn't grow back, there is a nice template of what the brows looked like before to follow. The biggest issue is the color may fade over the years to a slightly different tone, but this is easily fixed. Any brow tattooing should have very delicate hair strokes and very light powdering so it is subtle and natural looking. If done well, it will look like brows and be an easy template to follow to pencil darker brows if a client wants. Good Luck!",

I like to wait at least 9 months post surgery to work on scars, but will consider earlier if the client has note from her doc oking it. I recommend putting aside the scar as best you can and just think about what you want in terms of art.  Do you have favorite flowers or animals? What colors and styles are you drawn to?  And then start collecting images- photos, art, even greeting cards and fabric can be your inspiration.  Then, as you get closer to when you want to get the tattoo, narrow down your collection of images.  What are your very favorites and is there any trends (lots of blue birds, all red flowers, etc). It also isn't too soon to research artists and visit shops.  Look for someone who does tattoo art that you like, then talk to her/him about scar covering.  See any photos over scar covering if possible.   When you find someone you like, that artist should be able to draw the final art, or modify any art you bring in to be tattooable. Good Luck, and try to have fun thinking about the beautiful art you will have on your body.",

It is never to early to start thinking of what you want.  Definetly talk to a few tattoo artists to find someone who both does tattooing styles you like and has some experience working with scars.  I work with a lot of scars, both tattooing areolas, and covering scars with tattoo art and it is a great experience to see women take back their bodies. Good Luck.",
