They found a small hypoechoic mass and then I went for MRI. They confirmed the mass and rated it Birads 4. I have my biopsy tomorrow. Does anyone know if they give you any info at the biopsy? or do you have to wait a week for any info at all? I am so nervous I am sick to my stomach. Log in to post a reply",
