She has lost 30 pounds so far!  Which really scares me, because that is a lot.  Is that normal?  The doctors are just not talking to us much.  Just changing medicines and doing what they have to do.  Anyway.  My question is, does chemo/radiation bring out other things in your body.  For example, since she has started chemo she has gotten a cyst on her leg.  The doctor said they would just watch this and make sure it did not get bigger.  Then they found one on her kidney.  Last week a spot came up on her forehead.  So, does anyone know if chemo/radiation does this to you, or is there something else I should try looking into?  The doctors just say they are going to keep an eye on them.  They really will not explain any thing to us, so we are a little unsure of what is going on.  I have known people who have gone through chemo before, but none of this has ever happened.  I am just wondering if the cancer is not already at these other places in her body and now the chemo is bringing it so we can see it.  Is that silly??  If anyone has any information about this, it will be greatly appreciated!!  Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",
