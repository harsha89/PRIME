Ask careful questions about the creams your Centre recommends. I was initially given a cream which contained lanolin (my skin can't tolerate lanolin - not uncommon) and it brought me up in a rash straight away. When I raised it with the nurse next day she said \"oh yeah, we get a lot of that\", which led me to query why they give out a cream which causes reactions in so many patients! I was given Epiderm instead, but preferred XClair (which is a specific Radiation Dermatitis product - I had to buy it myself though.). It's partly my own fault for not checking the ingredients of the first cream I was given, but you have so much to think about in that first appointment it would have been nice if they'd asked me about my skin at the outset. Emu Oil containing an extract of lavender, applied at night, has been very soothing and moisturising. 2. A small dose of antihistamine helps ease the discomfort if your skin reacts. Once again it would have been helpful to be told this at the outset; the nurse did not mention it to me until session 6, however! 3. Exercise - even if it's the last thing you feel like doing - really does help with the fatigue. I got to the gym most days and felt immediately better for it; on the days I couldn't go, I felt sluggish. 4. I was absolutely craving high-protein food, and I didn't fight it. Normally I rarely eat meat, but for that two weeks I was a hell of a carnivore. 5. There's a lot of informal support to be found and given in the waiting rooms of these places. Everyone's tired, scared and fed up but people really do make time to be kind to one another, much like this forum. I wish a good outcome to everyone reading this. Best wishes for a brighter New Year.",

It can help you sleep too, as a temporary thing. I don't think it's been quite as cold over here in Europe as you've had it in the States, Gongshow, so it's been easier for me to face going to the gym - but on one or two days when I've needed something more low-key, I find Rodney Yee's Yoga DVDs really helpful. He does all levels, and there is a Meditation and Relaxation one I'm also very keen on. We need to take help wherever we can find it! All the best.  ",

Can I say a big 'thanks' for all the generosity and kindness shown on this forum and this thread in particular? There are some strong fine women out there. I start rads in ten days and have what may seem a silly question...but I'll ask it anyway...given the time of year, I'd like to be able to enjoy the odd glass of good red wine while I'm undergoing this treatment (I have fifteen 'blasts', running from December 19 to Jan 9 with some interruptions for public holidays and weekends.). I've been advised variously that this is an absolute no-no, but also that it's not a bad idea at all (all that Resveratrol helps cell reconstruction, apparently.). What did you other ladies do? Forgive me if this seems trivial!   ",

Just to reciprocate with a 'share' of my own; for those experiencing skin discomfort I have had several strong recommendations for a cream called XClair, which is specifically formulated for radiation dermatitis. I'll be slapping it on liberally once I start rads, so will report back on its efficacy. Hopefully it's available outside of Europe. ",
