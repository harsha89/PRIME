Will there definitely be drains, even if there isn't any affected? Also, I see so many lumpectomies that went onto mastectomies, is the percentage high on that? Haven't received the tumor markers yet. The lump was removed with vacuum-assisted core biopsy. The margins will be cleared. What percentage of women have to go back for a second time? Thanks in advance!

I know what you mean about the emotions. Everyone is different, but, I have learned in the past few days not to stay doing any one thing for very long. If I do I feel the anxiety build up I try to do something that makes me concentrate, like following a recipe and baking. I work at home, and even after being on the computer too long, I start to feel anxious, nervous, and sad. I finally called my Dr. and asked for anti-anxiety meds, they are helping. I wish you much luck also.     ",

I'm seeing a little brown color around the outside of the areola. I had a quick look about Radiation Induced Morphea. In the study below they mention tamoxifen. My MO said I couldn't start tamoxifen until I finish rads. http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2/1/136 \"There is no definite correlation between tamoxifen use and the development of RIM. However, tamoxifen can induce TGF-β secretion and increase lung fibrosis in breast cancer patients receiving both tamoxifen and radiotherapy 8].\"",
