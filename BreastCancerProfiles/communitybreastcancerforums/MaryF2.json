I underwent accelerated partial radiation (twice a day for 5 days) with very few effects. The 30% local recurrence rate was not acceptable to me and I wanted to do everything possible to KILL any stay cells. It did take a 2nd opinion with a radiation oncologist to get the treatment plan sorted out. My initial surgeon told me that with DCIS,you have plenty of time to get  the information you need to make decisions. I wish you the best, Mary",

I much prefer to see her 'on this side of the fence\". It's been very humbling to be a health care consumer( from my abnormal mammogram with the DCIS in February to finishing radiation in August).  My professional colleagues have been truly amazing and understanding during this experience . They are a big reason I was able to keep going . Mary",
