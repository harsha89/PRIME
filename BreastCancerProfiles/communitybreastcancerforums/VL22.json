The truth is it went so fast - it\u2019s so hard to believe I\u2019m on the other side of it. What is so disheartening is that every month a new thread has to be started because this disease doesn\u2019t stop. I just want to share that it is indeed a roller coaster. One day you feel in control, the next you\u2019re having a snap out and the next youre a crying mess. Don\u2019t \u201cbehave\u201d for anyone - do you. Unless you live this, you have no idea. Some tips - as everyone says - drink water! Lots of water! Even if you don\u2019t feel like it, get some exercise. Call your Dr immediately with SE\u2019s! Don\u2019t feel like your being a bother or overreacting. The sooner the side effects are addressed the better chance they can be minimized. Accept help. Get rest. My biggest piece of advice is the hardest - don\u2019t let the fear take over your life. Don\u2019t \u201cwhat if\u201d all the time. As you go through this process, you\u2019re still living. Find joy in it. Do some special things if you can. We took so many weekend camping trips through my diagnosis and treatment with our teen boys - time together we will cherish and never forget. It is so difficult to stay out of that dark place, but really try and you\u2019ll still have happiness through this crap time. Good luck!! ",
