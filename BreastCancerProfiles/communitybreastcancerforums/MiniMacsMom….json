So he is really great at figuring stuff out.  You do what you have to do to get through it.  Will there be issues he has to deal with, YUP but I was told by a child therapist that as long as they are loved and surrounded by love nothing that happens is insurmountable.  Other quirks are my hair, he didn't care about my hair when I had long hair but after being bald and now with short hair he loves to run his hands through it.  Mostly just a bunch of little things.  But he is also 2.5 now so a huge part of the problem is his age as well now ;)  It sucks and their are no guidebooks for kids this age, just do what feels right for your family!  At first we just said mommy had an ouchie boobie, now we are starting to define it more as mommy has a cancer boobie.  We were told that around to they start to need to know the difference in ouchies or they will think they have to have surgery if they get a small cut :(  it helps to define the severity of ouchies.  Its weird but he does seem to understand.  And when other little kids ask I always make sure to say I have a cancer ouchie but its not contagious.  Gotta love the little things!  Sorry, its alot of info, but we have learned a lot on this whole journey.  :)",

When your LE are is compromised and you get an injury, your body brings fluid to the arm to treat the injury and may not be able to get the fluid to leave. its harder to get it out.  When there is fluid buildup you increase your risk of cellulitus, a PTA infection... When doing rads or chemo any infection needed antibiotics will slow your treatment.  So they say minimize risk as much as possible.  Wear gloves and long sleeves hwen gardening, gloves when dishwashing, bug spray, no sunburn, ect.  I am only 28 with NO lymphs on my right side PLUS rads, so lymphedema is part o my new normal :(  But my arm looks normal with some work that we are doing, and over time, hopefully, I can decerase the amount of time it takes to keep the LE under control.  Sorry for the rant ;)",

I am sure this is posted somewhere else, but... it helps.   At 27 my husband and I had to bring this up and INSIST we are given the option of finding someone to help us.  The surgeon was going to just send us to chemo 3 weeks after surgery and we could be screwed in the end....  The fert specialist says we can have this done in 2.5 weeks since I am not infertile now and I don't need all the extra time to follow a normal cycle!!  There is HOPE!",

It is measurable.  In Feb the Lana tech talked about getting a night sleeve and a fllexitouch.  At what point do you decided you need to invest in a 10K machine, or in my case 2k because the insurance only ever covers medical supplies at 80%.   Thanks Diagnosis: 10/25/2011, IDC, 9cm, Stage IIIa, Grade 3, 4/15 nodes + Rotter's Node, ER+/P+-, HER2-, BRCA 2+ Log in to post a reply",

But the barometer is hard. I am under 30. Otherwise healthy and I try to eat well. I really hope u feel better soon. Oh I had taxol weekly and then FAC. Mda uses that regime because they say it gives u the maximum doses of chemo while preserving you immune system as long as possible.
