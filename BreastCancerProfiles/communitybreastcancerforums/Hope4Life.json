(The biopsy was in June.)      I kept getting sicker and went trhough some other major illnesses with other family members... the doctors could not find what was wrong with me - I have had 3 MRI's (on diffrent parts of my body) - 3 CT scans, nerve condution tests about a dozen x-rays - and still with pain on the left side, major headaches and leg aches and pains in my neck and back ...they could find nothing - they decided it was stress!  I am at a point where I can't even grocery shop - I can't eat or sleep and have lost 20 pounds in the past 6 months!     I developed an odd stabbing pain under my left rib and it is itchy and numb - so they sent me to a GI doctor who has put me on antibiotis and such - this was last week... Well, New Years day I woke up and got in the tub and found I had a golf ball sized lump in my \"RIGHT\" breast! (Just above and under the nipple)... I panicked!     Went to my gnyo on Friday and he is sending me to get another mamo on Wedensday and wants me to see a breast surgeon...  While there he did a pap smear - as my last one came back questionable and I started bleading massivly after the test... they did an immediate ultrasound and now want me to have a biopsy of the uturous on Tuesday (they found a mass)...     I am falling apart... I don't know what to think or do!  I am 45 and have 2 grown kids, but I also have a 12 year old that I want to be around to see grow up!  I am so scared and sick and don't know how I am going to get though this!  Log in to post a reply",
