I had lumpectomy a week ago and BS said I would have rads after and was healthy with clear margins. Today when I went in for post op follow up she told me Oncologist is recommending chemo and my ki-67 is High @ 64. I was blown away by the big change in treatment and honestly don't remember everything she said. She did give me a b Small book to read about oncotype dx test. I think I should definitely do this. I'm trying to be strong and this board helps to see I'm not alone. Also has anyone gone for 2nd opinions? Does it matter if the oncologist they recommended isn't board certified? I noticed he wasn't certified when I looked him up on my insurance website.",

My appointment was moved up to Tuesday so I will go and see how I feel with him. He is part of a group @ Ironwood Cancer research and Treatment Center here in Phoenix. I've also looked up a few other Oncologists in case I go for a second opinion. Have many of you done that? (Second opinion)",
