And I am pretty sure this is it .As I read some comments it given so much hope . My mother is 60 years old widow, Last year she was diagnosed with breast cancer it so very sad because were just a poor family in Philippines. My husband try to help my mother as the best he can but we still couldn't afford and continue her treatment because have more important things that my mother spend the money that we send to her. Anyway , She has some treatment but now she stops cause of financial issues. Her other side of boobs bursts have some fluid coming out .Sometimes she feels disgust of the smells. Sometimes shes scared and I am more scared too because I feel useless. I wish I am rich to help her more and I am far away from her. My youngest brother and sister take good care of her . I want just to ask some people that have good idea how to treat like this case at home naturally. How to give my mother a hope and give her some inspiration words . Thank You So Much !! God bless You allðŸ˜˜",
