And yes, this site was an enormous blessing for us both, seeing all you remarkable woman with this disease allowed me even greater determinaton that life can move forward, as woman shared their experience.  I will always be grateful.  Love to all.",

Another oncologist I saw told me \"he would not take half of the things back there\" meaning the chemo drugs etc.  I only saw him one other time and he asked me \"how are you bowels doing\" and my reply was \"great, I was not having any issues and he told me I will be.\" Moving on now to the world famous MDA, they told me to come back in three months, I asked if I would be alive and the oncologist told me to \"come back in two\". I had a temporary stent placed into the ureter in May, I never heard from the urologist again and made an appointment and saw him on Monday of this week and he told me I looked great and \"lets face it, no one expected to see you again\" I exclaimed \"what\" and his next reply \"well it's true\". Talk about brutally honest, there you have it.",
