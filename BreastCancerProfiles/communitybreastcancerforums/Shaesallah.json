Stay safe all My Prayers for everyone Shae     ",

Nervous to say the least but I wan made to feel comforatble.  Gettung the needle into the post was hurtful, but I survived it.  Next time I get the numbing cream. Of course there was alot of paper for them to to go over with me, you know like what tyhe meds are and the side effects... They stater the Taxotere first and were very careful to monitor me for any reactions.  Of course I had been drinking lots of water so 2 trips to the restroom were needed. LOl  Cytoxan was next and that went ok also.  They gave me a case of Ensure and I get one every time I go for treatment? I did ok the day of treatment, no problems (excepot the car stopped running, now Need to find a way to fix and pay for repairs).  The next day I friend took me for my Neulasta shot, that went good also.  Doc did order me meds for pain if I get any from the shot. I have had a bout with constipation on Frifay and Saturday but I was already cleared with the onco to use Alfalfa pills, they work so well for me.  Last night the pain in my legs and now this morning the pain in back for the shot, but so far I can deal with since I have the meds.  I have noticed also my morning ceral tasted alottle funny, but will wait and see what happend there. So all in all O am doing ok I think 9crossing my fingers) Talk to you all later Shae",

I Pray everyday for each of you to to get make it thru with the best of all lofe has to offer! On a more personal note, I have a grandson (almost 17 the end of this month) his name is J.R. He has been a runa away more times than I can count in the last year and into drugs.  J.R. really is a good kid, just lost his way in the last 1 to 2 years.  Currently he is in Juvenile Lock up so he is off the drugs.  But, they had tested and he is positive for Hep C.  This kid has always been my favorite (I really work hard not showint it since I have 10 grandkids).  But he knows how I feel,  Since ny daughter had to tell me about him and the  Hep C I have been devasted to say the least.  I feel so damn helpliess being stuck here in Kansas and the them in San Diego.  I get so damn depressed with all the personal life crap, mostly finances sucks and that is when we have money for the basics.....but now this just seems like one more thing to break the camels back!!  Too many nights crying to sleep with worry.  Thanks for listening.... My Prayers for all Shae    ",

Oh well it is just hair.  I go Monday evening to the Look Good Feel Good cvlass by the American Cancer Society.  I am actually looking forward to it and meetint others, hopefully maybe new friends.  The last 4 maybe 5 days I have been feeling better, just so darn tired.  Lots of naps at odd times. Then sleeping at nights is way off.  I seem to keep such weird hours and they make no sense. I noticed a few saying the were having a problem with constipation....my onco said it was alright to use Alfalfa tablets for that and they work really well for me.  I take 2 morning and night.  But I ahve at times taken 3.  Also black licorce seems to work well for me.   Maybe one of these will work for anyone else also. My friend and I go toa  support group for BC every other Tuesday night.....they are a good group os ladies to talk too.  The last weekend of this month they are having a weekend get away 'Puttin on the Glitz', we are going as it sounds likea lot of fun. For all the responses I have received Thank You so very much.  I try to worry about my health, but I worry more about my grandson.  He has easrned the right to make so phone calls (not collect) and I have spoken to him twice now.  that helps alot hearing his voice.  7 years ago when I had open heart surgery he wanted to be the one to come and take care of me.  He has a good heart I just want him to see that he can do so much better and be the good person I know he is.  Well, time to close. Stay safe all My prayers for all Shae  ",

But it is short on my Terms not the cancer or the chemo doring it.  It kinda looks like a high and tight Marine haircut (my daughter says).  Of course during the cutting process I did have a couple mixed drinks.  There were other real close friends thre and we had a great laugh at my hair coming off, but I do not regret letting her cut it.  Better to laugh than cry. Next I need to trim back my fingernails, which are between quarter to half in long.  They are mine, all natural.  I plan on doing that Tuesdy or Wednesdy evening.  I am praying for all Stay safe Shae",

I noticed the talk of the hair loss.  I actually had a friend cut mine, and she buzzed part  it and left some longer (maybe an inch) on top.  Had my Partner cut the top down.  Last Frifay I was 15 days from first chemo and I noticed in the shower the hair coming out all over my hands.  Same thing the next day in the shower also.  So Tuesday night I went ahead and buzzed my head just short of the scalp.  I have a baseball cap I wear outside and a scarf I can wear also.  Need to get a few more so I can at least have a change of color. My biggest problem is sleeping so I guess I need to ask the onco about that......my days and nights are all mixed up.  I know alot of it is depresion....I find alot of things (reading, playing, checking e mail, even being on the pc) I used to enjoy I can't  do anymore, the enjoyment is not there  I sure hope they come back soon.  Prayer and Hugs to all Shae",

I had spoken to my doc about the emotionall issues and he cave me something different to for sleepong it is Ristoril (generic form)!  I took it went to bed.  I was back uo in an hour and not able to sleep for another 3 hours.  I figure from the exhaustion of not sleeping the night before and then the dozing earlier that may had effected how it would help me.  So I will keep trying it, doc aslo had said I can use it with the Ativan....so I will keep trying and see what happens.  I also got the talk about working on getting me better and try not to worry about grandson and other problems.....but I have always been a worrieer even since I was a lottle girl.  Old habits can be so very hard to break (I am 56).  Sometimes I feel like such a whiner.....I have beem so very lucky in that no lymph nodes were involved, I only have 6 chemos to do and no rads.   So many others have been more devasted and yet they have so much inner strength!! I find hearing their stories uplifting and encouraging for me. To any and all who fight this cancer monster, I know we can get thru it....we are each here to share our good and bad days, have shpu;ders to lean on ot be a shoulder for another to lean on.  We are woman, we will overcome our problems witht the support, love and friendship we gain here.  So to each of us here I raise my glass (orange juice) and I say 'We are Woman, hear all of us Roar, we will overcome and be stronger for all we have been thru.'
