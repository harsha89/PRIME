      "Content": "HNBmommy wrote: I posted on here about a year ago. I had a small lump on my left breast. I had an ultra sound done on only a small part of my breast where they could feel the lump. The ultrasound tech told me that it was just my tissue \"thickening\". Every doctor I seen just blew me off, I felt that was because my age. I am 24 (23 at the time). I decided to listen to them and just carry on to my day to day. However, a week ago I got a sore spot where the lump is, its only about a cm long maybe two. I don't want to make a big deal out of it and be told I am crazy lol. I waited a couple days to post this thinking it might be healed by now but its not. I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and some advice on what I shouldÂ do. Thank you all in advance. Log in to post a reply",
