Has anyone experienced a malfunction with the equipment?The lidocaine did not fully dispense. The samples remained in the tubing and the needle remained in my breast for what seemed an indefinite period of time. It was painful, and my anxiety was over the top.The tech and Radiologist go out the door leaving it open explaining that their equipment had been down all day. Then the Radiologist wanted to continue to try to take samples. I said no because the machine had malfunctioned, She then stated she could change the needle. NO.. Really? The samples are still in the tubing.One tech threw the tubing away, the other pulled it out of the trash.They commented on cutting it out of the tubing. When they removed the needle they forgot to place the marker.They commented that they had had a stressful day, well they are the ones who set the tone,Don't continue to see patients when your equipment is not functioning! I don't know if it was operator error or not but the staff was flustered and unprofessional. i give that the whole experience an F. Oh, and what will the pathologist have to read? Cancer is straight from the devil.",
