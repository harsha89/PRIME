I showed to her which is on my phone. And when I asked if it is breast tb, she told she never heard of it only lung one. But I told on the latent tb one. Alas! May be I can let my breast surgeon know as she was asking if I ever had any bacteria. In other case, when I told the breast surgeon I have pcos with very irregular few periods and last year it was very prompt and regular. Does it have anything to do with bc. She told she doesn't know much about pcos related bc. Alas!  ",

When asked how big is the cavity, they mentioned 19 cubic centimeter. My bs pulled double the amount of tissue. Hmm.. Let's see how it looks after few months. I had a question on how much length of the ray does the seed emit radiation. There is no clear answer. But they told it is not going to burn the other parts. On Wednesday I have three times radiation as the doc is going out on Thursday pm. Twice is too much I feel, thrice??? Waiting for Friday as this will be done ",
