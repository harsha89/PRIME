What a relief!). I've had two drains after that as well, and just had one removed today (one week) as drainage was down to under 30 cc/day on that side. I felt absolutely nothing as the drain came out. I had taken two Percocet before going so that might have helped. The PS also said that the longer the tubing stays in, the more it might be a little uncomfortable, I guess because tissue begins to attach to it a bit. I agree with Digger to make sure your drains are not plugged. One day last week I noticed that my one drain that usually drains the most had hardly anything in it. Then noticed up near the top what looked like a clot, I milked the drain tubing to clear that out, and once I did that, more fluid started to drain.  I would just make sure that they are able to drain.",

Worked at Hopkins bone marrow transplant unit right out of school. Loved it but couldn't do commute. Worked in a hospital onc/renal for about 6 months, loved patients, hated the politics and nurse-bashing. Settled into nursing home position this past June. Had applied to hospice at that time, but no openings. Hospice is why I went to nursing school. Worst day of my life so far: 10/13/08. Received cancer dx. Got dream job offer from Hospice. Couldn't take new job due to insurance. Cancer dx DCIS bilat and IDC left side. Had bilat mastectomy on 11/17 with expanders put in. SNB negative. Still have two drains in. Expanders killing me! Major concern right now: have not been at nursing home long enough to qualify for disability pay. Husband retired on small fixed income. Financially speaking, need to return to work in about 3 weeks. Physically speaking, not sure will be able to work with expander discomfort. Am about ready to tell PS to take expanders out. Positives: Hospice says that I will be first in line for RN position when I am able. I have read most all of the posts here and there's a lot of good info. Any advice you folks could give on dealing with expanders and trying to work would be much appreciated. I have discovered that I am a REALLY impatient patient! Who knew??? Thanks, Cathy",
