I opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I am 3 weeks post op, and I begin chemo on Monday. I am having my port placed tomorrow.",

I am sorry that you have had to join our \"club\", but I am glad you are here =) I was DX when I was 31, just weeks shy of my 32nd birthday. I chose a bilateral mastectomy because I did not want radiation at all, regardless of it was recommended or not. Mastectomy surgery was my \"safest\" bet. The good news was that I was lymph node negative, which meant that radiation was not advised and I did not have to fight anyone ;) . I have seen skin effects of RADS that *I* was not comfortable with, and it is a very personal decision for me that had some vanity associated with it. Many women choose lumpectomy are are extremely happy with their choice. I did have reconstruction, I am pleased with the results.",

It explains my history a little, and that I cannot think of a \"cause\" I am Cari =) I was DX 3 weeks before my 32nd birthday, July 9th. I always had a Non hormonal IUD. I never wanted children, and had an unwated pregnancy at 18 for which I had an abortion, so I wanted the BEST and most effective BC around. My OBGYN, who was trained in Europe and married a US solider, said that IUD's in other countries were readily given to women without children. So I have never used hormonal BC. I also eat a grassfed meat/chicken diet, mostly organic, etc. I would be considered highly healthy, with ZERO risk factors.",
