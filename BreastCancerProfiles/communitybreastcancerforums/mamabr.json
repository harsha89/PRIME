I think I am going to try and go to our local cancer support center in the next few weeks, hopefully before ending chemo. With the holidays approaching I think things are going to get increasingly demanding because of family dinners, etc. I knew Thanksgiving was going to be tough because of extended family dinners, so I made plans for my family, 4 of us, to go out of town (with the dog too). We are driving to visit a college both the kids are interested in, football game and r&r. I have already received backlash. But I'm not going to feel guilty. It's 5 days in a row that my kids are free, no homework, no sports and no doctors.

My blood work showed my liver markers had high \"something or other\", but they didn't have to cancel the treatment, just changed the concoction and started the drip. It's amazing how quickly you can feel the venom enter the body. Sorry, I guess I should call it the anti-venom. Feelings in my head and mouth changed quickly. Everyone is so supportive. My friend took me to treatment today. She was surprised to see how many people were receiving treatments. There are probably 20 chairs and they were steadily filled. In a metro area, this may not be a large number. We live in a smaller city, so it hit home to see all the people battling.  It's one thing to support friends dealing with this, but another to actually see people in treatment, the IVs, ports, beepers, nurses. And it's different then visiting a hospital because most people have been to a hospital, but not so many to a cancer treatment center. She was a great help and the time passed quickly. My teens are enjoying the generous boundaries they get while mom and dad are preoccupied. There isn't the grand inquisition whenever they are going out and about. At this point, I just have to trust that they have good judgement.  Almost forgot, this morning my hair started coming out in fistfuls. I felt crummy at first, but my son put it in perspective that this is really the least of my worries considering everything else that has happened to us. Coming from him, I thought it was a sweet sentiment.  Anyways, best wishes to all! Thanks for the forum, it is therapeutic.",

He said rarely does treatment go without a snag. There was an earlier post about someone getting an infection and going to hospital for a few days. I had a few setbacks after the original bmx, but didn't think about setbacks during chemo. The doctor also reminded me about how important it is to be cautious while out and about due to the increasingly low immune system. I do not want to end up in the hospital again.  I was thinking about teeballmom, she started this thread/forum, and hoping that she is okay. She hasn't posted in a long time. Hopefully she is enjoying her family as opposed to a chemo setback. Take care everyone ",

One of the gals had a new hair style, so I complemented her on her hair. It really did look cute. She said thanks and rattled on about how she changed her color. I commented that I was sporting a new style myself, trying to make light of the situation and hopefully making her feel a little at ease. Her comment, Oh, is your hair falling out all over the place??  Inside I was just shaking my head, thinking, NO, my hair isn't falling out, my hair is GONE, hence the scarf and hat. I know I opened the door for her to make a comment. Then she launched into her taking care of her mom during her last days. That was comforting too! I'm overly sensitive.

Yesterday the needle poke hurt more than other times and I had to call my friend to talk me off the ledge. My friend also sat with me during AC#4 today and we did have fun catching up on our girls activities and looking forward to sending them off on their first day of senior year.  I also had to send in my LT disability paperwork, which makes total sense, but is another thing gone for now. And even though it's for all the right reasons, it's a reminder of how capable and active life was 12 months ago. I can imagine how Lifeonitsside feels by not being able to teach her art classes, it's probably something that brings great joy and you are probably awesome at it. And I kick myself into reality because I know I could be posting on one of the other boards where those dear women face bigger challenges. My heart goes out to them, as it does for all of you that help to make me stronger by sharing your days.  The next few days are definitely going to suck'ola, but I get to watch my DD play tennis on Tuesday, so I am keeping my eye on Tuesday.  Really, thank you to all of you that share your stories.

I know, or I think I know, the worst parts are over...decisions, big surgeries, decisions, fix-it again surgeries and the unknown.

I don't know what to say except I feel for everyone when we are having the hard days....and we all have our hard days and weeks. When I had my blood drawn today there was a man there I recognized. I thought he was one of my daughter's old soccer coaches. But then I remembered I recognized him because I saw him when he was doing his chemo training. I remember thinking that day (chemo training day) really sucked (amoung other days). When I saw him that day, I remember thinking what a sucky day it must be for him too. Everything was so scary on that day.... Now I was seeing him getting all hooked up with the chemo bags, his mom with him. I felt like holding out my hand, to say I know, I know this really sucks. But, of course, I didn't....that would have been awkward and he would think I was off my rocker. I just smiled...maybe next time I'll talk to him. When I see everyone in the room I just wonder about their stories. Everyone seems so nice and I know they all have a story. Anyways.....best wishes to everyone!",

For me, the Taxol is not as extreme as AC, I don't go to the real low of AC, but I wouldn't say I am popping back to 100% between Taxol treatments. I am pretty tired and kind of hover around 70%. ",

It hasn't been unbearable, but shots of pain through my legs and lower back. I go in today to (hopefully) start back up on the Taxol treatments. I have missed 2 weeks because my counts were too low. Hopefully they don't cancel again.  I've been having a really hard week, just feeling down. I'm a cpa and this is the first October 15th I've missed in more than 20 years. 10/15 is the final deadline for tax filings. Most of my friends think I am crazy to miss it, they don't even want me to go back for next tax season, too stressful for me. So many people at work helped to finish client returns, many difficult (or not so difficult, but chaotic) returns with years of information stuck in my head. I feel so badly and guilty that I wasn't there to help. I know it is totally inefficient for me to be there, I think many of you can understand how I feel. I'll get out of this slump..........I just feel so inept at everything! Hopefully I get started again today and can stay on the weekly schedule. Hugs to everyone!",

It seems like having a resource person dedicated to helping patients get through all the paperwork, insurance and disability, would be a great assistance.  Ann - I was wondering if you had a timeline for returning to work? As I recall you are an engineer(?). So far I have disability approved through February, but I also have another surgery to redo my reconstruction. I won't be doing that surgery until end of January or February. I certainly don't feel like going or thinking about work, but I know that at some level, by Feb., work will be part of the healing process, getting back on a schedule and trying to remember that I know something other the nuances of my new, unsolicited, cancer education.  Sorry to hear about those SEs. I was starting to have numbness in toes and fingers. That was about 3 weeks ago. I had 2 treatments cancelled and my new Taxol dose decreased. My MO thought he might reduce my Taxol treatments from 12 to 8. At the time I didn't ask any questions because I was worried about the other things, low counts and numbness. Now I am worried about reducing the treatments. I know most people would ask if I am crazy, who wouldn't want to reduce their treatments? But you know how you get mentally set on a plan and with this cancer, any time the plan changes, the light bulbs start going off. So now that my counts have been good and the numbness has faded, I am sick worrying about changing anything. I will see MO again on Wednesday, so will find out more information.  Prayers for everyone, take care!",

As much as the water is hard to get down, I can't drink anything else, so I force down water. I've had really bad heartburn, so not only does eating sound bad, it wrecks havoc on me, so I eat little amounts.  It's been almost a week without hair. Little by little I have faced the outside, increasing my confidence to go around town. Since I live in a small town, I can't go far without running into someone I know. I haven't worn my wig, and probably won't, but I have been wearing hats. I guess the big thing with the hair loss is that it screams cancer. Before hair loss, I could do many things and forget about all this. I went through many early appointments and tests without anyone even knowing something was awry. Actually, today I ran into someone I haven't seen for years. She casually asked, \"how's everything going?\" all I could say was, \"great, everyone is doing well and busy as ever\". She kind of looked at me funny because obviously everything has not been that great. She was very nice and what can you say?? It was just an awkward moment. There won't be too many of those, but I guess it makes me a little stronger. Lifeonitside - Hope you had a GREAT day at the Happiest Place on Earth!!! I love DL and am planning to go there in January! Happy weekend to all! ",

I am wondering what it will feel like emotionally to finish. I know it will be great to get back to a new routine that doesn't include chemo. It seems like we all have more work ahead of us, some having rads, finishing reconstruction and various hormone therapies. And we all have continuing doctor appts for the next few years. My chemo ends mid December. I'm a little scared that everyone is going to expect me to be back to normal (whatever that is) and I am going to still feel like I've been dragged behind a truck the past year.

I hope your body can get some energy before dec. 12. This chemo just zaps everything from us. I am thinking of getting an air purifier for my home and office when I return to work. I am so frightened of picking up a germ, now that everyone is walking around with a sniffle. I think our bodies are working so hard to keep up with our treatments, any extra germ would be a setback. I guess we all have to be so careful now, whether we are ending treatments or going into a second phase of treatments. For those with surgery or treatment ahead, our bodies are a lot weaker than 12 months ago when we had the cancer, but our blood cells weren't beaten down yet.  And Natalie, sorry to hear about your lymphedema. You sound so active and your love of exercise is inspiring. I send wishes that your new medical concerns are benign. Let us know!",

You are just a fighting person, fighting this drawn out battle of treatments, fatigue and rebuilding. I have had many supportive people call me and offer support and a place to go to for sharing stories. I have also not been ready to attend local support groups. I do appreciate the phone calls. I have also had many calls and requests for fundraisers. Some of the calls are probably from my name being added to the cancer lists, but it is too early for me to be a financial supporter. We are just trying to keep finances in check with medical costs and monthly bills and 2 kids, one in college and the other in lots of school activities, sports costs, etc. It seems like some of the cancer orgs would wait until next year to call and ask for $$$, not when I'm in bed feeling like crap (excuse my lang.).  I am finding that business people have been really sweet lately. Now that I get to more stores and people recognize what is going on, the grocery clerks ask if they can help with my bags and I don't fill more than 2 at a time. Usually it's a run to grocery just to feel like a mom again. I had something else for school that needed to be framed and they said they would donate the framing....super nice. I just smiled and said thanks.  But Natalie, you are a superstar and real inspiration. Working out and all the kind words you send...fighting makes us all a little less patient, but not meaner.  Take care and kill a few of those west nile mosquito's! ",

Of course, WE ARE ALL STRONG! But, I have to hand it to roadwarrior for working and exercising. I just haven't been able to do either. I know it is a double edged sword, but I am tired, I've probably been a little sad and my other life was pretty much on the go 24/7 and now I just don't do that anymore. Good for you roadwarrior and keep inspiring us to take walks and hikes because I do believe that exercising brings those valuable endorphins. I'm just not there yet. As treatments go, I was wondering the same thing Natl12. I am also triple negative. I did the 4 rounds of AC and now 12 rounds of Taxol. Back in the spring I read up on all the different cocktails, but after I made the decision, I stopped reading. We had several differing opinions, and all the MOs agreed, there was no single answer. Half of them recommended one plan and the other half recommended a different regimen. We had to decide on our own. As I recall, Taxotere was in one of the recommendations. I went with my first MO opinion. I trust him and I feel good/confident that he and his office will be there for me for the next 5 years or however long I have to have checkups. As you know, being triple neg., I can't do the hormone therapy. This is it, except for monitoring, I guess. We haven't decided on the ovary removal. I'll worry about that next year.",

I am thinking of all the things I can get done this weekend, even if it's feeling just a little happier. The doc thought I would be sad because it extends the treatments, but I needed the mental break and apparently the physical break. I guess I shouldn't be on the computer, but it's still pretty hot outside, the heat really bothers me and I thought all of you could understand why I would be in a good/better mood. Okay, I'm finished tooting my horn, I'm really not a bragger, I know what we are all going through. Kind thoughts to everyone and let's hope the CA heat subsides. xo",

I don't have a lot of advice for mastectomy technical matters, this is what I would offer for personal comfort: 1. Comfortable jammies - my MIL bought me new jammies, button in front. Super comfortable. There were also little pockets on pj top, so my drains could fit in the pockets. She also gave me a couple of lightweight robes. Plan on lots of rest, so hence the jammies. Also nice to have a comfortable spock suit (my name for sweat suit), velour?, something to lounge around in during the holidays. 2. Lingerie - I was going to write VS a letter, because if any company should have a bc dept., VS would make sense. I had a hard time feeling comfortable w/ new lingerie, because after the bmx I had a real desire to feel pretty. Prior to bc, I was very practical with lingerie, beige and black. My 17 yr old daughter has more lace and frill than I. But, when I looked at my bandages, I just wanted to cover everything up with color and lace. I couldn't find anything that looked pretty and would accomodate my new body. I started with immediate reconstruction. Prior to chemo I had to have the left side removed because of infection. At first, I bought things at VS and fixed it for me. But Nordstrom has a bc prosthesis program, with a full line of products and/or transforming any piece of lingerie to fit our needs. I don't live near a Nordstrom, but all the shipping is free and the pricing great, well worth it. If you don't have a store near you, they can work with you over the phone. Since I have re-reconstruction in the new year, I will be refitting again. 3. Looking back - less is more - the more rest you give yourself, the better off you will be in the long run. There is major healing going on deep inside and even if you feel like you can make a bed, fold clothes, put dishes away, drive, don't do anything you don't have to do. Take all the help that is offered.  There is probably more, but we'll all be here for you!",

No more chemo for me, just re-reconstruction, probably in Feb. - they want me to give me at least 8 weeks to get my strenghth back enough for another surgery. Also, no rads for me.  Super tired this afternoon and tonight, but now I am kind of awake. I'll probably take a little helper so that I can have a full night's sleep. Susan must be all finished and recovering tonight. Hope she gets some extra attention in the hospital since she is a nurse. They probably take good care of her.  Ann, hope you have your MRI and surgery planned. Night all......",
