Just take things one day at a time and ask lots of questions. You wouldn't believe all the great information you can get from this site. Hang on to your faith and keep a positive attitude!",

I also woke up feeling totally normal. Matter of fact, I had weeks of no pain afterwards. I would also highly recommend it. I hope everything goes well with you.",

I've been on the meds since Feb 08 and we thought we would have seen some improvement by now. I'm praying that everything will turn out fine with whatever I choose:>",

My LV ejection fraction rate is at 43% and he doesn't think/know my heart could handle the effects of Herceptin.  I'm taking Lisinopril and Coreg CR to help the heart out some. Has anyone gone through this? Were you able to reverse the cardiomyopathy and start Herceptin? How long did it take? If you needed radiation, were you able to do that? I now have to decide between continuing breast cancer treatments or keeping my heart healthy! What to do???????? verymuchloved Dx 10/9/2007, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 12/15 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Was looking through the thread and had realized I was posting on a different thread, chemo brain!!! I'm on my way to my last a/c tx on the 15th and can't wait to be over with this part! I've only had one really bad week of se's from tx number 2. I'm hoping that this last one won't be so bad either. I haven't been exercising like I should, have gained 15 pounds. My onc hasn't said anything so I guess I'm ok. I have to wear a little knit hat 24 hours a day to keep the heat from escaping my bald head. Other than the occasional mouth sores and bad bouts with nausea, I've done pretty good. I can't wait to stop smelling like chemo! I'm a little afraid of the next step though.My onc has changed my taxol from once every three weeks to weekly with the herceptin. Supposely, it's better for cutting down the se's. We'll see. It's really good to see that this thread has really taken off. My siblings aren't good at showing their feelings on the subject so I don't get to really talk about what's going on with me to anyone except my poor husband. It's nice that this websie is here and to be able to discuss and read what everyone else is going through and that you're not alone in this.  One thing I've learned is that attitude gets you everywhere! If you know you'll be ok, you'll be ok. I hope everyone well, and I'll be posting often.",

There was a little burning in my nose when the Cytoxan was started. Nothing I couldn't handle though. The Adriamycin wasn't in a bag like the Cytoxan, they used a syringe to insert it. The nurse said it's given like that so she can monitor any blood being backtracked. Other than that everything was fine. I'm on my way to being finished...yippee!!!",
