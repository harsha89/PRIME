After my wife's BMX, I made sure to say \" my wife had cancer\" and when people would ask for specifics, I would add that they are in a bag somewhere back at the hospital. We all know the realities by now, no one is fooling themselves, and no, you are far from being in denial. Sometimes it's nice to hear a positive spin on this sucky situation. My lady bought t- shirts for the family to wear on her first chemo treatment, i wear pink for my daughter, sister, friend, and so on. I insisted on \" proud husband of a survivor\". I totally agree with you, Each day you fight, you are a Survivor.",

As she calls it, the \"woodpecker pain\".  I told her about the Claritin and she has been on that for years for allergies.  I know the answer is probably already in one of these topics, but couldn't find anything quickly.  Hope everyone is doing well today.",
