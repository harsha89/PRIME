    "Content": "MsSoupy wrote: Hi all: After 15 months of AI therapy, I moved to Stage IV with mets to the spine and was switched to Tamoxifen in mid-July. I had a follow-up PET scan in mid-September. My current oncologist's view is that my disease is stable. However (without getting too technical), there were various details about \"increased uptake\" in several areas. Even before the scan, I'd arranged to have a second-opinion consult, and the second oncologist believes that Tamoxifen has failed. I'm trying to sort through it all, and my basic question is: does anyone have an idea whether there's a general rule how long Tamoxifen should take to \"kick in?\" Dx 8/5/2009, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 11/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
