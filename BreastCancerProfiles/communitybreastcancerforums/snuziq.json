This is my first post to this topic as I have been \"lurking\" trying to decide if I belong in the September group or not.  My chemo starts on September 30th so I was trying to decided if I would have more in common with the October group.  You all are so supportive of each other, it is a wonderful thing to see and I would really like to join this group.",
