Now what? do i get the biopsy with dr donahue (highly recommended, has done over 1000 of these)? do i meet with another surgeon first (dr Zannis--also highly recommended) on jan 11 and get his opinion and then make a decision about surgeons first before i even get the biopsy?  i plan on a biopsy no matter what   Do i wait until jan 21st when i can get a consult with a doc at the mayo clinic in scottsdale?  Then get a biopsy thru them and then see the results--prob at the end of the month...? what would you suggest? My goals- get a biopsy get results do it all as soon as possible:) thanks  Log in to post a reply",

And ask questions about biopsy. Sign patient consent form  ~Schedule Biopsy for the week of Jan 11th.  ~Once i get the pathology back, depending on the findings, get a few opinions on what my options are.    Thanks so much for your help.  I will let you all know how it goes.  Until i have more info , i will be reseraching this site and others to find out what questions to ask re biopsy.  For example, should i have a chemo assay test done on the biopsied area (if malignant)?  etc etc.... Sweatyspice, would you mind telling me what treatment you did after confirming malignancy?  Wishing you all the best as you walk this road.... ashleyaz",
