My MO says probably due to chemo, some damage to the liver. Naturally fear of reoccurance is raising it's head and this time is more overwhelming then previous exams/concerns post treatment. I'm struggling trying to cope with it while I wait for scan. Normal liver levels for the type of test my Doc. uses 29 is top of normal. My level last month was 49. Last week up to 55. A CT scan is being ordered. Hoping it's temporary inflammation due to chemo, or as my Doc suggested also due to my weight gain. I have cut out alcohol completely over the last month and do not take Tylenol. Has anyone experienced temporary benign liver problems after chemo? Suffering is a part of life, that does not justify adding to the suffering of others. Namaste.

For some reason this liver business has thrown me for a loop and I'm having a full blown anxiety attack. Headache, can't stop crying, vomiting. I was feeling perfectly fine before the phone call from my Onc this AM. I feel like I'm loosing it, I usually don't get this frightened, but your posts, sharing your experience has helped. Thank you again.",

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2015 12:12PM - edited Jan 10, 2015 12:13PM by DoggieBytes Hi, Do you mean the Neulasta shot? I had one following each of my AC infusions. The shot itself did not hurt the needle is very small. The chemo nurses in my clinic warmed it up a little before injecting it. Some people do experience side effects but not everyone and to varying degrees. One thing that does help with side effects is taking a plain regular strength over the counter allergy medicine called Claritan. (Loratadine 10 mg). It is available at the drugstore or Walmart. This was recommended by the Chemo Nurses and my Oncology Physician Assistant with the approval of my oncologist. Take the tablet the morning you are supposed to get the shot. Please check with your MO first to be safe. I did this and only had some very minor joint pain that only lasted a day or so. If you do well with the first shot you'll probably be fine thereafter. Make sure to stay well hydrated, that helps too. You will be o.k. Hang in there. The shot really does work to help your immune system.  ",

A lot of the products for hair contain harmful, damaging and cancer causing ingredients. You can look up the products via the link above to research and compare. It's well researched with cross links to specific ingredients. I want my hair back, I really do, but I decided I am going to use mild low toxicity hair and skin products to keep my scalp and follicles healthy as possible plus good nutrition (whole foods, staying away from processed foods as much as possible) and hope for the best!",

I have pretty good coverage at my sideburns, some decent growth at the top of my crown but the hair line at my forehead, very sparse. I'll be wearing wigs for awhile yet, but am glad that I've got growth already! I've heard of the vit. e but results are mixed.",
