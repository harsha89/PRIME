It's so hard for us to put some of this on the shelf so we can let go and enjoy other things in life. But, when we can the experience is even more rewarding. Good luck!!",

I kept thinking the nausea feeling and bad taste and inability to really enjoy food was a SE from chemo but then I was reading another board and the ladies were saying they had taste and nausea issues which they realized are from rads! My RO asks if I've had nausea but only seems concerned about whether I've thrown up - I haven't but feel like I could a lot of the time! I am going to ask more tomorrow and be more insistent about what elseI can do. I'm so glad that others are experiencing this (well, I don't wish it on anyone but at least I know I'm not crazy and it most probably is the rads not a SE from chemo!) Re: skin issues - My RO recommends coconut oil which I've been using as well as Bag Balm and aquifor, etc. My chest is getting really red and tight. Thanks everyone for your posts - I have been catching up with all the info and news. I will start taking my Ativan again to help with the way my stomach feels! Good idea I learned from your posts.",

I saw the RO and was very specific about my stomach issues, the pit in my throat I sometimes feel when I swallow, and not being able to eat. The nurse asks the same questions as she does each week. Today I got more aggressive with my answers. N-Do you have pain? Me - a little N - On a scale of 1 - 10 how bad is it? Me - I show her my red sore chest. \"It hurts and it bothers me. I have a very high pain tolerance. I birthed my three babies without ANY pain meds and my 2 boys were 9 lbs! So for me the pain is about a 4 but for many it might be an 8.\" N - any nausea? Me - yes. I feel nausea a lot. My stomach feels crummy and I am burping a lot. N - Have you thrown up? Me - NO, but I am not someone who throws up. I feel like I could throw up but I do not. I have hardly ever thrown up. I still feel nauseated. I have burped a lot and a few times and thrown up in my throat. I am 6 weeks past last chemo and I thought this was from that but my stomach is feeling worse and it seems to hit a few hours after rad treatment. I am not as bad on the weekend and actually better by Sunday. I have a pretty iron stomach...so this is really discouraging. She trots off and in come RO. RO- I hear you are having some problems. YESSSSSSSS! Guess what!! He said that all these symptoms are from the rads!!! Since I am having whole breast treatment stray rads are hitting my stomach and esophagus and that is what is causing this. THANK GOD! I AM NOT CRAZY!! So, bottom line, he went to get his physicist who listened to my symptoms. (She was about 28 years old - I guess she is really smart!!) She agreed that these SE's are from the rads and she will re-write the program to avoid more of my stomach and esophagus. Meanwhile, I will do the 7 boosts which are just to the small area where they did the lumpectomy. This is less intense and will give my chest skin and my stomach a chance to recover. They were going to do the boosts at the end, but this keeps me on schedule and I will still finish on the 29th. I did take the Ativan this morning and he thought that was a good thing to do. It seems to be helping. I am not really that fatigued and I teach half time, so it has not really affected my life - just my eating!! I have lost about 11 lbs which is a good thing but I would like to be able to enjoy my food and eat more than 3 bites without feeling sick!! Bottom line - be aggressive with reporting your symptoms. Do not feel like a wimp. It is all very scary and really makes me upset to think my stomach and esophagus were getting zapped even though he said they wrote the program to avoid my lungs and heart...guess I didn't ask about the stomach and throat!! UGH!!! I only have 5 more whole breast (and whatever else the strays are hitting left). Hang in there ladies. I hope you are all doing good! Looking forward to the weekend!!!  ",

I will say that if you have an issue, make sure you complain loudly! I was feeling nausea 6 weeks after chemo and well into rads and I finally made a big stink about it and they admitted that with whole breast rads it can hit the stomach and esophagus!!!! So, they rewrote the program and I did the 7 boosts to get a break. I felt better! Then I went back to the last 5 whole breast and the nausea came back!! So, when they say it's not from rads, I'd be skeptical. I never threw up but my stomach was always upset. I have an iron stomach and high pain tolerance, so when I felt lousy for several weeks, I decided to make that known! I lost about 12 pounds, which is a lot when you are post menopausal! My chest/shoulder blade area also was burnt and hurt like hell. I used all the creams I could and the candula cream (which is in miaderm) helped. One thing that I used was coconut oil - my RO swore by it. He also finally prescribed a steroid cream for the itching, which is in full force as the burnt skin heals. You are all amazing and it will soon be over!! Hugs to all! I will be celebrating tomorrow night!! I plan on taking a spring break vacationweek and will not start the arimidex until I get back! Now, if only my hair would start growing faster!",

Marijen - if your nausea does not subside make a stink about it! I see you are having whole breast - my RO finally listened and is rewriting the code because he said the nausea was definitely from stray rads hitting my stomach (and in my case, esophagus!). I was glad I got aggressive about reporting my SE's but it took me 4 weeks!!! Do not wait that long!! It is a SE and he said it should not be happening! We all hate to complain or make a stink and think we can handle this, but this is a time to get selfish and take the initiative to speak up. All my RO says to use is coconut oil and aquaphor. I keep searching for something else but it all just hydrates. The cabbage leaves help! My chest/shoulder area is bad. I'd post a picture but I don't want to upset anyone! It stings now and then....ugh! The other insult to injury is that this weekend, 6 weeks after last Taxol, I lost all eyebrows and most lashes. I'm a mess....no hair regrowth and now no brows or lashes and a burnt chest! I keep waiting to start the climb out of this abyss....it's gotta be soon! Hang in there ladies!!

Good luck!  I know biopsies can cause a lot of anxiety, particularly waiting for the results. We've all been there",
