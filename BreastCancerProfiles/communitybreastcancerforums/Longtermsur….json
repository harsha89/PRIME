I was apprehensive about another surgical procedure, but oh so grateful to stop doing the out-patient thoracentesis draining. Inpatient hospital time was 4 days and another week at a nurse friend's home before I was safe to go home on my own. May your mother's healing from the procedure be complete and uneventful, so she can continue with her cancer treatment and you can share more loving time together. Blessings for both of you, Stephanie",

Please read at your own risk and while sitting down in a quiet place. I'm not trying to overwhelm you, but you shouldn't read this in a busy, crowded place or at your workplace. Warmly, Stephanie Hi Lori, I am so sorry your mom is in her current condition and that you aren't finding the resources you need from her healthcare providers or online. Are you her designated medical agent? If not, can you work well with the person who is, so you can get and keep in the loop with what's happening for/with her medically? Can you find a way to talk with her doctors directly to get your questions answered? Lori, you asked us for a prognosis for your mother, because the doctors haven't clearly given one and other online resources are vague at best. Nobody can say and certainly not us band of folks dealing with MBC. We don't know your mother or her case. We don't know her resources or if and how her body will respond to treatment. We don't know much about the physical condition she's in or if she can even tolerate the treatment she's been offered, much less any future treatments. I wonder if you're asking for yourself as much as her - how long is she likely to live? Should I take FMLA (family medical leave) from work and go take care of her? Move her in with me? How tough are her ongoing treatments likely to be? And how will her disease likely progress? What future can we all anticipate for my mother and for ourselves? Of course, these are my wonderings, not your questions, Lori. But, from your description of your mother's current medical condition and the treatment course her oncologists have ordered, she is in dire straits and likely to die of breast cancer - perhaps sooner, perhaps later. If her doctors were focused on getting rid of her cancer, they'd be treating her brain, as well as her lungs, as well as her whole system with chemotherapy. Brain metastasis is usually treated with radiation and special drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier. Regular chemotherapy doesn't. Bone metastases are additionally treated with targeted radiation and injections or infusions of bone strengthening drugs to prevent pain and breaking. It sounds like they are focused on symptom relief or palliative treatment of her lung mets with both the oxygen and the chemotherapy. Basically, they are trying to make her feel better, not cure her cancer. Metastatic cancer isn't considered curable, but is treatable and some achieve what is called remission (the disease retreats). Even stability (the disease stops growing and taking over the body) while on treatment. The cancer is unlikely to go away or be cured - though as Deanna mentioned, there are always miracles. But miracles are, by definition, unusual or unexpected. What doctors expect is for someone with very advanced cancer is death by disease. And their treatment goals are to make the patient feel better, not worse. At a certain point, hope in advanced cancer is more about feeling better and less about beating the cancer. And at a later point, hospice is called in to focus fully on addressing pain, distress and symptoms of a dying body. There is still hope while on hospice - only it's different. Lori, I was on palliative care for 4 1/2 years and have been under hospice care since last November. It isn't a death sentence, but a chance to work with my team to achieve my best possible quality of life. You will need to find a way to get more information about your mom's condition through her or through her doctors, so you can help provide the best hope and care possible for your mother...and so you can plan this next stretch of your life. You can also decide you won't accept the dire news and seek second and third opinions, clinical trial options, continued aggressive treatments. You'll get some good advice here about how to do these things. Life is 100% fatal for everyone, but metastatic breast cancer can force us to face possible death sooner than we wish. Lori, I so wish we had clear answers for you...but we just don't know. You don't know. Your mom's doctors might have a good guess that they're not clearly telling you. Though nobody knows exactly when or how anyone else will die, there are telling signs, especially as death grows nearer. Here's an article about life's final days that is very graphic. You might want to bookmark it for a later read, because your mom isn't there yet: What It Feels Like to Die: Science is just beginning to understand the experience of life's end. Remember, my response is not only long, but potentially upsetting. I'm one of the few here who speaks openly about death. This group is great for encouraging members to seek and survive treatments and to never lose hope. My hopes for all of us are slightly different because I believe that facing death can help us clarify life - others' lives and our own. Please feel free to share more information, ask questions and share your concerns. We might not know what will happen with your mother, but we have big, kind hearts, much life experience and good minds. Sending warmest healing wishes, Lori, Stephanie",

RosesToeses, I hope you find your true mate in the tried and true Xeloda after being jilted by the trendier new drugs. Woke up thinking about other promising cancer treatments and cures and how they've changed over the past 25 years. While I could write pages about the supplements (shark's fin, anyone?) or clinics (Mexico, Europe or other?) or various practitioners around the world, I'll stick to the dietary advice that we're all too likely to get from well meaning folks. Trends come and go. Used to be macrobiotics and low fat McDougall diets, then Weston Price Nourishing Traditions. These days it's all Crazy Sexy raw foods, green drinks and low carb diets (raw or paleo). It does make sense that the SAD (standard American diet) isn't the healthiest, vegetable rich diet for reducing cancer risk and healing, but I've seen many many cancer patients and their loved ones go overboard into extreme diets. Recently, I wrote about orthorexia vs. healthy diets and quoted from http://www.orthorexia.com/healthy-eating-vs-orthorexia/ It's worth thinking about - in cancer our very lives and well being are at stake, so it makes sense that we'd become more scared and more inclusive of all foods and preparation methods we think are medicine and exclusive of all we perceive as toxic. BUT, I know two very thin friends of friends who've eaten well for years (no SAD or bad health habits for them). One has a recurrent brain tumor and they're talking about going to a monthlong raw food retreat to beat the cancer. Both are already underweight and I worry about them going on a catabolic diet that will break down what little stores they have...I think they need an anabolic diet to build their strength and stamina for dealing with cancer, recovering from surgery and radiation, etc. Of course, their lives are their own, but the extremism of the raw food diet is worrisome in their case. We cancer folks have been offered so many dietary treatments and cures. While most have worked for a few, few have worked for most. And don't get me started on cannabis medicine...helpful, but not a cure-all for all.",

      "Content": "Dec 20, 2015 07:20PM - edited Dec 21, 2015 05:36AM by Longtermsurvivor I have some ideas about PFS (progression free survival) and OS (overall survival) that I think are share worthy. First, as a long term cancer survivor who's read lots of medical and research literature, I'm a medical observer and patient, not a practitioner. Please don't take any of this as medical advice, just my thoughts on the topic. Feel free to question me and to talk with your own oncologists. During nearly 25 years with breast cancer, I've seen many promising ideas, treatments and approaches come and go. The media is filled with forward looking news releases about them, but reading the research, many of them are based on laboratory (in vitro) or animal studies and far too many don't develop into workable, achievable treatments/cures. Even reports of clinical trial results are often over-inflated about positive results and don't reflect detrimental or long-term effects of treatment. Phase I and Phase II trials are often under-powered and lack statistical significance for PFS or OS (the studies that led to approval of Ibrance (palbociclib) are). Yet, patients and those who care for us can be caught up in the hype and hope. I think there may be an element of wishful thinking and the placebo effect* at work. If it's newer, it must be better, right? Maybe. Some of the things I've seen come and go include radical mastectomies, removal of many underarm lymph nodes (I lost 35 in 1991) instead of sentinel nodes, Megace, DES**, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant in breast cancer, Avastin which worked well for some but not all, radiation for bone mets*** and many other treatments that looked promising in studies and trials, but turned out to be worthless or more dangerous in practice. I'm concerned that both Afinitor (everolimus) and Ibrance (palbociclib) may turn out to be more of the same. The thing about PFS is that it doesn't always equal good quality of life. It measures the cancer, not the unwanted, possibly toxic, effects. These may worsen our quality of life in the short or long term. Just because we achieve PFS or even NED (no evidence of disease), doesn't mean that the quality or length of our lives have improved. Thanks for letting me think about this with you all.

Ascites, while tough and often dire, isn't necessarily end stage. I've been dealing with it for the past year and had a different type of indwelling drain installed - Aspira. Torridon, are you doing the draining yourself or waiting for a nurse or aide to help? How often can you drain and how much? I've been taking off 2 liters at home every other day since mid-August. It's a huge relief. While my belly isn't flat again, it softens up after draining and I'm grateful for that and for breathing better and being able to eat more. A few things that I've noticed: draining is draining. I always lie down and rest immediately afterwards, often napping. When I wake up, I'm ravenous. Because my blood pressure drops, it's important that I not plan to run around for the first few hours afterwards. Also, I had terrible trouble with cramps in feet, legs and hands that have been helped with electrolyte drinks (homemade with fresh juice, coconut water and Himalayan salt). Also helpful are Hyland's homeopathic foot cramp pills and extra magnesium. I spoke with a hospital dietician yesterday who said to keep that up and to eat plenty of nutritious, high protein and high calorie food. I've got some unflavored whey powder in bulk from the local natural foods market and will try it with cottage cheese, banana and a sprinkling of salt. Torridon, if you're still huge and uncomfortable, breathing and eating just don't work well with a belly of ascites, please call your doctor to ask about increasing how much and how often you can drain. And please keep asking questions here. I will do my best to reply and hope others will chime in too! This is a difficult time, but it seems too early to throw in the towel. warm healing wishes, Torridon, Stephanie ",

So what if they're $90...that's cheap compared to having the drain installed (mine was $18,000), but more to the point, it should be the agency's worry, not yours. Medicare covered the cost of my drain and dressing supplies until hospice come on board, now they pay for all my medical supplies - Whew! I do drain myself every other day and it's an easy procedure. If that empowered you, I encourage you to try. At least try ditching the nurse. Second, flip flopping doctors! Ugh! That's what finally drove me to hospice - six different opinions about how to proceed with a rather simple problem (my skin is sensitive to latex and adhesives for dressing the drain site). Plus, hospice allows me to continue Femara/letrazole, which may slow my progression. Whildchild, I had a hospice interview in September, but didn't start until November. Can you talk to them about what they could provide that would improve your life? It's not a black and white option - treatment or die. It's possible to go onto hospice and recover enough health and well being to return to active treatment. While my hospice team treats me very, very well, I've heard horror stories about other hospices coming in and immediately giving patients drugs that disable and discombobulate them. I've been very adamant about not going that route and they've been very respectful. Meanwhile, can you begin to look for a new ally? It sounds like your current oncologist has given up on you, but you haven't. So, I wonder if there's a different oncologist in that practice or in NY who could work with and for you, rather than against your wishes. Finally, I absolutely agree - Ascites - yuck! much love, Stephanie",

If you've ever recovered from abdominal surgery, having an implanted drain is not that dissimilar - my belly just doesn't want to \"give\" or support me like it used to. Of course the ascites make it hard and tight, difficult to eat, breathe, bend over or exert myself. But the drain itself adds a different limitation, even though the exit site is sealed over. On the other hand, it's limiting to go to hospital to be drained and to face the risk of complications, infections and internal scar tissue from outpatient paracentesis procedures. Cancer is life-limiting, as well as life-threatening. Basically, this all sucks vital energy, no matter how it's dealt with. Capniva, I hope you settle on the right solution for you, even it's only for a short period. I'm very happy with my implanted drain and with being on hospice, though I know others might not be. btw, recently both Rosevalley and I have been sharing about implanted drains in our bellies at: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

I've used bold-type for some of the breast cancer specific entries - the statistics are grim, but here's a nugget for us breast cancer folk: Among patients with LC from solid tumors, the best response to chemotherapy and radiation occurs in those with LC from breast cancer, with 60% improving or stabilizing and a median survival of 7 months; 15% survive for a year\u2026 You'll need to register at no charge with Medscape to access the full entry: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a rare complication of cancer in which the disease spreads to the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord. \u2026 Meningeal symptoms are the first manifestations in some patients (pain and seizures are the most common presenting complaints) and can include the following: CNS symptoms are divided into the following 3 anatomic groups: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is incurable and difficult to treat. Treatment goals include improvement or stabilization of the patient's neurologic status, prolongation of survival, and palliation. Most patients require a combination of surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Background Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC), also termed neoplastic meningitis, is a serious complication of cancer that carries substantial rates of morbidity and mortality. It may occur at any stage in the neoplastic disease, either as the presenting sign or as a late complication, though it is associated frequently with relapse of cancer elsewhere in the body. LC occurs with invasion to and subsequent proliferation of neoplastic cells in the subarachnoid space. Intra-axial CNS tumors of diverse origins and hematologic cancers may spread to this space, which is bound by the leptomeninges. Infiltration of the meningeal space may thus occur from drop metastases via spread of the extra-axial space, hematogenous seeding, or local perinueral invasion; perinueral invasion is not infrequently seen in the context of gastric cancer or head and neck cancers. The leptomeninges consist of the arachnoid and the pia mater; the space between the 2 contains the CSF. When tumor cells enter the CSF (either by direct extension, as in primary brain tumors, or by hematogenous dissemination, as in leukemia), they are transported throughout the nervous system by CSF flow, causing either multifocal or diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges in a sheetlike fashion along the surface of the brain and spinal cord. This multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges by malignant cells is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis if the primary is a solid tumor, and lymphomatous meningitis or leukemic meningitisif the primary is not a solid tumor. Lymphomatous or leukemic meningitis is somewhat of a misnomer, as meningitis implies an inflammatory response that may or may not be present. First recognized by Eberth in 1870, LC remains underdiagnosed even today. Nevertheless, it has been recognized more frequently in the last 3 decades than before because of improved diagnostic tools, therapy, and awareness. It is not a single entity pathologically; it can occur concurrently with CNS invasion or wide dissemination in the intraventricular spaces, or in association with CNS metastases, with the clinical picture differing somewhat in each case. United States Approximately 1-8% of patients with cancer are diagnosed with LC, and it is present in 19% of those with cancer and neurologic signs and symptoms on autopsy, usually in those with disseminated systemic disease. LC is present in 1-5% of patients with solid tumors, 5-15% of patients with leukemia, and 1-2% of patients with primary brain tumors. LC can be the presenting symptom 5-10% of the time; however, the exact incidence is difficult to determine. Gross inspection at autopsy may miss LC, and microscopic pathologic examination findings may be normal if the seeding is multifocal or if an unaffected area of the CNS is examined. Adenocarcinomas are the most common tumors to metastasize to the leptomeninges, although any systemic cancer can do so. Small-cell lung cancers spread to the leptomeninges in 9-25% of cases; melanomas, in 23%; and breast cancers, in 5%. However, because of the different relative frequencies of these cancers, most patients with LC have breast cancer.[3] Lung cancer is the second most common tumor associated with LC. The incidence of LC increases the longer a patient has the primary cancer; LC is accompanied by other intracranial metastases in 98% of patients with a nonleukemic primary cancer.[4] LC is becoming more common with increasing survival from systemic cancers.[28] xxx The prognosis is generally poor because LC usually signifies the presence of metastases elsewhere, and the course of the systemic cancer is the major determinant of the patient's survival.[11] Untreated, median survival is 4-6 weeks; treated, median survival is 2-3 months[3] . However, small case series have suggested prolonged survival with newer chemotherapeutic regimens for diseases such as breast and lung cancers. The most notable exception is leukemic or lymphomatous meningitis, which is sensitive to both MTX and Ara-C and often can be eradicated completely from the CNS. Poor prognostic indicators include the following: a survival rate rare in patients with LC with a primary tumor other than breast. \u2026 Among patients with LC from solid tumors, the best response to chemotherapy and radiation occurs in those with LC from breast cancer, with 60% improving or stabilizing and a median survival of 7 months; 15% survive for a year\u2026",

Because I have so much trouble with both lung and liver, treatment has been for those. I don't get bone strengtheners either. In fact, my bone mets aren't even monitored...so it's possible to live long and well with untreated, unmonitored bone mets. But, if they are bothering you, it's possible to have them radiated. Radiation for bone mets isn't like the 35 days post-lumpectomy radiation, but rather is given for a very short time...10 days or 5 days or even 1 day. Guidelines for radiating bone metastasis have changed from 10 days to 1 day. Some radiation oncologists wait until the patient has pain or symptoms before radiating. http://www.choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2...

They can cause the body to weep and prevent its natural emptying of normal fluid that keeps the linings from slickly sliding beside one another. Mine happened with shortness of breath, worse on lying down, worse on the affected side, worse after bending forward then straightening up and worse with movement - even of arms as well as walking. Better sitting in semi-reclined position, even to sleep. The oncologist still listens with a stethoscope and taps my ribs up and down to listen to it. For many moons I had regular outpatient chest x-rays to check the volume of fluid. It can be drained off in an outpatient procedure called thoracentesis and 4 years ago I had a big surgery called a VAT's pleuradesis that sealed the lung linings together with talc. I also considered having a drain installed, so I could drain at home (like I drain fluid from abdomen now), but am glad I did the more invasive procedure as it was a good fit for me. While I hope that pleural effusion isn't in anyone's future, it's good to know there are options for treating it when cancer treatments aren't controlling it. Bestbird's book includes more complete information. You can find her contact information at the main page at Forum 8.

With later pleural effusion (fluid between the lung linings), breathing became more difficult and I eventually had a feeling of heaviness and slushing in the lower lung. Never any wheezing though. There are so things your symptoms could indicate - from the most benign to a cancer recurrence. Ask your oncologist's nurse for a referral to a pulmonologist to do a thorough investigation. Another resource to consult is this bco topic especially for those with earlier stage breast cancer concerned about recurrence: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/783594 Good luck in your search for answers. And maybe your symptoms will resolve on their own and you can stop your hunt soon. :) Healing regards, Stephanie",

The companies that profile tumors (listed in my post), should be able to direct you to which chemotherapies will and won't work for your particular tumor at this particular point in time in their development. Metastatic breast cancer is famous for changing mutations over time and even containing different types of cells in the same tumor. This cancer survival mechanism is part of what makes cancer so hard to get rid of completely - it just keeps changing. Think of antibiotic-resistant infections or pesticide-resistant mosquitos or herbicide-resistant crops. All beings want to live and they create cellular strategies to survive onslaughts of poisonous and lethal toxins. Cancer is made up of our good cells gone bad - it too wants to live and will change to survive. Our bodies want to live too, so it's important to support healing on all levels, not rely only on treatments to get rid of cancer. Rational Therapeutics website does a good job of describing the potential of tumor profiling. OncotypeDX wouldn't apply much in MBC, because it evaluates whether or not chemo is called for in those with earlier stage breast cancer - different test used for different reasons. And genetic testing blood tests are to determine the possibility of having a mutation that puts you at risk inherited risk of cancer. The most famous of these mutations of is BRCA that increases the risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Plus, it can help guide treatment options as there are a few BRCA mutation-specific drugs that aren't used outside those with the mutation. Angelina Jolie is the most famous, recent BRCA celebrity spokeswoman. Pretty much everyone with ovarian cancer is checked for BRCA mutations. Those with breast cancer, not so much unless they have a strong family history, were diagnosed at a young age and/or have bilateral breast cancer. Hope this helps to clarify things. Best, Stephanie",

Their protests in the 1960s and 70s were no more enthusiastic than their embrace of financial security in the 1980s. Boomers have reformed and reinforced every caprice of their age, so it's no wonder that now, as they confront aging and the ends of their lives, they're choosing quality of life over quantity. That means making time for bucket list adventures, foregoing those heroic \"do everything\" treatments and yes, planning every detail of their deaths. In 2012, Hollywood gasped when the death of Nora Ephron, screenwriter of Silkwood, When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, was unexpectedly announced. Ephron had told no one. But she left clues in her final book, I Remember Nothing, that her days were numbered. Hiding terminal diagnoses is a way for patients to control their deaths. \"Boomers have never been a stoic bunch,\" gerontologist Ken Dychtwald told Time magazine in 2013. \"They're not going to allow their last chapter in life to be an extended period of loss, fear, pain and suffering.\" Boomers' efforts to change the way Americans die are already being felt. Not willing to linger for years in nursing homes, they're pressing for the legalization of aid in dying, the legal right to receive a lethal dose of medication from their doctor when they have six months or less to live. The movement has garnered a groundswell of support in the past two decades, with four of the five states where it is legal passing their laws (or in the case of Montana, deciding their court cases) in the past six years. More than a dozen other states have grassroots initiatives underway, with six actively considering legislation. Efforts to better plan end-of-life care decisions have garnered attention, too, in recent years, with a proliferation of resources for elders to organize their finances and their end-of-life decisions. Hospice use and home deaths are increasing. A number of bestselling books have recently brought planning options and elder care issues out into the open, including Atul Gawande's Being Mortal and Katy Butler's Knocking on Heaven's Door, in which both chronicled the long and painful deaths of their fathers and addressed medicine's vagaries.",

Yes, MBC is on the list of Compassionate Allowances that nearly guarantee quick approval for SSI/SSDI: https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/ But re. working and earning money, I've heard everything from recipients being unable to earn any money at all to a very small earnings cap to a limit of $1090 to the Ticket to Work program for getting back to work. Some have had their benefits revoked for working, some even for being NED and presumably able to work. Basically, it's a big mess to sort out for each of us - I think because the programs serve such a variety of recipients from permanently disabled young people (think Down's folks) to newly disabled skilled workers to terminal patients...everyone but those over the age of 65 who are on regular Social Security. www.ssa.gov/planners/disabilit... The two programs (SSI/SSDI) are for those who can't be gainfully employed, but different SS offices interpret the qualification guidelines differently. Add into the mix that for SSDI you must have a certain amount of earnings and SS deductions within a certain time. Qualifying can be difficult for those who've worked at home, are self-employed and worked for self-funded employers (schools are notorious for having their own in-house systems that can leave their workers stranded without access to SSI/SSDI or Medicare). Then there's the $2000 property limit for SSI (at least recipients get income Medicaid right away) or the 5 month wait period for SSD income after your disability date and the additional 24 month wait period for Medicare. There's a lot to sort out before you even apply. It's worth taking all the time before hand though to speak with real experts. If you can't wait, here's a helpful book: http://www.nolo.com/products/nolos-guide-to-social-security-disability-qss.html I'm just a patient who's heard and read some hopeful, helpful stories and some confusing, unhappy ones too. good wishes in navigating your personal way through this, Stephanie",

Ah, life-threatening illness and teenage hormones! My parents were good liberals (what we call progressives, these days), so my rebellion looked like a search for truth in Buddhism, yoga and world religions/philosophies. If I hadn't witnessed the perils of fundamentalism, I might have fallen for its assurances that all would be right in the world if I just followed their righteous rules. Instead, I decided to join up with the 1960s and 1970s countercultures, hippies, activists, natural food folks and seekers. Yet, I empathize with your daughter - her early life, physical and emotional challenges and years of you with breast cancer must give her some sense of how unstable and transitory the world really is. When change is the only constant, it's understandable that we seek stability through authorities promise us safety and certainty. I hope this is just a stage for her and that she'll be inspired by how you've lived your life. What we see/perceive in others is so much more important than what they say.

This recent interview of the author of Tribe makes me like his book a whole lot better. :) Danger and hardship certainly characterize an MBC diagnosis - makes sense that we form our own tribes or communalism at bco and in support groups. We help one another through the hard times and celebrate the good - together! Much loving kindness and caring, Rosevalley, Stephanie Why Do American Soldiers Miss War? By Jenara Nerenberg | September 1, 2016 According to author Sebastian Junger, facing social isolation back at home deepens the trauma. Sebastian Junger is a former war reporter, the author of several best-selling books, and co-director of the Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo. His latest book, Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging, explores the loneliness and alienation of modern society and the haunting question of why soldiers miss war upon their return home. The book flips the script on PTSD, arguing that the isolation faced when returning home aggravates the trauma of combat, which raises the question of how to foster a sense of community and belonging separate from disaster or war. We talked with Junger about the causes and potential of communalism. Jenara Nerenberg: What avenues do you see that can help cultivate a sense of community and belonging to minimize loneliness and alienation in our society? Sebastian Junger: I think if we actively espouse an ethos of communalism that it would help. Communalism rises to meet the challenge of danger and hardship. It pops up spontaneously. But we live in a safe and more-or-less comfortable society, so we don't need communalism\u2014so we would have to actively espouse it. The tone of contempt used by our leaders and the lack of responsibility and culpability of those who have harmed our country very, very gravely contributes to the lack of community, as well. JN: What forces have contributed to us losing that sense of communalism? SJ: I think it's affluence. Affluence, income disparity, the automobile. All of those things have made our society more individualistic and less communal. JN: Why is it so important to get a sense of tribalism back? SJ: Well, the book is really about communalism, shared resources, and egalitarianism. The title of the book is distracting. \"Tribe\" is a loaded word. There is an amazing book called Our Beleaguered Species by Elizabeth Crouch Zelman about the importance of tribalism to human evolution and survival and the danger that that same tribalism now poses in the modern world. She acknowledges its crucial importance to the rise of human society but the liability that it brings with it in a modern context. I think she's the last word on that funny duality of human groups. Once you form a group, you're immediately forming another group that's not in your group, right? There's no way to form a group without creating another category of people that are not in your group, unless you make the entire human population your group, which is then a senseless distinction. Her book addresses that duality very well and should be widely read. Communalism is what characterizes our evolutionary past\u2014and when we're forced back to that way of being, it seems to be deeply gratifying to people. JN: How do you cultivate community and belonging in your own life these days? SJ: I grew up in the suburbs, where there was no community at all. Now I live in New York City in a poor neighborhood and I feel like there's something close to a neighborhood community, but it's certainly not at the level of the Kalahari or Kung or somewhere like that. JN: It sounds like you've accepted modern society the way it is and that it's not really set up for communalism. Are you interested in exploring solutions? SJ: I think there are solutions, but they're just not acceptable to us. Widespread disaster would force communalism, but who would want that? Banning the automobile would do the same thing, but no one's going to do that. I think there are plenty of solutions, but they're not palatable to people. You're not going to have your cake and eat it, too. You're not going to have the luxury of your cars and air conditioning and planes AND the kind of close communal connections that a survival-level economy forces on people. JN: So you don't think the rise of co-living and co-working movements\u2014developments like that\u2014are notable? SJ: Sure, I think small groups of people can function that way\u2014communes in the 60's and 70's, for example\u2014but if you're talking about a society-wide transformation, I just don't think that's going to happen. But that doesn't mean that small groups of people can't create their own circumstances\u2014of course they can. Old-age homes are communal societies. Platoons in combat are communal societies. At the micro-level, communalism does exist. But short of a large-scale disaster or banning the automobile, I don't think it's going to happen on a society-wide level. JN: Where does this insight about the automobile come from? I didn't see that in your book. SJ: People often ask me what can be done. The automobile has given us the mobility that enables us to work 50 miles from where we live and enables us to be completely divorced from our immediate community. The Amish have banned the automobile and their suicide rate and depression rate is extremely low and it forces them to live within walking distance of their home\u2014in other words, it reverts them back to their evolutionary past. JN: Was suicide not common in previous tribal societies? SJ: The data is very hard to find, but it seems to have been virtually nonexistent. There were ritual suicides and suicides to avoid capture by the enemy\u2014but suicide as a result of depression, which is what we mean when we talk about suicide in modern society, seemed to have been virtually nonexistent.",

Pajim, you're right - many (most?) of the bco members I've met share similar approaches to our medical care - informed, engaged, collaborative, willing to work with a team or get a second opinion. Some will pursue the most aggressive and possibly far-fetched treatment options (conventional and/or althernative), while others just want to get back to normal life. Yet, in my personal life I've known several much less informed patients who are happy to give all the decision-making power to their priests physicians. Medicine is sorta like a religion - we put our faith in different gods and their priests. And sometimes we see others' religions styles as not as good as ours. I've very strong opinions about my own care, but when others make very different choices, I do my best to listen, understand and support their faith. If they are questioning it, I'm also willing to explore that together. My goal is to support the other person. Right now, I have several beloveds choosing very aggressive, risky treatments with unwanted effects that they want to complain to me about. Listening with an open mind and heart is a challenge! Loving and letting go is my lesson. I am learning how to stay connected in spite of our different approaches. No real answers, just resonated with your post, because I too am in similar situations with my loved ones. warmest healing regards, Stephanie",

While we hope that the chemo clears it up, have you talked to your oncologist or palliative care doctor about symptom relief for ascites? It's possible to drain it in the outpatient interventional radiology department of most hospitals. Basically, you go in, they rub an ultrasound roller over your belly, find the biggest pocket of fluid, numb the belly with Novocain, then insert a large needle and suck out the fluid. I had it done once and they couldn't believe how much fluid there was, liters. A few weeks later, I had an indwelling catheter placed and have since drained on average a liter each day. It's such a huge relief to release fluid from my big, hard, swollen belly. Hummingbird, I wish you sweet relief too! Many blessings to all on this topic/thread and at bco, Stephanie",

Some are strong and fit - one friend who'd hiked major mountains on her own for decades, went out for a day hike, wandered into the desert and died.

My old-fashioned, not-a-power-port turns 13 (edited on 4/3 to be 14 years old) this month and I remembered a few more tips! * If you don't have emla or receive lidocaine by needle or spray, it's good to have the nurse stretch the skin taut over the port when inserting the needle on your out breath. * Accessing should be a sterile procedure, but the kit that comes with my hospice nurse includes a mask, two pairs of sterile gloves and a whole lot of stuff. That seems a bit overdone, but do be cautious, especially in hospitals and around germ-filled places. * There are different lengths and widths of safety needles - I use a 3/4\" 22-gauge safety needle for incoming, but a wider gauge for draws. This protects my skin from breakdown - necessary with weekly access. Also, longer needles are great for fleshier folk, shorter ones don't work loose from we skin-and-bone folk. * I've learned to de-access my port myself and find it's a simple procedure, though it requires syringes of both saline and hep lock. Maybe worth considering for home infusions that take a long time. Do you really want to have a nurse sitting around that long? :) Sending caring, healing regards for Patty and all, Stephanie",

I'd say, the area just keeps looking a bit more tattered every week. But I'm still expecting it to outlive me. :) GatorGal, it sounds like you are anxious about your port, but maybe good to get a magnifying mirror or a close friend to really look closely at the skin above it. If it's totally broken down, then get on it. If the skin is just needle-marked and doesn't have definite changes that look like a wound, then maybe okay to slow down. Either way, slow down and take a deep breath. It seems interventional radiologists often deal with replacing good ports gone bad. If you need a replacement, be sure to ask about low-profile and kids' ports, so you aren't sporting that big-bump metal medal on your chest. And some people love their ports on their upper, inner arm. Oh yes, my old port doesn't have a mouse tail, because the catheter is threaded differently than those that go over the collar bone.

LOUIS HAS SHOWN THAT ESTROGEN THERAPY CAN SHRINK TUMORS IN SOME WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER. ESTROGEN WORKS AGAINST... view more For breast cancer survivors, the idea of taking estrogen pills is almost a taboo. In fact, their doctors give them drugs to get rid of the hormone because it can fuel the growth of breast cancer. So these women would probably be surprised by the approach taken by breast cancer physician Matthew Ellis, M.B., Ph.D., associate professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis -- he has demonstrated that estrogen therapy can help control metastatic breast cancer. In a study presented at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, he showed that for about a third of the 66 participants -- women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy -- a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. The study was funded by the Avon Foundation through the National Cancer Institute and included six cancer centers in the United States. Ellis believes that estrogen therapy offers an appealing alternative to chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer that has become resistant to estrogen-lowering agents called aromatase inhibitors, such as exemestane, anastrazole and letrozole. These drugs deplete the body of estrogen and are standard treatments for hormone-receptor positive breast cancers, which account for about 75 percent of breast cancer cases. \"By stabilizing or shrinking tumors in some women with metastatic breast cancer, estrogen therapy can relieve pain and other symptoms of cancer and can potentially prolong lives,\" says Ellis, an oncologist with the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \"And unlike chemotherapy, estrogen enhances the quality of life. For many of our patients, their hot flashes disappear, and they lose other symptoms of menopause. It's a natural treatment for breast cancer. Not only that, it's much cheaper than chemotherapy, costing less than a dollar a day.\" Furthermore, estrogen seems able to return metastatic tumors to a vulnerable state in which they again can be affected by aromatase inhibitors. \"We thought acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitor therapy was permanent,\" Ellis says. \"But now we've shown that in some patients giving estrogen can make it possible to cycle back to aromatase inhibitors, and they can work again.\" About 40,000 women die of metastatic breast cancer each year, and estrogen therapy potentially could help thousands of women with hormone receptor-positive disease, Ellis says. The study measured how many women with aromatase inhibitor therapy-resistant metastatic breast cancer responded to estrogen therapy. All study participants had estrogen-receptor positive tumors that had spread to their bones, livers or lungs. The women were postmenopausal with an average age of 59. Coming into the study, all the participants were taking aromatase inhibitors to slow or stop the growth of their tumors. But their tumors had stopped responding to the treatment and had begun to grow again. Half of the patients got a high dose of estrogen (30 milligrams a day) and half got a low dose (6 milligrams a day). Ellis points out that decades ago, high-dose synthetic estrogen was an accepted breast cancer therapy and was only abandoned when the estrogen-blocker tamoxifen came along in the 1970s and proved just as effective with fewer side effects. The high dose in the current study was based on the amount given to breast cancer patients in many of those earlier regimens. Both the high- and low-dose treatments led to stabilization or shrinkage of metastatic tumors in about 30 percent of the participants. But the high-dose regimen had significant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, fluid retention or calcium imbalances. In contrast, the low-dose regimen had few side effects and was well tolerated. The researchers found that if study participants eventually experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit -- their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years, thereby managing their metastatic disease. The researchers also found that PET (positron emission tomography) scans could predict whose tumors would respond to estrogen therapy. They measured tumor glucose uptake before starting the women on estrogen and again 24 hours later. The patients whose tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare, were the same patients who benefited from estrogen therapy. It's too early to know why estrogen has a negative effect on metastatic breast cancer tumors. But Ellis has found one clue -- estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). \"I think that in order for breast cancer cells to survive in the absence of estrogen (when patients are on aromatase inhibitors), the cells have to learn to alter their cellular programs to utilize alternative growth signals like IGF1,\" Ellis says. \"In theory, when you give estrogen back, IGF1 decreases and cancer cells die as a consequence. But surviving cancer cells prefer to switch back to living on estrogen -- to them it's like eating out at McDonald's every day instead of foraging on roots and berries. These cells eventually reappear as estrogen dependent tumors and the cycle starts over.\" Ellis plans to continue to follow metastatic breast cancer patients to quantify the response rate to retreatment with aromatase inhibitors when estrogen therapy stops working.",

My friend in California had considerable assets, but lost her income and private health insurance with a cancer diagnosis when she could no longer work as self-employed. MediCal picked up the tab on her expensive treatments and hospitalizations.

Then you'll need to find supplemental insurance, including Part D drug benefits. People who receive both Medicare and Medicaid are called dual eligibles and are subject to yet different rules: http://kff.org/tag/dual-eligible/ Worth investigating before dropping or stopping other coverage. All states are mandated to offer local, personalized counseling and assistance to people with Medicare and their families through State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) https://www.medicare.gov/Contacts/#resources/ships And be sure to check out your spouse's insurance and other other benefits. Just like medicine, consult a licensed professional for guidance. Good luck, there's lots to sort out.",

The disability qualifications for both are the same and with metastatic breast cancer, you should be approved via their fast track system https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/ But there are differences. If you've worked and earned enough $ and Social Security credits, you'll get SSDI. The good news is there is no property limit ($2000 per individual). The bad news is there is a 5 month wait period for income and a further 24 month wait period for Medicare eligibility. When Medicare kicks in, you'll need to find secondary insurance to cover deductibles, co-pays and prescription costs. SSI has the property limits, but there is no waiting period for income and Medicaid kicks in immediately. Whichever program you're applying for, it's important that your disability date be as far back as reasonably possible. The date you last worked, not the date you applied. If you are granted SSI, then you might receive back payments that will take you over the $2000 property limit. There are rules about how to spend the money...you might be able to repay a loan or purchase important things for your family and yourself. And, I've heard but don't know that dependents can get Social Security income based on their parent's disability. It's important to understand the two different programs in general and your eligibilty in specific. Here's a good primer - http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/disability-... My public library has Nolo books...perhaps yours does too? Indenial, this is very complex and you'll need to contact Social Security to find out which program you are eligible for and what your income would be. Every agent seems to tell a slightly different story. When you get the story you want, try to get it in writing (make it official). Good luck finding your way through the Social Security maze. Blessings and warm wishes, Stephanie P.S. It's possible that your Obamacare representative can help you evaluate continued coverage as your situation changes.",

A new longitudinal analysis in the Lancet finds that there was an excess burden of 260,000 cancer-related deaths associated with that recession. The researchers observed that as unemployment increased, so did mortality for all cancer types examined. That held true even for those that, like breast and prostate cancer, typically have survival rates over 50 percent. Interestingly, that trend wasn't seen in all recession-hit countries. The UK, for instance, didn't see an appreciable rise in cancer deaths, likely thanks to its universal health care. Lancet story link: Economic downturns, universal health coverage, and cancer mortality in high-income and middle-income countries, 1990\u20132010: a longitudinal analysis Dr Mahiben Maruthappu, MA\u2020, Johnathan Watkins, MA\u2020, Aisyah Mohd Noor, MRes, Callum Williams, BA, Raghib Ali, DPH, Prof Richard Sullivan, MD, Prof Thomas Zeltner, MD, Prof Rifat Atun, FRCP\u2020 Published Online: 25 May 2016 Summary Background The global economic crisis has been associated with increased unemployment and reduced public-sector expenditure on health care (PEH). We estimated the effects of changes in unemployment and PEH on cancer mortality, and identified how universal health coverage (UHC) affected these relationships. Methods For this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the World Bank and WHO (1990\u20132010). We aggregated mortality data for breast cancer in women, prostate cancer in men, and colorectal cancers in men and women, which are associated with survival rates that exceed 50%, into a treatable cancer class. We likewise aggregated data for lung and pancreatic cancers, which have 5 year survival rates of less than 10%, into an untreatable cancer class. We used multivariable regression analysis, controlling for country-specific demographics and infrastructure, with time-lag analyses and robustness checks to investigate the relationship between unemployment, PEH, and cancer mortality, with and without UHC. We used trend analysis to project mortality rates, on the basis of trends before the sharp unemployment rise that occurred in many countries from 2008 to 2010, and compared them with observed rates. Results Data were available for 75 countries, representing 2106 billion people, for the unemployment analysis and for 79 countries, representing 2156 billion people, for the PEH analysis. Unemployment rises were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific cancers except lung cancer in women. By contrast, untreatable cancer mortality was not significantly linked with changes in unemployment. Lag analyses showed significant associations remained 5 years after unemployment increases for the treatable cancer class. Rerunning analyses, while accounting for UHC status, removed the significant associations. All-cancer, treatable cancer, and specific cancer mortalities significantly decreased as PEH increased. Time-series analysis provided an estimate of more than 40 000 excess deaths due to a subset of treatable cancers from 2008 to 2010, on the basis of 2000\u201307 trends. Most of these deaths were in non-UHC countries. Interpretation Unemployment increases are associated with rises in cancer mortality; UHC seems to protect against this effect. PEH increases are associated with reduced cancer mortality. Access to health care could underlie these associations. We estimate that the 2008\u201310 economic crisis was associated with about 260 000 excess cancer-related deaths in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development alone. Funding None.",

I treasure these quiet moments before life kicks into noise. How fortunate that nausea woke me and I saw the acorn woodpeckers flitting to their dead pine apartment building, the sky backlit by dawn clouds. It's funny, I used to be so very social and connected, but these years of living on my own have made me protective of my own private and quiet life. With death coming, I feel that slipping away - people come daily to take care of me. Just 2-6 hours and they aren't guests - are responsible for their own food, drink and work. Sometimes I sleep through much of their \"visit\". But each moment of life on my own reminds me how it's all slipping through my fingers. And that I never feel alone when in relationship with self, nature and the unseen worlds. Anyway, I'm thinking of you and how it must feel to be the strong one for your daughter. And to know you'll soon again be exposed as \"the cancer patient\". Sometimes being with others while being perceived as \"other\" isn't belonging, so much as feeling separated, apart from them, an object of pity or concern.

There's still so much life to enjoy! ~ Stephanie PS, thanks for the pointer to the NYT article, dear Rosevalley! Here's the paragraph you referred to that's within a longer blog post about an upcoming study. \"Studies showing that obese and overweight women are more likely to die of their breast cancer date back decades. Just two years ago, a meta-analysis crunched the numbers from more than 80 studies involving more than 200,000 women with breast cancer, and reported that women who were obese when diagnosed had a 41 percent greater risk of death, while women who were overweight but whose body mass index was under 30 had a 7 percent greater risk.\" http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/putting-b... Here's the free full text for the meta-analysis referred to in the article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC417644... It's a bit ironic for me to read now, because I'm likely to die of underweight, not overweight...but it's exciting there are things we can do to improve our quality and quantity of life. So few truly controllable factors in this f'ing disease.",

I do remember when you were limping along through December 2015 trying to get to Christmas concerts and festivities. Seasons have passed and your moments of reprieve stretched into summertime. Then, bam! Here you are again. This time you have the DWD meds - no thanks to your insurance company. But thanks to your perseverance. Rosevalley, we're both so strongly aligned with life and being here to support and love those we care for. Yours is a nuclear family and my loved ones are my extended chosen family. We want to keep showing up to make a positive difference for those we love. And yet, at some point, I feel, we must choose to enter the greater stream of life-death-life. Buddhism and nature teach us that all of life is a circle turning turning. We can try to hold back time and the seasons, but still they come on, regardless of our individual needs and plans. I recently read of the difference between the ancient Greek words zoe and bios. While both mean life, zoe is the infinite and universal life. Bios is the finite and individual life. Zoe is Life. Bios is life expressed in time and space, our individual lives.* A lifetime of being alive gives us the perspective that our individual lives matter most. This is reinforced when others rely on us - as your family certainly rely on you and my friends and family rely on me. Yet, I take comfort in those cyclical expressions of Zoe - the greater life force. To return to that strengthens me. Maybe the return will strengthen you too, dear Rosevalley. We are both Zoe and bios - greater and manifest beings. Sending much loving kindness as we both contemplate our edges. Big hugs too! Stephanie xxx * \"In reality, the difference between Biological life and Spiritual life is so important that I am going to give them two distinct names. \"The Biological sort which come to us through Nature, and which (like everything else in Nature) is always tending to run down and decay so that it can only be kept up by incessant subsidies from Nature in the form of air, water, food, etc. is Bios. \"The Spiritual life which is in God from all eternity, and which made the whole natural universe is Zoe. \"Bios has, to be sure, a certain shadowy or symbolic resemblance to Zoe: but only the sort of resemblance there is between a photo and a place, or statue and a man. \"A man who changed from having Bios to having Zoe would have gone through as big a change as a statue which changed from being a carved stone to being a real man.\" Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis (p. 159)",

I can only imagine how your husband feels now and how his sister's death will link with yours, coming so close together in time (if all goes as we think it will, though I swear you've got a few more lifetimes as Rosevalley). And, as we both know, special needs family members are deeply woven into the family fabric...not stray threads, but often integral to the functioning of the whole family. You don't have to be a mom or a dad to matter! I don't even have Tribe yet, but I'm already noodling on the topic and want to start up our book group while we're alive and well enough to attend. :) bco isn't really a tribe, but more of a nation - some of the forums function as cities or towns, many of the individual topics as neighborhoods or tribes. (thanks to Divine who introduced this metaphor here). The book Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity by Andrew Solomon has been with me recently - you must have read it? You can read his work on the deaf and deaf community here http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/defiantly-deaf/ Or watch this short video:  I'm excited to read The Tribe as I've spent my lifetime building community. Like many of my geography and generation, I broke away from the family of origin, church and dominant culture as my tribe and sought others with similarities (age, interest, enthusiasm, intelligence, contrariness, commitment, etc.). Oddly, as I age and approach death, I find I'm most interested in what's in others' hearts and if we have warm, mutually supportive connections, then I treasure our unique and diverse beings. Does that make sense? I treasure both individuality and connection/community. Tribe can make collective life possible, while limiting individual lives and options. I often ponder the reality that traditional tribes had to live with diverse members. Yes, severely disabled babies might be left out to die and those who betrayed tribal life might be exiled, a fatal outcome. Tribes fought and killed one another and some so exploited their environment, that their tribe was extinguished or absorbed into other tribes. The shadow side of tribes based on similarities is the casting out of the different other. Now that war has gone nuclear and post-nuclear, I worry that all could be destroyed based on polarization. Coming together has its upsides and downsides. For some reason, I'm reminded of Kara Walker's art work A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby.  She is a master at holding the paradox of pride and oppression, togetherness and alienation, culture and exploitation. I wish I could find video footage of audience reactions to the installation - it was a fascinating exploration!! Well, my dear friend, Rosevalley, I hope this feeds you a bit today. Your family and you continue to be in my loving, healing meditations. Sending much loving kindness for all of us, Stephanie",

Each wears a name tag \u2014 and on that name tag is a common sexual term: \"Ejaculation.\" \"Orgasm.\" \"Condom.\" One by one they introduce themselves by the name on their tag.

The moms and dads are bashful at first, but after signing for a few minutes, they're laughing at themselves. Let's face it: Talking about sex can be awkward. Having \"the talk\" is hard enough \u2014 but throw in ASL, and a lot of adults \u2014 whether it's a teacher in the classroom or mom and dad at home \u2014 can be completely stumped. While the speaking world has convenient euphemisms for much of this stuff, in ASL some of the signs are, to put it mildly, pretty graphic. And that can make teachers and parents very uncomfortable. \"There's a fear of, especially in ASL, the signs being pretty explicit at times, so desensitization is really key,\" continued at: http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/08/24/46629954...

You raise several interesting points about Tribe and I'm in agreement with you that I too appreciate others' perspectives on topics of mutual interest. Yes, I want to believe we will draw together into new tribes in the face of natural and man-made disasters. I think this is going to become ever more important as systems continue to collapse in face of global climate change and continued population explosion. Can we grow as human beings to embrace even the rejected as our own? Or will we stick to our cultural tribes, preferring always and only to support those who are like us and to fight against those who aren't? \"We are all tattooed in our cradles with the beliefs of our tribe; the record may seem superficial, but it is indelible.\" ~ Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Maybe we can get beyond our tribes of birth - you and I have certainly devoted substantial life energy to living/being the change we wish to see in the world. In this time of ecological, economic, social and cultural upheaval, will we resort to tribal ways? There are certainly huge political and religious movements that seek solutions in us-vs.-them and even war and walls. My surprise over the book was that while I agreed with many of Junger's points/assumptions, I didn't like how he argued for his conclusions. Yes, banding together is better than breaking apart in crisis, but are war and disaster our best guides and inspirations? It doesn't help at all that I'm unfamiliar with men/males/masculine archetypes and the military! Well, Rosevalley, it doesn't really matter to me if I like what life brings. Nor if I agree with it. Can I still find a way to appreciate what challenges me (evokes a response)? Can I be interested in process - the author's and my own? You know me, I don't wait around to be a victim. I'm fully capable of putting down a book if I don't want to spend time with the topic, tone, author, characters or poor writing (I just put a different book down this morning). But Tribe was short enough to keep my attention. Will it gain my appreciation? Yesterday, I gave Tribe to my friend who was in the military and is now a philosopher/physicist. He's super-smart and had read a recent book review that had piqued his interest. Plus, his former country erupted into civil war after he left in the late 1980s - so he can see/feel war from a distance of time, but not of tribe/family, region. So, I've already gained a book club with you, a good conversation with a good friend and hope of another good conversation with him. What could be better than that! Just a thought about how this relates to cancer? I do think bco and my other online and in-person cancer and disease support groups are often strengthened by adversity - a shared diagnosis has united me with many I'd not otherwise know. And there are many times cancer feels like a war (you know I loathe that metaphor!), because conditions can be so brutal and there seems to be so little freedom of choice. I don't like cancer and serious illness - that doesn't matter. Nor do I always agree with it - though gratitude practice helps me accept the things I cannot change. Yet, I appreciate the wholly different opportunities for learning and growth that they've brought to life. I feel similarly about this book - I appreciate it, without liking it! And that's just fine. Really. :) Thanks for starting this book club and keeping me engaged, Rosevalley. It's lovely to noodle while reclining. warmest of loving kindness for you and everyone too, Stephanie PS, The future might take many different directions, besides militarization and polarization, as systems continue to fail.

Just typing up your conundrum is exhausting, sweet Rosevalley. I can't imagine how living in the thick of it is. That's why there are fur babies, gardens and loving, supportive friends like us. Hope you you can release with ease into our warm and loving virtual embrace.

Yet, you've always welcomed me and I am grateful for you, our connection here. Rosevalley, I do look forward to meeting up with you on the other side. I'd recognize you anywhere! Yet, of all you've taught me over these months, the greatest is not to have expectations of what life and death will bring. You've been pulled back so many times.

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2016 09:49PM - edited Aug 28, 2016 09:58PM by Longtermsurvivor Good morning, dear Rosevalley, Here's my book report on Sebastian Junger's Tribe: I was surprised that this book didn't capture my interest or imagination. I thought it would be about tribes - traditional and modern, but it focused mostly on men, the military and war. I enjoy hearing, talking, reading, reflecting and acting on his topics: American Indian tribal life; US & world history; war's effects on humans, culture and the environment; community; PTSD; attachment theory; income/resource inequality; exploitation and colonialism; healing and recovery; forgiveness and letting go; and what modern folks can learn and integrate from indigenous and traditional folks to co-create a more just, sustainable and resilient future. Well, to be honest, I know next to nothing about men, male-dominant culture and the military. As a lifelong pacifist, I've not so much recoiled from war as sought non-violent solutions to historical and global issues. While Junger wasn't exactly a proponent of war and the military, he accepts and celebrates them and their ability to evoke loyalty, belonging and meaning. He contrasts this with affluent, disconnected, meaningless and purposeless lives lived by many moderns. I'm fortunate to live in the San Francisco Bay Area where thousands of people have come to co-create new ways of life for themselves and the next generation - lives that draw on native and indigenous tribal wisdom; the modern electronically connected age; harmonious ecological relationships; and care for the seventh generation of all beings living and yet to come into being. It's no stretch for me to imagine a future that incorporates the \"best of\", because I know so many who've devoted their lifetimes to it. I'm a fifth generation Californian and I know that my ancestors from here and elsewhere all sought better lives for themselves and us. And that better wasn't only measured by economic, professional and social success - but by community responsibility for all including the least among us. Junger's polarity between tribal life and modern life is a false polarity in my experience. Another problem I had throughout the book was his faulty reasoning - he too often misconstrued correlation with causation and then passed value judgements on his untested theories - an example is that society honors our military veterans by listening and encouraging them to self-identify as human heroes, not victims or villains. Those who don't want to take time to read the book's few essay-chapters can read much of it here: HOW PTSD BECAME A PROBLEM FAR BEYOND THE BATTLEFIELD Though only 10 percent of American forces see combat, the U.S. military now has the highest rate of post-traumatic stress disorder in its history. Sebastian Junger investigates. BY SEBASTIAN JUNGER MAY 7, 2015 (excerpt follows) http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/05/ptsd-war-ho... Well, my nausea has calmed down and I hope to sleep now. Looking forward to hearing from you, Rosevalley. And from anyone else who's taken on this short, thought-provoking book. early morning regards and loving kindness, Stephanie xxx excerpt from article: Any discussion of PTSD and its associated sense of alienation in society must address the fact that many soldiers find themselves missing the war after it's over. That troubling fact can be found in written accounts from war after war, country after country, century after century. Awkward as it is to say, part of the trauma of war seems to be giving it up. There are ancient human behaviors in war\u2014loyalty, inter-reliance, cooperation\u2014that typify good soldiering and can't be easily found in modern society. This can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even civilians are susceptible to\u2026 What all these people seem to miss isn't danger or loss, per se, but the closeness and cooperation that danger and loss often engender. Humans evolved to survive in extremely harsh environments, and our capacity for cooperation and sharing clearly helped us do that. Structurally, a band of hunter-gatherers and a platoon in combat are almost exactly the same: in each case, the group numbers between 30 and 50 individuals, they sleep in a common area, they conduct patrols, they are completely reliant on one another for support, comfort, and defense, and they share a group identity that most would risk their lives for. Personal interest is subsumed into group interest because personal survival is not possible without group survival. From an evolutionary perspective, it's not at all surprising that many soldiers respond to combat in positive ways and miss it when it's gone. There are obvious psychological stresses on a person in a group, but there may be even greater stresses on a person in isolation. Most higher primates, including humans, are intensely social, and there are few examples of individuals surviving outside of a group. A modern soldier returning from combat goes from the kind of close-knit situation that humans evolved for into a society where most people work outside the home, children are educated by strangers, families are isolated from wider communities, personal gain almost completely eclipses collective good, and people sleep alone or with a partner. Even if he or she is in a family, that is not the same as belonging to a large, self-sufficient group that shares and experiences almost everything collectively. Whatever the technological advances of modern society\u2014and they're nearly miraculous\u2014the individual lifestyles that those technologies spawn may be deeply brutalizing to the human spirit. xxx One could say that combat vets are the White Indians of today, and that they miss the war because it was, finally, an experience of human closeness that they can't easily find back home. Not the closeness of family, which is rare enough, but the closeness of community and tribe.",

The former was buddingly commercial; the latter was communal and tribal. As time went by, the settlers from Europe noticed something: No Indians were defecting to join colonial society, but many whites were defecting to live in the Native American one. This struck them as strange. Colonial society was richer and more advanced. And yet people were voting with their feet the other way. The colonials occasionally tried to welcome Native American children into their midst, but they couldn't persuade them to stay. Benjamin Franklin observed the phenomenon in 1753, writing, \"When an Indian child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian ramble with them, there is no persuading him ever to return.\" During the wars with the Indians, many European settlers were taken prisoner and held within Indian tribes. After a while, they had plenty of chances to escape and return, and yet they did not. In fact, when they were \"rescued,\" they fled and hid from their rescuers. Sometimes the Indians tried to forcibly return the colonials in a prisoner swap, and still the colonials refused to go. In one case, the Shawanese Indians were compelled to tie up some European women in order to ship them back. After they were returned, the women escaped the colonial towns and ran back to the Indians. Even as late as 1782, the pattern was still going strong. Hector de Crèvecoeur wrote, \"Thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of those aborigines having from choice become European.\" I first read about this history several months ago in Sebastian Junger's excellent book \"Tribe.\" It has haunted me since. It raises the possibility that our culture is built on some fundamental error about what makes people happy and fulfilled. The native cultures were more communal. As Junger writes, \"They would have practiced extremely close and involved child care. And they would have done almost everything in the company of others. They would have almost never been alone.\" If colonial culture was relatively atomized, imagine American culture of today. As we've gotten richer, we've used wealth to buy space: bigger homes, bigger yards, separate bedrooms, private cars, autonomous lifestyles. Each individual choice makes sense, but the overall atomizing trajectory sometimes seems to backfire. According to the World Health Organization, people in wealthy countries suffer depression by as much as eight times the rate as people in poor countries. There might be a Great Affluence Fallacy going on \u2014 we want privacy in individual instances, but often this makes life generally worse. Every generation faces the challenge of how to reconcile freedom and community \u2014 \"On the Road\" versus \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" But I'm not sure any generation has faced it as acutely as millennials.",

Here's a story with illustrations that my friend sent to me yesterday: Yesterday I was given a Monarch butterfly chrysalis to watch. It was a stunning celedon green with a line of tiny sparkling gold dots and more gold dots in other areas. You could just make out the orange and black wings through the chrysalis. This morning the chrysalis was black with the wings showing brightly through the chrysalis. I waited and took lots of pictures trying for the perfect focus for the big event. Finally she emerged quickly, in spurts, not slow like a baby chick. Her wings were tiny, her abdomen was large. With twists and turns she pumped the liquid from her abdomen to the veins in her wings. She hung by her toes while her wings expanded. When done she rested for 2 hours. I then brought her outside so she could feel the sun and the breeze. She changed her position getting ready to fly but kept one toe on the old chrysalis. Finally, silently she flew away. What a wonderful day, for her and me !

May they continue to kick cancer's butt and be kind to you. re. genetic testing and your insurance company's refusal to pay, there are many ways to go about straightening this out! The issue came up recently at www.smartpatients.com (free registration required). In spite of an ovarian cancer diagnosis, a member's insurance company denied payment for her genetic testing, for the same reasons yours did - \"EXPERMENTAL/INVESTIGATIONAL SERVICES ARE NOT COVERED: Experimental or investigational treatments, procedures, devices or drugs are those that\u2026æ Turns out, Myriad replied, \"they wrote back that \"the test that was denied by your insurance plans is for a newer test and we are not contracted with your insurance plan for\" - so they adjusted my account to zero.\" Too bad no one told her and she was dragged through the emotional dirt for months of thinking she'd have to pay out-of-pocket before the matter was clarified and resolved. xxx Here's some of what I found about the newer test: Genetic testing in situations like yours isn't experimental or investigational, but standard medical practice...has been for years now. This NYT article seems to address your plight:  Two advances in tests for the genes that carry an added risk of breast cancer promise to make the process less expensive and more precise.www.nytimes.com But, not all insurance companies are on board with paying for the new test. Testing of the BRCA genes has generally been limited by medical guidelines to women who already have cancer or those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancers. Insurers generally have not paid for BRCA tests for other women, and some insurers are not paying at all for a newer type of screening known as a panel test that analyzes from 10 to 40 genes at once. xxx See this from the USA National Cancer Institute: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevent... In December 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women who have family members with breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer be evaluated to see if they have a family history that is associated with an increased risk of a harmful mutation in one of these genes. Several screening tools are now available to help health care providers with this evaluation. These tools assess family history factors that are associated with an increased likelihood of having a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, including: xxx If you're peeved, that's fine, but if you want a resolution quickly, contact Myriad and ask whether your insurance company was charged for the newer type of screening. If so, ask them to please write it off! If your insurance company refuses to pay for the usual type of cancer screening, then kick and scream. It's considered regular & necessary since you were diagnosed under age 50...and I think in both breasts too. xxx Sorry you're caught in another insurance snafu, my dear Rosevalley.

Our thoughts color our days light or gray. We are constantly in interaction with our environments - inner and outer, drug-induced and relieved by others's loving concern for us. Rosevalley, I wish there were a little better balance between your and my outer environments. I've been celebrating the cool gray skies - yesterday we had a few showers - because the drought has so injured the plant beings I deeply love. Everyone is celebrating and pushing out leaves, flowers and even little fruits. They don't know how long the waters will flow. Sunshine unfolds in moments of time here - calm and gentle at first, then intense and harsh. The green grasses are going gold. Blooms unfold. Tender foliage wilts at noon, revives at sunset. Rosevalley, we both love plants and gardens so much! For many decades visits to botanical gardens and arboretums were my reward for medical visits and procedures. I even became a docent at a local botanical garden. Yesterday, when I was making photos for Patty and you, I remembered taking out members of a botanical illustration group from San Francisco. They wanted not just the lush blooms and foliage, but the faded leaves, the blackened seeds, the wilted petals. They wanted elements of death to emphasize the cycles of life inherent in nature. And humans are part of nature, though we try to set ourselves apart. You and I see our dying parts and our still alive, engaged parts - coexisting together! Always changing. I'm up early so I could take zofran and stop hiccuping in my sleep. Now, I'm waiting to drain the liter plus that I take daily. Each time I drain, I thank you, that I needn't fill to two liters every other day. Each time I drain, I have a little ritual. Drink 2 cups of water, drain, lie down and sleep for 60-90 minutes. My blood pressure tanks, my head swims, I can't push on when just empty. If the pattern follows, I'll wake ravenous and scarf as much protein as possible as quickly as possible. Then my day will begin again. It's my personal ritual. Rosevalley, you are not alone. I am here just hundreds of miles and a few watersheds to the south of you. Of course, I will reach out to you. Of course, this is a wonderful way to start my day. :) Wishing you joy wrapped in loving kindness, Stephanie",

Healing wishes, Stephanie  FOR A FRIEND ON THE ARRIVAL OF ILLNESS John O'Donohue Now is the time of dark invitation Beyond a frontier that you did not expect; Abruptly, your old life seems distant.  You barely noticed how each day opened A path through fields never questioned, Yet expected deep down to hold treasure.  Now your time on earth becomes full of threat; Before your eyes your future shrinks.  You lived absorbed in the day to day, So continuous with everything around you, That you could forget you were separate;  Now this dark companion has come between you, Distances have opened in your eyes, You feel that against your will A stranger has married your heart.  Nothing before has made you Feel so isolated and lost.  When the reverberations of shock subside in you, May grace come to restore you to balance. May it shape a new space in your heart To embrace this illness as a teacher Who has come to open your life to new worlds.  May you find in yourself A courageous hospitality Towards what is difficult, Painful and unknown.  May you use this illness As a lantern to illuminate The new qualities that will emerge in you.  May the fragile harvesting of this slow light Help you to release whatever has become false in you. May you trust this light to clear a path Through all the fog of old unease and anxiety Until you feel arising within you a tranquility Profound enough to call the storm to stillness.  May you find the wisdom to listen to your illness: Ask it why it came. Why it chose your friendship. Where it wants to take you. What it wants you to know. What quality of space it wants to create in you. What you need to learn to become more fully yourself That your presence may shine in the world.  May you keep faith with your body, Learning to see it as a holy sanctuary Which can bring this night-wound gradually Towards the healing and freedom of dawn.  May you be granted the courage and vision To work through passivity and self-pity, To see the beauty you can harvest From the riches of this dark invitation.  May you learn to receive it graciously, And promise to learn swiftly That it may leave you newborn, Willing to dedicate your time to birth. Listen here: http://canadapodcasts.ca/podcasts/OnBeingWith/3325429 xxx Willingness implies a surrendering of one's self-separateness, an entering-into, an immersion in the deepest processes of life itself. It is a realization that one already is a part of some ultimate cosmic process and it is a commitment to participation in that process. In contrast, willfulness is a setting of oneself apart from the fundamental essence of life in an attempt to master, direct, control, or otherwise manipulate existence. More simply, willingness is saying yes to the mystery of being alive in each moment. Willfulness is saying no, or perhaps more commonly, \"Yes, but. . . .\" Gerald G. May, Will and Spirit: A Contemplative Psychology (HarperSanFrancisco: 1982)",

Somehow, in spite of the N&V, you did. And you just keep making those important dates, yesterday your DH's birthday. Next, summer holidays for your DD3 and the long stretch toward her next school year. Rose, you keep surprising everyone! I'm praying you can do it without N&V and the worst aspects of living with MBC. I'm praying that you continue to encompass the full range of your life!

It sounds like your MIL's medical management could use some fine tuning. She has an unresolved UTI causing pain - can that get cleared up with a different regimen? Is the catheter causing or worsening the UTI? Can she be weaned off of it? It's nice that the Lyrica relieves the pain, but that's just masking the underlying problem by treating one symptom. I take Lyrica (half a 50 mg capsule at bedtime) for nerve pain along with other drugs for cancer-related pain. It was prescribed by my palliative care doctor who is now my hospice doctor. Belluan, can you advocate to see a palliative care specialist who specializes in pain control to work out a pain management program, since she has so many different pain-causing issues and some can't be resolved by treatment for the underlying problems (I think UTIs can be resolved, cancer, maybe not so much)? https://getpalliativecare.org Also, is there a psychologist, social worker or chaplain at her cancer center or in her community (a minister, priest or trusted other) who can listen and support her other needs? She may need meds, but a loving, listening ear can go a long way toward easing suffering. You shouldn't be her only confidante, since it sounds like you're her primary medical advocate. Belluan, you're in a tough situation. Your MIL does have some limited options for improving quality of life, but it sounds like her medical team isn't working together on her behalf. Yet. I hope you find the necessary help you need. A good place to start might be to ask the visiting physiotherapist for referrals for pain management and seeking resolution of the UTI. healing regards, Stephanie",

During the past year, I've had more trouble with pain, swelling, fullness, nausea, reflux and ascites. I was told the cancer now coats the outside of my liver and is in peritoneum - both give me ascites, which leads to similar symptoms. The doctors attribute the pain to both swelling liver and tumors on the outside - anything that causes the liver capsule to stretch or twinge can be painful - whether the culprit is on the inside or the outside. I'm currently taking tramadol and various natural remedies for the pain. For the nausea zofran, reglan and more natural remedies are holding the line. Hospice seems remarkably well informed, ready, willing and able to help with my variety of symptoms, not only pain. btw, I read one case report of a woman with breast cancer whose tumor-filled liver reached within an inch of her pubic bone. Whenever I feel too sorry for my ascites-squished guts, I think of how it would be without an indwelling drain and a chance to relieve the pressure. Singing praises of modern medicine and how that drain has freed up my life. good wishes to all my liver sisters, Stephanie",

Most of my attention is focused on that, but I visit other bco topics/threads to keep up with others in similar circumstances. bco really has critical mass for breast cancer, but you've a resource at SP that I don't know whether you've fully tapped. You can post with the tags <liver mets> and <crossing disease boundaries>, adding RFA and other related terms (I think they're tags too). Since these treatments cross disease boundaries, you can draw on the experiences of many there who have different primaries but need treatment for liver mets. As I said, I'm beyond aggressive treatments and on hospice, so don't spend much time on this topic, in spite of having many mets in and around liver. Nina, happy to see you here and hope you find all the best sub-groups for you at bco! warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

I feel like I'm going to be dead before the end of the year. I want to go curl up and cry. Wth!? Progression while on chemo? Ugh. Thought that was killing cells. I'm freaking out!!!!!\" Others here have done a fantastic job of offering reassurance, advice and personal examples of beating the odds. I want you to know that I heard your freak out and anger that you had progression while on chemo. And that your doctor said one thing at your visit and another on the phone. It is totally scary to feel your body change and worry about progression, then to get news that it's true! Lvin, it's really important not to mentally go to the \"worst case\" or \"best case\" scenario, because none of us, including you, have any idea how this is really going to unfold. My wish for you is that you reach out and find supports to hold onto - our virtual hands, our stories, a more in-tune and communicative doctor, hope for an effective treatment, a mind-body or spiritual practice, and maybe some anti-anxiety medication. This is really hard news to get, especially the way it was delivered. Of course, there will be freak-out. And it's good to sometimes step back from the panic and see that none of us know the future. And that those feelings will change too...if you keep reaching out. Sending much loving kindness, Lvin, Stephanie",

In newly diagnosed hormone positive mets, it's usual to start with an anti-hormonal aromatase inhibitor (Aromasin, Arimidex or Femara) perhaps combined with Ibrance or Afinitor, rather than chemotherapy. The hope is to control the disease with less aggressive treatments (we hope they're effective, but may have to give them 3 or more months to know). Many with mets say living with mets is a marathon compared to the sprint of earlier stage disease and treatment. I've taken to calling it an obstacle course with ever new obstacles to confront and overcome. Kathy, please let us know more and we'll help how we can. Also, I assume that you'll receive Zometa or Xgeva for the bone mets? You didn't mention it? Sending warm rays of healing light for you, Stephanie",

In my first year-plus with known liver mets, I was asymptomatic, then ascites kicked in early 2015, finally leading to an implanted drain in August 2015. My liver began to swell a little before then and is increasingly painful. I hear the pain is due to tumors on the liver's outside and the liver capsule swelling. My liver markers didn't go up when I was still getting blood tests (stopped at autumn equinox). And I'm still not jaundiced. I've had three scans of any type during the past 2.5+ years of multiple liver mets and have never had a liver biopsy. There seems to be some variation in how liver mets present, progress and are addressed (sorry, rhyme attack). Also, I first was diagnosed with a lung tumor in 1999 and have never had it biopsied. Nor did I have it regularly imaged until 2008 when pleural effusion became problematic. More variation. May be regional or historical. I think monitoring and biopsy are far more aggressive now than in the past. There've been many changes in treatment options too. Different oncologists treat differently. And different patients demand different treatments. (I'm conservative and others are more aggressive.) When I was on palliative care (2011-2015), I continued to get infrequent imaging tests (mostly chest x-rays - less radiation) and monthly blood tests. Now that I'm on hospice, I get neither. It works well for me. Used to need to know everything. Now I have some idea how much I don't and can't know and am in acceptance. Change and variation, Stephanie",

I'm not a medical professional, but am a professional patient. I was born with a genetic mutation (first in family) that produces gastrointestinal polyps from a young age and 93% increased risk of cancer in multiple organs at all ages (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). It's not a BRCA mutation, but presents it's own challenges. What the BRCA folks and I share is an autosomal dominant germline mutation that predisposes us to cancer. Autosomal mutations are in contrast to gender-linked syndromes. Dominant mutations have a 50-50 chance of being passed on to each child. This is in contrast to to recessive mutations that don't manifest in offspring, unless both parents have the same mutation. And germline mutations mean every single cell in the body is affected because the mutation occurred at or shortly after egg-sperm fertilization. This contrasts with somatic mutations - a mutation that occurs in the body some time after the person develops Somatic mutations are frequently caused by environmental factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation or to certain chemicals. Cancer can also cause somatic mutations. What Dani has is a somatic mutation of a BRCA gene in some part(s) of her tumor. This doesn't mean that she has a germline BRCA germline mutation from her father or you and it can't be passed on to her children because it's not in her germline (eggs). What it does mean is the cancer developed more and more mutations as it evolved. That's what cancer does - tries to outlive its host while stripping us of nutrients, etc. These are our cells gone bad or rogue. They are naturally occurring mistakes in cell growth, survival (autophagy), growth and migration (angiogenesis), metastasis and more. If you want to get geeky, here's an abstract of a medical journal article on the Hallmarks of Cancer: \"The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list\u2014reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the \"tumor microenvironment.\" Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ~ http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00127-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411001279%3Fshowall%3Dtrue Targeted therapies like Lynparza (a PARP-inhibotro) address just one particular somatic mutation or its effects of one portion of a person's cancer. It works by going after a single target, like the mutation that Dani's cancer has developed. Here's a bco article on the topic: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/experime... And here's an article on PARP inhibitors in BRCA+ cancer: http://www.curetoday.com/articles/combination-with-lynparza-gains-traction-in-breast-and-ovarian-cancers Momallthetime - this is a lot of information to digest, but I know you're a researcher as well as strong advocate for Dani.

What a dear one she was, so invested in living; so sure there were paths to cure that I just needed to find; certain that even thinking of death would cause it. Much has happened and while I've tenderness for the younger me, I see things on differently now. Mom, it sounds like Dani's health care givers are on the ball, considering all the options, willing to weed some out, wanting to broaden the conversation to include the unwanted \"what-if nothing else works?\" topic. Can you trust them to know the cancer and treatment territories? Can you lean into their expertise? Can you expand your perspective to include all possibilities, so you can then focus on your best-case scenario? You've often written that you've felt you've had to carry the hard news for Dani. That makes sense. You are her mom! You've been watching out for her her whole life long! And her cancer journey is arduous, unrelenting, heart-rending. Surely, you can look at the possible dangers ahead and consider strategies with her treatment team, even if you don't want the possible outcome? Please take what you like and leave the rest. I'm really speaking to my younger self - asking her to open her eyes, mind and heart to all possibilities, so she could then focus on her best case scenario.

As they say, please take what you like and leave the rest. Actually, I became symptomatic with breast cancer at age 34, 26 years ago this month. And I've been dealing with advanced breast cancer ever since. Although I didn't have children, I was in a new relationship at the time, climbing my personal/professional career ladder, building my savings, finally beginning to travel, doing things that were super important to me. Cancer wiped them all from my life. Steam used to rise from my ears when I heard women who were 50, 60 and 70 bemoaning their early stage breast cancer and the short-term interruption it caused them. Sometimes in support groups or oncology waiting rooms, I had to bite my tongue and there steam still rose as I gave them their equal time to kvetch. I'd ungraciously think, but you lived to 40, 50, 60 or older without this taking so much from you. I don't understand how Dani feels and I imagine she would be happy to live another decade or two to fulfill her dreams and life purpose. Her children and family are already grieving. I do understand my own experience and am grateful I have finally made peace with it. And with others' molehills that appear to be mountains to them. It's all a matter of perspective. I can't know Dani's or yours perspectives beyond what you share here, but you are not alone. And I do so appreciate your ability to keep showing up for Dani in spite of the terrific pain of her suffering and early death. And I'm grateful she is still here to experience the many joys and fulfillments life can still bring. This isn't really a rant, but rather a reaching across what appears to be the huge gap between us. Maybe the distance isn't as great as it seems. love for all, Stephanie",

It could still be an earlier stage of breast cancer (Stage II or III).

Your aunt is likely to be asked to have additional scans or tests to see if it has spread. Of course, it's her choice to take the next steps and to share what she wants with you.

Here's a recipe to be whipped up in a Vitamix blender.* None of the roughage is removed, just pulverized into bulk. There just isn't room in in squished up stomachs for over a quart of \"food\" - a cup of kale plus two cups of fibrous fruit a cup of cup of liquid and a cup of ice. Not in a boat, not with a goat! Better yet, feed the smoothie to your goat and tuck into an egg and some cheese - about 1 cup of food that's low roughage, high protein and contains quality fats. This will be nourishing, digestible and managable for us! Many in the nutrition world think frozen foods aren't fit for timid tummies, but it's 95º here today and I'm enjoying a homemade lime and ginger fizzy drink. That goes down easy and quells nausea and dry mouth. What's healthy for one, isn't healthy for all! Wishing you renewed health and well-being every day, my dear friend! ~ Stephanie P.S. I don't have any suggestions about hair, but hope this helps with N&V - they are so very icky! * Green smoothie recipe To one cup of ice add: * Column A (Choose 1 Item) Column B (Choose 2 Items) Column C (Choose 1 Item)",

Their sinuous limbs, smooth dark red bark and dense wood make them touchable, traceable with fingers and palm. When the iridescent hummingbirds perch on the tiny twigs, they are more beautiful than any human-made ornament. The way manzanita grow with and around their dead wood reminds me of us, how we incorporate our scars - the cracks where the light gets in.

Having lived my whole life with a rare, incurable, barely treatable illness, I've wandered far from the path of expecting, wanting or needing data to support my care decisions. After nearly 60 years in this body, I trust my body's wisdom/intuition as the greatest authority on how I can live well. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer 25 years ago, I actually celebrated! My previous medical research into my genetic condition had yielded only anecdotes, most of them depressing and distressing. Breast cancer - well, I knew women who'd had it and could actually engage experts, statistics and research to plot my course. In 1990, what seemed like a very good chance of cure, bilateral mastectomies with no reconstruction, quickly turned to recurrence and I've seemed to remain in the 1% of losers and winners ever since. My course is unique and for a long time, what I cared most about was how to live as long and well as possible. Now that I'm on hospice, what I care most about is living well by contributing to the greater good of the world - human, natural and divine. Is there anyone here who can say that their case of breast cancer is absolutely, statistically average? That they've followed all the proven treatments and received all the proven benefits without any of the harms? That there's a magic bullet or shield in conventional, complementary, integrative or alternative approaches? I've yet to meet that person! I welcome anecdotes, because they tell me about the human spirit, the nature of human existence, choices that did or didn't work for others. I welcome stories, because I am human and stories feed my sense of possibility and it doesn't matter to me whether the teller lost or won, but how they lived and faced their challenges. It's all an exploration! ",

Proponents of conventional medicine have not only their tools, drugs, methodologies, but also a world view that's often in contrast to proponents of alternative medicine. I've walked on both sides and respect the strengths and weaknesses of both systems. There are folks offering false promises on both sides and those of the purest of hearts and deepest of concerns for their patients. Some things \"work\" in both systems, but many things don't when facing advanced breast cancer. You are right - complementary (not complimentary - free) medicine is a bridge medicine that combines the best of both worlds for the greater well-being and care of the patient. Many large cancer centers and even smaller ones offer complementary (aka integrative) care to their patients that includes counseling, nutritional advice, acupuncture and support for lifestyle changes. Most offer support groups too, because many patients swear by them and research even supports support groups for improving and possibly prolonging life. I want to point out that we're engaged in a huge experiment here at bco - we're participating in support groups. Will they cure cancer? No. Will they lead to increased quality of life? Maybe. Will our hearts be broken when members suffer and die? Probably. Will we find support and good advice for finding new ways of coping with and confronting the beast? Seem to. Will we help one another find and stick to treatments? Likely. Is there an increased survival advantage to support groups, whether in person or online? All worth thinking about. Not really worth waiting for a double blind study to justify the value of support groups like the bco experiment. If we're happy being here, we're happier and it's not a waste of our time or energy. If we're not, then we can wander on to what is more healing for us. The work of Stanford oncologist David Spiegel, MD has long interested me. In his 1989 Lancet article, Effect of psychosocial treatment on survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer, he reported, \"The effect of psychosocial intervention on time of survival of 86 patients with metastatic breast cancer was studied prospectively. The 1 year intervention consisted of weekly supportive group therapy with self-hypnosis for pain. Both the treatment (n = 50) and control groups (n = 36) had routine oncological care. At 10 year follow-up, only 3 of the patients were alive, and death records were obtained for the other 83. Survival from time of randomisation and onset of intervention was a mean 36.6 (SD 37.6) months in the intervention group compared with 18.9 (10.8) months in the control group, a significant difference. Survival plots indicated that divergence in survival began at 20 months after entry, or 8 months after intervention ended.\" A later 2007 study seemed to refute the survival benefit for most participants, but noted, \"The newest research did, however, confirm that support groups improved quality of life for the participants\". In the journal article abstract the improved quality of life wasn't mentioned, but the improved survival of those with ER- disease was - Effects of supportive-expressive group therapy on survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer: a randomized prospective trial (free full text article available at the link). His further research has supported the benefits of mind-body medicine for supporting both quality and quantity of life in those with metastatic breast cancer. Thanks for starting this topic/thread dear Divine Mrs. M. I didn't plan to participate because I don't like arguments or false polarities, but I do like online support groups and civil conversations about topics of mutual concern - our survival and well being are paramount. Wishing you a good, good day! ~ Stephanie",

It's so rare, that there's got to be a few specialists who study it in depth and can predict its possible course and behavior. Here's a potential resource for you: http://www.metaplasticbc.com/things-every-metaplas... My father had primary lung cancer and it turned up as recurrent pneumonia as the \"tumors\" were disbursed through the lungs as unidentifiable floating objects. Before diagnosis, they'd shown up for years on chest x-rays, but didn't look like discrete tumors. I've had a lung tumor since at least mid-1999, but never had pneumonia and breathing problems arose only in early 2008 when tumors in my lung linings rose (pleural nodules and effusion/fluid). We're each so unique. We will hope with you, that your's is a passing event as cancer seems to over stay its welcome and allowed space/resources. warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

I like the both-and approach of palliative care that focuses on my ultimate well being and comfort.

I live on a farm too, though my landladies are the farmers and I'm their happy co-inhabitant. :) You asked about switching from Tamoxifen to an AI and whether treatment could be that simple. It can and often is for post-menopausal women, but you mentioned that you're menstruating again. You may also be looking at Lupron injections or removal of your ovaries to end your periods and become post-menopausal. Sometimes chemotherapy is given for aggressive hormone positive metastatic breast cancer to control it, then the patient is switched to anti-hormonals (typically AIs or Faslodex, sometimes in combination with ibrance or afinitor). You're at the beginning of a new learning curve, so don't get too far ahead of yourself. I used to describe mets as a marathon in contrast to earlier stage cancer as a sprint. Now, I describe mets as an obstacle course that we're continuously developing new skills and strategies to master in our quest for quality and length of life. May you be well as you enter this new stage, dear Luvmyfarm. Sending a big hug from a California farm, Stephanie",

      "Content": "Jun 17, 2016 11:37PM - edited Jun 17, 2016 11:41PM by Longtermsurvivor Yesterday, this topic/thread came to mind when I was writing at bco about Kelly A. Turner's book, Radical Remission https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/79/topics/845005 For over 25 years now, I've been mulling over how to refer to my life in breast cancer land. Like everyone else here, I don't like having descriptors put on me by others - whether they \"know\" or \"don't know\" me and what it's like to live with serious illness. A purely medical telling of my story with times and dates of diagnoses & treatments reduces me to medical materialism and that's not how I experience my life. As a lifelong pacifist, I don't engage in wars or battles. Unlike Diana, I'm not an athlete, so sports analogies make no sense to me. I seldom use the term \"team\" (that's just for hospice), but am happy to use healing allies. Survivor makes me shudder, because I've got a good case of survivor guilt, having outlived many beloved ones. Breast cancer clearly isn't a holiday or tourist activity - though that's what we modern, Western humans consider journey...something you pay for, control and enjoy. Yes, there are many joys, but also many sorrows. Journey or quest works for me. I'm an avid reader, story and metaphor person. To be called forth on a journey begins a fairytale or quest narrative. I was literally pulled into worlds, tasks, meetings that I would never have sought in my previous state. It's not what I would have consciously chosen, but I recognize that my entire life has been transformed...not just my body. Maybe I'm comfortable with journey, because I've had many adventures outside the medical-industrial complex, as well as within it. I've also had the \"gift\" of a very long time with advanced breast cancer (now 60 and began in mid-30s)...so my perspective is a slow, rather than rapid one. Yes, I've been tossed around quite a bit, but have the opportunity to reflect on my experience and choose my response...at least sometimes. One author whose work I admire immensely is Arthur Frank, whose book The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness and Ethics describes three types of illness narratives - restitution, chaos and quest. Here is a short synopsis of the three different types of illness narratives ~ https://abetternhs.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/forgiv... It's fascinating to me that Frank chose to profile Audre Lorde, the breast cancer poet and guiding light to many of us, as his example of the quest narrative. I identify most closely with this type of narrative, though I've a more refined and detailed personal experience. Bestbird and I have had offline conversations about cancer as a journey and have respectfully agreed to disagree on this one. Thanks for reading and listening, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my thinking on this important topic! warmest healing wishes for all, whatever you choose to call yourselves, Stephanie",

Want you to know there's considerable variation in how liver tumors are assessed and treated. I've never had a biopsy or local treatment other than my indwelling drain for associated ascites (diagnosed with liver mets in January 2014, ascites since January 2015 and indwelling drain since August 2015). Also, my liver function blood tests were normal until last autumn when I went onto hospice and stopped getting blood tests. I know that local/topical treatment via radiation, surgery or other means, can be done for a single or few mets to the liver (aka oligometastatic disease), but it sounds like Dani's disease is all over, not just a single spot in her liver. This website may give you some ideas? http://www.beatlivertumors.org Oh yes, liver involvement was a game changer for me (I've had pleural mets dx. February 2008 and lung mets dx. July 1999). The liver feels much more systemic as my ability to metabolize toxins and nutrients decreases. As you will soon see, each of us has a unique experience and it's impossible to predict for another just how it will go. I'd put the trust in Dani's doctor(s) and seek second opinions based on her unique experience, rather than trying to follow in our footsteps.

Let's hope MSKCC has some life-saving and life-enhancing treatments to offer you. re. requesting medical records. Call your local hospital and ask for the records department. Ask them their procedure for releasing records - is it directly to you, the patient, or to MSKCC? If the former, there may be a hefty cost (think $1+ per page), if to another institution, usually no fee to the patient. There may be forms to sign in-person or via faxed form. And you may need to hand carry the records to MSKCC. Another option is to talk with the nurse-navigator or administrative assistant at MSKCC. They may need you to sign a different form so they can request your records from your local hospital & practitioners. It would be great if they could do the work and save you time and maybe money too. And it would no doubt be helpful for everyone if you have institution and department names, contact persons' names, phone and fax numbers, so you can get the right folks connected with the right information. Some of the smaller institutions might not be \"in the system\" for ordering records. Remember, patients come from around the world to consult world-class experts - they often come bearing stacks of medical records, x-ray exams, imaging CDs and briefcases full of briefing materials. It's good you're gathering these now. You don't want to waste your appointment time due to incomplete records. And, hopefully, MSKCC second opinion consults begin before you arrive - that the doctors review your records before your physical exam. And I hope someone else chimes in, as there seems to be great variation for releasing and requesting medical records. healing regards, Stephanie",

      "Content": "Aug 11, 2016 06:29PM - edited Aug 11, 2016 09:24PM by Longtermsurvivor Hi Mom, What a really difficult spell this is for all of you. How hard to be waiting for good news and keep getting bad news of ineffective treatments and cancer progression. Like else everyone here, I really hope Dani wins the treatment lottery and gets one that gets her into remission or at least stable for a long time. I can't address her treatment choices or personal medical situation (I'm not a medical professional, nor have any of us met her, but through you), yet I wonder if her weight loss is due to unwanted treatment effects. So many people lose their appetites, experience taste changes, suffer N&V (nausea & vomiting), get mouth sores, etc.. Cancer treatments can make it hard to eat and easy to lose weight. It's worth talking about with the oncologist. Yet, weight loss in advanced cancer can be caused by the disease itself - cachexia, anorexia, and liver failure contribute. Weight and muscle loss is part of the advanced cancer profile. It's thought that cancer changes the body's metabolism to create what's called cachexia. Sometimes it's paired with anorexia (loss of appetite - not anorexia nervosa which is a psycho-physical syndrome). Sometimes it just happens, no matter how much or what quality of food you eat. I have many liver mets and my liver has swollen to take over half my belly. In spite of being big around the middle, the rest of my body is becoming skin and bones, the \"cancer look\", due to cachexia. My body is experiencing muscle wasting and inability to process food, calories, protein, fat, etc. I'm now 100# and am 5'6\" - so my BMI is less than Dani's. Mom, I've done a LOT to keep on this much weight. Am lucky to still have an appetite, to find food appetizing and have healthy food habits. I'm constantly adjusting when, what and how much I eat. I don't eat junk food to put on weight, but I do eat frequent, small meals (even bites) of high protein and high fat food as my body desires. An extra pat of organic butter in soup, half & half instead of milk, organic full fat coconut milk, eggs, toasted pumpkin seeds, high quality organic olive oil. Organically grown and prepared everything (the liver doesn't need any extra toxins to process). Whatever I can take in. But, here's the thing. It's not okay to force food on someone who can't eat or digest it. With cachexia and me, no amount of food increases my weight. I'm just trying not to waste away. And I get to control what I eat and when - so I don't make myself sick to my stomach or overtax my poor liver. I know that my cachexia is a cancer-caused, whole body crisis. I am beyond the point of seeking new cancer treatments. Dani isn't beyond hoping for treatment success. She's still willing to stay the course. May she find treatment that resolves the causes of her weight loss. May she find nourishing, replenishing food pleasurable. May her body prevail and process food again. Sending warm hugs for all of you. It sounds like many of Dani's loved ones are being scared alone and that's one of the scariest places to be. May love melt fear, Stephanie ",

You're charged with being upbeat, positive and reassuring about Dani's situation, while also responsible for surveying current and future dangers from disease, treatment, doctors and family upset. It must be nearly impossible for you to navigate the emotional landscape, never mind the practical issues. You say that Dani doesn't want to know more about her situation and prefers to focus on manageable details like hair loss, rather than loss of life. I so get this and yet I do hope that at least part of her wakes up and draws her loved ones together for support. There is always hope, though it may shift from care to quantity of life to quality of life to quality of connections with loved ones and comfort. On the practical level, I understand Dani's avoidance of sugar and other \"bad for you\" foods. Ensure and Boost are commonly suggested for gaining weight, but I won't go there myself. I've tried Orgain and other natural and additive free supplemental foods and appreciated this blog post by a food writer who's since died of metastatic cancer. Food or Vile Glop? https://storiesbycarrol.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/food-or-vile-glop/ I suggest such simple things as reducing food odors from cooking (unless they smell good to her); having easy to eat foods available when the mood to eat strikes; serving on small (tiny) plates and bowls; frequent small bites of nutrititious foods, adding nutrient dense foods to the menu. Mom, I removed the link to Rebecca Katz's recipes, since many would lead to weight loss, not weight gain. Her cancer cookbooks are excellent! Dollops of yum, tricks for tasty foods, focus on translating \"unhealthy choices\" into healthier ones and much more can be gained by reading them. Here are links that tell more about the books. http://www.rebeccakatz.com/one-bite-at-a-time/ http://www.rebeccakatz.com/the-cancer-fighting-kitchen Sending warmest healing wishes, Mom, Stephanie",

Where's the support in that?! Unfortunately, we with metastatic cancer are the \"bad news\" to those with earlier stage cancer, but you'd think the facilitator would do better at creating a safe, inclusive group for all. Of course, that means allowing the possibility of recurrence and \"failure\" into the group. And many can't handle that as they're struggling to get through treatment to the other end. I've developed a calm, reassuring, humorous attitude to put others at ease with my \"plight\". Funny how it is that the work is on me, but that's how the cancer culture works. Now that I'm on hospice, I've upped that attitude - hoping to put metastatic folks at ease around dying and death. Some of it is self protection - I don't like having pity and pariah projected on me (alliteration attack, sorry!). But I tell you, at the end of the day, I'm happy to come to this forum to meet with others facing similar situations. And D&D is my neighborhood, even if we've very few residents. :) Wishing healing for all - physical, emotional, interpersonal, psychic and spiritual healing. Sometimes the body gets remission, yet I believe the spirit can be healed, even as the body wastes away. Just saying', Stephanie",

Back in pre-Internet 1996, my friends started a Share the Care group for my partner and me, having heard my end was near. That group continued for 10 years, gradually dissembling as my primary relationship broke up. In 2012 there was more very ominous news and that group re-assembled (includes my ex-partner) with many new members using the same model and many online resources including lotsahelpinghands forms for managing caregiving tasks, calendars and participants' needs. Also, mylifeline.org provides free blogs for folks with cancer that allow carers to keep in touch. Mylifeline is much better than carepages or caringbridge, if you are concerned about privacy, ownership of what is shared there and commercial-free space. BCO and other online support groups like bcmets.org and smartpatients.com are also incredible sources of free, online support. smartpatients doesn't have a strong breast cancer community, but for cancer geeks who want to cross disease boundaries, it's an incredible resource. And I'd be remiss not to mention my cancer home since dx with advanced breast cancer in 1992 - Commonweal's Cancer Help Program. Their outreach program includes similar programs and resources, but also Healing Circles communities that meet all over N. America. Thank you for allowing me to share these resources. I wish this post weren't hidden away in just one community. Maybe I'll find a more central place to share it with other bco communities. Healing regards all, Stephanie",

It sounds like you have personal/family concerns that s/he might be aware of. If you have particular questions about estate planning, please contact an estate planning attorney, an elder care expert. Not all financial advisors know the ins and outs of these laws. The Cancer Support Community should have a good referral system for estate planning resources too. Just a bit on what you wrote: It's going to be a REAL challenge when Social Security disability kicks in next year (it takes 5 months before you start getting payments). Sadly, it will only pay one THIRD of what I was making. We'll have to tighten our belts. SSDI starts paying 6 months after your disability date, which is when you stopped working, whether or not you have a workplace short-term or long-term disability program or are on SDI, California's state disability program (not all states have disability programs that are paid by employee contributions. Here's a link to the CA SDI FAQ page - http://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/FAQ_DI_Benefits.h...) Many workplace programs will require you to accept SSDI starting on your eligibility date, so good to review that policy. Medicare begins 24 months after SSDI payments, so you'll need to maintain insurance coverage through your spouse, employer, COBRA or other program like the ACA or private insurance. If others are thinking of going out on disability from your employer and using COBRA for medical insurance coverage, please tell your employer's human resources department before you leave on disability. You can get an extension, if you opt for it sooner than later. https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives... Check this out, don't take my word for it!

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2015 09:00AM - edited Jan 1, 2016 07:51PM by Longtermsurvivor Hi JFL, Thanks for asking about my natural approaches to pain. Sorry this is so long, but I feel like I'm running out of time and want to get this written down while I still have the focus to do it. JFL, I don't think we've met yet. I've only been at bc.org for a couple of weeks and it's hard for me to sort out who's who and what y'all are going through. This is from my introduction I shared at the Dying and Death topic: My name, longtermsurvivor, isn't my hope or wishful thinking, but my lived reality. I've been living with advanced breast cancer for 25 years. While I can't give you my survival secrets, I can share a bit of what I've learned - how to maximize \"ease of well being\", engage healing allies, substances and practices, and what I've learned about caring along the way. So, here's my take on pain and other unwanted symptoms. I've had to live with them my whole life because of a rare genetic condition - breast cancer with lung, pleural, liver and peritoneal mets are later arrivals on the scene that affect how I live within my body. Because of early unfortunate experiences with many meds and surgical procedures, I tend to use the least amount possible for the largest good effect and the least unwanted effects. I also seek out holistic and integrative approaches including substances, procedures, healing allies, practices, process, service and faith.* I don't think these are widely engaged in the cancer, medical or wider world, but I'm highly motivated to live my best possible life, given my physical challenges. I don't try to get rid of or control pain now, but to learn from and through it. It is my companion, that too often clamors for attention. Also, physical pain is just one aspect of total pain as described by Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the hospice movement. \"All of me is wrong.\" This is how one dying woman, Mrs Hinson, described her pain to her doctor, Cicely Saunders. Saunders would often re-tell the story to explain her ideas about 'total pain' where there are no clean divides between what is physical, emotional, spiritual and social. I will work with and from anything that comes my way...though I'm feeling into my limits of what I can't yet do (unrelenting pain and nausea do require some meds, just not to the point of dulling consciousness or bringing unwanted effects). JFL, I hope you weren't thinking I'd send a list of herbal, homeopathic, body work, acupuncture, exercise and other tips for dealing with pain and unwanted symptoms. Sorry! I hope this is helpful to you and others. Sending loving, healing regards, Stephanie * My personal definitions this morning, subject to change and upgrading. :) substances = conventional and alternative medicines I take or inject or infuse or rub on my skin. procedures = things like regular draining of ascites, now through an implanted drain. healing allies = doctors and other health care providers including acupuncture, mental/emotional/spiritual support, my hospice team and my circle of caring friends who support me. Allies are those who see and support my unique journey and offer additional support that I may or may not incorporate. practices = things I do on my own to support healing - self-touch & massage, movement, diet, meditation, relaxation, MBSR, creativity, writing, etc. process = the deepening of these practices into a lifestyle, an approach and openness to how I respond to anything that comes through life or my body symptoms or from wherever. This is where cancer becomes more of a quest than a hinderance and I follow the adventure into unknown places that have expanded and enlightened my life. service = engaging my experience, strength and hope to encourage and empower others on their/your unique life journeys. It has taken many forms, but is useful for easing my symptoms, distracting me from my own woes and gives me a sense of meaning and purpose. faith = my current challenge - trust in others and how I fall into their care and how I surrender my body to the slow dying process.",

Other techniques of local control like sterotactic body radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation are being increasingly used, but their role is not yet clear.[11,19] I have a friend with breast cancer who's had individual tumors surgically removed or topically treated for many years.

Also, shortness of breath gets worse with full belly, liver swelling and also the ascites (fluid in abdomen). So, I try to time activity around eating too.

Yet, somehow the math doesn't add up for me nor does the anatomy make sense. I've had over 700 port access procedures, most to infuse, but a good 100 or so to draw blood too. Clearly, there's been no lasting damage to my vein, though the skin above the port is thin and needle-pocked. My understanding is the line snakes first under the skin, then dives deep into the vena cava where it tunnels within that large and pulsing vein all the way to the heart. I've actually seen this on an unusual imaging test called something like port-a-cath-a-gram. No, that's not the real name, but my port's septum developed a bulge and this test was done with an x-ray machine and contrast running through the line to reveal the entire circuit. Also, I was told that the line to the catheter doesn't form adhesions (scar tissue) within the vena cava, because the constant flow of blood around it prevents it from attaching to the vein walls. While I don't want to practice medicine and diagnose, treat or prescribe, the explanations we've been given differ. Woody, I wonder if by vein, you mean the skin over the port septum where its accessed by special needles? Another medical mystery. ;) warm wishes, liver mets sisters, Stephanie",

When I mentioned the stress that rising tumor markers caused me to my oncologist, she suggested not using them and just making treatment decisions based on how I felt and what she saw. An imaging exam could be used for more details. That was a couple years ago and I stuck with the tumor marker tests for a while, because I did want to know. Now that I'm on hospice, I don't get any blood or imaging tests. I'm pretty anemic and they check my fingernails, palms and lower inner eyelids for paleness to confirm. Then suggest I take more iron pills. Not an exact science, but how I feel is more important than any measurement they make. Taking it one breath at a time, Stephanie",

Hospice choices differ from treatment choices, but I thought of something that might be helpful for others with compromised liver function - different routes of administration for drugs. I learned this from MTF transsexuals who were taking estradiol to develop female sex traits. For a couple of years I took estradiol for my ER+ breast cancer in an effort to both treat it directly and to resensitize the tumors to anti-hormonal aromatase inhibitors. Another, longer story. I learned from these women that allowing the pills to dissolve under my tongue softened their effects on my liver. It's a method of action called first-pass effect. By allowing drugs to enter the blood stream through the mouth, rather the stomach, their first pass through the liver was detoured. I'm probably not describing this completely accurately, but now that I'm taking liquid morphine for pain, I've been given the same advice - hold the medication under my tongue or inside my cheek until it's absorbed, rather than swallowing it to spare my liver. Also, I can take less of the drug to get a bigger effect. Here's wikipedia on the first pass effect: excerpt: Alternative routes of administration like suppository, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol, transdermal and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect You never know when or how you'll find helpful tips for working with our already stressed-out bodies. And I'll never know if this actually helps drug absorption or just helps me feel better about it. :) Blessings and good healing regards for the entire bco world, including this special liver mets community ~ Stephanie",

Mine began in January 2015 and by August were bad enough to have a drain line inserted into my belly. An average of 1 liter is removed each day, but I still get the swelling, fullness, discomfort, reflux, reduced appetite that trouble many with ascites. Here are a few practical tips: * No tight clothing or binders! Wear drawstring hip hugger pants or elastic waist pants and skirts. That liter weighs 2.2# and I can gain and lose an inch of waistline daily. Now is not the time for vanity and a small waistline! Wear tops that skim your belly, rather than bind it. * Eat small meals and wait at least 4 hours after eating before bedtime. Avoid foods that lead to reflux - oranges, coffee, tea, spicy food. * Drink plenty of fluids, especially around drain times. Replenish with electrolytes like coconut water & broth. * Good mouth care - the dry mouth after many months of draining is terrible - so I drink water frequently, rinse with glycerine and marshmallow tea. Some people swear by biotene, but it didn't work for me. sometimes holding a bit of coconut oil in my mouth helps. I avoid salty food, most food, after 4 PM. * Sleep on back or side, not belly. * I hold my belly with my hands and rub gently in the direction my colon runs - lower left up to liver area, across upper belly to upper right and then down right side. * Exercises like gentle walking, yoga and stretching help. Anything that compresses the belly like the yoga poses of forward bends and child's pose don't help, nor does vigorous exercise that jostles the belly. * Stand up slowly after draining and watch your blood pressure - mine drops very low, while heart rate races. Don't fall down. Dancing Veggie, hope you find something useful in here. Please take what you like and leave the rest. Try it out for yourself, don't take my word on it. May Doxil be your friend, ally and healing savior from ascites. Ascites suck vital energy, as does draining. Fingers crossed you find something that stops that sucker! warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

Don't make the assumption that you'll follow a course of increased symptoms, pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen liver, ascites, jaundice (turning yellow), rising tumor markers or any of the possible mis-adventures along the way. It's very hard to tolerate the unknowable future. But that's our best bet for staying open to the present moment. To get all philosophical on you, we only live in the present, all the rest is imagination and aspiration. It's good to have intentions for treatment approaches and goals, but we can't know the future!!! Carol, while I'm sorry that you are in a funk now, I don't expect it to persist. You can be strengthened through this challenge - not necessarily to become a cancer conqueror, but to live ever more in the present, able to ride your waves of phases and even enjoy the unknowable future. Please be kind and gentle with yourself, this news is a lot to wrap your mind around! Carol, I am wrapping you in a hug of love and confidence. We are listening and here for you, Stephanie of the don't know mind (nearly 3 years of liver mets and still not yellow and haven't really vomited.)",

Mom I think a good place to start Learning about alternative is a book called anti-cancer a new way of life by David Servan-Schriever. Check my spelling on his name but the title is right. You need hope and help and practical guidance to find something that is acceptable and sustainable and helpful for Dani and all of you. It makes no sense to pursue false promises from either conventional or alternative medicine. I suspect though just keeping up with each day is more than enough and encourage you to focus on the love and support and kindness and being together. I also encourage you to focus more on lhealth and less on directly fighting the cancer. Though it's important to fight and address cancer, quality-of-life matters so much more than being beat up by treatments or spending additional hours getting tests before it is too early. Or jumping from treatment to treatment or specialist to specialist. Why waste time on all that when love and shortening existence is all we have. A balanced approach Seems the best and I do not know what your balance is, just how desperate you can be when you come here. Big love and sorry this is written on the cell phone. Pardon my typos it's st before dawn here and I'm just waiting out some symptoms that were bothering me. Supporting and loving you is the best medicine for what ails me.   ",

It's a warped kind of caring. The folks doing it are trying to help us, to pull us back from the precipices they perceive, but we might have different concerns/approaches/risk tolerance. We might make different choices than they'd wish for us. Here's another thought that comes to mind. A friend trying to decide what to do for early stage breast cancer corrected me when I used the word choices. She said, \"I'm not being offered a choice between something good and something better, but different bad options. I'm not making a choice, I'm making a decision.\" I think it's human nature to want more power and more positive choices. And there are truly some decisions that are between bad, worse and worst. Groups like bco help us evaluate our options and to make the best choices or decisions. For this, I am grateful. warmest wishes, Stephanie",

I've absolutely experienced anxiety and survivor guilt around the deaths of others with cancer - the worst period being 2003-2011. It seemed that friend after friend and even strangers just kept dying on me...and I worked so hard as cancer ambassador/mentor. I was not able to save them despite my helpful holistic suggestions. Many did develop some resilience and peace of mind-heart through our connections and conversations as they faced cancer and death. Two things were at play, their suffering-death and my reactions to it. Having no control over the former, I began to work seriously on my reactions through conversations, therapy, reading, creativity, spiritual sustenance and simple acts of self-soothing. It finally became clear that my own reactions/feelings mattered every bit as much as others' suffering and dying. An essential act of soul-spirit hygiene for me was attending grief rituals with Francis Weller and friends. Something hard broke inside me and now I can be sad, mad, afraid, concerned, suffering survivor guilt, peaceful and happy all at once. My inner knots of jumbled feelings loosened and now emotions flow more smoothly. I've linked to a recent Sun Magazine interview with Francis, if you're interested in grief work. And no, you needn't travel or participate in a grief ritual to benefit. :) I suffered for years and am grateful to not carry that stress in my body-being now.

I waited 8 weeks, then tried again and got everything I wanted - including continuing on letrazole/Femara and with my weekly IV infusions of my main medicine, Iscador. I've now been on hospice for 90 days and can't say enough good things about the medical, practical, family and social supports they've provided. It took some perseverance to get the options and treatments I wanted and I'm so glad I did and they could and that it's worked out so well for all concerned.

It more typically appears in those who've had lobular breast cancer and can be hard to detect on imaging exams, because lobular is sneaky, sort of stringy, not lumpy. I have ductal breast cancer and mets in peritoneum, but also in many other places, so my situation isn't analagous to your mom's. My troubles are more with nausea (not vomiting), pain and ascites (fluid in the abdomen) than vomiting. I can't lose much more weight - am 5'6\" and dropped from 120# to around 105# and that's with the ascites weight. Also, I don't do chemo and am on hospice. The only real bit of advice I have to offer is to find out whether ascites are making her symptoms worse. If so, the fluid can be relieved by outpatient draining (paracentesis) or an implanted drain. Another bco member with peritoneal mets is Rosevalley. She's posted often on the Dying and Death thread at Forum 8 and there's a separate topic/thread for her full of beautiful good wishes and images. You might want to read her posts, because she's still doing chemo and isn't on hospice. Whitney, I hope others will respond with encouraging news and ideas for your mother and you.

I've not done chemotherapy, so can't comment on its effects, but can comment that fluid in my body has affected my breathing, appetite, digestion, movement, sleeping and more - causing pain, nausea, reflux, etc. I have a lot of liver mets in addition to pleural mets. Both cause mechanical problems. The mets cause more fluid to be produced, yet hinder its removal. Liver mets lead to poorer liver function, which also increases fluid. Chasing the fluid can become a vicious cycle. Then the fluid, in whichever location, squinches the surrounding organs, impeding their usual functioning. To deal with the pleural effusion, I had a couple of thoracentesis procedures followed by a VATS pleuradesis procedure in 2012 that sealed my lung linings together. The ascites were eased first by a paracentesis procedure, then by a surgically implanted drain that allows me to regularly remove fluid at home. There are only three of us here with the implanted drain that I know of - Rosevalley, Torridon and me. If your next chemo is successful, it's likely that your problems will resolve again. If it's not or only partially successful, you may want to investigate the palliative measures I've mentioned. Don't worry too much about not eating much now. Nausea, discomfort and mechanical squinching of organs will lead to loss of appetite. You might want to try sitting at an angle, rather than straight up. And don't lie down after eating. Try to get high value calories - good protein and fats, since you can't eat much. Salads are definitely empty calories at this stage of the game. Fingers crossed that your chemo works.

There are a small number of us with abdominal mets, many posting at peritoneal carcinomatosis topic. Besides the random bolt of lightning from the blue, two other possibilities occur to me - were you on tamoxifen? That can increase risk of endometrial cancer. Also, there's a fairly common genetic syndrome called Lynch or HNPCC that increases risk of both endometrial and breast cancers. If there are other related family members with those and/or colon cancer, you may want to visit a genetic counselor about genetic testing for yourself and, if positive, for family members.

These days they more typically prescribe Ibrance with the Femara at first, then maybe later with Faslodex or Aromasin. Why are doctors concerned about your bones? Did mets show up in imaging exams? If so, most patients are usually prescribed a bisphosphonate like Zometa or similar Xgeva. If you have osteoporosis, then different treatments would be prescribed. Metformin is sometimes added to the advanced cancer mix, but isn't typical. It is used for diabetes - is that something you're experiencing too? Why do I encourage you to stay on the Femara? aside: Maybe Tamoxifen would be a better next choice for you. It used to be the drug of choice for MBC, but has been replaced by the aromatase inhibitors (Femara, Arimedix,Aaromasin)...for some with MBC, it's remarkably effective with very few unwanted effects. Back to Femara - If your cancer is hormone positive, it will use any bit of estrogen it can find as its food stuffs of choice. The AIs and Tamoxifen befuddle or block this cycle. I've now engaged Femara thrice. The first time I experienced many unwanted effects, but it stalled my MBC for 3 years. The second time, I was drowning in mets, it didn't save me and made me feel miserable, so I stopped after a short time. The third time around, it's slowed down the breathing difficulties associated with lung and pleural mets without touching the liver mets. But, it doesn't cause extreme unwanted effects that can't be met with a variety of integrative and CAM approaches, so I continue it. Many of my approaches detailed here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/79/topics... Marge, I too have relied on nutrition, lifestyle modifications, homeopathy (and anthroposophical medicine), energy medicine (Reiki and Jin Shin Jyutsu), mind-body medicine and most of the key factors in Kelly Turner's book Radical Remission: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/79/topics... But, I think that if I (we? you too?) can find a balanced way to make peace with powerful conventional healing allies like Femara, then it makes sense to engage them. We must treat them and our bodies with great respect...it sounds like your doctor just threw the prescription pad at you and that's thrown you off balance and off center. There are many ways to approach MBC and you deserve to engage those that work best for you. It's up to you to regain your life and well being again. Marge, I hope you find many healing allies, but don't throw out the baby with the bathwater of conventional medical approaches to MBC. Please feel free to argue, disagree, ask for explanation, complain, agree, expand or illuminate...I'm not trying to control your actions or reactions, just want to urge you to work with all the healing allies at your disposal. You're facing a huge challenge. warmest healing wishes, Stephanie in blistering Sonoma County, CA.",

Rosevalley, I too find great joy and comfort with plants and animals. 35 years ago, while undergoing extreme medical treatments, I began regular visits to botanical gardens and arboretums - just to be in the healing environs. Without trying, the plant medicine steeped in me and I became a plant lover and docent. We have two new animal friends on the farm - a goat, Ginger, and a steer, Mr. Mac. He's a very social guy and misses his humans. When he hears my voice from my window, he'll come to the fence and listen. I get to listen to his lowing more than he to me though. His voice is deep, lovely, so reassuring - except at meal time! And yes, he has a field, but hasn't gotten far past the barn. Like you, life continues to unfold for me. I remain happy and at peace. After a while of dressing plainly (bodily fluids, sleeping more oft than not, difficulty getting into & out of clothing), I've reclaimed my beloved beautiful clothes to wear all day as pajamas. Why not dwell in beauty - whether gardens, with our animal friends, in our lovely homes, with our loved ones or in imagination? Life is short - we choose what to focus our attention on - an infinite variety of expression that fascinates me! Rosevalley, our bodies may be tattered and torn, but we meet the world in presence and beauty. Sending so much love & light, Stephanie PS, sorry, no photos today - the poppy was on my doorstep, but I've been living in decline recline.",

Glad you'll stick around to have a little book club with me next week (yes, I can be selfish as well as selfless). Just to clarify, I was a volunteer hospital chaplain, not a hospice chaplain. I had my hospice chaplain in mind when I wrote - she and my hospice nurse are both moms and strong mama bears. On Monday they talked me through a strong lesson in self protection - sometimes it takes a show of claws and teeth. I missed that nurturing protection as a child, so am learning now to just say no to things I don't want to do, even if I love the people who want to do them with me. I can say no to play or process or performance. I get to choose and needn't even use the excuse, \"but I'm sick and dying, so don't expect the impossible from me.\" Just yesterday, a friend who spent years trying to cheer me up by telling me to get well soon, told me that she prayed for my release. We've shared so much process around death, grief, change and letting go. She finally gets it and gets me. (selfish, yes!). So much easier and lighter to have our loved ones accept our deaths as natural and wanted outcomes from our long and painful illnesses. These bodies do get worn out and our spirits long to fly free. Rosevalley, I pray your DH also gets his release and can nobly claim all he did to love you well for so many amazing years, through so many adventures. Then he can do the hardest, most painful noble deed and let you move on. Your love will remain, maybe through the particular pain of parting now. This is close to your prayer, yes? Rosevalley, you are essential mama bear. I've learned so much together. Thank you, my dear teacher, Stephanie",

I'm up early downing sauerkraut juice with my zofran to fight the nausea. Amazing, I haven't had more than a sip of alcohol since a celebratory glass of wine in 1988 and my liver acts like I've been drinking heavily and steadily for some time. Just celebrating not having jaundice or vomiting this morning, even as other liver & peritoneal symptoms floor me. So, I'm remembering you, my friend, and how we met last November after I finally joined bco. Had been reading off and on for years. It's amazing how often this forum comes to the top of the list for google searches on MBC-related esoterica. The computer kept sending me here, I kept seeing your name, realized you too had an implanted drain, began following the D&D posts and I finally moved from the smaller, slower town of bcmets.org to the big, fast, complex city that's bco. Glad I came and have met so many wonderful neighbors. But always remember that I moved here to live closer to you. Rosevalley, what wonders we both are! Last November, I was barely on hospice and you were weak at the knees from yet another failed therapy. Your daily N&V adventure was about to start and neither of us would have guessed that here comes autumn in the Northern hemisphere and the 2016 presidential election is about to begin (early voting starts soon). Could our younger selves have imagined being alive for this? Rosevalley, I hope your interest and involvement in life, including your loved ones' lives, continues to carry you into the unknown future. And I do hope for myself that the time to pass comes soonish...though I continue to have a good time in this ailing, failing body. Sending a sparkling rainbow to brighten your day, Rosevalley. love 'n gratitude, groovin' attitude, Stephanie",

Through validation, acknowledgement and witnessing, communal grieving allows us to experience a level of healing that is deeply and profoundly freeing. Each of us has a basic human right to that genuine love, happiness and freedom.\" Also, Martin Prechtel's book Smell Rain On Dust: Grief and Praise has helped me revision grief into an existence of love, beauty, praise and transformation. A quote from the book's promo page: \"Grief expressed out loud for someone we have lost, or a country or home we have lost, is in itself the greatest praise we could ever give them. Grief is praise, because it is the natural way love honors what it misses.\" I hope I haven't gone on too long. Grief is the key that unlocked the door to my anxiety and survivor guilt around the deaths of loved ones and strangers - whether from breast or other cancers or other causes altogether.

Yeah, as long as you're out walking around or driving that golf cart - it could be all over in a minute and not by MBC. Heck, a radio falling into your bathtub would do it. I will give a shout out that contemplating death has been one way of helping me make the best life choices for myself. I've long considered every day a gift. And being on hospice, I contemplate death more, but I also live more fully - enjoying my human connections, enjoying nearby nature, appreciating food, music, touch, clothing, laughter and so much more. Life's fleetingness is shown in stark relief with death's presence. I hope others don't make the false assumption that hospice means giving up and obsessing only on death. For me, it's been a different way of living fully and wholly in the now. Waking up and letting go, Stephanie",

      "Content": "May 2, 2016 09:24AM - edited May 2, 2016 09:26AM by Longtermsurvivor Good morning, dear Yogini, I'm glad you visited the liver mets topic and found hope there! I didn't mean to suggest that your mother is on her deathbed, just that she needs to stabilize and regain enough health to accept treatment for cancer(s) (you mentioned CLL, but not whether she's in treatment for it). Otherwise, she may be on her deathbed. At the hospital, they are used to handling medical emergencies like your mother's - the nausea, vomiting and any associated dehydration, weight loss, malnutrition and inability to eat or take oral medications. Palliative care should be able to help, since she has so many poorly managed symptoms now. But I realized that my response to you was unfair. Unfair to both of you, because I didn't paint a rosy picture of a good outcome for your mom. It can happen, there are just many steps between now and then. Unfair to you, yogini, because I don't know if the oncologists and other doctors can talk with you. Can you be your mom's agent or can she give a signed or verbal release, so you can? Is she married or partnered and does she have other offspring who want to participate in medical problem-solving for/with her? How will you work together on behalf of your mother's wants and needs? And I was unfair to your mother, because I didn't ask - what does she want now? What has she wanted in the past? Can you help her get what SHE wants, not what you want for her? You may want her to live a lot longer, but she may feel about finished with cancer and life. That might be because she's sick and in hospital now or because she sees/feels how her body has changed. She may need your encouragement to keep trying. Or your acceptance of her feelings. Or maybe your acceptance of her wish to let go. It's hard for sick people sort this out for ourselves and hard for loved ones to sort, understand, accept our confusion and mixed messages. Also, you may want her to try various clinical trials or complementary and alternative treatments like the CBD oil, but if she's shown no interest or engagement in them so far, then a last ditch \"Hail Mary Pass\", may only distract and cause discord at a time when you can focus instead on being together, healing, getting well and out of hospital. Does your mother trust her oncologist? Do you want to drive a wedge between them? How do you delicately suggest that your mother is vomiting everything, including the prescribed Xeloda? How do you ask why the oncologist chose that instead of something else and what else might work to achieve your mother's desired results? It's Monday morning here and I imagine your mom's oncologist has or will make morning rounds to visit your mother. If you are there, I hope you can find a way to get clear with your mother about what she wants now...and to represent her needs, even if they break your heart. Dear yogini, here's a prayer that's helped me many times, \"As we move forward from here, may we always move from darkness to light, from darkness to light and from fear of death to love of life and to freedom.\" Sending many blessings, Stephanie",

The skin above it looks fragile and pocked, the port septum had several years of bulging (we think from constantly putting in and pulling out needles) and about 6 months ago, it stopped giving blood return. Medicine goes in, but blood doesn't come out. During all those years I also had monthly or quarterly blood draws. And it was used to administer anesthesias for surgery. Because it's not a power port, I never used it for scans or imaging contrast. While I doubt this model still existences, it's been good to and for me. Because I'm so thin and don't have breasts or wear prostheses, it really sticks out on my bony chest. I used to be self-conscious about it and dressed to distract the eye from the area. Now that I have a bloated belly from ascites with a foot-long tube protruding from it, I've had to let go of vanity as well as control and dress for my comfort, not conventional beauty. Color, texture, warmth and beautiful fabrics are more important than ever! Also, I've had substantial liver pain and discomfort for the past 2+ years and have tried to describe it here previously. Since I don't do chemo, I can't blame it on drugs or getting better. Drat! I've been told that the pain is from the liver stretching, the capsule expanding and other organs and spaces being pushed into. I work with a wide variety of methods to engage the pain as healthfully as possible. Healing regards, liver mets community, Stephanie P.S.

They really can't be compared and while I can serve as an inspiration, I am not a guide to her longevity or personal experiences. Unlike Dani's aggressive and widespread disease, my cancer is very slow growing and responsive to a couple of therapies - notably Femara, Iscador & anthroposophic medicine and a spell of estrogen. It gradually crept from my chest wall to internal lymph nodes to lung to pleura to liver to abdomen and is now in multiple places. Now I am on hospice, but I waited 3 1/2 years from when I was first eligible to enroll. I did seek out a palliative care specialist in early 2011 and he and his team helped me through many tough jams. And that specialist is now my hospice doctor! That's why I chose him! Mom, it's never too early to seek palliative and hospice care, especially if there is more than one hospice option in your area. Although Dani's disease and mine share the same name, the nature of our beasts are completely different. Dani's is so aggressive and widespread, while mine is slow and slowed down by anthroposophic medicine. While she can't think of her decline and death, you can consider that as one possible, albeit unwanted, outcome. The shock of recognizing mortality and need for hospice care too late often causes much more suffering than necessary. That's why Dani's doctors are trying to have \"the conversation\", not to give up on her, but because they care for Dani and want her to have the best possible care, which isn't always the most aggressive treatment. I've recently posted resources about choosing hospices and what it's like to die in the ICU at bco's D&D conversation. You needn't be caught in an emergency, if you are willing to be even more brave and consider the possibility that hope might be for a good death, rather than suffering everlasting and extreme treatments. While I'm sad to be another voice for facing difficulties, I believe that knowledge is power and that wisdom requires tapping into previously unrecognized depths. I know you have the strength to do this, mom! And the sense to separate my breast cancer experience from Dani's. Listen to your heart and gut, but also consider all your options, while you still have them. Great love & tenderness for you and all who suffer, Stephanie",

It's been a long slow decline for me. My cancer grows slowly and is further slowed by the mistletoe medicine I've engaged since stopping chemotherapy in mid-1996. By most people's standards, I've been incredibly lucky, good luck and bad luck! I've never fought this for even a day, though sometimes I feel like I'm wrestling in the match of my life. Sometimes the cancer is on top, twisting me into odd shapes. Other times, I just keep breathing and persevere. My point is...knowing when to cede the match isn't losing or being a quitter. It's moving with grace while dancing/wrestling with awesome and awful life events. Interestingly, I don't have any jaundice (yellowing of skin) or way out-of-whack liver functions.

Shelby, I want you to know how your situation and willingness to share have affected me. I've been experiencing decreased physical and mental functioning and am more and more reliant on others for caregiving, this includes my hospice team and caring circle (my chosen rather than bio family). Yet, I'm reliving some of my early family dynamics - Will you be there for me? Can you support my idea of my care needs, by not projecting your grief, fear, worry on me? Will you respect my pain and process, no matter how dire? Can you tend me when I'm unable to care for myself? Can I trust you to show up when I need? These aren't theoretical questions, but rather come up as I surrender more and more to the dying process and learn to trust in ways that I couldn't trust as an infant (long story of abandonment and inconsistent care). Shelby, the details of our struggles differ, but I feel relived to know that we're both working on similar sets of life questions that were given to us by our experiences. For the psychology and spiritual geeks among us, I offer this article which is really a meditation on how the dying still seek healing for our lives...and how our traumas open new doors and vistas into healing: Attachment Theory and Spirituality: Two Threads Converging in Palliative Care? https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/740291/ I know this is a little geeky. The short version is, thank you, Shelby! I feel less alone knowing we live with related questions. all love & high regard for all, Stephanie Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.\" \u2015 Rainer Maria Rilke",

      "Content": "Nov 11, 2016 11:03PM - edited Nov 11, 2016 11:05PM by Longtermsurvivor Dear Z. OOO, so sorry to hear about you and needles. I've done 2-3x weekly mistletoe injections for 20+ years. The injections use tiny, short, slender sub-cutaneous needles, not big, fat intramuscular ones! I use a 1\" 21-gauge needle screwed on a 3 ml syringe to draw up the mistletoe medicine along with another, different 1 ml medicine into the syringe, then switch out to a 1/2\" 30-gauge needle to inject. The needle itself doesn't leave a mark or bruise or feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, I get a little pocket of medicine just under the skin. I rub it and give it literal strokes for keeping me alive and well and sane and connected 20+ years after chemotherapy failed me. I have engaged many hormonal approaches including tamoxifen, megace, femara (3x) , aromasin, estrogen and testosterone (which I think you'd enjoy). I trust this mistletoe medicine. It's now difficult, though not impossible, to find Iscador brand in the USA. I'm using Uriel's Viscum Mali (l) 2 mg which is 1/10 the strength and I just don't get the reaction I might wish (the nice red welt). On the other hand, Uriel's mistletoe/viscum meds are available OTC and they offer many different ways to apply viscum and many different combinations. You'd need to talk with their pharamcist. You can self-prescribe something like the ointment (use it topically on tumors on my chest). Can you tell I love this medicine in the context of the whole matrix of anthroposophic medicine. A good place to get a sense of the whole medicine matrix is Lilipoh Magazine. If you want a personalized mistletoe/anthroposophic medicine assessment and treatment plan and can spare the cost and time, consider a clinic retreat at Steiner Health Center. For my money and time, I prefer a week of deep healing at Commonweal's Cancer Help Program for overall support, but wouldn't get the mistletoe/anthroposophic medicine workup. OTOH, it's a great place to get to the core of it all and put one's new ever-changing life in context. all healing and loving kindness, Stephanie cancer is kicking my butt big time now. That's fine. I've so enjoyed and appreciated my 20+ \"extra\" years. Threshold Choir song: Breathe, open heart Breathe, bless this medicine Breathe, gratitude Breathe, breathe.",

I do my own research, so haven't needed his. And, I've trusted professionals to bounce my ideas off of. That said, most of the medical journal articles at PubMed are behind a paywall and each costs at least $30. I first got around by visiting medical libraries at hospitals and academic institutions and photocopying the original articles. Now, I have a relationship with a local medical school library that sends pdf's from the journals they subscribe to, at no cost and for personal use only. If others are inclined, I encourage them/you to do your own research. There's lots out there and some of it is even Open Access or free full text. Another source for news is eurekalert.org - these news releases are free, written in everyday English and will become the news stories you see, hear and read via popular media. Medical publishing is a fairly closed system. I welcome those willing to open it up, whether Open Access or Ralph Moss. best healing wishes for all, STephanie",

While it makes good sense to stop and take stock of where you are and what factors may have brought you here, it also makes sense to let go of any blame. You have no control over those factors now and can make choices about what you want to do - things that feel good to you, whatever the outcome. These days I'm all about \"no regrets\" and \"living well is the best revenge against cancer\". Just letting go of shoulds and have-tos is a big relief. And knowing I've made my best choice for the day and can change my mind tomorrow helps me let go and live without regrets. A recently diagnosed friend told others that he fully trusts his team. He doesn't disclose that his team includes both conventional and integrative/complementary practitioners, professionals and lay folks like me. He just gently closes the door on unwanted advice, while keeping it open to all healing thoughts/wishes/prayers/feelings. When folks offer unwanted or odd advice, I just figure it's about them, not me and is reflective of their caring - not my need. I focus on that, not the anxiety that often motivates them. Our warm relationships matter, not the content of their \"advice\". btw, I love hearing Gerson called Gershwin! I will remember that. :) As the saying goes, \"take what you like and leave the rest.\" warmest healing wishes always, Stephanie",

If we have the breathing room, we can look back at what we might have done differently, but forgiveness (self-forgiveness) seems more appropriate in evaluating our past choices. btw, my member name long term survivor was chosen tongue-in-cheek.

High blood calcium levels When cancer spreads to the bones, calcium from the bones can be released into the bloodstream. This can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood called hypercalcemia (HI-per-kal-SEE-me-uh). This can cause problems such as constipation, nausea, loss of appetite, and extreme thirst. The high calcium also causes you to make more urine, leading to dehydration. It can make you feel very tired and weak, too. You may be sleepy or even confused. If hypercalcemia is not treated, you can even go into a coma. - http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/web... Since the bone strengthening drugs Zometa and Xgeva have been used, I almost never hear of it. Is your mother taking either of these drugs? What do her doctors say about her condition and it's solvability? btw, I've had a small number of bone mets for over 4 years. I don't take those drugs, because they made me ill - that's why I keep track of hypercalemia though - maybe I'll encounter it on my own unique cancer journey. healing regards, Stephanie PS, here's an excerpt from a longer piece for doctors 12 Key points for clinical practice: www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/3/1/1/pdf ",

I wonder if you are at risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) that is far too common, but far too infrequently discussed in our cancer world. Whether or not you have taken those drugs or have ONJ, I hope that you'll be thoroughly worked up by a dental oncologist (usually found through major cancer centers) or a specialist in head and neck cancers. You should not stop with the radiation oncologist, but seek to preserve your jaw and to get proper pain relief. Also, have you consulted with a palliative care team? I'm worried that you are not eating, because of the tremendous pain in your face/jaw. https://getpalliativecare.org You can continue with active treatment while receiving palliative care. They will address your pain through various approaches, including as many drugs as you feel comfortable taking. Please remember, I am not a medical professional, but am advising you to get the best medical care possible. I've a beloved friend with MBC who suffered severe face pain for nearly a year and was misdiagnosed with a variety of problems. She was finally diagnosed with ONJ last month and is seeking proper pain control. It's ruined her quality of life, more than the progressing cancer has. It's been truly terrible to witness her decline. Rosieo, please advocate for yourself by getting the best proper medical care - a dental oncologist would be your next consult, if you can find one.

What about seeing an oncological dentist? Is that a possibility where you are, Rosieo? And this is a scary time - pain and the unknown tip us into the fear zone. Rosieo, another thought is to post a separate new topic on this forum asking about jaw problems in those with MBC.

I am sorry that you are both suffering this, though glad to hear that your mother is including you more now. You can help her a lot just by being together in peace. And I'm glad you are reaching out to bco members too. I don't have any suggestions for what chemo your mother might try next, I would hope that her oncologist has a workable plan for her. She's on her third chemo after three anti-hormonal drugs failed her. From what I've read, heard and seen, there are many treatments still left to try, but if each fails quickly, the chance of remission or even holding the cancer in check goes down. It's possible that her oncologist chose a less toxic drug, Xeloda, because her liver is too involved to handle a more toxic chemotherapy drug. There is hope that it will ease her symptoms and give her a better quality-of-life. I hope others will write in about other cancer treatment options and that you'll check the liver mets topic, maybe posting there too: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... And there's this topic for those of us with cancer in the belly, including that fluid, ascites:  Dear yogini, I do have liver mets and the ascites fluid. After having the fluid drained at the hospital and having it return, I was able to get an indwelling drain implanted into my belly, so I can drain safely at home, on my own, not in the hospital and at risk for infection. I've been doing this for over 8 months, which is a very long time. Unless treatments can quell the cancer causing the ascites, then your mom is in a serious situation and possibly facing death soon. Also, the nausea and vomiting are seriously depleting and it sounds like they are giving her the heavy drugs for it. Perhaps they can also give her IV fluids and nutrition? If you haven't consulted the hospital's palliative care team (aka symptom relief team or pain relief team), I encourage you to involve them too. My palliative care doctors have done a good job managing my symptoms, improving my quality-of-life. Wish I had more encouraging news for achieving treatment response, but I think that right now your mom needs symptom relief, so she can return to treatment, if that's her wish. Namaste, Stephanie",

Good news, Leftfoot! Celebrating with you. I have a question about liver pain - I've had numerous liver mets for two years and ascites for a year. With tumors both in and surrounding my liver, the pain seems related to what's happening on the outside (capsule). Until recently! Now it feels like I'm being stabbed just below my sternum. It could be the ascites which has recently increased in volume (3 months pregnant even after daily draining). But I wonder why it's now localized after being diffuse for so long? Does anyone else have liver pain with liver mets, how does it feel and what seems to help? Lying down, sleep when possible, increasing pain meds - any other tips? Thank you all so much for being here in my time of need. Oh, I should mention, I'm on hospice, so am not seeking second opinions, testing or aggressive treatments (though I'm still on Femara/letrazole). Thanks again! warmly, Stephanie",

Sometimes there's a long distance between the two, sometimes they are close enough to touch. Mary, I hope you'll take strength from our stories (I've been living with liver mets for over 2 years, pleural mets for 8, lung for over 16 and regional for 25). May we strengthen you, so you can respond with love to the love of your life! May you return from fear to love together! Mary, I'm reminded of this great article...maybe it could encourage him to be more conscious of what he says and its negative impact on your ability to survive and thrive). How not to say the wrong thing: It works in all kinds of crises -- medical, legal, even existential. It's the 'Ring Theory' of kvetching. The first rule is comfort in, dump out. Nobody knows for certain how long anyone has to live or how well they'll do with any life challenge. For him to give you a death sentence is as uncertain as for us to tell you that you'll live a long, long time. Living with uncertainty may be among life's greatest challenges - and cancer certainly multiplies uncertainty. >came to this discussion after a long time (yes to me, its a long time) with tears in my eyes and ache in my heart. a loved one of mine (yes, love of my life) who is a surgeon told me today that I should ENJOY my SHORT life because I don't have much time left and he has never seen any stage 4 who survived. OK, I mean I know I am going to die but hearing that from someone I love was a punch in stomach. I have been to TNBC boards as well but never find a woman in my situation.< warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

I hesitate to even comment on your questions, because my liver mets are both in and on my liver. Also, I have ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and peritoneal mets. It's impossible to separate the horse from the carriage. What causes different symptoms? Which mets cause ascites weeping? I will note that CA125 has been a remarkably effective marker for my ascites/peritoneal mets of just over a year and also for pleural effusion for over 8 years. I spent several hours reading about how the test works and still don't understand it well enough to explain it. Aside: CA125 is known as the blood test for ovarian cancer patients and there has been some thought that it should be used to screen for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic, low- to average-risk women. Because of false negatives, false positives, risk of over diagnosis, invasive treatments, complications, etc. studies don't support CA125 as a screening method for the general population. Aside, neither are pelvic ultrasound exams for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic, low- to average-risk women. The controversy is remarkably similar to breast cancer screening and prostate cancer screening - do these tests help more than harm? This is probably more than you ever wanted to know about CA125 and ovarian cancer screening, but as humans in a medicalized world, it really does help to understand the territory we travel. Sending a hug of light while you puzzle this out, Stephanie",

Holy smokes, how amazing is that! I too have appetite and weight loss and struggle to find foods that taste good and are nutrient dense. As the liver changes, it can be difficult to digest fats and protein. Also, it and the ascites can compress the stomach, making large meals impossible. Smoothies are difficult for me, because there's too much bulk for my tiny tummy. Better for me are healthy meats, eggs, vegetables and some grains and beans. I don't seem to like sweets, but love flavors like sour and salty. It will be interesting to see what your mother enjoys and can eat. And how you can help her keep up her strength. It sounds like you live nearby and are connected, but that she's only recently opened up to you about the seriousness of her cancer situation. You're doing great in learning quickly and supporting your mom in ways that feel good to both of you. What a blessing you are! Yogini, may I suggest balance poses now? And maybe a few warrior poses to keep you focused on both caring for yourself and for your mother too. And remember to relax in Savasana. :) Sending much love, Stephanie",

Stephanie Apr 14, 2016 07:40PM Longtermsurvivor wrote: Hi All, Haven't had much to contribute recently, as I'm on a different path with liver mets. Hospice choices differ from treatment choices, but I thought of something that might be helpful for others with compromised liver function - different routes of administration for drugs. I learned this from MTF transsexuals who were taking estradiol to develop female sex traits. For a couple of years I took estradiol for my ER+ breast cancer in an effort to both treat it directly and to resensitize the tumors to anti-hormonal aromatase inhibitors. Another, longer story. I learned from these women that allowing the pills to dissolve under my tongue softened their effects on my liver. It's a method of action called first-pass effect. By allowing drugs to enter the blood stream through the mouth, rather the stomach, their first pass through the liver was detoured. I'm probably not describing this completely accurately, but now that I'm taking liquid morphine for pain, I've been given the same advice - hold the medication under my tongue or inside my cheek until it's absorbed, rather than swallowing it to spare my liver. Also, I can take less of the drug to get a bigger effect. Here's wikipedia on the first-pass effect: excerpt: Alternative routes of administration like suppository, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol, transdermal and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect You never know when or how you'll find helpful tips for working with our already stressed-out bodies. And I'll never know if this actually helps drug absorption or just helps me feel better about it. :) Blessings and good healing regards for the entire bco world, including this special liver mets community ~ Stephanie",

I too am experiencing liver progression, but am at a different stage of life than Dani and finally made it to hospice after beginning my breast cancer journey at 34. She's still got much to live for and I know that everyone is working hard to ensure her life on earth. Back in June, Dani's team looked for a BRCA somatic mutation in her tumors to see if Dani's cancer might respond to PARP inhibitors. I explained in my response then that a germline genetic mutation is different than a somatic mutation of tumor cells. The former affects her offspring and maybe her other blood relations. A somatic mutation is about the tumor and possible treatment options. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... It sounds like a germline genetic test for TP53 is being suggested in the off-chance of explaining Dani's early and aggressive MBC. The test results won't provide any targeted treatment options (they aren't there for TP53 mutations), but if she has a TP53 germline genetic mutation, other blood-related family members may also be at risk for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Hopefully the geneticist is also a genetic counselor and can sit your family down and explain the meaning of the test before doing it! I hope too that s/he has a full family medical tree of Dani's blood family and can counsel you first. This is a time consuming process, but a positive germline genetic mutation changes the lives of all of the entire blood family, not only the patient. Personally, I think it's irresponsible to offer germline genetic testing to patients without complete counseling that includes conversation, a blood family medical tree and exploration of related topics. Germline testing can be a wild shot in the dark that may may injure unsuspecting and innocent others. This might be on your list of things to attend to, but probably isn't at the top of the list for keeping Dani alive, well and receiving the best cancer treatments. Healing wishes for you, Mom, as you navigate with a migraine. warmly, Stephanie",

Aromasin/Exemestane is a steroidal AI. And that Faslodex/Fulvestrant has a completely different mechanism of action. I'm no medical professional or scientist, but know that the first two are prescribed for those with earlier stage breast cancers, while the second two are used in mets (mets only, I think, though indications do change!). Good information here http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal I am on my third go-round with Letrazole and it helps with my lung and pleural mets, liver not so much. I've no unwanted effects this time and the cost is right ($10 monthly), so I'm sticking with it for now. Healing light and love for all my liver mets sisters, Stephanie PS#1 My liver is swollen to my pelvis now & that and the ascites have changed the shape of my belly, but I've no signs or symptoms of jaundice. Haven't had blood labs since last October (on hospice), so no idea if my liver function is off. PS#2 I've always read and heard that liver mets aren't treated topically (radiation, surgery, etc.) for a cure unless they are very few (oligometastatic). They're sometimes topically treated for symptom relief, but that seems pretty rare. Check out http://www.beatlivertumors.org/Liver_Directed_Ther... and http://www.beatlivertumors.org/Surgery.html  ",

It's what I've learned in the school of hard knocks! - best, Stephanie Hi Gramen, I hope you'll consider changing your game plan for getting a second opinion. This is the complete opposite of a regular doctor's visit. If you are seeing a specialist, s/he has lots of training and very little time to spend with you. S/he won't have your medical records at hand, unless you do the ground work now. If you come to the appointment with a few of the records that you have on hand, you will have underprepared for what may be the biggest examination of your life - an exam that may save, extend or improve your life. Please do the following: Contact your current doctor(s) and sign any releases to the institution you will be visiting. Ask them to send the necessary records to your second opinion doctor(s). If necessary, pick up records and/or imaging test results from your current doctor(s). Contact the office of your second opinion doctor(s) and ask if there's a release form you can sign, so they can get your medical records. Ask what they can already access by shared EMR (electronic medical records). Ask what supplemental records they need - biopsy & surgical reports, treatment notes, imaging exams, office visit notes, blood tests, etc.. Ask if they have someone on staff who can help gather the necessary information, so the second opinion doctor can study for the exam BEFORE the exam. If you walk in cold with incomplete or irrelevant records, you're wasting everyone's time. Remember, any consult isn't about treating cancer, but about treating you. Please don't make yourself a victim by under-preparing for this most important exam. Find out what's needed now and get to work getting it together for then. From my long personal experience, this will lead to better results for everyone. btw, in 2012 when I went to UCSF for a second opinion consult, they had an intern who gathered records, reviewed them, called me to fill in the blanks, prepped the doctor and participated in the in-person consult. It sure made everyone's job easier. Please, take the time now, Gramen! Best healing wishes for all, Stephanie This is one exam you can hardly over-prepare for and under-preparation may be hazardous to your heath and well-being.",

I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I am grateful for my life, all day everyday. But as someone who's achieved the impossible miracle of a very long life with cancer and has decided which treatment paths to pursue, I believe it's imperative that each of us decide at each moment along the way what we will and won't do to prolong life. Many treatments are more brutal than the disease and have little or no hope of leaving us with an acceptable quality of life. There are great costs to survival and I often wonder whether most will be able to pay the high price. Financial costs are the least of it. Loss of independence, mobility, physical function, employment, relationships, security, homes, hobbies and ability to physically care for others and oneself are only a few. Unless we acknowledge and mourn these losses, we've little hope of going forward with dignity. Looking back with rose colored glasses won't lead to longevity. Nor will denying the costs of survival. It's impossible to know until the moment of choosing, just what each of us will do to stay alive. And it seems possible that at some point along the way, dying is the best choice for loving care of our ailing, failing bodies. Most spiritual and religious traditions show us that death is a part of life and though mourned by the survivors, may be a source of liberation and transcendence for the dying. Death can be a great teacher for living life. From a friend on hospice, Stephanie",

Femara and Arimidex are non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors. Aromasin is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Faslodex has a completely different mode of action. Part of the strategy of taking estrogen is to resensitize the cancer to AIs, so it makes sense to exhaust those options first. Testosterone is likely more interesting to you, because it can affect muscles and cachexia. I think you've read this thread, because you posted there, but it is about another hormonal approach to MBC Androgen Receptor Testing & Treatment And there are a wide variety of chemotherapy agents available at different dosing amounts & frequencies. It's impossible to know how any individual will respond to those agents, but some who try them are able to function better with than without treatment. I'm interested in your process!

My understanding of hospice is that it's 100% covered wherever you are in the USA - at no cost to patients, including those who lack insurance. Also, you can be on hospice for a while and if your condition improves or you want to try curative treatment, you can go off at any point. Because hospice usually offers many supportive therapies (including family support), many patients do improve. And, at least in my case, I was able to continue on the anti-hormonal drug letrazole (femara) while on hospice. I think it's because it's not curative and it's cheap ($10 monthly for generic). Maybe you too can do both. Maureen, please know there are many at bco who care about your well-being and will support you however we are able. warmest healing wishes, Stephanie",

I'm also willing to believe (having personal experience) that the so-called dead remain aware and connected to us, but that they must journey on, so it's not fair to hold them back with my personal, earthly needs. And, having had a NDE (near-death experience), I believe death is a beautiful and happy place where I will reconnect with Love. I hope to connect with my deceased loved ones too. That's why I've done so much forgiveness work with those who loved me but harmed me while they were alive...I just want to feel our shared love, not old hurts rehashed. I was using the word lose and lost as in a physical, material way for when I can no longer take someone's hand, hear their living voice, feel their physical presence at significant life/family events. First holidays without loved ones in physical attendance are challenging. They are so missed! Being able to touch, speak, feel, hear is why I continue to make memories for/with those I love. Knowing I am mortal, I am sure to embrace them, say their names, tell them how much I love and appreciate them. These artifacts may live on in their hearts and memories, even if they have no sense of connection with the dead or life after death. When I am dead, I won't have those physical/material ways to stay connected. But I believe our connection spans the life/death threshold. Just my personal experience. Sending much love, Stephanie ",

By Ashley P. Taylor September 8, 2016 excerpt: Fashion-designer-turned-director Tom Ford said he thinks a lot about death. \"Death is all I think about. There is not a day or really an hour that goes by that I don't think about death,\" he recently told Hollywood Reporter. Many people probably share Ford's morbid tendencies, at least to some extent, Pelin Kesebir, an assistant scientist and psychologist at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Live Science. \"To be preoccupied with death is very common and very natural,\" Kesebir said. This preoccupation can cause psychological problems, but it doesn't always do so, she said. It's rare that people have a pathological fear of death, she said. Further, although \"thoughts of death can be a source of anxiety and dread for someone,\" they can instead be \"a source of immense clarity and wisdom for others,\" she said. However, psychologists in one school of thought \u2014 those who are \"existentially oriented,\" or who study the way that concerns about the meaning and value of existence affect human behavior\u2014 say that the roots of many common psychological problems can be traced back to people's anxiety about death, Kesebir said. More specifically, these problems relate to anxiety about failing to live a good life, Kesebir said. \"People are usually not afraid of death per se, but of not having lived a worthwhile life,\" she said. People may have frequent thoughts about death because of humans' sophisticated mental abilities, she said. Our minds \"make us painfully aware of inevitable mortality, and this awareness clashes with our biologically wired desire for life,\" she said. The result of this clash is a very understandable and normal anxiety, Kesebir said. Continued at: http://www.livescience.com/56013-why-we-think-about-death-and-dying.html",

In my region in the SF Bay Area, there are no residential hospices within 50 miles...so that's not an option for me! Too bad as the SF Zen Hospice Project with the director BJ Miller is close, just not close enough. See too this end-of-life podcast series...http://tns.commonweal.org/event-series/end-of-life... Because so many local friends and family members have died while I've been outliving my prognosis, I've been able to witness the different local hospices in action. Also, I have friends who are volunteers and staff at all of the different hospice organizations. My favorite non-profit agency created an out-patient palliative care program in 2011 and I became one of their first patients. Now that doctor is my hospice doctor...but he comes every couple of months for reviews, which are usually more philosophical explorations than physical examinations. My daily hospice nurse visits track my physical changes and engage in conversations about that matters to me - oddly and interestingly, we share many common concerns explorations. The chaplain and social worker also visit 3-4 times a month combined. My team keeps me busy. For 4 1/2 years, I've had a Circle of Care that uses LotsaHelpingHands for organizing calendar, people, announcement and information. The group is a fascinating blend of friends and a couple of family members who plan to care for me through the dying process, to prepare my body for an after-death, at-home vigil and create a funeral in my religious tradition. During the 4 1/2 years we've met, I've developed ultimate confidence in this group of mostly women. The residential hospices I know of have great facilities for guests - sometimes including kitchen access and ability to share a bed or have a recliner bed nearby. Here's one in Australia I admire https://www.karuna.org.au and there's the Zen Hospice Project above. Each of us must choose our own way to go based on our understanding and what resources are available. It's never to early to start looking and talking with loved ones about what we want. Okay, gotta go back to sleep now that my body has calmed down! Jennifer, thanks for deepening our conversation here! Sending gratitude and healing regards for all, Stephanie PS, I hope those of you who believe you are mortal, will check out local hospice alternatives - some places have a lot to offer, some have very little.

This happened for me with Femara. love, Stephanie  PUBLIC RELEASE: 18-AUG-2009 Low-dose estrogen shown safe and effective for metastatic breast cancer WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE When estrogen-lowering drugs no longer control metastatic breast cancer, the opposite strategy might work. Raising estrogen levels benefited 30 percent of women whose metastatic breast cancer no longer responded to standard anti-estrogen treatment, according to research conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and collaborating institutions. The results are reported in the Aug. 19, 2009, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Not only did estrogen treatment often stop disease progression, in some patients metastatic tumors became resensitized and again responded to anti-estrogen treatments. \"The women in the study had all experienced a relapse while on estrogen-lowering drugs, and their disease was progressing,\" says lead author Matthew J. Ellis, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist with the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \"So they were faced with undergoing chemotherapy. We found that estrogen treatment stopped disease progression in many patients and was much better tolerated than chemotherapy would have been.\" About 40,000 women die of metastatic breast cancer each year, and estrogen therapy could potentially help thousands of women, Ellis says. Furthermore, he points out that the therapy is inexpensive, costing less than a dollar a day. Sixty-six postmenopausal women with breast cancer that had spread beyond the breast participated in the study. All participants were originally diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER ) breast tumors, meaning estrogen stimulated tumor growth. Seventy-five percent of breast cancer cases are ER . All participants had received aromatase inhibitor treatment, which severely lowers estrogen levels, but their metastatic tumors had later reappeared or resumed growing. The study compared a high 30-milligram daily dose of estrogen to a low 6-milligram daily dose, and evaluated how well the treatments controlled the women's metastatic cancers and how the treatments affected their quality of life. The high dose results in estrogen levels in the blood comparable to that of pregnant women, while the low dose gives estrogen levels similar to that of women who are ovulating, Ellis indicates. In both the high- and low-dose groups about 30 percent of participants experienced a clinical benefit -- their tumors either shrank or stopped growing. Interestingly, the researchers demonstrated that they could predict fairly accurately which patients would have this positive response. They conducted standard positron emission tomography (PET) scans before estrogen treatment and 24 hours later. If metastatic tumors flared, or glowed more brightly, in the PET scans after estrogen was started, they were much more likely to be affected by estrogen therapy. In 80 percent of women with PET flare reactions, tumors responded to estrogen therapy, and in 87 percent of women without PET flares, tumors did not respond to estrogen. The participants filled out questionnaires to indicate whether they had adverse reactions to estrogen during the study. Adverse reactions could include headaches, bloating, breast tenderness, fluid retention, nausea and vomiting. Patients receiving the high estrogen dose had more severe side effects. \"The older women in the study were, the fewer estrogen-related symptoms they had,\" says Ellis also professor of medicine in the Division of Oncology. \"But overall, we demonstrated clearly that the low dose was better tolerated than the high dose and was just as effective for controlling metastatic disease.\" In the 30 percent of participants who responded to estrogen, tumors often began to grow again after a period of months or years. But in a third of these recurring cases, the researchers showed that the women's tumors had become resensitized to anti-estrogen therapy. The tumors shrank or stopped growing when the patients went back on their original aromatase inhibitor treatment.",

Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, Oncology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera ASMN, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, viale Risorgimento 80, 42123 Reggio Emilia, Italy. boni.corrado@asmn.re.it. Anticancer Res. 2014 Mar;34(3):1287-90. BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy plays an important role in the management of breast cancer. In the past, testosterone was the most common line of hormonal therapy for this disease, but its use has been almost completely abandoned in the past 40 years. However, because of earlier reports on favorable therapeutic results, we re-evaluated its use for treatment of hormone-responsive patients who have become refractory to other lines of hormonal therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with positive metastatic breast cancer who had become refractory to treatment with other hormones and whose disease was progressing, were treated with testosterone propionate, 250 mg once every two weeks, twice, and then once every four weeks until disease progression, drug toxicity, or death. RESULTS: Regression of disease was seen in 9 patients (17%; 2% complete and 15% partial). Stabilization of disease was seen in 22 patients (41.5%). In the remaining 22 patients (41,5%), the disease progressed. Median overall survival was 12 months from beginning of testosterone treatment. Hirsutism and dysphonia were noted occasionally, but were not distressing enough to mandate cessation of treatment. There was no major toxicity except for two non-fatal pulmonary emboli. CONCLUSION: Testosterone showed a significant therapeutic activity in previously hormone-treated patients with metastatic breast cancer who were no longer responding to such treatment and whose disease was progressing. These results warrant consideration of testosterone use as treatment for patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer. PMID: 24596374 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2016 07:57AM - edited Feb 9, 2016 08:11AM by Longtermsurvivor Hi Maureen, Holding you in tender, loving thoughts today. I've been on hospice for 3 months and have continued to have my femara/letrozole refilled at the local pharmacy. It's prescribed by my oncologist, who is still my PCP while I'm on hospice. The femara is paid by a separate part D Medicare benefit, while hospice pays most of my other meds and medical supplies and delivers them directly to me. It's only $10 monthly, so I don't think the cost will trigger a review. If I were doing chemo or Ibrance at $10k a pop, I'm certain I'd have trouble getting that paid for. btw, I'm enrolled in a non-profit hospice and know there are wide variations between individual hospices and different regions. Also, I have a POLST and while I'm DNR, I still have limited medical interventions. It's unusual on hospice, but I'm also still getting infusions of my healing medication of choice, Iscador. If you feel bold, please ask your oncologist about trying anti-hormonals again (if they worked for you in the past), not for curative purposes, but for palliative care, symptom relief. Wording is important when you're on hospice. Comfort care, quality of life, symptom relief, staying out of the ER and urgent care centers are all buzzwords that have worked for me. :) warmest healing regards, Stephanie ",

As a baby, I had a near-death experience because of my genetic condition and while I've never feared being dead, I've been curious about the ways people die. Not just how we die physically and medically, but our inner reactions and also the reactions of our families and loved ones. I've been able to participate, observe and learn from many and am very grateful. While I may wish I could be an enlightened being and one with all that is, I clearly have preferences on how I go, based on what I've witnessed in others and experienced in my own life. Because of past medical traumas including over 40 surgical procedures and many crises, I fear a medicalized death. Dying in the ICU or ER would be terrifying, not comforting for me. Even a hospital room with its sounds, smells, textures and canned air would be traumatic. Also, I'm so over medical tests from the least invasive blood tests and imaging exams to the more invasive surgical and rescue procedures. Rather than pursuing last ditch \"Hail Mary Passes\" including chemotherapy, clinical trials, outlandish CAM (complementary and alternative medicine), I've settled on hospice and supportive measures like acupuncture, body-work, prayer, meditation and serving others. This is clearly the right approach for me now and I'm grateful to do less medical interventions, rather than more, as the cancer slowly progresses. Dying isn't a medical emergency, but a fact of life...that's the way I live now and the way I hope to die. It's no longer about list-making, legal arrangements, getting rid of stuff and informing others. Either that's in order or it's not. I don't have the interest or energy to attend to that stuff now. Just to live fully into dying. A different perspective, but one that wants to be shared this morning. healing regards for all, Stephanie P.S. I saw three doctors yesterday who agreed that my liver mets are slowly progressing and likely to be the death of me. I should gradually sleep more and more and eventually settle into the long sleep. Sounds like a good plan to me. ;)",

About the time our conversation stopped flowing, yogi was sitting with her dying mother and Noni was wondering about when to stop ineffective treatments. Since then, Nancy died and A Guy's girlfriend went home on hospice. Many others have experienced progression, disease response to treatment or disease stability. But, though disease may come and go or stay the same, life continues to flow and those we care about continue to sicken and die. Sometimes we're the ones going through that crash course in life and death. I wonder how others feel while witnessing the decline and deaths of loved ones? I experience awe. This is so much bigger than me. It's similar to how I feel in nature or prayer. Humbled. Sometimes the awe is awesome, sometimes it's terrible. It's certainly awe-inspiring. When I realize that I too will die, that I'm going to lose everyone and everything I love, I tremble. Death is certain. What's optional is whether we turn to face it or try to hide from the inevitable. Here's a poem: It doesn't interest me if there is one God or many gods. I want to know if you belong or feel abandoned. If you know despair or can see it in others. I want to know if you are prepared to live in the world with its harsh need to change you. If you can look back with firm eyes saying this is where I stand. I want to know if you know how to melt into that fierce heat of living falling toward the center of your longing. I want to know if you are willing to live, day by day, with the consequence of love and the bitter unwanted passion of your sure defeat. I have heard, in that fierce embrace, even the gods speak of God. -- David Whyte from Fire in the Earth ©1992 Many Rivers Press Sending much love and hopefulness that this topic will experience new life being breathed into it. And, if it gets too intense here, come on over to the Dying and Death topic. It's a scary topic, but we really aren't scary people. more loving kindness this morning, Stephanie",

Our writers answer some of the commonest queries Wednesday 17 August 2016 Our consultation is nearly finished when my patient leans forward, and says, \"So, doctor, in all this time, no one has explained this. Exactly how will I die?\" He is in his 80s, with a head of snowy hair and a face lined with experience. He has declined a second round of chemotherapy and elected to have palliative care. Still, an academic at heart, he is curious about the human body and likes good explanations. \u2026 If you are a cancer patient, or care for someone with the illness, this is something you might have thought about. \"How do people die from cancer?\" is one of the most common questions asked of Google. Yet, it's surprisingly rare for patients to ask it of their oncologist. As someone who has lost many patients and taken part in numerous conversations about death and dying, I will do my best to explain this, but first a little context might help.

In England there are Soul Midwives http://www.soulmidwives.co.uk , The Natural Death Center http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk and Dying Matters http://www.dyingmatters.org/overview/about-us In Canada a thriving death midwifery community that can be found at Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/306940662720202/ In Australia Zenith Virago and others have been providing care for dying and dead for many years - http://www.naturaldeathcarecentre.org In the USA there're hubs like The Home Funeral Alliance http://homefuneralalliance.org and the Green Burial Council http://greenburialcouncil.org Internationally, there's a magazine - Natural Transitions: A Resource for Green and Holistic Approaches to End-of-Life http://www.naturaltransitions.org It's available free online and worth reading/skimming for ads and introduction to what's available in your locale. Most hospices allow and some encourage willing loved ones to stay with the body after death for at least a few moments. The nurses can help you with whatever level of care you wish to offer the body. For me combing my mother's hair, anointing her face with benediction oil http://www.flowersociety.org/windber-hospice.htm and putting her death dress over her heavy body was sufficient. For friends though, we've prepared the body for a three-day home funeral which takes considerably more preparation and care. Even if someone has died in hospital, residential hospice, assisted living or a skilled nursing facility, the body needn't be whisked away, if the survivors want/need to say a personalized good-bye. For many this is necessary closure - at some level they realize their loved one really is gone. If this is your inclination and it's appropriate for your survivors, you can ask for it. And, if it's your loved one who's dying, this caring may comfort you. Love lifts the veil of fear. Loving kindness this morning, Stephanie",

Here's a beautiful blog post by someone who's doing it: July 3, 2016 Yep, sorry, my apologies, with a diagnosis of metastasis four months ago , I didn't beat cancer. Every one said, \"You are going to beat it\", some said, \"If anyone can, you can!!\". They cheered me on as I endured one treatment after another and I kept fighting \"like a girl\". I was told I will kick cancer's ass and will show cancer who is the boss. I rode the wave of positivity and determination. I believed that I will beat it too. I thrived on the fantasy of the cancer submitting to my will and strength. Songs, inspirational quotes, memes, greeting cards and stories, all led to me to the one end point, \"beating cancer\". Being very much a type A personality, I accepted the challenge, I said to myself \"I will beat cancer\". Except for one open book exam, I have hardly failed at something in life. So why not this! However, two and a half years after my first breast cancer diagnosis, I was diagnosed with metastatic disease in the lymph nodes in my chest and some spots in my liver. Shocked and traumatized only begins to define of what I experienced. It was a very hard and exhausting process to come to acceptance. Broken and beaten, it felt like a failure as if I let down every one who thought I would \"knock the shit out of cancer\". I was no longer the example of how stage 3 can be a success story and inspiration. As a doctor I understood that it was nothing that I did, to bring back my cancer. But I still felt a sense of shame. continued at: https://uzmay.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/i-am-sorry-... ",

I did find some resources on liver encephalopathy that suggest that lactulose can help with it. I don't know if hospice will use it for comfort. Here's a general description of what happens with liver failure due to cancer. http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-... This is a sad and scary time and I'm glad you're reaching out to us. Your mom's hospice care team should be able to help you with the stress too! Please don't hesitate to ask them what can be done for your mom's troublesome symptoms! They're there to help and probably have many tricks in the bag, not just medications, but even gentle ones like bed baths if her skin begins to itch. Please don't press food on her, as her liver might not be able to handle it now. Offer and let her choose what, if anything, seems good. And a few bites may do. This video helped me a lot when my mom was dying and is now helpful to me as liver mets affect my ability to eat: Sending a very big virtual hug, Stephanie",

My situation isn't the same, because I've done very little chemotherapy (personal preference based on pre-existing genetic condition). My cancer has responded to Femara and low dose estrogen, but no other hormonal approaches. I notice that most folks with MBC resort to increasingly aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy, as their cancer spreads and affects their quality of life more and more. This can be a lethal approach as the body is increasingly worn down by both disease and treatment. I've gone the other direction, doing less and less conventional treatment as the cancer progresses and have been on hospice for 10 months now. They allowed me to stay on the Femara and Medicare hasn't stopped me yet. But, otherwise, I'm doing only very modest CAM/integrative approaches along with the hospice approach. For me, this IS a workable solution. But, I have liver, lung, peritoneal, pleural and node involvement. A bit of bone too - but I don't even do the bone drugs for it. My mets are likely to kill me, bone mets only, I'm not so sure of though? SattiPearl, I don't think most people with extensive mets like mine live as long or well as I have. And I don't know what would happen if you decided to stop treatment. They say bone mets are slow, painful and seldom fatal just on their own. You might end up in a heap of trouble, but not dead soon, if you stop treatment. Still, it's something worth discussing with your own oncologist. Maybe say, \"when do I know treatment is futile and what's likely to happen if I stop?\" There are professional, medical guidelines for end-of-life decision-making in patients with advanced cancer: http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/ca... There are no right answers for everyone, just a finding our way as we go! Trust your heart and your gut after consulting your head and your oncologist. I believe we know what's the best medicine for us. warmest healing wishes, Sattipearl, Stephanie",

As a hospice volunteer, I once asked a woman I'd been visiting for several months what she wanted for her upcoming 75th birthday. She was wheelchair-bound, living in a nursing home, and in the last stages of metastatic breast cancer. \"Life,\" was her answer. Life. Of course. We all want to live as well and as long as we can. Eventually, though, our bodies betray us and we begin to show the telltale signs of aging. And, as we age, we have to reconsider and accept who we are now, and think seriously about how we want to live throughout our last chapters. No one wants to think about the prospect of death. But as we lurch into old age, we are faced with the prospect that many of us will need what our medical system does not currently provide: high-quality end-of-life care. It's more than a personal concern; it's a pressing societal issue. Projections are that, by 2030, one-fifth of the population will be 65 and older, compared to 13 percent in 2015, and 9 million people will be over 85. Currently, our country's end-of-life care is fragmented, costly, and unsustainable. Too much aggressive care is given that is futile and ruinous to people's quality of life. Doctors frequently don't discuss with patients and family what truly matters to them and offer comfort; and those left behind are often wracked by a sense of guilt, haunted by the choices they've made in the heat of the moment without really knowing their loved one's wishes. Fortunately, there are people, places, and organizations that are taking a serious look at how to improve quality care, and some are making strides in the right direction. continued at link in title",

And I'm no longer partnered, so it's fairly easy to slide out of life without upsetting others. Plus, I've been at death's door off and on throughout my life, so my beloved friends, family and health care providers know death comes with my package. :) Because I've lived long and well with cancer, I've witnessed the dying of many and have seen first-hand many different ways that people approach death - from eyes and arms wide open to unprepared to relieved of pain to heavily medicated. My own dad who died of lung cancer was a lifelong performer/teacher and enjoyed his great big 35th AA birthday bash on a Saturday and died 36 hours later. His will be a hard act to follow. My sense is that we die how we live. With cancer we have a bit of warning that we are going to die (unlike many who have accidental, traumatic or instant deaths), but that we can get focused on treatments and maybe cures and ignore that warning. We get to choose how we approach death, if we choose to look in that direction. And then, we get to choose how we'll live, based on that knowing. I used to be of the \"be prepared\" approach, but have over prepared and now am of the enjoy the moment approach. Jennifer, there's a wonderful topic here at forum 8 on Dying and Death that has 3,343 posts and 239,048 views. Members approaching death have written openly and truthfully in ways that are helpful for them/us and are often helpful for the readers/viewers. It can be a scary topic to read, but really we aren't scary people. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... Jennifer, sending you strength, comfort and courage as you face this scary topic. warm healing wishes, Stephanie PS, my dear friend raised three sons to adulthood as a single mom, all the while with advanced breast cancer.

We can hope that people die in a surrounded by love, forgiveness, gratitude and permission to go, but that's more idealistic than realistic. And knowing each participant's personal history, coping style, emotional signature is important. We can do our best to understand our survivors and to respond (in advance) to their needs. Yet, so much in life and death happens that is beyond our control. PurpleMinion, yes, we can go fast with cancer. There's something called an illness trajectory that shows how dying of different health causes looks. Here's a pretty good one for cancer, comparing it to chronic illness and old age: Illness trajectories and palliative care Figure 1 \u2013 see trajectory 1 and description on page 3 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC557152/#!po=8.82353 I've heard often from hospice that the average length of stay for cancer patients is under two weeks and that more than half of enrollees with cancer live less than 3 days on hospice This late enrollment means that the hospice team is just trying to get the patient and family comfortable when death occurs. Fortunately, they offer bereavement counseling for loved ones. But, if we recognized our terminal condition sooner, than we and our survivors might be better prepared. I just passed my 6-month hospice evaluation because my condition continues to decline, but know I'm on the outside of the bell curve on this too. An article that really helped me understand how we die of cancer is this one: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2 The author, Atul Gawande, included that story in his best-selling book, Being Mortal. I encourage others to read the book when feeling brave. The first half is more about dying of old age and the second part about dying of cancer and other serious illnesses. He's a good writer and it's an easy read, albeit emotionally taxing, because he's writing about people like us! Two other medical journal articles that might interest the more diligent readers are: Retrospective evaluation of palliative care and hospice utilization in hospitalized patients with metastatic breast cancer Authors include Temel who did the first study showing improved survival in lung cancer patients receiving palliative care http://pmj.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/03/14/0269216316637238.abstract  Early palliative care in cancer treatment: rationale, evidence and clinical implications Lynn Howie and Jeffrey Peppercorn Ther Adv Med Oncol. 2013 Nov; 5(6): 318\u2013323. doi: 10.1177/1758834013500375 PMCID: PMC3799294 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799294/  We can keep our eye on the prize of treatment response while still allowing that we might always fail to achieve it and may die sooner than we or others might wish. Our loving care for our survivors is a great motivator for preparing to die as well as possible...whether or not anyone is ready for the inevitable. Life - 100% fatal. May we all live as long and as well as possible! Healing regards, Stephanie",

Four years ago when it looked like I might die soon of pleural mets, I formed a \"circle of care\", a group of close friends and family members, to care for me. I don't have a partner or offspring who might assume primary caregiver roles and I was concerned about burning out my carers or suffering disjointed care. Share the Care and LotsaHelpingHands are good models for establishing caring groups. I chose circle members, mostly women, familiar with caring for the ill and dying and also with dead bodies. My hope is to die at home under hospice care, then to have my body prepared for a home vigil before a funeral. Where I live, this is very common! There are several long-running hospices, Final Passages originated here and The Threshold Choir began nearby too. Final Passages trains people to care for the bodies of their dead loved ones and The Threshold Choir sends small groups to sing at bedsides of the dying. Members of our group have dealt with the deaths of parents, partners, siblings and friends. I've worked with eight different members to care for the bodies of our dead friends, so I have a deep trust about their abilities to work well and work together to hold a calm and loving space. My own home is a lovely, healing place with lots of green views out the windows, peace and quiet. It's a great place to live and will be a great place to die. It's even a good-enough place for a home after-death vigil, though it's out in the country. The local Threshold Choir has come weekly for the past four years and their songs have become my refrains...Here's one song, My Grateful Heart. If you'd like to find one in your region, be sure to check the link above. Bodily functions and fluids don't disturb me or these women. My sister and I were well aware of the dying process when we accompanied our mother as she transitioned and were able to advocate for good pain control, but didn't treat her death rattle breath. Dying is a labor similar to birth. It is work - physically, spiritually and emotionally. It isn't dignified, if you expect no mess, no fuss or muss. But it is incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring to accompany the dying, especially those we love. I am grateful my loved ones continue to care for me as my body slowly fails and I trust them as I move toward a beautiful, mysterious birth into a new state of being. A good death will differ for each of us. Yet it is our final act of life and love on earth. May it be one of healing for others and ourselves, whatever our dreams, needs or situations. well wishing, Stephanie",

We are getting a ever more complete overview, as more members contribute their/our unique perspectives and experiences. Scary - oh, yes! We have touched some deep nerves around cancer, treatment, dying, choices at end of life, our perceptions about death. And I've read stories that have brought sadness, fear, tenderness, concern and anger (on behalf of others, not against anyone). Part of me wants to \"fix it\" - to provide loving kindness, words of wisdom and resources to ease suffering. Part of me knows it's better to breathe and be with the fear than to fix it. Cancer sure pushes us up against the wall of mortality and treatment is one way to back off from the hard, head-battering fact that we all die. For me now, the distress of my mortality is better eased by support than treatment. It's reassuring to know I'm not alone, that people care, that my dying might serve others - intimates and those who read what I write now and later. There's a certain immortality in knowing I've touched others deeply. Because I'm neither partnered nor a parent, I wonder if this is the how well-partnered and parents feel - belonging to a greater whole; contributing to others' lives in meaningful ways; finding it impossible to imagine not being there for loved ones at their significant life events...and for the daily connections. Perhaps the more integrated we are into life, others' lives, the harder it is to imagine our deaths. And, even when we can imagine our own not being alive, our loved ones often can't. Or it takes them a very long time to come around and wish us well on our journey. Or to see death as our release from suffering. Yes, Jennifer, you chose a great title for this topic - it's completely scary! And we're helping each other to breathe and be with scariness, so our lives are better lived in love than locked down in fear. Sending much loving kindness for all, Stephanie",

This affects our decision making around treatments, life plans and end-of-life preparations. Without accurate understanding of what we're facing, we are vulnerable to poor choices and disappointment. Cancer isn't fair. It doesn't fight fair. And it doesn't always respond how we'd wish. Being well-informed and preparing ourselves for a range of outcomes seems more prudent than expecting only the best, wanted outcomes for ourselves and our loved ones.

Prigerson, Paul K. Maciejewski, Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Cornell University; and Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY Presented in abstract form at the 51st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Chicago, IL, May 29-June 2, 2015, and at the ASCO Palliative Care in Oncology Symposium, Boston, MA, October 9-10, 2015. Abstract Purpose: Accurate illness understanding enables patients to make informed decisions. Evidence of the influence of prognostic discussions on the accuracy of illness understanding by patients would demonstrate the value of discussions. Methods: Recent and past oncology provider-patient discussions about prognosis/life expectancy were examined for their association with changes in illness understanding by patients. Patients (N = 178) with advanced cancers refractory to prior chemotherapy whom oncologists expected to die within 6 months were interviewed before and after a visit in which cancer restaging scan results were discussed. Illness understanding scores were the sum of four indicator variables: patient terminal illness acknowledgment, recognition of incurable disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage of the disease, and expectation to live months as opposed to years. Results: Before the restaging scan visit, nine (5%) of 178 patients had completely accurate illness understanding (ie, correctly answered each of the four illness understanding questions). Eighteen patients (10%) reported only recent discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists; 68 (38%) reported only past discussions; 24 (13%) reported both recent and past discussions; and 68 (38%) reported that they never had discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists. After adjustment for potential confounders (ie, education and race/ethnicity), analysis identified significant, positive changes in illness understanding scores for patients in groups that reported recent only (least-squares mean change score, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.01; P = .002) and both recent and past (least-squares mean change score, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.70; P = 0.028) discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists. Conclusion Patients with advanced cancer who report recent discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists come to have a better understanding of the terminal nature of their illnesses. xxx In pre- and post-scan interviews, patients were asked four questions that assessed their terminal illness acknowledgment (TIA), recognition of their incurable disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage of their disease, and expectation to live months as opposed to years. These elements of illness understanding were deemed by us to be essential for patients to make informed decisions about end-of-life care. Responses were coded 1 or 0 to indicate the presence or absence, respectively, of each of these elements of illness understanding by patients. These four indicators were then added together to construct summary scores (possible range, 0 to 4) to reflect illness understanding at the times of both the pre- and post-scan visit interviews. Differences between pre- and post-scan visit illness understanding scores (possible range, −4 to 4) were used to define changes in illness understanding by a patient between the pre- and post-scan visit interviews. TIA was assessed with the question \"How would you describe your current health status?\" Response options were (1) relatively healthy, (2) relatively healthy and terminally ill, (3) seriously ill but not terminally ill, (4) seriously ill and terminally ill, and (5) do not know. Recognition of an incurable disease status was assessed with the question \"Which of the following best represents what your oncology providers have told you about a cure for your cancer?\" Response options were (1) my cancer will be cured, (2) my cancer may be cured if treatments are successful, (3) my cancer cannot be cured but we will try to control the cancer with treatment, (4) my cancer cannot be cured and I am not able to have any additional cancer treatment, and (5) do not know. Knowledge of advanced stage of cancer was assessed with the question \"What stage is your cancer?\" Responses were (1) no evidence of cancer, (2) early stage of cancer, (3) middle stage of cancer, (4) late stage of cancer, (5) end stage of cancer, and (6) do not know. Expectation to live months as opposed to years was assessed with the question \"Many patients have thoughts about how having cancer might affect their life expectancy, either on the basis of what their doctors have told them, what they have read, or just their own sense about how long they might live with cancer. When you think about this, do you think in terms of (select response)?\" Response options were (1) months, (2) years, and (3) do not know. xxx DISCUSSION Results of this study demonstrate how poorly patients with advanced cancer understand their prognoses and how effective recent prognostic discussions are to improve illness understanding by patients. All enrolled patients in this study had incurable cancer that was at an advanced stage (eg, late, stage IV gastrointestinal cancer) and a life expectancy of months, not years. A small minority of patients accurately, and completely, understood the gravity of their illnesses (eg, 5% endorsed each element of the terminal prognosis at study entry); approximately one in four (23%) reported only recent or recent and past discussion of prognosis with the oncologist. Patients who reported at least a recent discussion about prognosis with the oncology provider exhibited significant improvements in illness understanding. These results highlight the need for timely (ie, current) prognostic disclosures to terminally ill patients who meet the criteria used for this study. The results also suggest that oncologists should discuss prognosis on an ongoing basis, and as frequently as appropriate, with their terminally ill patients. If this occurred, patients would likely have better illness understanding and, thus, make more informed decisions about their end-of-life care. These results are consistent with, and advance, the existing literature on illness understanding, prognostic disclosure, and advance care planning. The effect of recently reported prognostic discussions on improvements in illness understanding by patients is in line with the advance care planning strategy to regularly and dually address both dynamic medical situations and individual patient goals. This approach encourages medical decisions to be made in the moment instead of on the basis of advance directive documents, which can sometimes be nonspecific, outdated, or unavailable. Consideration of prognostic understanding as an evolving awareness of one's changing health empowers patients, their loved ones, and their healthcare team to make informed decisions. Furthermore, recognition of the need to update patients frequently about a prognosis may help patients and families who struggle to come to terms with the terminal nature of a disease. In the delicate task of delivering prognoses, some have argued that the median informs the message, which argues for the use of a prognostic range such as months instead of communication of a specific time frame, such as 6 months to live. Outcomes research in strategies of communicating with both realism and hope for patients with serious illness is needed; statements, such as hoping for the best (eg, years of survival) while being prepared for the worst (eg, months left to live), during ongoing discussions of prognosis may be one way to achieve a balance. This report suggests that, regardless of the approach, the recency of the prognostic discussion matters for prognostic understanding by the patient. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways to communicate prognostic information to ensure that patients have accurate illness understanding. Such insight seems to be a prerequisite for informed decision making.",

Waited to read this topic until I'd read the book...a few thoughts that haven't been voiced - The story is told third-person, but we're privy to Ove's thoughts and feelings and only witness the actions and words of others. Point-of-view - I think POV is a weird amalgamation of Ove and Sonia...when he meets new people, he can assigns them to his categories. But when he sees them through Sonia's eyes, he gets a broader perspective. His relationship with cat changes as he integrates Sonia's perspective into his own... kindness and caring emerge. But, was he really a curmudgeon? His wife called him the \"strangest superhero I ever heard about\"...she saw potential in him that love unlocked - whether it was their shared martial love, love shared with neighbors or even the photo of the family in a water fight. We know from the scene in the computer store, that though he changed,his basic approach to others didn't. Did you find it ironic that he whinges on about \"white shirts\", yet there's a throw away line that he worked for the \"housing authority\". He was a white shirt, a paid authority, not just a self-proclaimed or neighborhood authority. He's rule bound, yet rages against rules. An authority who rages against authority. Did anyone notice or care that the 7-year old never gets a name? Did it bother you too? Has cinematography so affected our culture that books read like films? Does the author really see life this way? Or did he hope his book would become a film? Here's the trailer - Ove being an orphan surely affected him and I think that Sonia was one too. Both Ove and Sonia were motherless children. She healed by channeling it into her work - becoming more like the \"good mother\". He became his own version of his own \"good father\". Both valued reliability. And he provided a safe container for her to blossom and grow. He tended her so she could tend her garden of children and plants. Then he tended her pink flowers - against all odds and advice. And the good mother Parvaneh was able to pull him out when no one else could. Ove was a superhero who thrived against all odds. I'm with other readers in our group. I know many of his age and few have so hardened in their ways. Yet, I don't think the suicidal death wish is antithetical to the survival instinct we so identify with. There are good reasons are hearts are here and different reasons they're tugged onward. Okay, enough noodling! ~ best, Stephanie",
