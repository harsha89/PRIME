I also have not share the news with my children, siblings, or my mom. You know I had kidney cancer 10 yrs ago and many many scares since then, the most recent was last July with lymphoma cells in my stomach but resolved with treatment.  My children are tired of hearing that I may have cancer. This time I didn't want to worry them but I think my doctor was worried. I need to know if it may be cancer so I can prepare my self and be strong for my children and my mom. The thing they saw in the us was not symmetric, had a shadow, and it measure a little less than 1 centimeter. I had a 3d mammogram, a diagnosis us, and the biopsy with a clip left on site... What do you think? Please be honest. I can handle it! Log in to post a reply",

I do have an appt. with my surgeon next Thursday at noon but I asked her to call me when she gets the results. I had my biopsy on Monday and they told me it will take three or four days. So I am hopping tomorrow or Friday. I had a conversation with my husband today as he is also in the process of finding out about a lump that he has. His appt. is on Monday, so we made a pact to be together no matter what. That made a difference it made me stronger. Thank you for your support. I'll keep you posted. ",
