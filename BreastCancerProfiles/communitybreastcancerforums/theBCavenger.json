Since the surgery, I have been under the impression that I was not going to need chemo since there was no lymph invasion.  I am now told Chemo is required for all tumors over 1cm. Mine was 1.5cm. If I do the chemo, will need to get a port installed as, due to the lymph removal, they can only use the veins on my left arm, and thy don't want them to collapse. That means a total of 2 more surgeries for the port installation/removal and at least one more for the reconstruction! UUUGGHHHHH! I guess there is some test they can do that is very expensive that tells if you are at a high/low risk of recurrence, and I have requested this test. I felt good about my choice, but now everyone is telling me I should get the chemo! If it wasn't for the extra operations, it would be an easier choice for me.  Why a I such a big baby about all this??? Why can't I just be more accepting of the surgeries??? Everyone of the surgeries I will need will be outpatient, obviously the hardest one is already done, yet I can't stop freaking out!
