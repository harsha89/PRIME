I never knew there were \"Custom Made Breast Forms\" and wish my plastic surgeon had told me they were an option instead of the implant which caused me nothing but complications, infections, etc. These forms are adhesive, can be worn 24 hrs./day 5 days/week then I understand adhesive has to be changed. They can be worn with regular bras or no bra, they are matched to your skin tones and have nipples. I won't have to wear a bra 24/7 for my self-esteem or to look normal at night for my fiance! I will be able to wear normal bathing suits! No more heavy prosthesis, ugly lingerie, etc. Why aren't we told about these as an option? Why doesn't Medicare pay for them? In the long run would be cheaper for insurance companies than plastic surgery. I am just trying to make women aware that these custom forms are available as an option because I never knew about them till I happened upon a shop that carries them. I go for my fitting Saturday! I understand some insurance companies cover the cost if you have a prescription from your doctor. Log in to post a reply",
