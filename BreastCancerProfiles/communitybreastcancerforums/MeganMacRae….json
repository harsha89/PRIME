Did you have that happen? I know I will be going with her to see her Onco next Friday, but was just looking for some hints now. Congrats on 2 years! I know we all are ready for it to be done. She is probably sick of me asking her every 2 minutes if she is ok or if she needs anything. Good luck everyone. I hope you all get through it with help too. Mom couldn't do it without me. ",
