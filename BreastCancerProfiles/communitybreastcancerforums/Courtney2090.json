    "Content": "Courtney2090 wrote: I found a lump in my left breast about two weeks ago and last night I found some yellowish redish discharge in my bra only on the left side. The discharge is very thin almost watery. The lump is hard and I can feel edges on it. I can literally grab it with my thumb and finger (no pain) and it doesn't move around. I got sick with the flu back in October and though most of my symptoms went away I am still so exhausted all the time and still have a terrible cough. I have been on so many different antibiotics and prednisone I feel that if the dicharge was from an infection it wouldn't have started while I am still on antibiotics. I am only 30 and I feel like a hypocondriac for going to my doctor so often lately but I have a terrible feeling about this. Did anyone else have a similar experience with these symptoms? And adviced would be much appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
