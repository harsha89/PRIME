My concern is about my mother - 69years old, BC, recurred and with widespread bone mets.  My mom used to be Stage1 in 2003, taking tamoxifen and femara for 5 years. Just last November, after coming back for vacation in US, her cancer came back and spread. She lost 22lbs in weight in 2 months and she had widespread bone mets in bones, tiny spots in lungs and 11 liver mets. My mom went on Taxol and Zometa immediately after knowing cancer recurred. Since she did not undergone chemo last 2003, now her onc gave it as its the last resort. We went on 16 weekly sessions of Taxol and later on took Intaxel. After 16 weeks, her liver mets were gone but her lungs still has it. The bone scan showed minimal progression after 16weeks. She is on break for two weeks and will resume chemo again on the 20th. The onc said that he will use Xeloda and Aromacin this time. During chemo, my mother always has her fluctuation of WBC.  She always has this injection to increase her WBC.  Does anybody know what should I give her in order to strengthen her WBC? What are the foods she has to eat? I have read that Vit C and Ascorbate can help lessen bone mets, is this true? I hope to meet other people similar with my mom's case.  Our onc gave her 2 years to live but I dont believe him.  Only God knows.  I just want to give my mom the best care and the healthiest food so her body can fight the cancer cells in her body. I hope you could share your tips with me.  Thank you.

Onc says he will use Docetaxel (Taxotere) because we have already exhausted Taxol. Anybody has used this drug?

      "Content": "lemon_acosta wrote: Hi, my mom is on chemo rest for almost two months now.  She is taking Aromasin as her maintenance for her bone mets.  The problem is her eyesight is deteriorating and I dont know why.  I dont know if this has something to do with her illness or not. Her left eye is blurred and barely can't see anymore. She is also having occassional headaches but not really painful. Does anyone here has the same experience? I am thinking this is the side effect of aromasin.  Leah Manila, Philippines Mom on Breast CA, Stage IV, with brain, bone, lung & liver mets Dx 10/10/2003, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

We immediately underwent radiation and already 9th tx of 20 sessions. Onc says we will resume chemo 2 weeks after radiation. I would like to get inputs of those who have the same condition of my mom (ER+/ PR+) as to what chemo drug was used and hows it doing well. My mom is 69years old and chemo is done weekly because of her age. Taxol was used to her before and removed her liver mets. Please share me your experiences and how did you do using this drug.  Hugs to all!  Leah  Mom on Breast CA, Stage IV, with brain, bone, lung & liver mets Dx 10/10/2003, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
