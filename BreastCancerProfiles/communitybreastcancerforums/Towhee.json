Taking a pill for every little twinge is unwise in one's life because dependency becomes entrenched. You have been careful and protected your body from the effects of such dependency. Bravo. That was then. This is now. Genuine, severe pain deserves treatment. You don't seem to be arguing over taking medications that do terrible things to your body because they are necessary to save your life. Pain medication may well now be necessary to save your quality of life. With who you are and the current state of your physical body, there is no way that you will become addicted or abuse drugs.  Aspirin, NSAIDS, Tylenol...none are without risk. Tylenol, liver. The others, kidney and bleeding tendency. We all have to be smart consumers and use them with discretion. It may well be time to consider narcotics. They do not make you \"high\" if you are in a lot of pain...the pain uses up the drug. The high comes with taking them when no pain is present or taking more than is needed. Please let your team assess your pain and suggest appropriate treatment, Annie. You, your family, and your students deserve the attention that is being wasted on pain. Think about it, will you? Love, Judie",

Bundling all your other symptoms and observations into the cancer bag is sooooo typical. Yes, your doctors need to know about them, but they are likely not related. Your experience with falling-down dizziness is very typical of an inner ear problem, not typical of brain cancer.  I am newly alone and understand the fear. While I am blessed with children in the area and friends from the past, I am alone 99% of the time and when one has BC, it feels more than alone...it feels helpless and frightened.  There is no way around it.

Grade 5 ultrasound just means that it is for sure going to turn out to be cancer. There is nothing about how bad the cancer itself is.

All those thoughts of panic, cancer, statistics, etc. just spin around and whip us up into the state you describe. I find that playing a simple, repetetive game on the computer helps...solitaire, spider, card games in general. Do you do crosswords? Other word games?

There are lots of things to consider, and your breast surgeon can explain your options best. But there certainly is hope that you can keep your breast. You won't know for sure until the surgeon has all the test results in hand and examines you. As you Google, you will find an overwhelming amount of information, some of it conflicting and confusing. I did it anyway because it gave me some sense of involvement in an utterly uncontrollable process. Talk about feeling helpless!!! Try to recognize the point at which the search is taking more energy than you can spare and leave it for a while. You can only absorb so much, especially when you don't have all the information about your particular tumor. Wait it out here with some amazing women who have been there.

My day... Oncologist in the morning. I tell her I just don't feel grounded in how we came to treatment decisions and a plan....that she just listened to what I had found on the web and said ok. Asked if I could schedule a longer appointment to start from the beginning, go over tests, statistics, options, do an OncotypeDX, revisit treatment options. She was willing to do that, and very supportive. I was under so much life stress in the beginnig that it was hard to think clearly. However, she says a year past surgery is too late to reconsider chemo, so insurance wouldn't cover OncotypeDX. She also said that the results from that test tend to be closely correlated to the Estrogen receptors in the tumor..mine was 99% +. So I guess I'll just settle down and accept that I chose the best option at the time. Then, off to the clinic where ex was having her mammo. They found three tiny calcifications in one breast and want her back in six months for a recheck. She's taking it fine. She's a confirmed hypochondriac about every little ache and pain, but doesn't tend to worry about things like this, so is doing fine. So, this woman who destroyed my life nine months ago and I go out for lunch. It's as if nothing ever happened. Chatting, totally relaxed. Bizarre, if you ask me. I don't know how I feel. Is it good to be friends? I don't know. Is it bad? I don't know. Is it natural? I don't know. Right now I am so deeply depressed that there is no feeling.

There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

I slept last night wrapped in the gift of cuddles from you, and feel your love and support. Thank you so much. Agnes the cat thanks you, too. ",

For the hula part, we started by sitting in a circle on the floor applying JERGEN\"S lotion!!! The teacher taught us that hula was mainly in the hands and lotions warmed them up and made us aware of them so they would be more expressive. I LOVE that scent! Cathi, my dad was a car dealer and did the same thing with bringing special ones home. After the above-mentioned dance class on my 9th birthday, daddy arrived in a white convertible with gold leather upholstery. All the girls piled in and we drove home to a surprise birthday party. There were at least ten of us and we sat up on the back of the back seat and crowded in the other seats. You see, back then we didn't get thrown off or hurt in accidents so didn't have seat belts and laws and stuff. My dad brought home one of the first Thunderbirds...when it was a sports car competing with the Corvette. It was red with two seats and went fast. We got up to 110 before daddy slowed down. Fun memories! Thanks girls!",

The little guy is the one in college now. I started turning gray as a teenager, and so did my eldest son. He's 34 in this photo.  More recently, me with my son on his Senior Prom night. I later cut my hair very short in anticipation of chemo, which I ended up not having. But I like it short now. It's not a good photo of him, but I love the outfit! Today is his 19th birthday and he's in Walla Walla and I'm in Seattle. It's out first birthday apart. My baby boy is all grown up!  I'd do the grandkids, but there are eight of them.

The boxes are gradually diminishing. I can take my time now rather than be pressured by the schedules of others. Agnes the cat is in pure ecstasy.  Which brings up my current quandary. Friday I am supposed to leave to go to Lake Chelan for the annual weekend reunion of my RNB (registered nurse baccalaureate...we were already RNs with either associate degrees or diplomas who returned to school to get a BSN) group. It's our 29th. We are a motley crew that bonded somehow. I really need this. However, I haven't connected yet with anyone in my building so have no one to check in on Agnes. She's kind of living here under the radar, as it were. I would leave Friday morning and return Sunday early evening. Would it be safe to leave her with lots of food and water for that long? Fumi, I am again inspired by your tenacity. What I love about your attitude is that it is entirely grounded in reality and simply doing what must be done. That fits so well for me. Thanks for sharing. Love and hugs to all. Each of you is an inspiration in your own way. You have made life possible for me. Bless you... Judie ",

I know my body is telling me it can't keep up, but I just don't know what else to do but keep going. I have had to go more slowly today. I gave in and started taking pain meds. That should help. Wren, trying to do spring cleaning with fibromyalgia...I fully understand. Diagnosis in the middle of crisis...that, too. You are clearly a tough, determined lady. I'm glad you are enjoying your new home. Anne, I love bears. We had them raiding compost much of the spring when I lived in Holden Village. We had to absolutely ignore them so that they didn't get comfortable with humans. Some years they had done so and started raiding the food inside the community kitchen and had to be relocated, possibly euthanized, so we were careful. But in your own private kitchen!!! Wow! As a little kid, I was one of those tourists driving through Yellowstone with a bag of marshmallows to feed every bear we met on the road. We'd toss them, and if we could entice one to come close, roll down the window and feed them by hand. I'm amazed that I still have a hand!!! One year when I was about 8, I was wading in a creek there and came face to face with a huge moose. It was fun. OMG!!! I just read your update. This is getting scary. Please be careful. I agree about rodents. Yes, they are cute...where they belong. Fumi, you brought sunshine in an otherwise bleak day. The vision of Pooh baby opening a package from his very new girlfriend and finding panties....hysterical to say the least! He would either have run away in terror or caught the first flight to Osaka. Nancy, I have followed you with interest...Your treatment has been intense, yet you seem to just go with the flow. Much, much admiration and support from here. It seems you are doing it all at once. Doing it through an office move with the situation you describe is remarkable. There is a bulletin board here, but money is impossible and barter would take more energy than I have at the moment. I haven't gotten to know anyone but I do know that of over 80 tenants I am one of only three who still drive, so I probably have more energy than most here. I just have to slow down a bit, I think. Jane, you're almost right...I've not only experienced the top three, but the top four...death(s) of loved ones, diagnosis, divorce, three moves. I suppose I've earned the stress level I feel. I have to giggle, though, at your advice. Agnes is, shall we say, a rather unique feline. She does not cuddle...that is a posture of submission and she is at all times the dominant resident in our home. She would enjoy the music, I suppose, but much prefers that I do the singing, which would negate the relaxation for me. I did, however, take a couple of pain pills and turn on music for myself. For the first time in a very long time, I slept last night. Agnes slept in her usual place...perched atop my hip, carefully balanced. All the love, hugs, and concern after I posted my \"poor me\" whine meant more than you can know. As usual, the cure arrived from the cosmos, unexpected. My son called at about 7 and asked if he and Connor could drop by for a visit. He wanted to get out of the house. He brought a couple of slices of the Pagliacci Pizza seasonal special...smoked salmon. Connor brightened up the chaotic room. I got out the marble game...a toy my mother had kept around for visits from her grandchildren. I had purchased one for my youngest son and he had recently brought it to me for Connor. It was the first time it had been out. I tried to capture the joy, passion, fascination, excitement on his face, but my camera died after one shot. It would not have captured the squeals, jumps, giggles, and exhuberance, anyway. It was utterly joyful. They reluctantly dragged themselves out the door at 11pm. Cai had as much fun building as Connor did dropping the marbles in and watching them go. Enough happy energy was stored in the air and walls to make today bearable.  Hope this brings a bit of the uplift to all of you that I experienced! Judie",

I'm the one supposed to be antsy!!! The \"force\" or whatever is with me today... It's a beautiful day. I went for a long walk. I passed the store where I got my breast prostheses. On a whim, I stopped in to see if they might have a product I could use to make my fake boobs stick to my chest. Because I had a bilateral mastectomy without recon, there is nothing to anchor my bra in place and I constantly have to check to be sure my boobs aren't around my neck or in my armpit The salesperson was wonderful, really trying to understand what I wanted and find solutions. She finally said that the ideal for me was one of the prostheses that stick to the chest. She showed me one, and I was thrilled...just what I want. Not too heavy, stick to the chest...I asked the price. $425 EACH! Medicare pays for one set every two years, so I'm not due, and I doubt they would be on the approved list. Marjorie (my helper) said that the company that makes them is having its annual training workshop to certify fitters. They use models and I would qualify, but it is tomorrow and everything is probably set. Just for fun, though, she called the teacher, who gladly worked me in as a third model because I am a \"bilateral\". The pay is either a $75 gift card useable anywhere, OR......drum roll...........stickon prostheses and a bra! That's like nearly $900 worth of merchandise just for letting people measure my chest and try on different styles of boobs. Count me in. I also get a free lunch. I am now a highly-paid model.

I almost collapsed in giggles. Gentle hugs all around, my friends! As most of you, I need to drop some pounds. It's a lifelong struggle and anxiety relief through comfort foods isn't helping. But how do you exercise will-power when you put a load of clothes in the laundry down the hall and go out for a little walk in the sunshine while you wait, turn the corner and run smack dab into an honest-to-god Polish/German deli that makes sandwiches, has genuine weiners (not hot dogs) in the display along with head cheese and all kinds of weird liver cold cuts, etc., and is overflowing with all kinds of imported candy and cookies? I returned to my wash carrying a sandwich, a bag of Marzipan Kartoffein, a bunch of Malaga candies, and a poppyseed bread roll half-loaf. I will return for weiners and noodles another day. ARRRGGGHhhhh... My neighborhood is fascinating and fun to explore, but there are way too many calorific discoveries lying in wait. BTW, in the UK homely has nothing to do with how cute you are. How I wish we were all together in a room chatting. I so enjoy the conversation, but trying to respond in writing is cumbersome. Shirlann, when my first child was born, I was outraged that they wouldn't let me see him at will. I was severly scolded for unwrapping him to count his toes instead of using my twenty minutes to feed him. I demanded to be discharged the next morning so that I could take care of my own baby! How I would love for that baby to be starting kindergarden with Chase. How very proud you must be, Karen. He sounds like a winner. Hmmm...Jane...it sounds like Possum's sister's name must be Blossom? Bless you for caring for her. You have such a gentle, loving spirit. Mel, it would be such fun to have a cuppa' with you and stroll the neighborhood and the city. With all the famous and wondrous things to see, my favorite has always been the Fremont Troll. If you ever get here, I'll show it to you. Thirty seconds and you have seen all there is to see, but it's special to me for some reason. Tomorrow my son-in-law has invited me to go with him to Tacoma (Hi Karen!) to see the glass museum. I've seen pictures. It must be overwhelming in person. I don't know if my daughter is coming along, but who cares? Her SO is the artist in the family. His parents are both semi-well-known modern artists who live in the Bronx, where he grew up. Very interesting, eccentric family. I babble. Sweet dreams all! Judie",

(He's straight, but because of being raised in the family he had, feels perfectly free to enjoy being flamboyant.) He is bouncing off the walls because three of his favorite groups are playing at the festival at Marymoor in July...The Decemberists, Death Cab For Cutie, and The New Pornographers.

I had a basal cell carcinoma on my back years ago, so I go in for an annual total body skin exam. The doc didn't even notice it. I have all kinds of skin thingies and like to ask her to tell me what they are just 'cause I'm interested. I assumed it was a tiny skin tag, but the top of it was a bit different so I asked. She had to get out her magnifying glass to even get a good look and lo and behold, it was a basal cell carcinoma and she removed it on the spot. These guys are very slow growing, invade underlying tissue only if they get huge, and don't metastasize. They are of concern mainly because if you get one, it increases the likelihood that you will have cancer some day somewhere else...like I did. So what is my penance? Shunning? Torture? 30 days of not creating bad humor?....I'm shaking in my boots here.",

My youngest daughter has removed herself from all contact with the family, including me. She is angry. I can understand, but her criticism and withdrawal are painful anyway. If you happen upon a ray of sunshine that's not hot and humid, give me a call and we'll share it...lol. Just got back from watching the Blue Angels perform over Lake Washington. We had a family/friends party at my son's dream home. He had been excited to host the party. The house has a wonderful view of the event. I kept seeing him in every shadow. His absence, and that of my daughter, made it a bittersweet event. Those who came were warm, witty, and good fun. We had fabulous food, too. No alcohol, though. It would have been easier with a beer or two, but DIL doesn't drink and some of the family members are uncomfortable with it...sigh.",

It is tempting to leave and go on with life without the burden of constantly saying goodbye. But I believe that all of us do give presence that enriches and sustains, even those of us who just read and offer prayers, thoughts, energy. We matter. When it seems that we are surrounded by loss after loss, I try to remember that we are surrounded, too, by an unimaginably enourmous cloud of love, light, laughter, connection, and community that is far bigger than loss. It absorbs the pain and offers it up, transformed, into the pure illumination of life, purpose, and future. Those beautiful souls who have gone ahead are laying new bricks to make the journey better for others. Their pure light helps us to find the heart, wisdom, and courage to travel the Yellow Brick Road, one brick at a time. So I stick around.",

I'm not going to get on a bandwagon one way or the other. We have been sold the BSE and mammogram apporach and accepted it. No one was brave or honest enough to tell us it wasn't working very well. Instead of defending something that has proven not very effective, why not jump on the bandwagon of finding a better way to prevent, detect, and treat BC? On the other hand, if there truly is nothing to be found, we need to hang on to what we have. I'm taking a deep breath and a wait-and-see attitude. We tend to react according to our own experience and apply it to the general population. I had yearly mammos and did religious BSEs. Everything was clear. 10 months after a clear mammo, I noticed an odd place on my breast, realized it might be a lump, and the rest is history. It was not discovered by routine mammo or during a BSE. It was a 2.9 cm IDC. Go figger. Routine mammos and BSEs did me not a whit of good. Thus my calmness in the eye of the storm. I want something better.",

He has been a joy to me and gotten me through a rough year but he's also been a challenge to walk on leash (leash aggressive) so our walks are short. My granddaughter is gifting me with Guinness, a six-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He is the king of cuddle, loves all people and all dogs. We take long walks and he is so mellow that I get to meet and visit with SO many nice people. I get my exercise and socialization all at once! Until I decided to keep him, he was the perfect dog. No barking, no chewing, just pure adoration. Yesterday, after I made my final decision, we were at a park enjoying the lovely day. Guinness started chasing every person who came within a hundred feet, barking ferociously. As I write, he is chewing up a shoe. True colors emerging. I named him Guinness because his eyes look like the bottom  of a bottle of stout. Weird, I know. Whatever emerges in the personality of this little guy, he's all mine now! Sigh... ",

Just found out that Connor, at age four, is booked to travel unaccompanied on a 12 hour flight to Beijing. He is to meet with one of the flight attendants the day before to say hello. I am LIVID. What kind of mother sends a child that age alone? She talks about how adorable he is an everyone just loves him and he entertains all the other passengers and is SO good. She's been lying to me about how a family friend is going with him until I said that my ex and I will drive him to the airport and would like to go early to have lunch and meet the friend. Suddenly she says that the friend's plans had to change. I told her that I will not place him on that plane until he has someone he knows and trusts to accompany him. So the visit may be extended. I don't know what my rights are, but I do have posession of his passport. I'm hovering around panic attacks. Oh, Cathi, why can't we protect our innocent grandchildren from their immature parents???",

He has been wanting to go to China and would be thrilled to take Connor home!!!

Oh, Jane! I can just see you and your ear plugs at the rock concert. It sounds like soooo much fun. I love live performances of any kind, especially outdoor festivals featuring new artists. Sue, please let us know how you are. Your se severity is worrisome. How did the pie turn out? I LOVE lemon meringue pie. Have you ever made Key Lime pie? Not the fake stuff, but the real thing. It's tart and exquisite! I adore Scrabble, but no one will play with me. I seem to have all the luck getting just the right letters and opportunities to win nearly every time. I have no good luck in any other game, in fact, I rarely win. AE, do you think the Look Good/Feel Good people could help a woman who still has hair and never, ever wears makeup? It might be fun to see what I look like all dolled up. Karen, do you think your daughter could volunteer? I wouldn't want my first time to be with a non-expert.  Shirlann, thanks for the travelogue! 19 pounds? You gotta be kiddin' me! Ah, but cruise food would make it worthwhile I hear. Little Cleo sounds adorable and very smart. I truly understand why you miss your \"kids\" so much. I miss mine constantly. When I left, I could only take Agnes (of God) the Cat. I love her, but grieve for the others. Keep the stories coming! Nancy, I know what you mean about your daughter. My 15-year-old granddaughter is spending a few days with me to help out. For me, help out means taking care of Connor and helping with cleaning. For her, it means cooking. She loves to cook. We've reached a compromise...some of my kind of helping, some of hers. We are having fun. I love the story about your son. How lucky he is to have parents who encourage a child's passion/creativity. Is he still interested in theater makeup or other aspects of theater? Wren! So good to hear from you. I've missed you. How exciting to have your replacement surgery scheduled. It's been a long road, yellow bricks or no. Lisa, feed yourself! I don't like you having headaches. Lazy is ok though. You've earned it my dear! Wow...four bedrooms and three baths for two. Yes, it's time to downsize. A condo is especially appealing because of no outside maintenance. There comes a time when working in the yard isn't fun anymore. I took a 2-week vacation from Arimidex and see my onc on Wed to discuss things. The pain se combined with my already chronic pain from sarcoidosis is becoming draining. My primary doc started me on a fentanyl patch...very low dose...to take enough pain away that I can ignore it and get on with the rest of my life. Wordy today...oh, well. I have to take advantage of energy when it comes. Good Monday to all...waiting for news everyone! Judie ",

Some are the spaghetti strap kind, some the undershirt style. All are a blend of polyester and lycra. Having something on that was snug and didn't rub really helped, though I had to keep tugging them down 'cause I went nuts if they got near my armpit.

Ah, he just needed a little love. Then he bit me. Not hard. Okay...enough. Back in bed, my SO was making odd sounds at the end of each breath...kind of a whimper. Thinking it must be a bad dream, I did a gentle touch. It worked. Soon, it changed into a snore-type thing almost like choking. A strong shove corrected that! Soon, Dorie, the lab, started dreaming.

So remember, ladies, all of us need so much that sometimes we forget that we are not alone. Our spouses, lovers, children and friends need us, too, and need us to surface from cancer from time to time. I have checked in from time to time and am so very pleased with Sue's progress and the wonderful family that has developed around her. In expressing what we all feel, Sue has created a safe place for others. It also helps us to have a place to talk without overwhelming our already overwhelmed families. It's all good.

We hear all kinds of rumors and stories, but your words come from experience. Thank you so much. Please keep bravely sharing your thoughts and your story to all the world. We all need the quiet heros like you to give us hope and strength. My daughter's ex was Afghani. He left as a young teenager during the Soviet occupation. I learned so much from him and his family. The book \"The Kite Runner\" was almost the story of his life...the age of the main character, the status of the father, the escape under frightening circumstances. My memories of the \"big\" days in history tend to be vague on specifics. On 9/11, whatever else went on, I do know that I was glued to the TV and radio. One or the other was playing in every room of the house. I was in shock, horrified for all those people, all those families, all those brave fire, police and medical officers. And I was frightened. The world at that moment shifted forever. Congratulations, Karen. We've got to find a time to celebrate one of these days. I'm now in a situation where I don't have to worry about babysitting. I'm free as a bird! I wish we were closer...I'd offer to take your son off your hands for a few hours. I'm a renowned kid spoiler.  Shirl, I think maybe you uploaded your pictures to Photobucket in a small format. You can set up what size you normally want in your preferences. I use 800 x 600, which might be a bit large here, but when you post them you can make them whatever size you like without losing quality. Does that make sense? I think you'll have to upload them to Photobucket again in a larger size. Let me know if you need help. I would venture to guess that a lot of you like to spread a bit of cheer. Sometimes it pays, as I discovered yesterday. I was at a large home improvement store. It was busy as always. As the clerk rang me up, I asked her about her day, we talked about her schedule, its benefits and drawbacks...just small talk. As my total came up, she said, \"Just a minute. You're not going to pay that. I'll cancel it out.\" She then dug around in an envelope and found a coupon that had been mailed out as a promo and which I had never seen. It was for $10 off. That was about 1/4 of my total. She scanned the coupon, redid my total, and said, \"You made my day and I want to make yours a little better, too.\" I just love encountering people like her. The money was nice, but connecting with a nice person was the real reward. One final story...all of this is off topic, but who cares??? In my wanderings on the net one day, I ran across a site related to Native American tribes that included a conversation about traditional reservation foods. There was a recipe so strange I just had to copy it to try someday. Well, I did the other day. Because the recipe was so strange, I planned on tasting the result, making a face, and tossing the rest in the garbage. The recipe was for \"Vinegar Rolls.\" You basically make a baking powder biscuit dough, roll it out, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, dot with butter, roll up into a log, slice an inch or so thick, lay them close together in a square pan... All normal until now, you say??? Well, while you've been doing the above, there is a pan with water, a LOT of cider vinegar, sugar and cinnamon boiling away on the stove. You pour it over the pan of rolls. There's a lot of it! Then you bake the mess. OMG!!! I loved it. I know, I'm deeply disturbed and off my rocker and all that, but I really liked the crazy things. The liquid stuff turns into a thick substance somewhere between syrup and pudding on the bottom. It's sour, but sweet and tasty. Sorry if this brings on nausea for anyone. I'll close with collage of all my furbabies. Only Agnes was able to come with me. I miss the rest SO much! Maggie was my best buddy. Sunshine has since died. He was very old for a canary, so it was expected. ",

Besides, I'm half Swedish...you need me!   I'm back.   Thanks for the cuddly companions, AE. I feel like I've horned in on Ulla's thread. My comments about being lonely were to let her know that I can feel this with her, not to get support for myself. I'm ok, truly. Lisa, like you, I have children and family who love me and would do anything for me. I am currently living with my eldest. He and his wife are dealing with the difficulties of culture and a household that includes his mother and her mother and father. There is no time or energy for conversation or just \"hanging out\", and can anyone ever truly comprehend the fears and craziness we feel as we deal with bootface? Therefore, the loneliness, the isolation. In reality, I am deeply blessed and shamefully ungrateful AND it's wonderful to be able to have a place to express things I can't share with anyone else. Thanks. My dear Ulla, again there is deep understanding. Sometimes there seems no way to continue living when life hands you something you don't want and can't control. I'm so glad you \"failed\" in leaving this world. If you tell your doctors you are feeling suicidal, I think they will consider antidepressants more willingly. You have been doing the things that fight depression. Exercise has been found to be even better than drugs in most situations, and you have been doing that. You want to run away from this horrible world, so run. Put on your running shoes and run (or walk) until you are so tired you have no energy left to think about harming yourself. I know, easier said than done. You say that everything is so strange for you there. I hear you! I was just thinking today that I have all my possessions, a room and bathroom of my own, I have carefully organized my things, yet something is wrong. I am living out of context. Yes, everything is here and normal, but it's normal in the wrong place. If I had freely chosen to come to this place because I wanted to, this feeling would not exist. Does that make any sense at all? I hope you have been able to unwind a bit. Remember, you got horrible news from home. You will be in a state of shock and disbelief for a while. You will get to the other side of it. The only thing you have to do right now is breathe. The rest is optional. Have patience. You deserve to live even when others suffer and die. Why? Because it is not your time. You have more to do. Worthiness has nothing to do with it. Love, Judie ",

It's 9:20 pm here...probably too late.   Hmmm...I don't know if the house is a bungalow. What defines one? It's a smallish two story with dormer windows in the three bedrooms upstairs. The main floor is living room, kitchen, family room, laundry and half bath. It's a very typical design in this area. Your dogs would love the inside, but forget playing in the yard...it's full of house...the largest house legally allowed for the lot. But they would have fun running up and down all the decks! Off to start a new book. Since my eyes lost some of their sharpness and it's hard to find a place with enough light and comfort to read books, I \"read\" them on my mp3 player. It's so cool. Go to the library web site, find book, download, listen. It even checks itself back in. Perfect for lazy people like me! And I can read while I walk, wait for appointments, shop for groceries, and drive. Judie ",

Good luck with the chairs! Karen, is it hot enough for you? I'm already roasting. Speaking of roasting, my daughter bought tickets for us to a pig roast this afternoon. Yes, a whole pig. It's a fundraiser for BC. The woman hosting it at her home works for my daughter and was very supportive when I was diagnosed. She and her group have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past few years. I remember when she was first diagnosed and my daughter was distraught and turned to me for info (I'm a nurse) and support. Now the tables are turned. Yes, Karen, it's time for you. Drawing takes few resources, can easily be put down and picked up. Manga comics are huge right now if you want to do that and impress your kids! I have had different reading genre periods...mysteries, then medical novels, then family sagas, then historical fiction, crime non-fiction. Now it's totally eclectic. Whatever hits me at the moment. I'm trying to sound better. Glad it comes through. Gotta keep fighting!!! Has anyone read the \"The Cat Who...\" series of mysteries by Lilian Braun? They involve a middle-aged curmudgeon type newspaper guy in a tiny town who has two Siamese cats that help him solve mysteries. They are ridiculous, unbelievable, trite, poorly written, and absolutely wonderful for some strange reason. I devoured them a few years ago. Judie",

If this is going to be the third time, I would run, not walk, to the nearest second opinion and consider a new ps before scheduling surgery. My heart is glowing with the news from UB and Sue. When you care about people, good news is wonderful medicine. Ulla, you will be missed. A week away from home might help you to gain a new perspective if it is a place of beauty, good memories, interest, or healing for you. Know that we are with you. We can't run away from bootface, but we can run toward the love of friends and family, the beauty in the moment, and the promise of every tomorrow we are granted. And with that platitude, I say again...I'll miss you. Sheila, I think you should have little stitches tattooed around the edge of your nipple so it looks like an applique on a quilt. So cute! Sorry...my weird side is escaping. I need to go reel her in...BBL. Hugs, Judie ",

      "Content": "Jun 20, 2008 06:11PM - edited Jun 20, 2008 06:14PM by Towhee I have a big decision to make. As you may know, I am living with my son, his wife, my adorable soon-to-be two years old grandson, and his Chinese grandparents. When I moved in, the grandparents were on a 6-month visit to China, so I was the full-time cook and bottle-washer. It was far too much for me to handle because of an autoimmune disease, but I did it, complaining and feeling proud of myself all the way. Grandparents returned and banished me. They are living in the house as servants and nannys. This is the normal way of things in China. I'm sure they shield me from responsibility out of respect (I'm the mother of the son), but I went from overworked to utterly superfluous. The grandparents speak only one thing in English...\"Thank You\". They also do thumbs up or down. That's it. They are dear souls, but mama is quite set in her ways and can be stubborn. Despite all, she and I have developed a sort of friendship. She really likes me. I bought a phrasebook to try to improve communication. Not very helpful, though. She did find one phrase, \"I like you\" and put in a bookmark. Every day she grabs the book and points to the phrase, then to me. Then she makes a sour face, says her daughter's name, and does a thumbs down. Healthy, delicious Chinese cuisine is presented every meal if I join the family. The setting here is gorgeous. I can walk anywhere and experience beauty and never be bored. There are parks with wooded paths, parks with open areas, a huge park on the lake with swimming, a dog area, a natural amphitheater, a cute downtown with two Starbucks...it goes on. This is all within a very reasonable walking distance except the park on the lake. The large Community Center has a wide variety of classes and activities. There are two indoor public swimming pools. The point is that I am finding that living in a smallish room, lovely but shaded so that not much sun gets in, is becoming depressing. I have nothing to do but entertain myself. I go for a walk maybe once a week. The excuse is the pain I have from the autoimmune problem and the se from Femara. It is hard to force myself past it, but when I do it really feels good. Connor spends a half hour or so a day in my room with me. I read, explore the qualities of various objects, and play trucks with him. These times are precious. Another issue is \"a place of one's own.\" I feel like an honored guest rather than a resident in my home. It's always been a big deal for me to have my own home...to take care of, to invite guests into, to manage, to decorate. Here I have a room, but no involvement in the rest of the house...cooking, cleaning, decorating, etc. If I want a glass of water or to raid the refrigerator for a snack, I have to go upstairs to the kitchen. It's kind of like living in a nice hotel. I'm homesick. And then there's the problem of my son. All my life I've sworn that I'd never live with one of my kids. I love them. I'm very, very proud of what they've accomplished. I want it to stay that way. Living in the same household means observing warts close up and personal. My son is gradually sinking in my esteem and I hate it. I want a return to innocent adoration. The opportunity: DIL's parents have an apartment downtown that is a HUD senior (55+) low-income unit. The waiting list is 2 years. DIL arranged with the manager for me to live in the apartment if I wish. DIL will not let the apartment go, even though no one is living in it. It's very cheap and she wants to hang on to it. A home of my own, the thing I've wished for, can be mine! The other side of the coin: Where I am now, there are people in the house (though I stay in my room 99% of the time), Connor is here and adores me, and I am not alone. I've been going back and forth in my thoughts. The immediate issue is that this would be the third move in four months. I'm tired. Very tired, and missing my previous life acutely. Another issue is that being in my own place will mean being truly alone. I tend to isolate too much when I'm feeling down, so not a good situation that way. Yesterday I had a morning appointment with one doc, an afternoon appointment with another. I took the keys to the apartment and hung out there in between to see what it looked like and experience the atmosphere. It is light (my room here is very dark), reasonably attractive and well-maintained, lots of storage, cozy, and two blocks from my oncologist's office. A Cathedral is across the street which plays lovely bells. Actually, the apartments are part of a building that houses the offices of the Archdiocese. I would pay next to nothing for rent. I've always loved downtown. This is actually on a hill above downtown, but an easy 1 mile walk or bus ride to downtown. It's a pretty steep hill, so the walk would be daunting coming back. When I met my ex, I was living in a studio apartment downtown in the trendy starving artist area and walking to work on the hill...about a 1 1/2 mile walk each way. I was on evening shift, so that meant walking home after midnight through a scary part of the city. I just held my head high and paid attention to my surroundings. Never did I feel afraid. I was sure in good condition then...sigh. The area is pretty and walks would be through city streets rather than wooded areas, but there would be interesting destinations and access to lots of entertainment, services, and a variety of people, including some kind of scary ones. I actually like that. Whatever I decide, I must find ways to return to the living instead of allowing myself to be swallowed up by bootface and grief. Life does go on, and I am extremely blessed with a wonderful family and caring friends. I'm interested in your feedback. I have a leaning toward one option, but want to be sure I'm considering all the issues. If you got this far, you are a dear and thank you thank you thank you! Hugs, Judie the homesick ingrate.",

It gives me time to do things at my own pace, though it is very hard to wait. Mel, I've saved the picture with the poem. It fits. Thanks. Karen, your dream of an apartment downtown is here waiting for you. My home is your home (when I get there). Years ago I had a funky little studio downtown where I escaped from the ravages of being a single mom to four teenagers. It saved my sanity. In fact, if you want to escape reality altogether, let me know and I'll spend a couple of days here with my son and get some quality Connor time. Think about it. Great photos from the relay. I'm proud of you and Portia. Shirlann, your situation describes just what I've always dreamed of. It sounds like heaven. My fantasy has always been to have an apartment in downtown and a cottage on the beach at the ocean. I might add a cabin in the mountains, but don't want to be greedy. AE, thank you thank you for the postings from Val's daughter. They are deeply moving. Let her know how much they meant to us here and that her mum's still spreading inspiration all around the world. The ripples of her life will continue to touch hundreds...perhaps thousands...of lives.  I especially loved the stories about the very human woman who had stinky feet and loved to write. Nancy, how many will be at the reunion? Your bossy brother story is a stitch! Is he involved in planning the reunion? That would be interesting! The place I'm moving to has a very active community, lots of social events and interest groups. I've been wanting to join a book club and when I was at the library I saw that there are several that meet there. Perfect! Anne, your time in the mountains sounds heavenly. Your energy and determination are inspiring and your descriptions always fascinating. It's wonderful that you and your husband enjoy this kind of time together. How much better can it get? Speaking of solstice, a funky neighborhood in Seattle has a fair every year to celebrate solstice. There is a parade and a sacred tradition of nude bicyclists crashing the parade. They paint their bodies and every year it gets better. Here's a link to photos of this year's event: http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/photos/popupV2.asp?subID=3877&page=1>itle=Fremont+Solstice+Parade&pubdate=6%2F21%2F2008 Sue! That table is gorgeous. I can't believe this is your first attempt. Great job. You, too, are welcome at my little place any old time. It's time to become a globetrotter, my dear. SueBee, it sounds like you made a very reasonable decision. You must be in surgery or recently finished. I've been thinking of you and sending lots of healing energy your way. A slumber party with 8 9-year-old boys? Are you crazy, woman??? Actually boys that age are just about my favorite humans of all. There is something achingly adorable about boys that age, but your slumber party might be going a bit overboard even for me! Oh, Jule...it's so good to hear from you. I'm sorry you're having a hard time, but I do understand. Comfort is hard to come by sometimes when you are broadsided like this. I do send caring and hugs and hope your heart begins to mend soon. You are a dear soul. Judie",

Was this impulsive, planned, or both? Rusty is absolutely adorable. I'm so, so jealous. Love the new pic. The video was awesome. So much so that I was very skeptical, but checked it out and it's genuine. Wonderful. I'm so sorry about your dad. It's so hard to see our parents decline and face the fact that parents aren't forever like we thought. Hugs coming your way. Sheila, I have always wondered why those marble games haven't been more popular. It's something everyone can have fun with...all ages. But then I've always been a Rube Goldberg at heart. I'm so excited about you and Lisa meeting. I expect a full report from each of you!! Shirlann, I absolutely love Cleo! The avatar is great, but a bit jarring to see a stranger when I look for your sweet face. But who am I to talk when I use a bird to represent me! My grandchildren grew up in a flash, too. I have a total of 8 ages 2 to 20. Connor was a late add-on. The next youngest is 11. Don't you wish you could preserve each one at their cutest stage? Having my own last child so late in life has meant that I missed out on a lot of grandmothering. (My oldest grandchild is a year older than Devin.) Connor has been an opportunity to feel like a real grandmother.  Lisa, thanks for hanging in with us. With someone like Dennis coming into your life, it shows us how much you care when you take time to share. I'm thoroughly enjoying your fairy tale. Then there's Fumi...not so warm and fuzzy today. OMG, dear! Yes, one wonders when enough is enough. But you must realize that you are a hero to many women who are ready to throw in the towel but keep going because you did. You have a purpose in life that is very important. Let that purpose lead you and inspire you when weeks like this come along, as they surely will. (((((Fumi))))) Sue, how're you going? I hope things are lightening up for you. Facebook reinstated me with apologies...how about a game of Scrabble to celebrate? Val, I did slow down. All is well. Devin came yesterday and we hung pictures. He said if someone had told him how hard such a simple task was, he would have laughed at them. After three hours of intense work, he is a believer. I rewarded him with my famous biscuits (no, Sue, not your kind. baking powder biscuits that you eat hot out of the oven with a meal spread with lots of butter...what do you call them?) He had mentioned how he misses them. I wish I could send Connor to you to hug for a while. Connor hugs are fantatstically healing band-aids. My apartment is now finished. Lots of organization of small stuff remains, but that can be done over time. It's out of sight and I can find what I need. My walls are covered with too many pictures and look totally tacky. But they surround me with the good of the past...family photos, artwork purchased on meaningful trips, (one painting by Henk Guth of the Macdonnell ranges, Jane...do you know of him? Small but lovely oil painting) and a great deal of my own artwork that has been stored in a box for years. Not great art, mostly sketches, but the years when I was immersed in art were some of the happiest for me and seeing them brings good feelings from that time. So tacky is good right now. Later I might decide to consider style rather than comfort.  OK...I'm spent. Gotta rest. Love to each and every one of you!!! Judie ",

Instead of having fun with my daughter and graddaughter fixing up her new condo, they came here and took me to the doctor. We did have the pie afterwards, though, and it was actually a fun visit. My youngest son came today to just hang out, which always pleases me. Tomorrow is prep day for my colonoscopy Tuesday. I get to drink 8 glassed of \"stuff\" in two hours tomorrow and again at five am the next day. What fun! But it buys me a day with another sweet granddaughter who will drive me all of six blocks to and from the clinic. They refuse to allow me to walk home. So stupid, but the reward is time with my granddaughter so I won't complain. Anne, please remain bear-less.

Normal, but frustrating. I had my first colonoscopy when I was 57 because I had an episode of diverticulitis and ended up in the hospital. They found one good-sized polyp and removed it. It was pre-cancerous, so I had to have another colonoscopy a year later. I had just one then, but it was not worrisome, so I'm now on a 5 year schedule. But 7 polyps???? That's too many. The odds of one or more being cancerous are pretty high...like 30-50%, I think. If they are malignant, but not invasive, you're absolutely right. I'm cured for now and won't need treatment. It's going to be a long two weeks. The cecum, BTW, is where the small intestine and large intestine join. It's the final goal--end of the line so to speak--for a colonoscopy. On another note, this has re-opened my thinking about my oncologist. I haven't been happy with her manner, though she is highly regarded and her medical care has been fine. I won't go into all the whys. Suffice it to say we are not a good match. I had decided that it was no problem since I'm just going in for blood tests every three months. My first anniversary is this month, and I think after that it's just wait and see and I'm probably done with her. Being hit now with thoughts of needing further treatment renews my desire to find another oncologist. The one I would like has a long waiting list, but that shouldn't be a problem. Long introduction to a short question: Both of these docs only do BC. If my biopsies are positive and turn out to be a new cancer rather than BC mets, should I look for a generalist or stay with the BC specialists. I guess I should check out other places on the board for this question. I don't tend to read anywhere but here. I'm rambling...sorry. Judie",

I hope the surgery goes smoothly for you. Thanks to each of you for the uplifting, honest, sensitive, kind, and tough messages you leave here. I gain something from every one, and know that we are a good thing.  I'm exhausted, but wanted to say things are looking up in the vast wasteland in my headbone, so no worries. I'm going to make it.

This is because activity of any kind increases metabolic rate in muscles, etc. The PET scan identifies areas of increased metabolic activity. It will show recent injuries, arthritis, areas of infection, and cancer. The trick for the radiologist is to figure out which is which. Every area that lights up is not necessarily cancer. It is highly sensitive. So sensitive that it's very difficult to read and many doctors feel it gives too many false readings both ways. After my surgery, I had a bone scan and a combined CT/PET scan. The bone scan was fine, but the other scan showed up every tiny lymph node, bruise--you name it. The radiologists deemed most things to be fine and referred me for an ultrasound to confirm the ones where there was slight concern. Glad it's over for you, Cathi. So sorry that UB couldn't tolerate it. It's no fun. Hugs to all...Judie",

One thing I did, that my kids still remember and use in their own families, was to create a schedule. Each one got to be \"Captain\" for a week with coveted privileges such as riding in the front seat of the car, controlling the TV choices, staying up an hour later, and an outing with me...dinner, movie, walk in the park...their choice. That, of course, was a plan to deal with sibling rivalry when I was a single parent of four. But creating a plan, whether private or shared with the family, where Rhuel, Portia, and Chase each knew they had your full attention in a loving, positive way might relieve a litlle of the tension. Not a cure, but a positive to offset some of the negative energy going on right now. You don't get to truly enjoy any of the people you love. Right now, trying to do things \"as a family\" might not work well. Blessings, Judie",

Thanks. Linda, it does get better. You have certainly made a good decision. I was a single mom of four and worked evening shift for much of the teen years. It was not good for any of us. How I wish it could have been different, but they all turned out well after some challenging years. They seem to like me most of the time, though they are now at that age where you suddenly decide to see all the problems of your life as a result of how you were raised...sigh. I did that but have finally outgrown it and accepted the fact that I had wonderful parents and turned out bad because I was a rebel. Barbe, can we switch? You come here for your surgery and I'll go there. I hate preoperative meds. I want to be alert, chat with the team while I get strapped down and prepped, go out like a light for the op, wake up remembering everything except the actual surgery. These days you get drugs that make you forget everything that happened after you took off your clothes and donned \"the gown.\" Crap..my memory is already going. I don't need drugs for that. I love the OR. I used to work in one. It's like my only chance to live that life again and they refuse to allow it. Starting my own IV and slapping on the mask would be a small price to pay. Whaddya say? They found more cancer at my appointment today. I'm terminal. OK, so I'm being a drama queen. The appointment was with a dermatologist. The cancer is \"probably the smallest basal cell carcinoma you'll ever see.\" The punch biopsy cured it. I'll live. I'm rummy...sorry. No alcohol, just the hour.",

As my sister would say, the've all jumped to the same confusion. My ex's father was hospitalized for minor surgery once. By evening he was acting crazy, belligerent, out of it. They assumed he was psychotic and restrained him with heavy meds and planned to send him to the looney bin. This was a Yale educated, respected man who had never had a psych problem. It turned out to be viral encephalitis. He could have died if his daughter hadn't put up a huge fuss. Also, as with Mary's aunt, an electrolyte imbalance or buildup of kidney or liver toxins can cause the same symptoms. I hope they get to the bottom of this soon and quit chasing their assumptions.

I just don't have the stamina to keep going. I'm a perfectionist. Sold $20,000 in three months with a perfect feedback score. But I had promised the guys on the Quadraphonic board my son was very active on that if we ever decided to sell the record collection, they would be given first dibs. I didn't think my DIL would sell them for a long time. Wrong!!! So I posted the database of the collection and am receiving a ton of interest. Tough thing is that all 17,000 items in the collection are in the music room at their house, mostly in boxes. I'm up now working on making a spreadsheet of all the records and cds I have to dig up tomorrow. My daughter and I are going there tomorrow (today). I'm too tired to keep it up. Got to go to bed. It all earned me a very embarrasing trip to the ER. I wish I'd needed some stitches, Nancy. I've just been feeling crappy and having some chest and abdominal discomfort for a couple of weeks. When I walk Jasper, by the time I get home I am sweaty and huffing like I just ran a marathon. I usually have more stamina than that. Lots of other minor stuff that added up to my doc insisting that I get checked out. I know it's nothing and told her so. Now she knows it too. She still wants a treadmill stress EKG. I thinks it's either stress or Aromasin. I'm doing better with it than either Arimidex or Femara and have been on it for months, so it seems odd to have severe side effects now. Who knows. Why am I writing? I'm exhausted. When I'm this tired I ramble. Sorry. BTW, I made the best rhubarb syrup EVER today. I love it on pancakes. Goodnight, Gracie....",

Unfortuneately, they divorced, but have worked well together with the girls. My son is married to a Chinese woman and they have a son. So of eight grandchildren, three are half another culture. I should probably add the two whose father is Italian but born in NY. I think he's a culture all to himself, that guy! (He's the one who built the table and shelves and trim) Actually, the affinity existed in me before my kids were even old enough to date, so can't blame them, can I! ",

I've explored most of Idaho, Utah, and Western Montana, been all up and down the Pacific Coast, spent a month in Australia, stayed at Sammy Hagar's estate on Maui, but have NEVER been east of Billings, Montana. They tell me there are some interesting places out East. Shirlann, of course you were a cheerleader! You still are, and very good at it. What would this place be without you? Subee, my son took swimming lessons for eight years from one of the most wonderful women I have ever met. She's been doing synchronized swimming since she was a teen, and is now in her 80s. As of last year, she was still doing it! I admire you for doing it for ten years!!! Nancy the sorority girl...that fits somehow, red hair and all. Do you stay in touch with your sisters? Oh, Mel! What nice drawings. Keep it up, girl. Anne, french horn is my all-time favorite instrument. Lots and lots of practice might be daunting, but wouldn't it be worth it to be able to give me a fabulous concert when I arrive? Love the picture on the rocks. You are too cute! I've joined Constant Reader. Wow! It looks like a nice group of intelligent folks. I'm going to enjoy lurking there. Thanks for the info. Sue, I'm with everyone else on the diet thing. Your body needs fuel for the fight. The extra weight can come of later. Patience, dear, patience. Oh, I forgot...that's not your greatest talent, is it? Hang in there, anyway. Sounds like you do, indeed, have a lorra talent, especially in music. Ulla, it feels strange not hearing from you much. But then everyone here seems to have cycles of ups and downs, posting and not posting. Just know you are loved and get the rest you need. AE, what a positive environment you have created for yourself. No wonder you are able to help others create the same around here. You must be drawn to water. There is no better place for me to calm myself than the ocean. Karen, somehow \"boring\" is not a word I would associate with you. You say you are boring then list several things that I find far from boring. I love the Whoopie story. Today was spent with my youngest son, just hanging together. It was like a refreshing dip into sanity. He's set aside Tuesday and Wednesday for me, then he's starting his summer job and fishing, so no more long, lazy visits. Have good Mondays all! Judie ",

I says paint what you feel like when you feel like it and don't make a mess. Mel, thanks for the hugs. I can't believe how much Lilly and Agnes resemble each other. I thought that blaze on Agnes was utterly unique. They both have five-letter old-fashioned girl's names. How big is Lilly? Agnes is about 9 pounds...all feisty muscle. She has the strongest tail I have ever seen in a cat and keeps it erect at all times. In fact, I was going to call her Viagra, but decided it was too tacky for her regal self. Her full name is \"Agnes of God\" not from the movie, but because she thinks she is the Supreme Being. Agnes plays fetch with twisty ties or a Q-tip and HATES being petted gently...she'll bite if it irritates her. She likes being rubbed and scratched firmly and against the grain. A totally weird cat that I adore...  Ulla, please come to Seattle ASAP!!! My front tooth broke off and I look like a homeless vagrant. I can't smile now. That's just not like me! I don't care if you don't speak perfect Swedish...you can work on my teeth anyway. Heck, I don't speak a word of Swedish myself! The board has been very, very slow for days now. I wonder if they are doing work on it, too many people are on and overwhelming the server, or the server has a problem. It's not the internet, just this board.

My son volunteered to look after Agnes, so off I went to Lake Chelan to be with 8 women who have spent a summer weekend together for 29 years. We have nothing in common other that graduating together. I've decided we do so well as a group because of that very thing...no one is ever bored!  Something special always happens on our weekends.Yesterday we planned a visit to three wineries nearby that  our hostess especially liked, and whose owners she was familiar with. We had harvested lavender from her garden and woven stems and ribbons into little wands.  We put a bunch of them in a basket to deliver the the Karma Winery for them to give out to customers. They were delighted. We then sat in their little outdoor cafe, planning to have a glass of champagne. We were taken aback by the price, which had been $8 last year, and is now $12. We decided on a bottle and enjoyed chatting about what fun it was celebrating for the 29th time. Our waitress was so cute...had just run in a half marathon that morning. It turned out that I had known her very well 12 years ago! I didn't recognize her because she hasn't aged at all! She had run a half-marathon that morning.We all delighted in the unexpected reunion. When we were ready to leave, she came to our table just beaming. \"Want some good news? The couple that had been sitting at the next table paid your bill. They thought you were people who deserved champagne!\" Unbelievable. View from the Karma Winery:   Some deer wandered through...  We then went to the Nefarious Winery...very small, I didn't get a photo. I love the name and my friend loves a wine of theirs called \"Consequence\" which a Sauvignon Blanc based blend with 30% Aligote, and 10% Viognier added to the mix. I purchased a bottle along with a Viognier. We hit Tsillan Cellars Winery, a gorgeous place built to feel like Tuscany...Here's the bathroom.  A walkway...  The view...  One of our group is making long, skinny, weird scarves on the side. She brought bags and bags of yarn and we mad a bunch. I guess they are the latest rage...  I could go on and on about the weekend but I'll not bore you further. Here's the moonrise from Saturday night. I could hardly believe it!  Thanks for humoring me! Judie ",

They just do shows for fun at the school. Like everyone, Whitman has had to cut costs, and they decided to disband the ski team, Varsity Nordic, because it was very small and expensive.

It's not standard, unfortunately. About my view and the building of a new house...they are connected for me. I am living with my son and his wife and baby, in their dream house. It's been under construction for a year and a half. We are living in the lower level. The upper level is almost finished, but empty except for the kitchen, which we are able to use. It is a gorgeous home, high-tech, has a spectacular view, and the process of building it has been a nightmare. Trust me ladies...find an already built home of your dreams. By the time you have built one, you will be too stressed to enjoy it. Every flaw (there will be many) will scream at you every day. AE, my heart and voice also chant the B9 totem. I'm anxious to hear the results.  Sue, as always my heart is with you. Your path has been a hard one. Your angst has been expressed so well that you have dragged a bunch of women to the yellow brick road and on to the Emerald City with you, laughing all the way (when they weren't screaming, of course.

Women in the Congo who are brutally raped by soldiers from one of the many militias vying for power and are left with damage that causes fistulas that leak fecal matter and urine through the vagina are said to be \"ruined\". They are considered filthy and are rejected totally by their families and villages. The militias in that area are funded by diamonds and trace minerals, which are called \"conflict minerals.\" Electronics, particularly cell phones, iPods, and computers, rely on these minerals. We must force manufacturers to reveal where they are getting these minerals so that we can choose to purchase from those who do not support the violent militias. The play was fab...great story, great acting. As we left, the actors collected money that goes to a hospital in the Congo where women can go to have their wounds surgically repaired. Each operation costs about $500. The play was at a major Seattle Theater, and I know they must have collected a lot. I hope so. It is touring, with the final performance in the Congo itself.

When in the kind of emotional and physical stress you are enduring, insomnia is bound to happen. Here's what works for me. It's against the principles of sleep experts, but it works for me. Take it with a large grain of salt. I like to listen to or read books. It keeps my mind focused somewhere besides the stress of the day. I will soon become sleepy. If I am listening to an audio book, I will fall asleep. That means I have no idea where I am in the book, but that's no big deal. I actually set my iPod to turn off in 45 minutes so I don't get too lost. If I am still awake and listening, I just keep listening. Better to keep the brain focused on fantasy than to toss and turn and worry. If I am wide awake, I do some kind of hand work...knit, crochet, whatever, along with listening. Then I feel productive at least. If the problem persists for a few days to the point I'm just not getting enough sleep, I take a sleeping pill. I think you need to put your hubby on baby duty when this happens so you get one night's sleep at least. You can trust him, you know. Take turns when both of you are sleep deprived. So that's my method. It will probably not work for anyone else...I'm so unique! lol Nettie, What a lovely wee dainty bundle! Her eyes just reach out and enfold you. She is one special gift that came with a high price tag, but repays in multiples in her own darling way. Thanks for the pic! A strange day for me...feeling a bit under the weather and spacey, but at least I'll sleep well tonight!!! (sorry Cathi...wish I could share)",

Many nerves in the chest are cut, so there is a lot of numbness at first, which decreases pain. If they had removed all the lymph nodes, I know it would have been more painful, so I'm not much help on that part, but the mastectomy itself was a breeze.

      "Content": "Sep 15, 2007 01:54PM - edited Sep 15, 2007 01:57PM by Towhee (apologies for the long-winded comment)  Such panic today! I'd like you to go to  http://community.breastcancer.org/topic/5/conversation/673568 and read the 11th comment by Nicole. It has kept me going through all the fear and depression. It's simple, doable, and very, very smart. You seem to keep wrestling with the panic of having no control and falling into the \"what-ifs\". It's all too familiar. Here's what I did at the same point. Had my family make meals to freeze so that I wouldn't have to worry about cooking for a while after surgery. I actually dipped into the meals a couple of times before surgery when I couldn't cope with cooking. Came here to get support and information. (wise move, BTW) Composed emails for family and friends who were interested, giving them information about what was going on, what was planned, test results, etc. Made an appointment with a therapist so that I had someone not involved in any way to talk to. Sometimes we hold back around family or friends, not wanting to upset them. You don't have to worry about that with a \"professional friend\" as I like to call my therapist. Sent an email to the pastor of the church I have belonged to for years, but only attend occasionally. I explained in the email what I was facing as well as the fact that I am agnostic, hovering on the edge of atheism, so I didnt' want or need a lot of \"God-talk\". What I really wanted from him was an occasional phone call to remind me of life. When he called, he asked if I would mind being included on the prayer chain, and I said I'll take any help I can get! It can't hurt.  The first week or two he called every few days, even when he was at a conference out of town. Now it's every week or so. It's been wonderful. We just chat on the phone, as if we were friends catching up on things. He asks about my kids and family. He tells me what is going on in his life. This reminds me that life goes on, and I will, too. Just what I had hoped to get from him. I set up a durable power of attorney for health care so that health care decisions would be made for me by the person I trust if I can't make them for some reason. I cut my longish hair short, as a baby step towards losing my hair during chemo, which may or may not happen, but the change was actually kind of fun. I like it! When anyone asked if they could do something, I said yes and gave them an assignment. It makes them feel less helpless. A neice brought me a Starbuck's latte a couple of times. (a good role for your sister?) Another person delivered some fresh fruit and veggies to supplement the frozen meals. Others will be driving me to appointments to give my usual driver a break.   I accepted the fact that I was too terrified of some of the tests and the surgery to think about them. I decided to just go to appointments and trust that I would cope however I could. None of it was easy, none of it was as hard as I thought it would be. I have coped. That has surprised me no end. All these things were under my control and helped me cope with the cancer, which was totally out of my control. To focus on that over which you have control helps to make the rest bearable. Hang in there. You got through giving birth, life's crises...you will get through this, too. And for goodness sakes, laugh...especially at yourself!                                  ",

The other was calming music. Most of it was Enya. I can just float away on that music. The trick is to use calming rather than boring music, whatever that might be for you. Native American flute music and Mike Rowland are others that work for me. Oh, and there's Harper Tasche, but I don't know if his music would be available over there. He plays the Celtic harp, psaltery, and others, and composes his own music. I'm partial to Harper because he came a couple of times to a village in the mountains where I was a volunteer. Years ago he had been a volunteer there, so came back to perform for the villagers from time to time. Some of his music was inspired by night-time musings at the village. I'll send you a PM with more info. You are sounding great!!! Towhee ",

However, for sleeping, I have a microbead pillow that I hug when I sleep. Snuggling it against my chest made it possible to sleep on my side much sooner than I expected. For positioning the arm away from the body, it is absolutely ideal. You can squish it around exactly how you want it. Being nearly healed, I don't really need to hug my pillow at night any more, but it fits so nicely where my breasts used to be, and is soooooo cozy.

Connor's fever is down (was over 102 during the night) and he seems much better. A short illness is deeply appreciated. Hopefully back to school tomorrow. My hip is nearly all better...I can walk!!! All is well and I'm ashamed to have dumped on everyone over things that turned out to be no big deal...sigh Nancy, I'm counting down with you, too! There's not much harder work that moving and creating your own space, but it is very satisfying work. It can be addicting!

      "Content": "Mar 14, 2008 10:24PM - edited Mar 14, 2008 10:56PM by Towhee Hello again everyone! It's been four months since I posted. I've checked in from time to time to see how you are all doing. What a group! Because I felt it was time to let go of obsessing about cancer, I had stopped participating. Reading recent posts, though, have motivated a return. Has anyone saved my seat at the bar? This could turn into a book, so bear with me as I try to be brief... Events: 2007...partner's mother died (elderly, not unexpected, but still hard. I was quite close to her), my sister died (unexpected, only 65), partner's best friend died (prostate cancer, only 56), breast cancer and surgery for me, son who was only child for partner went off to college. Loss, loss, loss, loss...then my (female) life partner of 22 years ended our relationship. I left the end of January. She owns the house, so there was no choice. For 26 years I enjoyed a career as an RN. I became unable to continue as an autoimmune disorder became increasingly worse. I've been on disability since 1995, so my income is a pittance...too little to afford deposits and rent on a decent apartment. However, I do have four adult children who are rather amazing human beings. Their offers of a place to live were gratifying, but I have always maintained that I would live on the streets before moving in with one of them. There are certain things you just don't want to know about the lives of your children, and living with them means you get to know everything!  After searching for affordable housing and looking at the downside of doorway/park bench living in downtown Seattle, I relented. My eldest son and his wife are finishing building their dream home and invited me to join them. I have my own room with adjoining bathroom. While waiting for the house to become liveable, I stayed with some dear friends who wanted it to be permanent...how popular is that, eh? I'm now ensconced in my lovely room. Because of having a child so late in life, I didn't get to do much \"grandmothering\" to my older grandchildren. This  son has an 18-month-old boy, so I finally get to spoil a grandchild. He is a delight, but caring for him is overwhelming sometimes. Both parents work, so I am \"it\" a good deal of the time.  Here's why I'm back: Bootface is still firmly in the fabric of my life...the fear, the sensation of stiff, truly ugly scar tissue where living breasts once existed, waiting for mets that must surely be in my future, panicked about going through dying of my cancer...it just doesn't go away, does it? Enough of my story and on to why I just had to post: Karen and Lisa...about theater: My youngest son, the one at college in Walla Walla (Whitman) is also obsessed. He's been taking classes at Seattle Children's Theater since he was about 7. The past two summers he did an internship there. He's been in every musical at school and many plays at school and at Seattle Children's Theater. He loves it so much that he knows an education is critical. If he ends up with some crappy job with lousy wages, he won't be able to afford staying involved in theater. So, he worked hard in school to qualify for getting an education at a college with a good drama department. He's doing a double major in economics and theater. Tell those girls to hit the books!!!  Jule, my son is an avid flyfisher, naturalist, and photographer who is enjoying hopping on his bike and exploring the Walla Walla area. Any insider info I can pass on to him? Sue, it's good to know you haven't changed. I still love you, you know!   Enough already. I'm trying to absorb everyone's stories and am totally confused about things like whether AE and UB are chemo drugs or people taking them, and if the yellow brick road goes through my neighborhood.

That said, I'll tell you my stories...Karen, I can relate to your mother's story. My grandparents had a small farm. I loved, loved, loved the animals and named them all. The cows were dairy cows, so I thought I was safe. Then an adorable little bull was born to my favoite cow Susannah (she used to let me sit on her back). I was about 7 years old. That little guy would lick my patent leather Sunday shoes to a blinding shine as I stood on the lowest fence rail. Then one Sunday dinner at grandma's, she served veal instead of chicken. I had no idea what veal was until my mean, mean older sister told me I had eaten my little bull calf. I have never knowingly eaten veal since then.  My Chinese DIL was talking about having eaten both dog and cat. She didn't give it a thought back then because no one kept dogs or cats as pets. It was the same as our food animals. Since living in this country (15 years), she has bonded to pets and is horrified to think anyone could think of using them as food. It's very cultural.   Jane, you must have had very special parents. AE, Good timing on the biopsy! I'll be with you.  Everyone else...hang in there and pop up as soon as you can!!!    (Judie sinks back into her black hole, feeling sorry for herself, and won't come out until she can appreciate all that she does have.) ",

It's now an interesting household. Mom keeps telling me (in gestures and occasional interpretations by DIL) to go rest. Excuse me! I haven't lost two entire night's sleep and acquired jet lag to boot. So I try to get her to rest. She just laughs and keeps on cleaning and cooking and stuffing food into little Connor. It's going to be interesting. She is a good cook, though. Yummy dinner. And she likes the apricot-currant bread I baked for their arrival. Off to \"rest\" now...love to all, Judie ",

It would have been fun to see you again. My greatest disappointment, however, is not getting photos when we had the chance. I thought we could get them over the next couple of days. That means we have to do it again, doesn't it? Good attitude, Cathi. I admire you. My attitude is that this is a load of crap I don't deserve and there is NOTHING good about it. Period. So which of us is happier and will live life to the fullest? I gotta get a grip. That's all the energy I got tonight. Here's a photo of me sans Jule that Devin took:  ",

I've taken it the past two nights and still take 3 or more hours to fall asleep, but with the med I don't wake up again until morning. We'll see. It sure gives a hangover, though. AE, I'm not stewing over the ex but allowing things to unfold however they will. We are talking at least once a day and the conversations are as if we just picked up where we left off. It's good to communicate about unfinished business, like when setting up my sewing machine yesterday to make some outfits for Connor, I realized that all my accessories, threads, supplies, patterns, etc. are still at her house. It still feels eerily strange, but so far okay. Jane!!! So good to hear from you. Please get internet soon and tell us all about your new home and community. Sheila, how very true. Thanks for the inspiration. That's SO you! Cathi, how goes it?  I know what you mean about dreading actually seeing your chest. It's a tough hurdle, but once done it's done and you can move on. Did you end up writing a message on the girls before they left home? Do you think our girls went away to college and left us with the empty chest syndrome? GROAN......I'm sorry. The devil made me do it. Oh, Nancy! I can't imagine the pressure you're under. I'm sorry, but I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the peek into your world. You are a strong woman...which has always come through in your posts, but I see it more clearly today. I hope a reprieve arrives soon so you can have a little fun and relaxation. Karen, be well.

I'm glad Ed was with you. Some advice from one who learned the hard way. Despite being a little more expensive, go to a shop staffed with certified fitters when you get your first breast forms. You wouldn't believe the training they go through to be certified. They will guide you to what will look best. No guesswork for you, and they make you feel soooo at ease. I really disliked wearing them until I found the Amoena Contact Comfort +. It feels like part of my body instead of an add-on. Both the shop (Mary Catherine's) and the Amoena sales rep bent over backwards to find what I needed, saying that they weren't finished until I was happy...which isn't easy sometimes. End of shameless infomercial. I just can't believe what they did for me and am so grateful. Sheila, IMO, you won.  Britney Spears trumps a beer-bellied ballerina any day! The vote was rigged! Demand a recount! Karen, I'm sorry about Tinker. We had a similar situation with our Wire-haired Fox Terrier when she was only about three years old. There would be a puddle on the kitchen floor that looked like it could only have come from an elephant, and she drank huge quantities. Her problem turned out to be diabetes insipidus (not related to the other, familiar diabetes). It's a lack of a pituitary hormone that regulates whether the body keeps its fluid or releases the excess as urine. When it's missing, fluid just goes in one end and out the other and the body can't maintain its balance. We had to administer hormone drops into her eye every day. Very pricey, but totally cured the problem. Over a few years, her own system took over and we were able to discontinue treatment. It was so weird. It's raining in Seattle. I slept late, so will now hop into the shower, then start sewing another outfit for Connor. Such fun! Have a great day, all! Judie",

Soon you will be back to dentistry. How are you feeling Cathi? Are things anything like you imagined? It's quite a trip, isn't it! Sheila, names are hard to remember and I worry I've forgotten someone so I rarely try to send greetings to each one. I just assume they know I care and receive the warm greetings I send. I live across the street from the cathedral for the Archdiocese of Seattle. I've been wanting to check it out. They do a solemn mass on All Souls Day (November 1) every year using Mozart's Requiem. I went 1 1/2 hours early to be sure to have a seat. Turns out there was a regular mass just preceding the Requiem. I went in, not wanting to take a chance on not getting a seat for this very popular event. So I'm thoroughly churched...two masses back to back! I loved it. The Requiem was beyond awesome. Having the music performed as intended...a mass for remembering those who have died...in a gorgeous cathedral was breathtaking. Lots of tears of remembrance of my parents and sister, and tears responding to the beauty mingled as one. Today is the feast day for St. Martin de Porres, the patron saint of social justice, the poor, and others. The Cathedral is doing a mass that day for the homeless who died this year. For many of them it is the only remembrance there will ever be. I'm touched. I plan to attend. Having a cathedral across the street might be dangerous! I'm agnostic teetering on the brink of atheism, but I love the ritual and community of church...sigh.   Love to all, especially Mel at this difficult time. You can do it honeygirl!!! Judie",

As I said, the retreat was filled with huge belly laughs from snappy exchanges of word play and twisting of images. That, I'm afraid, came home with me. I glanced at your very wise signature line quote, and it became \"It's not whether you get knocked up - it's whether you get back down!\" I'm sorry. I hope no one is offended. I'll get over the retreat's evil effects soon. Nancy, your story for Leesa was very meaningful for me. It is my deep desire to spare my children the experience you had with your mother. It is, indeed, a fine line. If I were to act fully on how I feel, I'd be on the phone daily with each of them telling them about what it's like living in the shadow of bootface. But that would be depressing and irritating. If I were to act fully on my desire to protect them, I'd be stoic and refuse to acknowledge suffering. Striking a balance...being honest without negativity, recognizing when I need to take care of something, letting them support me in ways meaningful to both of us...it's a challenge. Sheila, I can see your stone sparkling in the window over your sink. These small symbols can help anchor us when life seems out of focus. How wonderful that your church has a yearly retreat! Ulla, your words may be few, but they are filled with you and your joy. A week finished already! I hear a distant dentist's drill...it gets closer every day. Study, study, study! (as if I needed to tell you) Your goal is at last within your reach. Karen, any progress on the house? Access to your lot? When I lived in my previous home, a neighbor subdivided his lot, but the section he wanted to sell had no access to the road. He asked us for an easement, but we refused. It would have totally intruded into our lifestyle and the peace and quiet of our property. So I do understand that there can be a lot with no access to the road. I hope that works out for you. Shirlann, I can't believe that your daughter-in-law was so insistent on a forced march. Have you and Walt recovered? BTW, I checked around and think I answered my own question about jealousy/envy: Jealous 1     a: intolerant of rivalry or unfaithfulness     b: disposed to suspect rivalry or unfaithfulness 2: hostile toward a rival or one believed to enjoy an advantage 3: vigilant in guarding a possession Envious: 1: painfully or resentfully aware of an advantage enjoyed by another joined with a desire to possess the same advantage Jealousy concerns something one has and is afraid of losing, while envy concerns something one does not have and either he wants to acquire, or prevent another person from getting. \"Jealousy is always born with love; it does not always die with it.\" Jealousy concerns something one has and is afraid of losing, while envy concerns something one does not have and either he wants to acquire (non-malicious envy) or he wants the other(s) not to have (malicious envy) The experience of jealousy involves: Fear of loss Suspicion or anger about betrayal Low self-esteem and sadness over loss Uncertainty and loneliness Fear of losing an important person to an attractive other Distrust The experience of envy involves: Feelings of inferiority Longing Resentment of circumstances Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities Disapproval of feelings I'm afraid I suffer from both this past year.

That was one vicious bit of protoplasm! No one could touch his \"boy\" in his presence. Shirl, that turducken sounds like such fun! You are clearly a mom to come home to! Nets, go for it girl! I'm glad you are finally getting a few things sorted out.\\ Hey, Sue, whatcha' reading? Wish I had a brew here. Sounds good. I'm reading Angela's Ashes. Hi Jule! Gosh...I had lots more to say but I'm fading. Not a wink of sleep last night. Luckily that isn't happening very often any more, but it does sap one's energy. My love to each of you. You are always in my heart.",

Why do some of us stick around after the crises of diagnosis and treatment. Yes, we want to help. Yes, we find support. Yes, we have to endure the pain of sad news of all kinds. But is that all? What we have here is salt and pepper. Salty tears interspersed with spice, sometimes pretty hot! (Lisa, are you listening?) We are a miniature slice of life, drawn together by a shared, life-changing experience. We also have sugar and vinegar. Sweet, inspiring thoughts. Intense explosions. I tried to migrate to a support group for parents of children who died. What I found there was people so absorbed in their own tragedy that they could only taste the salt, spew the vinegar. It was a very large group who never shared silliness, joy, mundane details of everyday life. It was depressing rather than supportive. Back \"home\" there is a fullness of communication that makes life seem hopeful no matter what happens. We embrace it all. What a miracle! I love you guys...  Judie",

My lump was slightly over an inch and only one breast was affected. I was given the option of just removing the lump with radiation treatment afterwards, but I chose to have both breasts removed, hoping to avoid  radiation, chemotherapy, and worries about it coming back in the other breast. One of my lymph nodes had cancer cells, though, so I will need chemo, but not radiation. The breast that had no cancer showed changes that tend to develop into cancer, so I was pleased with my decision.  On size, if your tumor is 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) it puts you in category 2 out of 3 for tumor size. Category 1 is less than or equal to 2 centimeters. Category 2 is between 2 and 5 centimeters, Catgory 3 is larger than 5 centimeters.This is just one part of looking at your cancer. After surgery, when all pathology and other tests are finished, your doctors will have a clearer picture of what is there and how to treat it.",

My dear mother had the gift of seeing humor in any situation.  It was how she coped with everything that was falling apart in her life. She especially laughed at herself instead of feeling she was a failure or getting embarrassed. Toward the end when she developed Alzheimers and would forget mid-sentence what she was saying, her eyes would twinkle and she'd say, \"Well, I have Alzheimers, you know!\" and laugh. In the darkness, find a little humor. Like when my daughter asked if removing breasts caused phantom pain like when a leg is amputated. Nipples are sooooo sensitive, she said. Hmmm says I, I haven't heard, but the sensation in my breasts usually isn't painful...I wonder if I'll get phanton pleasure. Or, like a button I saw: \"Yes, these are fake. The real ones tried to kill me!\" (I'm thinking of doing that at some point.) As to the pain in your lump, I had that and it scared me. After surgery, the pathology report mentioned the presence of a small amount of blood inside the tumor, probably caused by the biopsy. I'm convinced that was the source of the pain. I don't know why I didn't think of it!  Hang in there! ",

It was especially bad at night, probably because there was nothing to distract me from noticing it. When I first got into bed it felt like it was going to explode. I had a both breasts removed. I just had four sentinel nodes removed, not a full dissection. Here are my life's experiences with pain, in order of severity: 1. Broken shoulder  2. Childbirth without anesthesia 3. Abdominal surgery 4. Pneumonia 5. Influenza 6. Mastectomy I am three weeks post-surgery. When I reach up or to the side, the incision area pulls and is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes the whole thing starts burning. That's it. Not painful at all, just not \"normal\" to the point I never notice it. Fear...I know what you feel on that issue. I've had surgeries, etc. before, and was frightened, but this was more than just surgery. It was the big C. I took an anti-anxiety pill the night before, held tightly to the hand of someone I cared for, and who was calming to me, right up to the final moment, asked the anesthesiologist to give me something to calm me down the moment he appeared, and focused on my breathing just as I had done when I was in labor. It all helped. I woke up after surgery feeling 1000 times better than I expected. All that fear over nothing. I was embarrassed.   If you choose to walk away, you likely risk losing your life. We have to be brave through this.  Remind yourself that you will be able to do what you need to do at the time it needs doing. You cannot do today what you need to do the day of surgery. So Sue...what needs doing right now??? ",

Anyone know  of a good label for me? Our Easter was fabulous. The teen grandchildren set up egg coloring and an egg hunt for the two little ones...Connor and a 3-year-old grandneice. The two of them bonded and were adorable all day. I ate Swedish pancakes until I nearly burst...six of them! two with fresh strawberries and sour cream, two with blueberries and sour cream, two with butter and maple syrup. All this and the best ham I've had in years. We took turns cooking the pancakes and laughed hysterically at each other. There's quite a trick in flipping them and sometimes they break mid-flip, or land on the pan off-center. My father used to flip them flawlessly using a simple table knife! I'm so sorry that your Easter was stressful, Karen. I don't know what to offer as advice, so I'll just keep my arms around you until you feel better. Money stuff is very scary, Elaine, especially to a guy who is now the major support in a pricey situation. Working one's way through college is very tough, but there might need to be a compromise over time. You will find ways to work it out. At least with ssd you won't have the worry of huge medical bills. Hang in there. Love that pic, AE. Perfect place to cut loose after chemo for bootface! Three days Connor-free for me!!! Lots to do,  including rest. His mom leaves for China for a few weeks on April 29, so need to be in good shape. The other grandparents will take him some days for lunch and nap, but I'll have him every evening/night. Holding your daughter and you in my heart, Cathi. I, too, have had two friends with cervical ca that had simple conization of the cervix and no recurrence, but both were found very early. Hoping for that outcome for your daughter!

I'm hoping to head your way next month. I miss my guy!!! Karen, I think of you often. I know what you mean about being sidetracked by thoughts of your dad. It still happens to me many years later. Parents are part of the fabric of who we are. Portia is a knockout! I had a daughter who was actually kind of homely, but refused to let it stop her. She became highly skilled with makeup and filled in the rest with personality. Sue, did you get your hair cut? Pictures, please! Anne, 22 years ago I was in my prime physically and emotionally, doing work I loved (charge RN L&D), was respected and had lots of friends. I had met the love of my life and we were beginning the process of having a child and creating a family. It was a very good time. Happy Anniversary!  Love and hugs to AE, Shirlann, Sheila! Judie",

Being alone is scary and hard, just like being told you have BC or any other crisis. I've been alone for almost eight months now and must take one day at a time. It is doable, and in the end life will be far better than before. As you know, when I fall apart I just do it here then put myself back together with the help of those who love me. Shirlann, My mother started a tradition many years ago of baking a lumpy cake for each grandchild's birthday, pouring rocky road icing all over it, then decorating with tiny toys according to the child...dancing ballerinas,  bicycles, sports figures, motorcycle. I wasn't well and missed Connor's actual day, but decided to do a cake a few days later. It was a rush job, so I just used a cake mix baked in a muffin tin and piled the cupcakes up and poured the icing over them. Mom baked a chocolate cake from her fabulous recipe in a large baking pan and cut it into shapes to pile up. It's actually very simple and silly. Jane, I pray that your neighbors soon forget about darling kitty as she gradually sneaks into your home. She already occupies a space in your heart. Wren, so where is my PM? Details, please! Sue, by the time it gets there it will be a solid mass of chocolate concrete!!! Hmmm...how long does it take, anyway? Yesterday the Glass Museum and a long walk in the surrounding environs, lunch in a nice restaurant seated outdoors. The weather was incredible, the museum indescribable, the company delightful. I could sit in the \"hot studio\" all day and watch the artists create. It is a huge circular studio probably a hundred feet high with several furnaces...at least three...and bleachers for onlookers. The process is a dance by a team bringing the artist's vision to life.  Today was babysitting Connor for 4 hours...Tinker Toys, a trip to the library where he was fully engaged and enchanted, a long walk on another gorgeous day, home to watch a Richard Scarry DVD from the library, out to dinner with daddy. I am a happy camper for once!!! Life is good. (Who said that??? Judie? No way. C'mon. Who said it? Show yourself, coward!) Judie",

No funds for another night, coupled with no rooms available allowed me the adventure of sleeping in my car last night. I haven't done that in years! Both Devin and I thoroughly enjoyed the visit with Jule. He is fascinated by her work and knowledge of fishing in the area, so I had trouble getting a word in edgewise for a while, but more than made up for it after Devin left. Jule and I are pretty equal in the windbag department. Devin left fairly early on for a callback he got from an audition for theater sports (think Who's Line Is It, Anyway). After that Jule and I just ignored the frequent visits by the waiter asking if we wanted anything else and kept on gabbing until the place was closing. The theater sport team Devin had auditioned for has only 9 members and there were just two spots open. Around 30 auditioned and he has no experience, so expected nothing. At 3am there was banging on his dorm room door. When he opened it, the team picked him up and threw him on his bed and pelted him with candies. He got in!!! He's so excited. The school doesn't compete, but the team does frequent shows for the students, which are very popular. It's great acting experience and a ton of fun. On Friday Devin and I walked all over downtown Walla Walla. It's such a cute town with actual stores along the streets so it's great for window-shopping. We then went up into the hills outside of town did some walking and talking. It was gorgeous. There were bushes dripping with choke cherries! I haven't seen those since I was a kid in Idaho. I wanted so much to pick a bunch, but had no container. If you're not familiar with these guys, they are aptly named. Put one in your mouth and you'd be very sorry. It's kind of like putting a lump of alum in your mouth. However, they make the absolute best jelly and pancake syrup in the world! The blackberries are coming on, too, so we gobbled those as we walked. When we got back, I called Jule to make plans after she got off work. She had to go to a meeting her boss usually attends and said Saturday would be best, so Devin and I had dinner at Pho Sho (great name for a college town Vietnamese noodle house, eh?) Then he had to go to a meeting and I hung out at the motel until bedtime. Saturday I called Jule and left a message, but didn't hear back so Devin and I headed south to Oregon and the fantastic Tamástslikt Cultural Institute on the Umatilla Reservation. Then we headed out to Hayes park along the Walla Walla river for another hike. It's such an amazing area no matter where you go. Home, dinner, another call to Jule, left message, then went to the play festival. It was a blast. At 9pm the night before, 9 students from a playwriting class are given the theme for a 10-minute play they are to write by morning. Early am directors and actors are chosen, then all day rehearsals, staging, costuming, performance that evening. The theme was \"reversals\" and every play had to work in the name \"Vladimir\" somewhere. Utterly amazing, sold out event. Night in the car, early breakfast with Devin, then head for home. It's about a five hour trip. The drive home was spectacular, just as the drive down had been. This weather is unbelievable! I had forgotten just how much I love to get behind the wheel and head down the road. So there's the detailed travelogue from the wordy wanderer! I hope Jule is ok. I'm assuming David's plans got changed and she headed out of town. Love her comments about our meeting. We totally hit it off. Jule was exactly what I expected. I would have recognized her anywhere. She's bubbly, fun, wise, and soooo happy with her new man! Love ya' Jule, even when you choose him over me. Judie",

Remember that I am 65 and have a significant belly...My choices are: 1. Buck up and deal. Wear breast forms and avoid surgery. 2. Tidy up the dog-ears only. 3. Single-surgery implant. The best I could obtain is a small A size.(surgeon seemed to lean towards this option) 4. Expanders to whatever size I want...two surgeries plus fills every two weeks. At my age beauty is irrelevant. I hate wearing my fake boobs, but look silly without them. All I really want is to wake up from this bad dream with my own boobs drooping and flopping. I miss them.

Leesa, with a positive ana and normal sed rate, it may not be anything serious. The ana is pretty general and can change. If it is RA or lupus, take one step at a time. It can be no more than a nuisance at times. Hang in there! Because I've been far too deeply depressed to just be stress, and my hot flashes are constant and insomnia intractable, I saw my onc to see if it might all be related to the Femara. She seems to think symptoms are rarely related, and wanted me to see a shrink about the depression and insomnia, and take a two or three week break from Femara to evaluate the hot flashes. In the meantime, I got set up with relaxation training in PT with a woman who runs a wellness program through the hospital that has a great reputation. I can't afford it, so just set up a few individual relaxation training sessions that insurance will cover. She suggested some CDs that can be checked out from the cancer ed library, which I did. Long story long, a couple of them hit me right where I hurt...like how do they know what I'm thinking? It's all about mindfulness, so that's what I'm working on and it is helping greatly. Then I got so sick and tired of hearing people here talk excercise, excercise, excercise for anything from a hangnail to chemo side effects. It is mentioned frequently in regards to Femara. Rats! I'm a sitter, not a runner! But I bit the bullet slightly and got out my Thera-Bands and pages of isometric exercises and stretches. My apartment is now decorated with pages of instructions and colorful lengths of stretchy elastic hanging in several strategic places. I stop at each one and go through the routine at that \"station\" two or three times a day. I slept last night without any medication. Tonight I went to the cathedral across the street for their ecumenical evening Taize service. So lovely and gentle. I wonder if I am actually finally accepting the reality of bootface and taking steps to buck up and deal? Or maybe I just needed a little entertainment. In any case, good to hear from everyone and hope your world is a bit brighter this evening than before. If not, (((((((My Sisters))))))) Judie",

Coming here exposes us to a lot of pain and suffering and fear. Is this healthy? Are we ghoulish or something? How can we be optomistic and cheerful while dealing with the issues here? It can get heavy. Lately, I seem to have added a whole sh*tload of baggage to the mix having nothing to do with bootface. But then, coming here also exposes us to a lot of courage, laughter, dynamic personalities, and a heckuva great place to unload when our \"turn\" comes. I think each of us must take a vacation from time to time to maintain perspective, but the thought of anyone leaving permanently is hard to imagine. Yet we are all individuals, with individual needs/resources, and paths and I respect those deeply. The above ramble is probably meaningless. I'm tired. Today the frenetic, raw, crazy days ended with a truly beautiful funeral service where tributes from my son's professional, academic, friend and family networks brought to my awareness how large was the circle of his influence. He was an amazing being and I will miss him. It is now time to grieve and to heal. The love and support here is with me. Thank you. And congrats Lisa, and anyone else who chooses to go to the movies instead of crawling into a hole. It's the little things.  Judie",

While all of us are free, yea, encouraged, to vent and even wallow when needed, for a long time my needs will be overwhelming to this group. With losing my partner and home followed by losing my son, bootface seems to fade into the background in my life and it is unlikely that I will have much wisdom or support to offer for quite a while. I am currently not facing treatment, recurrence, surgery...just coasting along. Know that I am going to be okay. I am needed and will find the courage to go on and sustain those around me. There are a couple of support groups I'm checking out and plan to be involved. I know I will discover another circle of people who understand and will not tire of listening. It is unreasonable to expect others to listen every time something comes up. Having a place of understanding at those times is such a blessing. Lighthearted moments and joyful times are on my agenda for sure. I will remain open to them and embrace them when it is time. For now there is the work of grief to do. This group has taught me just how much it helps to talk with others who have \"been there\" and are never \"fed up\" with talking about bootface. You have been a miracle, and will continue to be. I have delighted in the journey to the Emerald City with you and will always carry you in my heart. Having a life-threatening disease and the constant shadow of it has brought together one of the most diverse, amazing group of women I have ever known. You are all my heroes. If anyone cares to send a PM on occasion, I will get a notification email and read/respond. It is likely that I will also drop in to check up on all of you, but won't post...just a loving presence in the background. Please keep on being the loving, silly, fascinating, sweet, ribald, creative people you are. Judie",

You can even just cook up oat fiber and it tastes the same as oatmeal. I add berries, nuts, seeds, cinnamon, etc. to vary the flavor, but I am one who enjoys oatmeal anyway. I use half-and-half and real maple syrup on it...my guilty pleasure! BTW, I like my oatmeal creamy and have developed a method of cooking that is perfect for me. I mix the grain, salt, and water in a bowl, microwave until it just comes to a boil (usually about 2 minutes) then turn the microwave down to its lowest setting and cook for 15 minutes. ",

I'm in a never-never land of all the things my son collected, reading his amazing college creative essays, unearthing his dozens of adventures written for D&D....he was a locally famous dungeon master...unending paisley shirts... It's so bittersweet...like an autopsy of his soul. I've washed and folded at least 30 shirts that are in great shape for Devin to check out. What he doesn't want will go to charity. I'm quite immersed in selling some SACDs that he purchased from Japan and arrived after his death. They're pricey, and the wife can use the money. The online Quadrophonic community has been amazing...almost as good as here! Sue got totally yelled at on Facebook by Val, Karen, and I, and promised to see the doc today. She'd better do it or she wll suffer the consequences. Cathi, my heart melts every time I see Margo. That is way too cute. Bring her along when you come visit, okay? Nets, you are a hoot. I'm glad you found us. Keep that attitude, girl! When I was married in the long, long ago, my married name was Campbell, and hubby was very into his Scottish heritage. I did calculations once and came up with 1/8 Scot, but heck, the name clearly qualified. Therefore, we named our first son Cailen after Cailen Maol, an ancient knight or king or something. Cai was very proud of his name, and dreamed of visiting Scotland one day. Nancy, I think a good physical therapist is worth their weight in gold. Sadly, insurance tends not to agree. Sunglasses! What a treat. It's amazing what light does to the mood. Today is sunny here, thus this long epistle. I do so enjoy your visits. Ay, Carumba!!! I'm starting to sputter...not as much gas as I thought in my tank..Jane, you are so precious to me...keep it up. Karen, I know that you are going through with Tinker...been there done that. Imagine carrying a lab down the stairs to the back yard to potty, then back up. So hard. Sheila, I'm thinking of making a quilt out of Cai's paisley shirts. Am i nuts? Weird? Mel, honey, I hope you are finding as much light in your life as you bring to this board. You are amazing. Lisa, great attitude. I'm right with you offering support and courage as you step out. So much to say. So many women (and a man) that I love who are in my heart but not in my fading awareness of this moment. Oh, well. Gotta stop somewhere! Nitey nite from me and Agnes ",

I can imagine my adopted daughter nodding in agreement. (except for the wicked step-mother, of course. Integrating an adopted child into a family of biological siblings isn't as easy as one would think. I loved my kids as equally as any parent can. The only difference was the initial bonding. It took a bit longer, but did happen. She was #2 of my first four. The reality is that who we are is a combination of nature and nurture. My daughter had distinct personality differences from the others. Those were not necessarily negative, but made her not fit in easily with the natural flow of things. She and I both had to work a bit harder. As adults, she and the others are not as close. Despite my best intentions and hard work, I couldn't force the kind of relationship we desired. It sounds like your husband's mother might have been disappointed by the challenges on adopting and integrating him into the family. Her behavior might reflect that. It is wrong. Your husband doesn't deserve it. And, he can't change it. All you can do is accept that she has done the best she was capable of and be grateful that he has been given the gift of a good woman to love (you, of course!). Oh, geez...I'm waxing way to philosophical today. Better quit. I'm going to bore you with a poem I wrote for my daughter...I hope I haven't posted it before...memory, you know!",

BTW, 42 is so young as to be almost underage, IMO!!! A couple of months ago I went through the \"should I have done chemo\" crisis. I even asked my onc if I could still re-visit that decision, but she said it was too late. I soon settled back into my original rationale 'cause it was the right thing for me. Karen, diagnostic possibilities: 1. Tamoxifen...it can get worse over time and can cause constant pain. 2. Canceritis phobialis...a common affliction here 3. Something autoimmune. 7. Bootface So are you trying to imitate Sue? Get thee to a doc my dear. If nothing else, that much pain needs management. Suffering is non-productive. Knowledge is power.

She'll be SO glad to get home and be your sweet angel after what I put her through! Great job confronting the PS, Cheryl. It sounds like he is on board now. You've sure had the complications, but this, too, shall pass. How wonderful to have a son willing to clean for you. Good job, mom! Leesa...leave it to a nurse to discuss anatomy and surgery with a 7-year-old. I laughed out loud. But hey, she asked, didn't she? I hope you figure out what's going on with your body soon so that you can get treatment. LIsa, I assumed you were a partier in high school and beyond. Your eyes give you away. And here you are dating one guy and chatting up another already. I'm so jealous. Of course you have my permission to share anything I write with your daughter. I admire her so much. Can there be anything harder than to do the right thing for a child regardless of your own desires? She rocks! Elaine, your description of this place is beautiful. Very, very well said.

I would have been delighted to have my daughter with me for a biopsy. Your mom doesn't know what she's missing, but we're all individuals doing things how we need them to be done. That's okay. I've gotten behind and can't begin to respond to all the posts. You just can't miss a day around here! Cathi, I was the daughter of a car dealer who loved his work and had tons of energy. This meant at least six days per week, off to work at 6am, home by dinner IF we were lucky, which was not often. So I understand what you must be going through. My mother dealt with it well most of the time, but went through periods of resentment and even worrying about \"another woman\" kind of stuff, which never happened. One way they made things a little better was him coming home for lunch. Mom would have it ready when he walked in the door, they'd eat then cuddle up on the couch for a power nap. It was very sweet. And when he was home, he was truly there...fun, warm, silly, romantic, a gread dad and husband. Is there any way you two could find to bridge the gap a little? Jane, I don't know how you do it. Having your partner only on weekends must be tough. Any plans to change that eventually? Nettie, that video is hilarious! I'm glad you are feeling better. Lisa, welcome to the virus incubation club! I've got one stranger than strange. Luckily, part of the strange is that it's not too bad. Achy, fever every day or two. One day I decided it was a sinus infection because I imaginged a little facial pressure and had to blow my nose...once...in the morning. Within a couple of hours, all gone. This morning my nose turned into a garden hose for one huge blow that pulverized a Kleenex. After that a bit drippy for maybe 20 minutes. All better! This has gone on for a week now. Karen, I, too, was a bit concerned about your post. It's a relief to hear that things are not scary. I hope Rhuel is able to relax and be himself in Las Vegas. Sounds like fun! Leesa, it sounds like your business is going to take off smoothly. You deserve a bit of sleep. Speaking of sleep, I'd better grab some. Lunch tomorrow with my RNB group. We graduated from the University of Washington in 1979 and have had a weekend outing and a winter luncheon every year since. An odd group, but somehow we just like hanging out together. Can't wait to hear the next installment in their lives. g'night all!",

As a teenager, she was always getting into trouble for taking off on her horse after school and riding until dark.  Heaven. You've earned this trip, and so has your husband. Enjoy every moment! It's nearly 3am. What am I doing? No brains.",

I'm sure we have some kind of hereditary thing because it strikes young and old, thin and fat among us. Your symptoms are classic for gallstones. Some people have severe, painful attacks, some have mild pain or none at all. I had little pain but terrible digestive symptoms. (potent sulphur-smelling belching, nausea, diarrhea) Surgery is usually laparoscopic and not too bad. I had mine back in the olden days when they usually made the incision at the bottom of the ribs on the right, which was incredibly painful. My surgeon made my incision up-and-down...sternum to navel, so I would have less pain. Nice guy. What he didn't tell me is that the connective tissue in that area doesn't heal as strong as before and is highly prone to creating hernias along the incision line. I ended up with three hernia surgeries, the last one with a mesh patch which is holding well. My daughter had surgery three years ago, laparoscopic, same-day surgery, little pain, rapid recovery. Good luck!",

Sue, you would love Seattle. We might be a bit cozy in my little one bedroom place, but the boys could sleep on the floor...we'd make do because you would all be so happy here. There is a Sub shop four blocks from here and I'm sure they must need you! I just returned from a five-mile round trip walk and think I'm going to die soon, so have to write fast. An old friend called and asked me if I would like to use a ticket...her friend had backed out at the last minute. I grabbed the chance. The Seattle Storm women's basketball team in a playoff game against the LA Spark. I walked to the arena to meet my friend, screamed my head off and now have no voice...we won!!!! It was an exciting game. It's the best 2 of 3 and each team has won a game, so Tuesday will be the deciding one. Wish she had a stray ticket for that game! It was such fun. On that note, I retire.

Sheila, are you the official channeler for us? That is too weird, but wonderful! Karen, you are amazing. Many hugs coming your way.  AE, you asked about Aida. It was spectacular. The dream of a lifetime fulfilled. Since age 14, I have longed to see Aida, but never expected it to happen. Seattle Opera put on a spectacular performance. My date was incredibly suave. He wore his sharp black suit with a dark green dress shirt, tie, and gold tie bar. I wore a dressy pants outfit, earrings, and my grandmother's engagement ring.  My dream came true in a far more magnificent way than I could ever have imagined. That is all true. Also true is the utterly unexpected agony stimulated by a sudden flood of memories of sitting in the theater with my beloved, her parents, our son either on the stage or sitting with us. It was a big part of who we were. The sadness meant viewing the performance through tears, but in no way was my joy diminished. I tell this story because I think it is an example of life as it is for most of us here. Life's overwhelming challenges, including Bootface, pull us down, the goodness of life pulls us up. We live on a yo-yo. Each day I come here to follow the journey of my sisters. I find great joy. NED! Love! Family! Adventure! I also find tragedy, depression, despair, fear.  Life on the yo-yo can stretch us to the breaking point. We come here to reinforce the places that are getting thin before they tear. That is our strength. No matter how bad it gets personally, we can still find the will to offer compassion, the openness to share joy with our sisters.",

I didn't get to see all I wanted. Shirlann, you can mix up Mel and I at will, as far as I'm concerned. We're all part of the same stew. Mel, I'm pleased that you \"get\" my humor. Sometimes I get in trouble. Love the new avatar Sheila! You're dog is cute, but you're cuter! I'm with you, Wren, though I'd susbstitute Rip Van Winkle with Dante's Inferno. Re-awakening is our challenge. Just got back from a walk to the store for TP and came home lugging some on-sale meat and fish, marked-down donuts, chips, a wedge of garlic knoblauch cheese and a pack of TP. I have utterly no sales resistance. Anxiously awating your path report in two weeks, Sue. Take a pain pill and relax for a bit, okay? Love to all! Judie",

But then, who knows...it might be an idea for next time!  I'm so sorry your husband is being like that. It does sound like the irrational thinking of his neurological deterioration. It's so sad that he is so addicted that he thinks of going home to die instead of fighting for the strength to stop drinking. It will be interesting to see what the tests show. And just what you need...and unexpected huge bill. Here's hoping it was just an error easily straightened out. Share the above rain cloud and dancing with Sue...you both are doing the dark cloud thing.

Sue, you are going to have a wonderful time unwinding and getting away from bootface. I'm sending lots of sunshine to your soul. AE, I hadn't known much about the Catholic service, but did remember there was controversy about giving up Latin. I took Latin in high school, so wished I had gone before they discontinued it. However, it turns out that the parishoners at the cathedral wanted things a bit more traditional, so they do some in Latin and some in English. The solemn mass with the Mozart Requiem was all in Latin. I soon learned that there is a difference between classical Latin and church Latin! I was pronouncing everything quite differently. It was interesting at any rate. Cathi, your story was priceless! I've run into receptionists who don't have a clue at times, but never to that extent! You owe me another keyboard, and I'm not sure how much damage there is to the monitor! Leesa, hang in there. It's awful how many decisions we have to make and how much waiting we have to do. It doesn't get easier, it just gets done. Each step is one behind you. Take them one at a time and come here often to interact with women who understant and will support you. SHIRLANN!!!

For me, I think it is because today is the love of my life's first anniversary of meeting the love of her life. Two days later the affair began. It is a time of celebration for them. This event happened one week after my breasts were whacked off and I felt and looked like Bride of Frankenstein. Family members who were a big part of my life had died in recent weeks and months. There comes  a time when the aggregate of loss overcomes any possibility of meaning I have shelter, but no home. I have children but no family. I am utterly alone, dancing each day with bootface, waiting for his attack. Sue, Cathi, Fumi, and others...this is not a time I can offer support.  That makes me deeply sad. I just don't understand life anymore. Once upon a time I considered myself very wise. Everything good has abandoned me. It grieves me to be so negative. I hate my life more that I hate politics. But I still love my sisters who won't ban me no matter what I say. Judie",

I had this spa robe that was sooooo soft, but didn't fit but I loved the fabric and couldn't give it away. I decided to cut it up into jammies for Connor. It's kind of feminine, but who cares for jammies. He's obsessed with moose right now, so I put one on the front. Then, late at night, I wondered if I could create a nightcap...  How totally goofy is that!!!??? Oh, well, he loves it. Ulla, big hugs to you.

There were spiritual times, lots of Yoga, more belly laughs than I've had in years, connecting with women who KNOW what it's like living with bootface who don't tell you to cheer up, the healthiest, most delicious food I've ever eaten, staff who find pure joy in creating an atmosphere of freedom, peace, support. They wouldn't even let us tidy up our mats after a yoga session. Walking up the hill to a meadow and finding bear scat along the trail, awakening to the gentle sound of a small gong at each door in the morning, hugs, tears, an incredible rainbow from water to sky....bliss. Returning to reality, to an empty apartment, is tough, but I hold in my hand the small pebble from Iona, Scotland that I was given and I am comforted. It is 2.7 billion years old, smooth and white with a small pale green heart on one side. It gives perspective. Namaste, Judie Oh, dear. I've got to shed the new age trappings soon. For now, bear with me!",

No one else can provide it. I miss it terribly. What I do have is children who are willing to give/do anything for me, friends who care, numbers to call any time of the day or night, hugs from caring family and friends, people who have \"been through it\" a sensitive counselor...so much more than many of us have. I am blessed, and grateful. But there is always an empty spot that can only be filled by one who has been by your side through it all...childbirth, broken bones, homework, promotions, sickness, passion, dreams,shared memories, tragedy. One who holds you through the night, comes through the door every single day, someone who appreciates your cooking or any little thing you do, who knows you and what comforts you. I have so much. I am grateful. I also mourn for what was and feel lost without it. The support here has been phenomenal. It amazes me how much can come through words alone from people I have never met. Well, I have met Jule and there's a strong hope in my heart that Wren will fly over and land soon. I have nothing to give these days but do read about and care for each of you and what you are facing. You are strong people and will rise above the challenges of bootface. Judie",

I shot through the flowers and window to the cathedral towers outside.  Shirl, Ulla was in Paris for the holidays and is active on Facebook, though I haven't connected with her. Perhaps she's taking a well-earned holiday from bootface. I'll bet we'll see her again, though. Thanks for the uplifting words everyone. They mean more than you can ever know.

The difference is that you had four positive lymph nodes on pathology, which couldn't be known for certain before surgery.  So your onc is correct, but remember that N2 meand 4-9 positive nodes, so you were just barely into that category.

This summer is our 30th reunion. For our 20th we went to Maui for a week. We had each chipped in $50-100 at each of our two gatherings per year for five years, which was placed in a mutual fund. It was during the glory days of the stock market and we had enough money for airfare, all meals, and the rental of a 10-acre estate belonging to a rock star. I slept in his bed! We talked about doing the Greek isles for our 30th, but husbands and partners were so unhappy about our great adventure without them that we cooled our heels. We had hoped to do something special but didn't invest regularly, which is a good thing...we would have lost bigtime. So this reunion will be local, and instead of spending money on travel, we are all going to bring a gift for each of the others. One is making a stained glass hanging for each of us, one jewelry made from the Venetian glass beads she brought home from a trip to Italy, one quilted table runners (she always wins a ribbon at the state fair for her quilts), and the rest of us have to figure out what to give. It will be wonderful. I'll come home with 8 hand-made or carefully chosen gifts from long-time friends! Hey Leesa, you feel old with a daughter turning 23????

Then I turn my eyes to the amazing deeds of ordinary people, both simple and heroic. Yes, life is worth living. One person can make a difference. You could not save your friend, but maybe you have saved another life or made the world a better place for someone. What purpose is there in giving up? There is only meaning in taking the next step, then the next. I, too, become engulfed in dark thoughts sometimes. Life is unfair. Why do I have to suffer when others do not? There is no answer. Ulla, I am alone, too. I feel your pain. I am alone in a different way...there are people in the house where I live, but no one who understands or cares to understand. I live in my room alone most of the time. So let's be alone, sad, worried, and scared together. I will fill my heart with love and caring for you. And I will fill my heart, too, with hope and a vision of you as a dentist, caring for the health of people, as a woman who challenges her mind and body to be the best they can be, as a friend who brings understanding where there is none, and of your corner of the world being better because of who you are. My heart is also with your dear family and your husband. Be strong so that you can be there for them every day. You are so special. Your sister, Judie ",

He is responding well to my potty-training talk about putting the poop in the toilet so no yukky diaper. He came into the bathroom at the...ahem...opportune moment, checked the bowl before I had a chance to flush, said, \"Well done, grandma\", pulled the handle and said \"bye-bye\" as it flushed. (And I blushed) At least one of us is getting trained. He cares nada about yukky diapers. I'm off duty until Wednesday night. That should give me just enough time to recuperate.

When are tests scheduled? And to make you feel a bit better, I hope, about your daughter...my youngest daughter used to take my car while I slept long before she was old enough to get a license. I just learned this the other day. I only knew about the time she lost control backing out of our drive and hit two cars parked at our neighbor's house. My insurance company specifically listed her as not covered on my auto policy! It shook her up so much that she never drove again until her late 20s! She grew up to be extremely responsible, but I wondered during those teen years... AE, you and UB are amazing. And I love your townhouse, especially the ducks outside and the critters on the bed. Are they labs? (not UB, of course, he's clearly a Racing Snoozhound...I just love those). I adore labs and German Shepherds. Ulla, weight varies day to day, time of day, before period, after period, and phase of the moon. It is useless to weigh frequently and try to make sense of it. Weigh yourself at the same time every day...morning, naked, before shower or food is a good one. The ideal is to weigh once a week, but I think you would have no patience with that. :) Once every day or so is also fine, but instead of trying to figure out what it means, look at the trend...over time are you going down or up? Is there a difference in how your clothing fits? Try to ignore specific numbers as much as you can. You look amazing just as you are now. Do you have to use the word \"tiny\" when you refer to mature Swedes? They do love to eat!!!  I know...I'm one of them.  Tiny would not be used in a description of me! Sue, love the poem and, as always, your bright spirit and wicked humor. Your boys are amazing, too. You have much to be proud of, Dorothy! I'll try to post some photos of my current abode. It's fun to see faces and the places they live. Everything becomes more intimate. Sweet dreams Nancy, Judie  Oh, Sue...you posted while I was writing away. I LOVE your red jitney!

But we are a very close family with a weird sense of humor, so the comments were very funny to all, including me. I had a tremendous need for moments that trivialized and poked fun at the upcoming bilateral mastectomy. But this was my family, not in-laws, who knew me and what worked best for me. Most of the goofy humor actually came from me, including the learning to walk again not being top-heavy one. Knowing that many people who have limbs amputated experience phantom pain that seems to come from the missing limb, my daughter in all seriousness asked it it would be the same for me...would I have phantom pain? I had never considered that, and responded with, \"I don't know sweetie, I'll let you know. My guess is that if it happens, it will be phantom pleasure, knowing me!\" She nearly choked and the story was repeated ad nauseum. Those same comments coming from someone who was not close to me would have been innapropriate and infuriating unless I felt that they were having a hard time knowing what to say and used humor as a way to express caring. I'm so sorry it came from the wrong place at the wrong time for you. You are right to keep her away while you are vulnerable. I hope your husband can support you in this. Gibby, love the stupid people comment from your dh! Barbe and Cathi, how very blessed you are. Take good care of those guys!",

Ulla, I think you are well within the area of reason. With such a low percentage of hormone dependence, I'd think about it, too. Is there any way to get statistics out of your doctor or health workers? If taking Tamoxifen increases your odds by 1 or 2 percent, why go through it unless you are driven to do every possible thing. It is you decision, and either way is very reasonable.  Quality of life was why I declined chemo. The standard chemo would give me 3%. Aggressive chemo goes up to 5%. I am 64 and have a chronic autoimmune disease. The chemo would probably affect my well-being for the rest of my life and could even make me bed-ridden. It was an obvious decision for me. If I were the age of most of you guys and in good health otherwise, I'd be right there with the rest of you, lined up for the needle. One must weigh one's values. I wonder if Tender has access to the numbers. I haven't seen anything about the benefit of Tamoxifen related to degree of hormone dependency. It would be most interesting. In the meantime, here's my reaction to all your tears...  One day at a time, my dear, one day at a time. Hugs, Judie ",

It's my first mother's day with only four children and could be sad, but I'm determined to focus on present joy and save sadness for another day. Connor is all excited to see his aunties for a bit, then will go to the \"other\" grandparents while the girls and I play. What a romantic wedding you have ahead, Barbe. Your dress sounds spectacular, the setting divine, the occasion joyful. My wish for you is perfection of the pleasure, even as the usual imperfections of occasion arise.

Sheila, you've increased my \"want to read\" book list more than enough! Thank you so very much. Anne, I had just started reading \"Eat, Pray, Love\" with my SO when things came crashing down and we split. I want to get back to it eventually, but a bit tender right now, as you might imagine. Your other books/authors are also added to my list. All sound intriquing. I've been doing the Middle East, too...Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns, Lion Eyes...can't think of others right now. I'm also reading Chinese stuff, for obvious reasons. Jane, I also read the Curious Incident.... It was an odd book, but I really liked it. You absolutely MUST start painting. Your sons are grown, you are moving to the mountains...just do it, mate! Oh, Shirlann! I loved Marley and Me. I read it when my life still included a lab, so it was all too familiar. Really beautiful book. At the time I was occasionally visiting a lab board, and the author dropped by and chatted every now and again. Having been raised Mormon (has been a long time since l was a member) and having a great-aunt who lived in a polyamous group, the whole thing is interesting to me. \"Real\" Mormons haven't practiced polygamy since the late 1800s, but still get painted with the same brush and the splinter groups. Any recommendations for a good book on the subject? I did read Banners of Heaven. Your other books are on my list now, too. Ann, how creative to make furniture and rooms for your Barbies! And singing! Oh, how I would love to do what you are doing. I'm not a great singer, but when I can sneak into a group of good singers to support my lack of talent, what an amazing feeling it is to open wide and belt it out as if I could! The physical sensation of the harmonies and dynamics absolutely reverberate through the body. Clearly, you love doing the challenging stuff, which is so cool. Familiar fluff is fun, of course, but to wrestle with a piece and come out with beauty...ah, it doesn't get better than that. Hope you are getting rested up so you can be ready for your \"unveiling\" next week. Lisa, I'm with you. I have loved playing around with different media, but my favorite was always graphite. I liked to see how much I could do with just a pencil, graphite stick, or even powdered graphite. Got any drawings to share? I'd love to see at least one. You and Danni are stunning in the photos. Not just beauty, but the loveliness of soul is evident in all your pictures. Let me add my name to those whose teenagers were terrifying and still grew up to be responsible, even successful, adults. Going through it, though, is hard. Especially the lying. That was the hardest for me. I have to tell you a story about that. My youngest was a party girl supreme. She would lie about a sleepover with a girlfriend and go to parties where there was drinking. Wise, caring mother talked with her about the importance of trust between us and all that stuff. One day, she invites me out for pizza so we can talk privately. (my nickel, of course) Mom, she says, I want to be honest, and I want to party. Would you prefer that I actually tell you where I am going, or lie because I know you won't let me go? That's the kind of kid I raised. How wonderful. She put me right in the middle. We talked for a long time and worked out a deal. I drive her and her sister and a friend to the party and drive them home. They will promise to limit their alcohol to one drink, making it last through the evening. So, when I pick them up, Jill says, momionlyhadonedrinkallnightandonlydrankcoketherestofthetime. ArentyouproudofmeIthinkweshoulddoitthiswayallthetime.... I turned to her and said, one drink, eh? That's great, and I think you are telling the truth. How much speed did you have??? HowdidyouknowmomI'mnotdrunkatallandthere'snowayyoucantell! LOL, but not so funny at the time. She manages a large clothing store, has two kids and a husband and is wonderful. It can happen for you, too, Lisa, Nancy, Sherry, and Karen! (Oh, and don't tell Shirlann, but my son stole my little stash of pot from me. That's as bad as it gets, you know. I knew then I had to give it up) Oh, Suebee! I'm so sorry that your recovery is not going well. That sucks big time. It sounds like your surgeon has taken steps to set things right. I'll be thinking of you. Your little family looks adorable. It would be nice to see more if you're willing. I love putting faces to the women here. (and the man...sorry UB) Ulla, what can I say. You're doing all the right things. I think your best bet is lots of retail therapy. Who can have stomach pain in the middle of buying something beautiful! Hang in there! Suzeeq, what will we do when you arrive at the Emerald City? You cobbled together this motley crew to drag you down the Yellow Brick Road. You have a responsibility, you know. What is the next road we must drag you down? We need to be needed! Yes, Kaloni, Photobucket is where you send pictures to live so that you can share them with us. Go to their site, sign up, read about how to use it, then come here for help when it drives you nuts. Ulla had it almost right...it's the Direct Link you want to copy into the little popup you get when you click on the green tree-like icon at the top of the \"add comment to conversation\" box.

Suicide has passed through many minds around here. It's quite natural. Antidepressants help, but the most important thing to remember is that thinking about it once in a while is ok. Action is not. Allow the thoughts to wander through and out. Avoid clinging to them and giving them power they don't deserve. I try to think about the fact that I can always decide not to do it, as long as I live. Once I take action, I no longer get to make that decision. I like to be in control. I will think of you and be here in spirit, but I have to go up to dinner. I'll check back in after that. Oh, and lots of women have given birth after treatment. What more wonderful thought to hold above all than the love you have to give your future child!     Oh, Lisa...if you've told your adoption story I've missed it. Please do tell it again. Two of my five are adopted. Here's a poem I wrote about the first one (who's now 40) Bad poetry...sorry...   To Patti at Sixteen I expected A vulnerable, enchantingly perfect Body to snuggle contentedly In my mother-arms. Your gangly, bald, scarlet Coat-hanger-stiff Body resisted me, Screaming mother-loss. I expected To be fulfilled, Experiencing the radiant Joy of nurturing a needy innocent. You writhed with colic, Slept only fitfully, Rejecting my touch Which needed to comfort. I expected Us to bond instantly, To be mother-daughter paired forever. We wavered, the two of us, Between tender, wondrous love And seething rage. I expected Not to care About your beginnings. I found myself wondering Whose eyes were reflected In your intense, sober ones. Whose passion for music Flamed in you? I expected that you would be mine, Belonging to no other. I desired exclusive possession, But discovered, my precious Woman-child, that no human Owns another. I learned That our hard-earned bond, Our sturdy mother-daughter Sense, belongs exclusively to us. The sacred birthing-bond Belongs to another, whose pure love Delivered you into my life. I honor the woman whose body Nourished you, whose courage Gave you life, enabling another To experience the richness, The pride of being mother To you, most beloved Daughter.

A person loves to entertain and wants to plan a barbeque for friends, but is afraid it might rain so does nothing. The day turns out sunny and perfect for a barbeque. Which is the tragedy? Is planning for an unknown future meaninful in and of itself? Meaningful enough to make it worth the risk?  Love and gentle hugs, Judie ",

Finals are over...Hooray for our kids! Get some rest now. I guess you must be finished with your Tuesday chemo, Sue. Wow...one more. Remember when you couldn't face the idea of all those months on chemo? How thrilling to be on the home stretch. Are you a nurse, Anne? Working in a student health center would be interesting for me. How do you like it? Shirlann, don't let that closet intimidate you. You are in charge. Harumph...that closet is trying to steal the spotlight. Looking forward to a report from Suebee. I truly hope all went well for her. Welcome \"home\" Lisa. Don't you just love those men we call sons? My youngest arrived home from college yesterday. I get to see him for an hour or so on Thursday morning. We're going to take a long 1-day, possibly an overnight next week to the Olympic Peninsula for a bit of \"bonding\" time. He'll fish, I'll shoot birds (camera, of course) and we'll eat American junk food. I can just see your son's bewilderment when he got to Denver, Sheila. His shivers gave me a good chuckle. Hit those books, Jane!!! My mind is blank...what is it you're studying? A senior moment cuddled in a nice, warm, hot flash. Life is good. I think. What defines good? I forget. Karen, you are always my ray of sunshine. I know why your home is filled with so much light. You live there! What is Portia going to do with her upcoming summer? It's always a kind of love/hate thing this time of year. It is now 1:30 am in my world. I've been getting to bed later and later. The past week it has usually been between 4 and 6 am. I hit the sack at 3 Monday and got up at 11. A solid 8 hours of really solid sleep. That was the last of it...haven't slept since. Still don't feel particularly sleepy, but do feel crappy physically. I don't usually have any trouble at all sleeping like a baby. I think it's probably the AI kicking in since I can hardly move. I hurt in places I forgot I had. So I've pretty much been living in my room for a week or so. I'm already taking antidepressants and seeing a counselor, so just need to ride it out. No biggie. BTW, my dil and her parents are from Chongqin in Sechuan Province. Luckily, it wasn't hit too badly and their family and friends are all okay. Can you just see me running around the house trying to communicate with them to tell them about the quake? I finally found news in Chinese on the Google news site. The pictures looked like the story was about the quake, so I printed it out for them. So scary. So many disasters with huge loss of life the past few years. On that note, I'm going to attempt to crash and burn. I figure I can sleep all day tomorrow and be up bright and early Thursday for my \"date\" with a college man!!! Hugs... Judie",

I love having a home cluttered with books, but I've had to enter a life of sparseness for a while. What books I have are still in boxes. A room just doesn't seem right without a bookcase! Sheila, thanks for the tips. I'll look up those authors. I love historical fiction, too. Ordinary Heroes by Scott Turow was an excellent book set in WWII Germany. It gave me a better understanding of that time and place. I read The Kite Runner, then the next one by the same author, A Thousand Splendid Suns. If you want to understand Afghanistan, you can't do better. He's a great writer. Judie ",

So many pages since I left! I've missed each of you. The pressure of caring for my grandson coupled with my family re-connecting through Facebook made it too hard to keep up here. Another reason was that my need for support concerns my son's death. This kind of grief is so complex. My cancer worries have become insignificant for now, and I didn't want to distract from the purpose of this group. I tried an online group more appropriate, buy it was too depressing. As always, things change daily for all of us, including me. I miss staying in touch with all of you and knowing how you are. I don't know how much I can contribute, but will start checking in again. My nephew posted a slideshow-video of old photos of my brother (his father) who died at age 21 when he was 3. My parents raised him after that. The slideshow included his own growing up, my parents, and my children. My nephew has been deeply moved seeing another young boy lose his dad. The music accompanying the show was a CW song about fathers, then another about brothers (my brother and I were very close.) It's been 6 months I and have not cried. I've had to hold it together for others who needed my help and support. The loss is too great for tears, anyway. Long story long, this slideshow, images of my brother and my son, its songs,,,all triggered tears at last. I'd forgotten how painful tears can be. But I must walk through the grief. When one protects onesself from pain, there is also a blunting of the experience of love, joy, happiness, caring. I have little to offer right now, but I'll do what I can. It's a long journey. (Yes Barbe, I'm on antidepressants...lol) As my birthday gift, my youngest son gave me a road trip with him to Utah, where most of my family lives. We had a great time. How is it that relationships become deeper and conversations more meaningful while riding in a car? I was deeply honored that the above-mentioned nephew rode his Suzuki from Idaho to be with me. On what would have been my son's birthday, I spent the morning sitting on the grounds of the hospital where he was born, remembering that day, his birth (my first), and the miracle of his life. In the afternoon, my brother hosted a barbecue. Every single family member within driving distance came. There were 47 in attendance. It was healing being surrounded by loving people, tons of lively little ones, dogs, horses...I am so blessed. On the bootface front, I, too, am having some new pains related to my spine. I had lots of side effects from Arimidex, then Femara. I got an rx for Aromasin, but was waiting to start until after Christmas, in case it also created side effects. I never did start it. I'm just under two years out from surgery. I haven't bothered to see my oncologist, either. Finaly, after the catharsis of tears, I did make an appointment. It's time to pay attention again. I apologize for the lengthy epistle, but it's been a while. I'll be lurking, watching over you with love. Judie",

Along comes a new husband. Okaaaaaaay...maybe. But a new brother at her age??? How disgusting. Suddenly she is not only sharing you, the others need most of the attention and she's left out. Tough situation, but have faith in the good parenting you have done. It will come out eventually. I went through a somewhat similar situation. It was a nightmare. My kids and I all survived. Just barely. My life is being turned upside down again...maybe. More later. For now, I've scheduled surgery to get larger implants and tidy up the remains of the dog ears, maybe do nipples. I don't know. I was happy with the idea of being flat-chested, and would have remained so if I had Cathi's figure. However, I ended up concave because they took so much tissue out, and I'm ...ummm.. a bit portly, shall we say. It was the Tweedle-Dee look and I felt uncomfortable no matter what I wore. It's amazing how much big knockers camoflauge the belly! So, I just went for a one-step implant...no expander, just to correct the concaveness. I have been satisfied with the result, but they are a full cup size different. At my followup today, the surgeon explained why...I won't go into that...and said it could easily be fixed and the rest tidied up. Why am I doing this? I thought I didn't care a whit about boobs. Maybe I just need something to occupy my mind right now. Sheesh! 'nuff for now. I am checking in every day and it feels good. Thanks for being who you are, collectively and individually. OK, just one quick Connor story: He was invited to ride in a HumVee in the 4th of July parade. He is nutty about vehicles right now. I didn't attend, but the rest of the family did. So just as the parade is to begin, he climbs out of the Hummer and says he's all done and wants to go to grandma's. Period. No enticement of glory, food, entertainment had an effect. (buttons popping here) He wanted ME more than he wanted to ride in a HumVee!!!  Love, Judie",

Sue had posted the pie recipe some time ago and I had never gotten around to making it. Being the nerd that I am, I had to look up the history of the pie. Would you believe that the pie when it is sold in stores is called American Pie? No reason. Somebody thought it would sell better if it was American. Sue's recipe is one of many, and is the one I made. I downloaded the original recipe and will try it one day, too. Caramel: 175g (6oz) butter 85g (3oz) caster sugar (superfine sugar in the US. I just used regular and it worked fine. 85g (3oz) dark brown soft sugar 397g can Carnation Sweetened Condensed Milk 4 small bananas 284ml carton double cream, lightly whipped cocoa powder, for dusting In a large saucepan, melt 100g (3½oz) of the butter and stir in the crushed biscuits. Press into the base and partly up the sides of a 7½in springform. Chill while preparing the caramel. To make the caramel, place the butter and the sugars in a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves. Add the condensed milk and, stirring continuously, bring gently to the boil, to make a smooth, golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the biscuit base and chill for about 1½ hours. Slice the bananas and arrange most of them over the caramel. Spread with whipped cream. Decorate with the remaining bananas and dust liberally with cocoa powder. The Original Hungry Monk Banoffi Pie Recipe Invented at the Hungry Monk in 1972, Banoffi Pie (originally known as Banoffee Pie), is still as popular today as it was the first time it appeared on the menu. There have been many imitations as far and wide as Russia and the United States; it is even rumored to be Mrs Thatcher's favourite pudding! Below is the original Banoffi Pie recipe as it first appeared in 'The Deeper Secrets of the Hungry Monk' in 1974. Banoffi Pie Recipe (to serve 8-10 people) 12 ounces uncooked shortcrust pastry 1.5 tins condensed milk (13.5 ounces each) 1.5 pounds firm bananas 375ml of double cream Half a teaspoon powdered instant coffee 1 dessertspoon caster sugar A little freshly ground coffee Preparation Preheat the oven to gas mark 5 (400F, ). Lightly grease a 10in x 1.5in flan tin. Line this with the pastry thinly rolled out. Prick the base all over with a fork and bake blind until crisp. Allow to cool. The secret of this delicious pudding lies in the condensed milk. Immerse the cans unopened in a deep pan of boiling water. Cover and boil for 3 hours making sure that the pan does not boil dry *(see CAUTION). Remove the tin from the water and allow to cool completely before opening. Inside you will find the soft toffee filling. Method Whip the cream with the instant coffee and sugar until thick and smooth. Now spread the toffee over the base of the flan. Peel and halve the bananas lenghtways and lay them on the toffee. Finally spoon or pipe on the cream and lightly sprinkle over the freshly ground coffee. *CAUTION It is absolutely vital to top up the pan of boiling water frequently during the cooking of the cans. 3 hours is a long time and if they are allowed to boil dry the cans will explode causing a grave risk to life, limb and kitchen ceilings.",

She is a 100% house cat and has been for all of her nine years. Some critter, probably another cat, came to our window and Agnes pushed out the screen and took off after it.

I've known, of course, about your profession, but to hear you discuss treatments and technical stuff sheds a whole new light on you as a person beyond the cancer. Sue, David is handsome and Zippy is adorable. (that is Zippy, isn't it?) Kudos on the visit from the execs, but 14 hour days? You gotta stop that girl!!! You'll not only lose the weight you've gained, you'll dry up and blow away! You'll have the face of a hedgehog. Did you succumb to that cake? Now I want one. You're trouble for sure. You deserve a bit of cake, Sue. You're a FREE WOMAN! Oh, Shirlann, I can just picture you wearing out your mouth. I'd figured you for a talker. It would be fun to chat sometime sitting somewhere comfy into the wee hours. My idea of fun. Hope the computer problem gets resolved. We need you around here. AE, where have you been? I've missed you. Your patio looks like so much fun. You are the creative one. I'm jealous. Lisa, it sounds like Danni is having a dream vacation, but I hope she comes home. I can't imagine having my daughter living so far away. Okay. So we have to let go sometime. It's ok. Keep up the email updates. Love it. I hope your energy returns soon. The pics are great. I know you must get sick of hearing the same old same old all the time, but I can't help it...you and your girls are drop-dead gorgeous. On top of that, very good people. Mel, you did it! Wow. Now it's waiting. We sure know all about that, don't we. Hmmm...which is harder-waiting for a path report or wating to hear from Oprah???? Wow, Karen, that was an intense interview. Have you told us what the study is? I can't remember. It sounds like a good one. Jane, it sounds like your mother is doing what mine did. It was such a blessing that she lived in happy times of the past. Many others in the Alzheimer's unit seemed frightened, confused, angry. Mom was just mom, living her own life. As I said, we were also blessed that for some strange reason, she never lost that part of her brain that named her family. I hope you get a little of that blessing as well. Thanks for the Libby story Jule. It was just what I needed right now. Can't wait to see pictures. It would be cool to see the rose, too. Spring is here. New life blooms. It's all good. Hugs to everyone, Judie",

It is, in fact, called \"Pill Hill\" instead of the proper \"First Hill\". This means I have a wide selection of restaurants to choose visit from 7am to 5pm M-F with a few on Saturday. Office hours. Evenings and weekends there is a greasy spoon that's semi-adequate and McDonalds. Today I was walking to an appointment and noticed a new restaurant. INDIAN!!!! I've been missing soooo much the good Indian food we had at my old place. And they are open 7 days until 9pm. I'm in heaven. Had lunch and it was excellent...sigh....

Jule, by all means ask about the colonoscopy. Docs tend not to think of these things. Thanks for your concern. You may hear from me. Yesterday my son and grandson visited for pizza and an engineering session. Needless to say, my mood has been uplifted dramatically. Kids (of all ages) are good medicine.

Very few people have air conditioning here because it is only useful for a week or so per year and usually not actually necessary. Humidity is 50% and climbing at the moment and it is 92 in my apartment on the 8th floor with lots of big windows. I leave windows wide open when it is cooler outside than in, then close windows and blinds when the sun hits. I am sitting at the computer in the nearly altogether with a wet washcloth on my head that is one of several I rotate between my head and the refrigerater. A large fan is blowing directly on me. It's tolerable until I have to go into another room. The news is letting people know where they can go if it is making them ill...libraries, grocery stores, malls. It's serious. Funny tale from my haircut yesterday. I go to a little barbershop around the corner that has one barber, one chair, owned by that barber, a Vietnamese woman with gifted hands and a strong work ethic. She is open 7 days a week. I live on \"Pill Hill\" where all the Seattle metropolitan hospitals are within blocks of each other. My cancer care center is two blocks from where I live. So anyway, I go in for a haircut (no appointments, just wait your turn) and there is a woman in the chair getting her head shaved while her husband waits in a chair. Lan (the barber) carefully shaved her head, and when finished advised her to go home and throw everything away. \"No matter if it good or bad, even if it new it no good now. Throw all in garbage!) The woman didn't say anything, but as she decided whether to put on a scarf or hat and mentioned how good it will be not to have handfuls falling out, it was clear that she was a chemo patient. I think Lan thought she was shaving her head because of lice!!! So funny. Because of the heat, I then got the shortest haircut I think I've ever had. It didn't help. It will grow out. I'm seriously considering cancelling surgery. It's not an overnight stay, and the predictions are that it will cool a little, but still be hot. It's an elective procedure. I need to decide today.  Glad things are a little cooler for you, Helen. Linda, you've had it rough, too. So much rain, now heat and humidity. Cuppa global warming effects anyone? You want that hot or with ice? I can give you either, but you'll want lots of sugar either way. Gotta get nose back to my eBay grindstone. I'm trying to get some of my son's audiophile equipment, music, and collections sold. I have done very little of this before, so it's slow going and not much fun.",

Today's disappointment is a prelude to finding the house you are meant to have. I'm so good at platitudes, yes? But this one comes from the heart. It will happen. Ulla, your words touched my heart. You miss the Ulla before bootface. We all miss so much the life before that nasty villain interrupted it. There is no going back. There is a new, stronger Ulla who has lost her innocence and survived. You are now in a new place and it will take time to adjust, but know that you are very, very much Ulla...loved, strong, intelligent, motivated, beautiful, loving, kind...and you have given us more than you can ever know. Your words about home hit me right between the eyes. Thank you. It sounds like you are in a quiet, reflective, sad time. This is so very normal. Drift on through it as you can. Jane, I had trouble reading your post through tears welling up. They made me feel more whole and hopeful than I have in a long time. The picture you paint is exactly my ideal, and it can't happen in the suburbs, now, can it??? Bless you. Dearest Mel, your concept of life is one I do not share fully, but expresses so much of the goodness of life and connection of us all. I fully agree that as long as Valerie is remembered, she lives. She will be with us for many years. Your \"blunt\" assessment of my current situation was a breath of fresh air. I think too much. Sometimes one must just go for it and you shoved me right up front. Thanks. Wren, you read my gut instincts correctly, but the part about being with the over 55 crowd is one of the things I dislike about the plan. I just don't fit in. I'm only forty-something, I think. (I wish) I really like hanging out with all ages. Sandy, thank you for the story. I feel so old (65 last month) that it seems too late to do anything. Your give me inspiration. Up and at 'em!!! So, it seems that I was not balanced in my reporting. My leaning toward independence came through loud and clear. I really appreciate being tipped in the direction of taking a chance. My youngest son (19) is coming to help me begin the process tomorrow. We'll just go to the apartment and start cleaning and just experience being there. Lots and lots to do. The actual move will be over the July 4th weekend. Off we go!!! I love you all so much, Judie",

That's all I can remember tonight...I'm too wiped to read everything just now. It's nice to have kids who love to cook gourmet meals. Just got back from granddaughter's 22nd birthday dinner. She requested filet mignon. My daughter cooked it with a shallot mustard wine/port reduction sauce, candied carrots with cumin, sauteed asparagus, red potato chunks roasted with herbs and fresh garlic, sauteed mushrooms...it was pure heaven.

A good one will prevent these things and is worth its weight in gold. I use Nod32 from Eset. They do an excellent online scan, but would probably end with an ad to buy the product. It's $40 per year, and well worth it. I have never gotten a single malware, trojan, or virus since installing it four years ago. Its major problem is that it's not terribly user friendly. Their online scan removes anything it finds on your computer. It's probably your best bet to get rid of the trojan right away. Other online scans only detect but do not remove them.   http://www.eset.com/onlinescan/ Also good is AVG. They have a free version that is very good for the home computer. I used it until I purchased Nod32 free.avg.com/  The third highly regarded software is Kaspersky. Often rated the best, but pricey...$80 for one year.

There are two absolutes in operating a computer. (Fumi, there may be more. I'm not the expert that you are, so please add if you like) 1. Back up your documents and images regularly. Again and again you run across someone who has lost years of work and irreplacable history when a drive crashes or a computer is stolen. Drives are becoming cheap. Use an external drive or tape backup and store it away from your computer. 2. Install a good antivirus program and keep it updated. Why I prefer Nod32 is that it regularly catches virus/spyware/malware BEFORE it is even installed. It prevents the need to remove anything. It's not 100%, of course, but close. And the price is reasonable. I don't know anything about One Care, so can't comment. Also, Nod32 is very small and uses minimal resources on your computer. End of sales pitch. More important than the particular software is that you keep it current and use it. I know, it's easy to forget. Good intentions and all...kind of like flossing. But there is so much to lose, and so much frustration and fear to be had if you ignore these rules. In love and caring for each of you, Judie ",

Religious thoughts and expressions are accepted by non-believers as sincere expressions of love and hope rather than keep your religion out of my face. Politics is gentle and kind around here.

I used a Photoshop filter on the picture to melt it down. I wish I knew Photoshop better. I couldn't quite figure out how to do what I envisioned. Cathi, my mother made it clear to all of her children that she was not a babysitter. She was a grandma with all the rights and privileges thereto. She took them individually to her house when she wanted, gave them one-on-one grandma time, spoilted them rotten, then sent them home.She was the best grandma that ever lived! I have done the same. though didn't have the freedom to have them very often. Connor is the first grandchild I've actually done babysitting for, but it was an extaordinary circumstance. Hold the line, Cathi...you can do it! Lisa, I find it a bit scary, but hope all goes well with Wayne. I'll be thinking of you. Sheila, for some reason a Basset hound is just the dog I would imagine you having. I just love them. Oh, Jane, do I know what you are going through. Don't you sometimes long for the days when parents chose a mate for their children? There might not be sparks, but they would probably be able to co-exist under the same roof. Thanks, Shirlann. I know you have lost, too, and understand. I'm tickled that you found Dr. Wong and feel better. Today I had my \"annual\" exam. Actually, it's only every three years now. My primary care doctor is far more than my physician. We go way back to her days as a resident when I was the charge nurse teaching her the practical side of deliveriing babies. So, for most of the time we chat. Some ot the time she actually does the exam. When it comes to the breast exam part, she says, \"I guess I don't need to do breasts, but I will feel your axillae.\" Then she pauses with a quizzical look and says, \"Do you mind it I feel your breasts?\" I crack up. I give permission, she feels them and pronounces them to have a natural feel. We then crack up together. She's such a character! Anyway, I passed my physical with flying colors, had a nice visit, and a 2.5 mile walk. A good day. ",

I called a halt to the sale. I've done enough. My goal was to get some of my son's music collection into the hands of his friends on the quadraphonic board where it will have meaning and bring memories to them. It's been a huge job. I wouldn't have done it for any other reason. Those people have been family to me through the past year. Really great folks. I sold about half the discs I had here, which is about 3% of the total collection. It's massive. The \"fun\" part of the project is that he did conversions of quadraphonic records to CD or DVD-A discs, preserving the quadraphonic channels to play on a DTS or Dolby 5.1 system. They're remarkable. He had copies of all of them on spindles, a total of about 1,000 discs. I am cataloging and organizing them and will offer them to family members. The range of music is astounding. I will end up with a lovely music collection. I even have a Pink Floyd \"The Wall\" poster hanging on my living room wall. It's a large poster, framed, that was in the media room. It's weird, but I love it. Sigh...sorry to ramble. I needed to do that tonight. Cathi, I'm so glad that everyone is getting better. I'm constantly sending healing energy your way. Nancy, I know what you mean about needing to vent. Life would be so much simpler if you and I were in charge, eh? lol Karen, I hope Portia's mouth continues to heal without problems. It's a big deal! When is moving day? Or did I miss it? I'm kind of scattered. Barbe, there are no mistaken opinions when it comes to medical things and strange relatives...  We all speak from our own experience. It is sad to me that someone chooses to live that way, but it is a choice. How is your health doing? I do worry about you and your husband. You are a strong woman. I'm with you on the humidity. And the summer heat combined with the Aromasin is nearly unbearable. I'm sticking with Spring!!! Jane, what a wonderful son you have. You must be very proud, but wish he'd do his good deeds a little closer to home! My baby boy is now wandering about Liverpool, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland with a backpack and sleeping bag...no tent. It's great to see them become independent adults, but.... Hugs to all, especially little Ella-bug, Judie",

The story is too long and boring for this place, but I'll try for the highlights. My son who died last December at age 45 had a passion. It was music. He was a true audiophile. His new dream house included a state-of-the-art media room for his equipment and huge music collection, including thousands of vinyl records. He was a collector and especially loved quadrophonic records played on equipment using vacuum tubes producing analog music rather than digital. Those of us left behind don't understand the equipment and wouldn't truly appreciate it. Today a fellow audiophile and member of an internet board they were both very active on, drove five hours to help us identify and evaluate equipment and music. We made some decisions about how to sell it. I will be doing much of it on eBay, which felt utterly overwhelming to me, but I'm the only one who knows how and has time. It will take a couple of years, at least. By the time I left I felt like I had performed open-heart surgery on myself with no anesthesia. But after I got home, I looked at the items I had brought with me to begin selling...music mostly...records and high-end music DVDs. I played a couple of them and even I, with my cheap equipment, could appreciate thier specialness and quality. Soon it felt like I had brought a fragment of his spirit, his soul into my home. I feel like I know and understand him a little more. Its an example of how sometimes unimaginable pain can slip moments of unexpected beauty into the wounds and make one realize that all is not lost after all. Everyone here has suffered extreme loss because of bootface, as well as various other crises large and small. This place is one of those bits of surprising beauty that remind us of the good people of this world and the beauty that attends us when we need it. I love each of you. Thank you for being there for each other.   Judie",

Lisa, it was incredibly hard to do at the time, but my children have thanked me over and over for never saying anything negative about their father or his family over the years and encouraging them to have a relationship with them. Loving and supporting him has absolutely nothing to do with me. It's not a competition. People need to have some kind of positive spin on their biological creators in order to have a positive feeling about who they are. That's just my take on it, of course. They have never achieved a close relationship with their dad, but still include him whenever he is willing. My role was to step aside. A very, very challenging role at times. Yes, I was internally upset when they gave him credit he wasn't due or he tried to put me down and weaken my relationship with them. But the goal is to have healthy children who can observe the truth. Force-fed, even the truth is hard to swallow and lies become a more attractive meal. Let it bloom on its own, in its own time. All this meandering thinking I'm doing here can be distilled very simply...let go, love, trust, accept. Oh, Mel!!! It sounds like a nightmare. I wish I could sit with you. Sometimes that's all one can do. My heart is doing that across the miles. You are so special. What a wonderful gift your son is. You deserve to have that. Bless you!

It can never be the same again. No one wanted to plan or attend anything. My youngest son, home from college, committed to being with me. We were going to have a plate of food delivered by the church across the street and just hang out. Then today one of his college friends who lives in Seattle invited us to join her family. How sweet! Then one of my daughters sent a message that she and her husband were cooking dinner and anyone who felt like it should come. Low key, just hanging out with people who love each other. So I guess we are reluctantly \"doing\" Thanksgiving, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it will be okay. Things do work out. ",

Ladies on the other side of the pond, I have a question. I talked with my son on Skype this morning. He's already seen a play (Cat On A Hot Tin Roof) and is settling into the flat. He is disappointed that all his flatmates are International students rather than locals, but when school starts he hopes to find some friends. He badly needs a couple of pillows and is certain there is no place nearby to find them. He insists there are only specialty shops in London and he's not quite sure where to look. He is in the Bloomsbury area and within a very reasonable walk to Kings Cross Station and the British Museum. He has found three grocery stores, but what about bedding, school supplies, and other things? Any advice?",

Years ago I had a similar experience. Our cat disappeared and was gone for days, perhaps it was a week or so. I was a registered nurse and was at work when I heard a STAT page over the hospital system. I was terrified. I called the desk and was connected with my daughter who was about 10 years of age. She was hysterical. Dabs (the cat) had appeared on the back steps, badly cut up and near death. I rushed home and took her to the vet. One leg was split open with muscle hanging out. It looked hopeless. As they cleaned her up, more and more cuts were found. The vet said this type of damage occurrs when a cat climbs up into the engine compartment of a car or truck recently driven and still warm. They fall asleep and don't awaken in time to escape when someone gets in the car and starts it up. The fan catches the poor napping feline. They rarely survive. But, of course, our Dabs was tough. She survived, but they told us her leg would never be right. Hah! Within a month she was jumping to the top of the bookcase where she was fed (to protect her food from the resident dog) as if nothing had happened. She ended up living a long and healthy life. As to advice, I can't help specifically, but I do think you should ask your onc if there is anything more you can do. He may indeed advise steroids. Don't suffer more that you must!

Mei has pneumonia and looks horrible. Her fever broke partially today, so she thinks she'll be well enough to travel by Friday. I told her she's nuts. Well, in kinder words than that....

They are staying with me the entire two weeks, which was a bit of a shock, but it does mean lots of Connor time, so I'll deal with it. Instant presto-chango from lonely hermit to overactive hostess. Whew!!! I had my first post-op appointment today, and first looks at the results. I had been very reluctant to go through with it, thinking I could live with things the way they were. I am now thrilled with my decision. My dog ears and a major scar problem are gone! Just a smooth, even line on each side and so far the boobs look good. It takes time for them to settle in, but so far look great. My daughter misunderstood what the surgeon said...I went from 400cc to 600ccs. I guess I have good skin. And to top off the good news, as I came out of the PS's office, there was this cute young thing hanging out by the elevator, who approached me and asked if I posted on BC.org and might perchance be Towhee. It was our Wren!!!! I must say she looks great with stunning \"girls\" (at least in clothing). I had another appointment or we would have visited longer, but she'll be back in a month and we'll plan something. Made my day!",

I hope it doesn't go that far. Hi Jane! What's new in Oz? I am living in the chaos of adding two people to my tiny space, trying to recuperate from surgery, and enjoy this precious time. It looks like they will stay until June 4! Connor is still jet-lagged and wanting to have his active play time at 2am. I hope that settles down soon.

I'll send a photo as soon as I can. It's so good to have him back. My little Guinness puppy was ripped from my arms by the breeder. My granddaughter had a 10-week-old puppy from her, also on approval. She emailed the breeder that we wanted to purchase both puppies, and asked if there was a discount when you  buy more than one. The breeder went ballistic and demanded that both pups be retured within 6 hours. Asking about a discount makes it clear that money is more important to you than the animal and you are not a good home for her dogs. We are both stunned and heartbroken. I just returned from a bone scan and have a CAT scan in a couple of hours. I'll get results next Monday. I'm confident that they're OK. They saw some enlarged lymph nodes on an MRI of my shoulder when I was having pain there, and the scans are to diagnose them. But the MRI was just after I'd gotten a mild infection in the tissue around my right implant...I'm sure that's the cause of the nodes. But with our history, we get the full monty. I spent the weekent at Lake Chelan with my nurses' group...pure heaven...mystical, peaceful, connected. We've been having a weekend reunion for 31 years now. A great group.",

The adolescent center one is from two of my nephews, both MSW and have worked with at-risk youth in several capacities since they were in their 20s. I think it is a good program.

The sleepover with my daughters was great fun, even though I was babbling on, repeating myself. I told them it's a preview of what they're in for when I get old...lol. I had baked a pumkin cheesecake the night before and threw stuff in the crockpot for oxtail barley soup before I went to the hospital. Jill brought a wonderful bottle of organic wine, and I added a loaf of rosemary herb artisan bread. It was a supper to die for. The cheesecake was the best I've ever made, This morning, I dutifully had my quinoa and totally forgot about breakfast for them. Heidi, with a guilty look, asked if anyone would like cheesecake for breakfast. The response was a resounding \"yes\"...it made a fab breakfast for them and post-breakfast treat for me. oh, geez...I see I'm still repeating myself. I hope this isn't permanent!!!",

I don't want to lose another body part but, like my breast, this one is trying to kill me. I don't know whether to rant or hide my shaking self under the rug. It will be okay. No worries. I'm tough. I'm a @#$% liar too. Anyone want a supposedly adorable Mini Schnauzer???? Mr. Jasper has reverted to pooping on my Chinese rug.

I would love some smiles right now. Please?",

Not such good news. Your high fiber diet has probably been beneficial in delaying problems. As you probably found on the net there is total chaos as to opinion on diet and diverticular disease. Don't eat nuts, seeds, popcorn. Nuts, seeds, and popcorn help prevent diverticular disease. High fiber. Low residue, low fiber. You can choose any weird diet you like and it will fit somewhere as the ideal diet or the worst diet for diverticulitis. It looks like the only consensus is that removing that portion of colon is the only thing that works. I'll bet it would help the IBS, too. My episodes of diverticulitis feel just like bad menstrual cramps...the dull ache in the pelvis and cramping just above the pubic bone. But when they press on my belly, it hurts more on the left side. After a few days, the fever starts and goes to 103 (39.4). I'm so sad about Wee Amy. Has she been diagnosed with a \"syndrome\" or are her problems unique? It breaks my heart when a sweet baby is so longed for and ends up with so many challenges. But then I guess her specialness needs exceptional parents. Hugs all 'round, especially to Auntie Nets! I hope you are able to enjoy the time with Lilly Rose and have lots of energy. Love hearing about Whisper the miracle cat. I think one reason Devin enjoys you so much is your shared taste in music. His travels on the continent have been very, very difficult, but not enough to bring him home. Spain brought him very close to giving it up. But he has come to realize that rest and seeing what is important trumps meeting a tight schedule to \"collect\" places on his list. I haven't heard for a couple of days, but his plan was for Vatican Friday, Ancient Rome today, Pompeii Sunday, meeting a friend and staying with her until Thursday, then going together to Venice. Love your comment \"I have now decided that I am going to be there for my family and friends, not strong for them.\" Here here!!! Jane, bless you my dear friend. The vision of you doing \"blind contour\" and one of you in a sunny room sketching a model brought such a feeling of peace and inspiration. Thank you so much. These moments bring me back to a beautiful place that is life. Barbe, your words echo those of the surgeon. I knew it but didn't want it to be true. I've decided to forge ahead and focus on improved health on the other side of this hurdle.",

Your attitude is strong and positive no matter what. I know there is a job out there for you that is just right. Until then, enjoy your new computer and do some quilting! Nancy, I'm sorry you didn't get chosen, but you, too, inspire me with your attitude. Good luck on the house hunting! Leesa, my heart is with you and the others who are grieving. What a painful experience. Sending tons of hugs to everyone involved. Lisa, it is heartwarming to read your ongoing love story. I'm sure there have been a few bumps in the road, but you both seem to have your eye on the future and don't let them throw you. Blessings. Barbe, how exciting to be inundated with babies! You remain an inspiration and source of strength wherever you go. Cathi, I know how hard things are for you. You are one tough cookie, but just how much does it take to make the cookie crumble? I pray that things ease up far before that point. Until then, you have my shoulder anytime you need it. Big hugs to the whole gang! Wren, glad your surgery is in the past and hope things get better soon! Well, I'm well and truly out of gas. Boring words, I'm afraid, but just had to let everyone know I'm here and love you so much.

Even if the parents had made amazing progress and were ready to take over, it would still hurt like crazy to let go. One suggestion FWIW: You can enhance the possibility of improved parenting by letting go of criticism and finding opportunities to reinforce what they do right. If you are an ally, you will have a stronger position in the little one's lives. I know...mission impossible...so hard. Mainly, take the opportunity to take better care of Cathi. She's very, very important and need to be in top form! Sheila, I hope more antibiotics will do the trick. Sinus infections are the pits. I'm in a full-blown pity party today, though getting better. Had sudden onset of sharp pain in my hip Saturday morning on arising. Treated it with ibuprofen with poor results...ended up taking a Vicodin, but hate the dizzy feeling. Went to doctor (partner in the practice...my doc had an overfilled schedule already). He sent me for an x-ray. Called this morning...negative result, so wants me to see and orthopedic surgeon. ??? Oh, well. Called for appointment. Can be seen by the PA in two weeks. Excuse me!!! I am responsible for a toddler and can't walk!!! Forget it. If it goes away I'm good. If it continues, I'll hit the ER. Crap! On top of that, Connor is sick. You know what that's like...and my friend in the building who trades lots of favors with me left for Mexico yesterday and I'm taking care of her plants and picking up mail. My poor dog isn't getting out to potty very often. There. That's the full monty... The doctor had prescribed Mobic for the pain. I can only take for 3 to 5 days because I am diabetic and it's hard on the kidneys. But it seems to be working this evening. I'm getting everything possible done in case it stops working. But I am nearly pain-free at the moment and savoring it. Hopefully, it's going to resolve on its own.",

There is an off-leash dog area, and Connor went nuts. The kid has no fear. His favorites were the biggies...German Shepherd, Goldens, Irish Wolfhound, Border Collie. There was a wonderful Visla/Border Collie mix...extremely well-trained and so cute! No dreams for me, but I keep going through periods of acutely missing my breasts and despising the stiff chest. I use a vitamin E lotion and massage it daily to keep the tissue supple, but it still has a feeling of stiffness from the inside. And I'm tired of wearing prostheses. I've been just going around flat. Well, not flat...a little concave with a nice round belly below. Tweedledee. I'm in a \"screw you\" mood and don't care how I look. Is this depression or standing up for myself? I don't know. I just hate this whole thing. End of whine. My path has been so much easier than many of yours. Life is actually good. It's a gorgeous, sunny, shirtsleeve day. The park was spectacular. I miss my dogs terribly, and petting all the dogs at the park was good medicine. (Jule, I'm soooooo jealous!) I'm making steady progress on my project of scanning old family photos onto my computer. Grandson is adorable, pain is under control...it's all good, eh?

It is so refreshing to read the honesty in your posts...no attempt to sugar-coat or feel obligated to reassure us that you are okay. You're not okay! None of us was anywhere near okay while we were wating for surgery.  For our part, reassuring and supporting you through this nightmare reminds us how far we have come and how much strength we have managed to rally in ourselves.

Speaking of pictures, you are so much fun, Mel. Are you possibly our Yellow Brick Cheerleader? Thanks for the warm welcome AE. I hope I can keep up with this dynamic group! Here's hoping UB's pain settles down very soon. What a life you two have! Hey, Karen, I can relate to grandparent burnout. You could always bring your ...ahem...active...son and I'd bring my grandson. On second thought, let's wait. I wouldn't want you to get too weak to go to those treatments! It would be fun to meet you whenever it is possible. I feel guilty \"only\" having surgery and skipping radiation and chemo. My hat is off you you guys who are doing the whole nine yards. Jane, don't give up on the grandbabies. My eldest son is the papa of my youngest grandson! He was 44 when Connor came along. It took him a long, long time to decide he would make a good daddy. Hey, Sue! I know you are feeling low in the energy department and have been to hell and back, but you manage to brighten the room when you walk in. Keep it up! I've gotta make that pie I read about when trying to catch up. You are dangerous, girl! GB, I'm jealous of your Blue Mountain adventure. It will be fun to go along with you over time. Wow, Nancy, what a dad! He sounds adventurous. Somehow I think he would also be a lot of fun. Is that a good guess? Ah, Shirl, thanks...I've missed you. Your comment about reading all the messages and not being able to remember a thing cracked me up...join the club!!! I'm glad Ulla's ok...what a struggle she has. It may be a big country, but it seems that Nordie's is everywhere now. It's kinda sad, actually. It was our local pride and joy, too good to go mainstream, but like Starbuck's, we've lost our edge. Nothing's local any more and I just hate it!!! It's been a tough day here. Each day I've been feeling a bit more down and can't figure out why. I went for a walk tonight to clear my head, and it hit me that in a few days it will be the anniversary of the first of the events that ultimately unraveled life as I had known it...the death of my partner's mom, who had been a very large part of our lives. I miss her. Her death was the beginning of the end for our family. So now I know why I'm down, and it's perfectly normal, and I will get through it. Whew!!! (All the pain and constant hot flashes are another story altogether...those I'm not so sure about ) With that, it's into bed with high hopes for some sleep...that wonderful, elusive state of restful oblivion...

All these bootface meds make our bodies and minds twist and shout, but in the end we will know it was just a strange victory dance. So, everyone who is tired, hurting, waiting, scared....let's dance!  Any fun Easter plans, anyone? Today I'm coloring eggs with the grandson and baking hot cross buns. Tomorrow we are having guests for dinner. Our menu is a bit odd...a combination of Chinese and American. Cumin lamb, Szechuan green beans, scalloped potatoes, peach cobbler with ice cream. It should be good, though. My Chinese DIL is a good cook, though she doesn't like to do anything fancy and never uses a recipe. Her beans have become famous in my family. Cheers dear sisters!

Most of that old devil anxiety will be shoved into a jar with bootface. Sue, clear lymph nodes trump grade 3 every time.  Clear nodes, grade 3 = probably no spread. A few positive nodes, grade 2 = possible cancer cells in other organs. Yes, grade 3 is more aggressive and that is why it grew fast. But it likely was growing fast in the breast instead of exploring elsewhere. Close to the chest wall means maybe radiation, but the oncologist will have full information and can guide you there. Size and grade...borderline for chemo. At your age, I think I'd go for it, but again, your onc will know a lot more and will give you all your choices. At any rate, your ducks are now in a row, ready to be hunted. Congratulations! And in 6 weeks, the pain will be history, too. Towhee ",

This board is different than most and I was confused at first. I actually like it better because you can make the picture bigger or smaller after you put it in your message.   On Photobucket, you have a number of choices of links to copy. For this board, copy the one labeled \"Direct Link\", come back here, click on the little tree thingie, paste, then click \"insert\".  I don't know how other hosting services work, but to enter a picture here you have to use the basic URL without the [IMG] tags or any other special formatting.

Then I closed my email program to get it out of the way...or thought I did...the red x belonged to my browser...my wisdom lost forever...I removed myself from the computer before the temptation to crush it became too great. That was four hours ago. I have now calmed down, but this post will not be the masterpiece the other one would have been. I'm useless for rads questions, but don't think you have harmed anything...forget the paranoia.  I am wondering if the back pain is related to how they position you on the table. Just a thought. Mel, as always, you are a ray of sunshine. Spring may be here, or may not. I can't tell with the nutty weather we are having. A run to the arboretum is in order. I love going there in early spring. It's a huge park with little rolling hills planted with every kind of fuschia and rhododendran imaginable. Some of the rhodies are huge. It's truly a fairyland. There's also a small Japanese tea garden. I wish I had some free time to go. Maybe next week I'll be able to drum up enough energy to take Connor if we have decent weather. My son didn't want children, either. I was sad because he is so good with them. His main reason was that he didn't have the patience to deal with little ones all day every day. That was true. He was a wonderful uncle, but after a while with a kid it was easy for his irritablity/anger to be triggered. He finally matured, developed patience, and became a dad...in that order. Would that more people had that kind of insight. So don't give up yet, my dear. I hope the quiet means that everyone is having too much weekend fun to even think about bootface! Judie Oh, Hi Nancy! I was writing my post at the same time as you, but you got there first! I'm tickled about your wig. Are there pics in the offing? I'm a sucker for redheads of all shades. Three of my kids are auburn, another is a strawberry blonde. Then there's the odd one...light brown, not a hint of red. But I love her anyway. BTW, there's no red in my hair, either. Don't know why I became enchanted by it. Just weird, I guess.",

This is one head-in-the-sand, ignore-it-and-it will-go-away kind of woman speaking here! Who me? No way!!! Frankly, my dear, even after surgery and doing reading and research and having tests and talking about it, deep down inside I still don't believe it. It just can't be. So go ahead. Be mad. Be furious.  Be scared.  And while you are in that state, go on autopilot for a while and just do what you have to do. You know what that is. Believe me, Sue, you are in the absolutely worst part of the whole thing...waiting for surgery. I thought I'd go totally crazy. Well, I was totally crazy. Remember, the only thing you absolutely must do at this moment is take another breath. If one day at a time is too much, take it one breath at a time. No one can do this for you, or make it go away. You are in control of what you do to give yourself the best chance at finishing raising those boys and looking forward to spoiling your future grandchildren.

You and I may not the type to jump up and shout that we will beat this thing no matter what it takes, but we can do what needs to be done, get it over with, and get on with life.  You've gotten some wonderful advice and support here.
