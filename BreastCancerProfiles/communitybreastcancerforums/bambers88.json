At this point I'm only now beginning to feel some of the long term damaging effects, memory - arthritis, you know.. So as of late there has been a noticeable change in my vision. Very very noticeable. Long story short, I just got home from the eye doctor and believe it or not, my vision has improved so dramatically he cut my prescription in half.. I couldn't see because the power was too strong!!! OMG!! It absolutely HAS to be from the chemo.. My rx has not changed in 20 years... I am completely stunned!

We (my rad onc and myself) have had many discussions, during which not one did he ask and/or explain to me any risks involved with radiation. He failed to mention to me anything about the damage to your lung - long term heart disease - risks of smoking - yadda yadda yadda. So I bring these things up to him (shouldn't it be the other way around?), and I get the master sales pitch of how insignificant these risks are in comparison to the benefits of it. I must have IDIOT tatted on my forehead.  He is very aware that while I have dramatically cut down on my smoking, I still smoke, however much (my limit is down to 5/day now, working on it), I STILL SMOKE. Call me weak, call me idiot (after all it is tatted on my head), call me late for dinner, whatever -  the fact remains and I admit it. Granted he is waaaaay smarter than me, but it's not rocket science, smoking causes lung cancer - factor in the part of lung that is hit by the radiation and your chances are now as good as gold.   Perhaps it's just my f*#%ed up way of thinking, but shouldn't this be addressed BEFORE one commences treatment?? I mean, if I haven't been able to kick the habit come crunch time then what, that's YOUR  problem not OURS, we're doing it anyway? Now THAT'S what I call job security.  So now, given the circumstances, I feel backed against the wall, which makes me even more PISSED OFF, which makes me want to smoke even more, not quit... I wonder just exactly how much concern they have for my health or just exactly how much concern they have for making their car payment. Tomorrow is treatment number 3. I'm not exactly confident with doing rads in the first place even if I didn't smoke. Correct me if I am wrong, but radiation causes cancer too! Mention that and the master sales man kicks in high gear again telling me how safe it is nowadays, blah blah blah. Ok then Mr. Rad Onc. You can stand here and hold my hand while I'm getting the next 33 treatments if it is so safe nowadays. And explain why you are hiding behind that 3ft thick iron door, with the DANGER RADIATION signs posted all over the parking lot.   I'm bald, I'm pissed, it's my life and I'm pulling the plug until I'm a genuine quitter.
