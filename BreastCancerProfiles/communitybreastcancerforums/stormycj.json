I will tell my family if I am diagnosed with bc, but I don't want to worry anyone. I hate being scared that Im going to find out Ive had bc for years and never realized it. I dont want to put anyone else through that. 44andscared, our stories are very similar! I pray both of our results are benign. Keep me posted!",

      "Content": "stormycj wrote: I am new to this forum, but so far I have found comfort and answers to a lot of my questions.  About four months ago I started to feel what I thought was muscle soreness in my armpit.  I am in the military and we're always doing pushups so I chalked it up to something good, building more muscle.  After a couple of months I realized that it never really went away.  I backed off of the pushups and I still had this dull achy feeling.  On Friday I felt around that area and found a hard oval lump in my right breast, really close to my armpit.  I never really felt there when doing my self-exams.  I went to the doctor yesterday and he said it is 1 1/2 cm long by 1 cm wide, hard but moveable.  I have a mammo scheduled for 2 weeks from now.  They said the radiologist will do the mammo and will decide on the ultrasound based on what he sees.  The hardest part about all of this is that I don't really have anyone to talk to about this except my husband - which is hard because his mother died from cancer.  I don't want to worry my mother because I don't know anything yet and her mother died from Lymphoma.  I feel really alone, but this community has helped me realize that I am not alone.   Thank you so much!

So far the doctor was great, explained everything, and told me what steps I needed to take. I actually was offered an earlier appointment, but I already had a trip planned so I pushed it out until the 14th. I am going to a military medical facility here in Germany. We recently had a guy diagnosed with testicular cancer and he seemed to get pretty good care there. But I guess we'll see what happens. I will let you know!",

It sounds like you are dealing with it rather well.  Don't worry about what your family says about your decision to have the double mastectomy, you have to do what you feel is right for you.  Good luck on your journey!",
