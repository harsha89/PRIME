      "Content": "lovex5 wrote: Good evening!  I have been lurking on yall's discussion board for a while now and wanted to get some input from you all.  Late October I developed nipple change on my left breast.  Just out of the blue one day it was sore and itchy and the skin was flaking off some.  I didn't think much of it because at times I have had the skin peel from both nipples without any discomfort.  So I chalked this up to dry skin and/or a new bra.  Anyway after a couple days I became concerned and looked online.  Of course all the info on Paget's came up and I began to research.  I read about discharge in your bra.  That night when I put on my sleep bra that I had worn the night before I noticed a few spots!  At this point I was no longer having pain or itch but was still concerned.  The areola seemed raw/weepy.  I began treating my nipple with cortisone cream and after about 4 days it cleared up.  That was two weeks ago.  Everything was fine until it started itching this morning.  Sure enough it looks red around the nipple again.  Seems to be the same thing as before.  A little background info on me.  I have a rare genetic disease called Tuberous Sclerosis Complex which has caused benign renal tumors and kidney disease.  I have had one kidney removed in 2010 and am in Stage 3 ckd currently.  I will begin treatment with Afinitor in a few months to hopefully shrink my tumors.  I also have dyshydrotic eczema on my hands.  I am hopeful that perhaps this is eczema but I've read eczema is usually on both breasts.  My husband is in the military and our insurance isn't all that great.  The facility where I receive medical care is, how should I put this--not too fond of spending money.  They do as little as possible and go to great lengths to avoid costly tests and such.  Should I go ahead and get the ball rolling on a visit to my pcm for referrals or would it be ok to wait and see if it goes away again?  Kind of ironic to be worried about such a rare form of cancer when I already have a condition that only affects 1 in 5,000 people!  Thanks for letting me share what is going on!  Any advice, words of support would be appreciated!  Log in to post a reply",

Today my right breast began to itch so I took a look...low and behold now the other nipple has done the same thing! Small portion of the top has peeled (not sure how to explain) and has clear fluid. Sorry if tmi. I'm not sure if i should be relieved or more worried now.",
