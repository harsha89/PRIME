Did you experience this and if so does it get better quickly. I have noticed it more the last 2 days since the feeling is coming back. I had immediate expander implants also which may add to the swelling. My PS said everything looks good as of yesterday Thanks Rio",

I also get the you look great comments (from well intentioned people) but if only they knew how you really feel. I continue to say I feel ok and try to change the subject. Take Care Rio",

It feels great to be rid of the rocks but I quess I thought I would feel better about all of this after this last surgery. People do make comments to me about how I look related to the surgery and cancer.  I just say yes I am lucky to have caught it early and that I feel OK. I know they all mean well.  I do not feel very good and haven't since my original surgery. It has been more discomfort than pain but it still makes you feel not like yourself. It is hard for those around us to understand what we are feeling. I know I need to get used to the new me I just felt I would be more excited after this last surgery  Take care Rio",

The pain has been tolerable but I will be glad when it is gone. Once I was taken off the morphine and put on a different pain med I was able to move around better. The morphine made me feel cruddy. My path report came back with nothing in the lymph nodes but they did fined a small spot on the opposite side. My decision to do both with the ILC diagnosis was the right one. I should get the drains out Thursday. I am taking it slow and easy but overall doing well. Friends and family have been very supportive. I am a little bored doing nothing but am making myself take the time. My DH washed my hair for me yesterday. We made a make shift station at the kitchen sink. The bath stool we bought to use for sitting on to clean up works great becasue you can raise and lower to the right height. It felt terrific. Even though he was a little awkward at it he did a good job. Somewhere on these boards I read that the stool helps and it made a difference. Thanks to all of you for your ideas and how to make things go better. Going into foreign territory like this surgery is can be scary but when you have a place to go and ask questions it is helpful. I hope all of your upcoming surgeries go well  Take Care  Rio",

I do not want to let my family, friends or employees know how I feel so I am writing here to express my feelings. I find by admitting them it is somehow easier to accept. I appreciate these boards and have found them to be a great comfort to me while waiting for the day to arrive. Every once in awhile the thought of not being around to see my children grow, marry etc I am overwhelmed with grief. It does not usually last very long but it hurts while it does. I hope my pathology report comes back before the long weekend. Thank you to all of you for this site and sharing your stories. Rio Log in to post a reply",

My surgery was Wed and on Thursday I was asking myself why did I do this. By Friday I was feeling better and going home. Every day it has gotten better. I found it helpful to go to our masectomy shop in advance for a zippered sports bra and a button down cami. They also had pouches for the drain tubes. I also made sure to have some soft flannel button down shirts to wear. They have been the easiet to put on. I did find myself crying from time to time prior to surgery and have a few times since. It is hard for people around us to understand what this diaagnosis can do so one mentally. Everyone who cares about you mean well and are trying to comes to terms with it just like we do. I hope you have someone to help you when you first get home. The simplest things we do with our arms can be difficult to do right away. Because my Mom had a masectomy in July I was famaliar with the tubes and what I was in for myself. As Beth NY said if you put yourself through college you can get through this. I would guess all of us have our ups and downs as we go naviagte through this new world but the support from these boards has been a tremoundous help for me personally. Let us know how your surgery goes when you are feeling up to it. My best to you Rio",
