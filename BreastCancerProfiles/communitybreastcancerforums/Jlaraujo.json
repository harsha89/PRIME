I them moved my way through the taxane family and changed my \"T\" to Taxol and had an allergic reaction (severe rash/itching). Today I tried the \"third time's a charm\" taxane and start Abraxane. I was also doing treatment every 21 days and today we switched to weekly so I'll have to arrange my calendar as everything was revolving around \"the good week\". Changing to weekly came with another added plus which is no more Neulasta! :). Anyone else out there on ACH?

I moved to Taxol, CH and had another reaction, so I won myself some Abraxane, Carboplatin, Herceptin. I also started out on every 21 days and now I am on weekly, ACH, then CH, then CH, then ACH again, no weeks off. I am also doing 21 weeks of treatment if you include the initial two, then Herceptin only for another 8 months. Anybody else out there? Side effects haven't been too bad so far, diarrhea and nausea due to crazy stomach acid, but I think I finally have it under control.
