I was just at our local organic grocery story today and there wasn't much to be found (it's a co-op--we don't have Whole Foods). 2. Are frozen fruits and veggies ok? 3. Several folks mentioned eating wheatgrass; our store doesn't carry it. Are there any recommendations for ordering it? 4. What about dried fruit? 5. Are any of you taking supplements? I was taking a multi-vitamin and Ca++/Mag/D complex, but they're huge and hard to swallow.",

Please keep in mind several things: 1. Recovery from surgery takes a while. The anesthetic is a central nervous system depressant that stays in your body fat and can have an effect on your body for awhile. That, on top of the diagnosis, will take an emotional toll. Added to that are pain, discomfort, etc. There are many physical influences on your emotional state, so it's not all about having the right attitude. 2. You are going to have bad days and allow yourself to feel those emotions. I have been very impatient with myself regarding recover and it just causes more anxiety. 3. Take advantage of all the physical resources you can. Since you are in the UK, I took the liberty of looking up some things and found http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/index.htm, http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/, http://breakthrough.org.uk/. You may want to contact them directly and ask about resources in your area. Also, ask your oncologist about cancer resources in your area--they should be the ones to have that information. In the U.S., many communities have cancer support or cancer information centers that can provide information and services. Ask about this in your area. 4. The advice given to me when I was first diagnosed is if chemo is offered take it. It's much more manageable these days, but I have found that the treatment for side effects varies. I'm aware of a woman who got her chemo in at a rural hospital and was given no anti-nausea meds. There are multiple ways to treat the side effects and if they don't offer them, ask! 5. Another piece of advice I was given was to \"ask for what you want\". If you're not happy with what your care team is doing, ask for other options/team members. At some level you have to go with your gut instinct on things. 6. Perhaps ask one of your friends from church to set up a meal delivery sign up and transportation help for you during chemo. You can also include neighbors or others who may seem like only acquaintances, but would love to help you. My friends did this for me through a web site called www.lotsahelpinghands.com. Oftentimes others might not know what you need and you may not know what you need, but I can tell you that having meals delivered was a big help to my family and it was nice to always have someone with me at my chemo sessions. You may not know what you need now, but that's ok and things will change over time. I hope this information has helped you some. I wish you God's peace as you go through this process.",

My eyelashes grew back quickly after chemo, but fell out again after rads (seem to be growing back). 2. I have the feeling that I may black out when I stand up (not all the time, but very often). It's not dizziness, but things start to go black, then clear up quickly. The feeling doesn't persist. 3. My immune system seems to be compromised. I've had 2 sore throats in a month and currently have a bad cold. I haven't been able to find any information about these types of symptoms AFTER treatment has ended. I know it takes time for the body to recover, but if I can be doing something to help that recovery I'd like to do so.

An enlarged lymph node found on palpation sent me straight to neoadjuvent chemo where I did 4 rounds of ACT (dose intensive) and 4 rounds of Taxol. I handled the chemo really well and finished on Sept. 10. My surgery wasn't until Oct. 19 (doctors' schedules) and I was quite confident going into it because the tumor could not be located on ultrasound and neither my surgeon nor oncologist could feel the lump. Everyone was excited. I had a double mastectomy (decided to rid myself of the other potential culprit) and my pathology report after surgery has floored me. It showed the tumor only shrunk to 1.5x1.0x1.0 and there were 4/12 positive lymph nodes. I went from Stage II to Stage III cancer overnight, even though my oncologist says they don't like to stage people who've had neoadjuvent chemo (the standards are based on adjuvent treatment). In addition, my mom was diagnosed in Jan (age 81 ER/PR+ HER2-, 1 positive node, low onkotype, lumpectomy + radiation doing great) and my 54 year old sister in July (ER+, PR-, HER2-, 1 positive node, mastectomy, currently in chemo, will have radiation). We've tested negative for BRCA--clearly there's something else genetic going on. My family got hit by the cancer stick--hell even my pet boa constrictor has cancer and snakes don't get cancer!

I will likely finish the expander fills in the next couple of weeks and start rads shortly thereafter (appointment is next week). I've been reading a lot about Zometa on this site and will ask my doctor. She's actually referring me to another onc in Indianapolis (ones who are more breast specialists) to determine the best way to shut down my ovaries. That may entail an ooph, which I have no problem with. I'm also going to ask for the test how well I metabolize tamoxifen. She said that it's only done if you're on other meds that may interfere with the drug. I take Prevacid for GERD, ambian to sleep at night (a side effect for me of the chemo) and xanax now and then for anxiety. I spoke with my pharmacist and they said it should all be ok. Has anyone heard about problems with these drugs and tamoxifen?",

The mitotic score stayed 1/1, which means the cells aren't dividing rapidly and I'm happy w/that. So, my score jumped from 4/9 to 6/9 and that was consistent from both pathology opinions. It was interesting to learn that only 20% of women have a complete response to neoadjuvent chemo and it's mostly ER- women.

My doc was disappointed that the tumor didn't seem to shrink much, but as also said what you all have said--it could have been larger than estimated by the core biopsy and MRI. The thing that sucks is that I had a clear mammo in Dec. After mom was diagnosed I thought I'd better start checking myself--I felt something funny, but w/my small tatas I was never sure if I was feeling a rib or something. I waited a month or so to go in (through a menstrual cycle) and of course I'm kicking myself for waiting that amount of time. One positive thing I forgot to mention is that my margins were clear--1cm. I know some reports want 2 cm, but others accept even less that 1cm, so I'm happy w/that. I'm great at telling others to focus on positive things, but I have a hard time applying it to myself. My doc wants to put me on tamoxifen right away instead of waiting until after radiation. I figure I can handle the hot flashes since I've been having them through chemo. Hoping for the best I went ahead with immediate reconstruction, so I'm dealing w/the tissue expanders/healing/trying to get back flexibility. They are NO picnic! It may be for naught if the radiation oncologist wants them deflated to make zapping easier. PureE what is your family gene mutation?

My onc is having me get a second opinion from a onc breast specialist about treatment, which I appreciate. I'm gradually coming to terms w/things. To be honest, this is probably the first time in the whole process I've actually grieved getting the cancer. When first diagnosed I was pragmatic and it was all pretty surreal.
