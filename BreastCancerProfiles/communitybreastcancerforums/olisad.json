Something to tuck in the back of your mind (or write down, Tanya has to write everything down - chemo brain :) It is early but results were promising and may move to a phase II trial. Tanya has had regression with Tax/Ad, stability with TEMP (which is tamoxifen along with etoposide, mitoxantrone, and platinol) and regression again with Xeloda.

Tanya started Faslodex this month. The beginning of a long, hopeful journey. I remember reading your posts and feeling, saying, yes \u2013 markers down, yes \u2013 warm the stuff, yes \u2013 double dose and on and on. Then getting to the end of that thread and thinking oh, no \u2013 markers up. A quiet no. And then shortly after finishing reading that thread, seeing your post about your doc leaving, another quiet no. And then seeing this today, hooray!!!! A very loud, loud YES!!!!!!! So happy for you.

Tamoxifen (the hormonal) then 3 chemos (etoposide, platinol and mitoxantrone). Through all of the chemo she has continued with tamox. She is ER+, PR- and HER2- and IDC. She had a 7cm tumor in her lung, 40+ spots on her liver and one on her adrenal gland. Her first scan showed excellent results (after 2 rounds of the taxotere and adriamycin) \u2013 lung clear, liver and adrenal gland lesions size significantly reduced (over 50%). Next scan is in 3 weeks. She will go for 3 consecutive days. Day 1 EMP, day 2 EP, day 3 E. I have read about each of these separate, but not about them given all at once. Or at least haven't yet found any info on it. Probably need a few more days of googling. Just that everyone here is a great place to start, so much knowledge and such willingness to share. I am the question asker of the two of us. I already have some for her next onc visit. Like, why this combo? And where can I read more about them? Hope that is the info you were looking for. And if you have questions, I will ask and find some answers. Thanks for the warm wishes. Lisa Edit: Realized I have the title as TEPM, not TEMP. Ugh. Apologies, sometimes my fingers work faster than my brain. ",

She feels good. Tired at the end of each week on, (she takes 1500mg 2x a day for 7 days and then has 7 days off), but other than that she really is holding her own. It took a few cycles to get the dosage right and since her side effects are scarce. We were talking with her onc last week and he wants her to consider adding something to Xeloda later in the summer to see if there could be a quicker, more dramatic result. Gemzar was when he mentioned, a small dose once a month. In reading I found that Taxotere and Ixempra with Xeloda also have increased effectiveness. Anyhow, I guess my thought is if you're feeling good, and summer is a coming, why not start with Xeloda? Something considered to be relatively mild, but something that works on both bone and liver, and something that can be amped up with an additional chemo if you are not happy with the results. Thanks for letting me ring in. Lisa ",

And after only 2 weeks had her first scan. Stable. She will pepper her onc with questions on Tuesday. In the meantime, got a text from her that just said stable. And then another that said a little bummed. Stable is good. Not what she was hoping for but I think stable is good. Right? Best friend has mets to liver, bone, brain. Log in to post a reply",

After over a year of apply, deny, re-apply, re-deny, written appeals, and written denials, a hearing on her SSDI came and went without denial! SSDI approved! Even without the mandatory amount of work credits. Tamoxifan was deemed enough to inhibit T's ability to work fulltime. If any of you would like the details PM me and happy to share. 3. Reduction in liver tumors indicates positive response to treatement. 14 months of chemo and in May T decided on a chemo break and try Faslodex. Well, hello Faslodex...

Personalized \u2013 not just a copy of the petition\u2013 telling them why this is important to you and your community and our healthcare system. Sending notes to your Senators, Congressman and Governor is easy. A quick Google and you have their address. What elected officials don't want are unhappy, motivated constituents. Could I suggest taking it a step further? I know that these boards and Facebook and the like are great places to connect and to touch base with masses, but a personalized letter to a friend goes so much further. If someone asked me to write a letter for an important cause and gave me compelling reasons why, I would certainly do so. I believe most would as well. If asked, I would pass along that story and information and ask my friends to do the same. If a group does that and continues to ask, it has the potential to go far. What Dr. Tuohy is looking for is exposure and for some foundation, organization, their partners or corporate sponsors, and even congress to fund his study. To take it to human trials. Even people you don't know, celebrities, sports figures, philanthropists, reporters, etc., may react to a letter. You just don't know until you try. I also believe there are many, many worthwhile theories and researchers that would benefit from a cage rattling. It just so happens, that here on this board, it started with Dr. Tuohy. ",

Twoshoes has only been part of the stage iv world for 4 months. I think she still is wrapping her head around the entire dx. That there isn't a magic pill or treatment that makes it just go away. Her attitude is so positive and she always has a brave face for friends and family. It is her nature. This news just slowed her down a bit. Deflated her a bit. Expectations we attach to ourselves are tough things, especially when you have no control over their outcome.  I agree she needs to take time to put all of this into context, to breath a bit and understand that the path she is on is a long one. I just want her to know there are so many behind her, helping her up when she is down. Thanks for your thoughtful and though provoking post. Lisa",

I love them all. But with Cathy, I can't figure what it is. I like her relationship with her student Andrea. I think Cathy and her neighbor are similar characters, there is a loneliness that her neighbor has learned to live with and that Cathy is just beginning to find how to herself. Look forward to see where that storyline goes. Best giggle out loud moment was when she was outside sunning and her husband came by. That exchange was funny. I do understand her want to spend more time with her son and even brother and the husband, blech, that actor just gives me the creeps. He was cast perfectly. :) Looking forward to episode 3.",

Ford and pink, yogurt and pink, furniture and pink, vendors. It seemed so weird. I get it now. (The  artist in me loved the pink water fountains.) It was an emotional morning. Names on t-shirts. Families walking and holding hands. A mom sitting on her lawn chair alone on a city corner with a sign that just said \"Thank You.\" I thought selfishly about me for a while. And then Tanya. And then Cheryl, Linda, Kendra...  And then about so many of you who have shared your experiences, and laughs, and rants and cries. Or have written a kind note. Or offered sage advice. Or who said it straight, when maybe I was looking for a sugar coated response. Someone here wrote a thank you recently to \"people I will likely never meet but cherish nevertheless.\" I can't think of a way to say it better.

I realize this campaign is very Hollywood, and very broad, but if you'd want to get Dr Tuohy's work noticed rather quickly, light up their forum. This broadcast is September 10, 2010 and most of their forum doesn't look like it has been touched for months and months. A sudden burst of women discussing their story and the hope of new theories and research could help shed more light onto that work. Also, a note to any of the founders could possibly go a long way. There is also a place to share your story. The links are below. First forum, then founders, then submit a story. Hope this isn't violating any rules or stepping on any toes. Merely a suggestion.
