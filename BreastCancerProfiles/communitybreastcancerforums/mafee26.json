My onco asked me to have CT scan and bone scan for my CA 15-3 is still high after finishing chemo a month after. I let her checked on the lump..but she told me its probably my ribs, but she still urge me to have CT scan. i am not sure if its a good idea to finish first my 33days session of radiation before i do CT scan, because im hoping that radiation will have positive development..",

Done surgery (mastectomy) with 12 nodes negative..showing invasive ductal carcinoma. ER-PR+. Done 4 cycles chemo from Dec 2012 to feb 2013. I still have high result of CA15-3. I am on radiation therapy (tomo) for 33days that started last April 2. I noticed lumps (2) near my mastectomy scar. I am so scared of the thought that i need to get through operation and chemo again if this mean local recurrence. Is there anyone experienced the same. I am really worried. Thanks! God bless everyone! Log in to post a reply",
