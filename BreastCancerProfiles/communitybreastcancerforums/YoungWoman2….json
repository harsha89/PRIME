I'm actually a law student studying health law and I know doctors sometimes make you have more procedures than necessary precautionary to themselves. Is there a reason I should allow them to do a mammogram versus an x-ray or ultrasound? If I go in, I'd like to be informed and not let them convince me to do all of those things.",

I can't seem to find anything on the county's health department site but I will try to give them a call. There are also many pregnancy clinics that give free ultrasounds but I assume I would have to be pregnant and that a breast ultrasound would require different equipment. Thanks to everyone for all the advice and replies! Everyone on the site is so helpful and caring.Â I'm very grateful that there is a network like this.",
