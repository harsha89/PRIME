I'm going in for a ultrasound guided needle biopsy tomorrow.  I have a lump, measured on ultrasound to be just about 1cm. Now my mind is going a mile a minute, I'm in google overdrive. Super scared for the patholgy results to be bad.  Now every little ache and pain I have is making me question my overall health. I'm sure I'm worrying myself more then I need to but the unknown is the worst. At least if I knew for sure what it was then I could have a plan in order on how to deal with it.  Good luck at your biopsy tomorrow I'll be thinking of you and praying that we both hear good results.  My biopsy is scheduled for 9am.",

I'm a 34 yr old mother of 6.  My husband found a lump in my breast on Wednesday the 27th, that day I got in with my obgyn she ordered a bilateral mammogram and ultrasound for Friday the 29th.  The radiologist said she was \"unsure\" of what it is so I'm scheduled for a needle biopsy tomorrow morning.  I too have been googling like crazy, and inturn turning myself into a basket case.  The \"thing\" they measured is just over 1cm.  In November when I was 5 months pregnant I had a lump in the same breast and they did a ultrasound and said it was a clogged milk duct....now here we are 8 months later in the same spot with this \"lump\".  I dont know if it went away to be honest I wasnt really paying attention once they told me it was a clogged milk duct I figured it didnt need anymore attention or thought.  I'm scared of the unknown, scared of the what ifs......just scared",

They said this is the only spot that shows concern from the mammogram and ultrasound. Now the waiting begins for the phone call. They said I should have the results by Friday.  I have an appt scheduled with the Breast Surgeon for Tuesday 8:30am....the dr said they like to have the appts made one way or another before the results are in. Continueing to hope for B9 results.  Thanks again for all of your support!",

If it is what we never want to hear, know it's a battle that can be fought and WON.  I encourage you to look at the forum under Biographies and Success Stories, with the Topic Success Stories. When I was waiting for my results I found that forum so inspirational because you see that this is a war that can be won and there are so many stories of women going on to live 20, 30, 40 years after diagnosis.  But remember you do not have a diagnosis yet, so it could still be nothing. Praying for you, your babies, and the stregnth you need to get through this difficult time.",

This corresponds to the biopsy-proven breast carcinoma seen on recent sonogram and mammogram no suspicious adenopathy is seen. No chest wall or nipple invasion is noted.

This website is a godsend, to those in each stage....fear, battle, and triumph. God Bless each and every one of you and your families.
