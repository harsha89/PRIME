The oncologists nurse is working hard to get me appts in Seattle (about 250 miles away) that are close together so I'm not driving over the pass in winter too often. Today I'm leaving for Las Vegas for our annual Nascar vacation. In addition my daughter gave me a Christmas present that now seems as if it was from heaven. Tomorrow night I get to live out my teenage fantasy and meet Donny Osmond. Some of you may think this is really dorky, but it has so given me something to look forward to. She gave me a VIP ticket which includes a backstage chance to meet and photos with Donny and Marie. When I find it hard to breath and things seem overwhelming I think of the show tomorrow.  Then I'm going to spend 3 days out at the race track watching cars race at incredible speeds. Lots to see, and very loud. I'm hoping the noise drowns out that inner voice - at least most of the time. I find far too often that the cancer is on my mind. I have my 1st appt with a plastic surgeon set up for next week when we get home. From there on it will be hard to ignore. But at least I'll be taking baby steps forward to get this over. The nurse is working on getting the rest set up so when I get back I'm off and running. Again, after being long winded, I really appreciate the kind words, thoughts and prayers. I haven't shared this with too many yet, because I have no answers for them. After meeting with the docs and setting up a plan then I'll start to let people know. Being able to share thoughts here is so helpful. Thank you for listening (reading) and prayers. I'll keep breathing. Debby",

Spent way to much $$ on the pro photos. They wouldn't let us take our cameras. But it was a night that I will remember and smile about for a long time! Marie is beautiful and very nice. They talked for a couple of minutes as they were signing my pictures. Didn't think about those obnoxious breasts very much. Totally forgot them when Donny sang Puppy Love. Debby",

I have had 6 month followup mammos and visits with the oncologist throughout. Today, almost exactly 1 year since the last surgery, the mammo shows large areas of calcification between the 2 previous ADH sites in my right breast. I saw the oncologist following my mammo. For the 1st time she is suggesting that I consider mastectomy and reconstruction. I'm 50 and am seeing my breasts disappear a chunk at a time. Has anyone else had multiple surgeries for ADH? Has anyone elected to go with bilateral mastecomies due to recurring ADH? Dx 2/19/2010, DCIS, 4cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

You're right, it's like being stuck in a whirlpool. Every 6 months the stress starts all over again. I would be very interested in how your visit with the plasitc surgeon goes. I'm still a few weeks from any further appointments, so only have time to sit and think. Good luck to you.",

The oncologist I've been seeing for the last 1 1/2 years called to talk about my options. I told her I was interested in reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy, and probably bilateral since I've already had ADH in my left breast as well. She is referring me to 2 surgeons in Seattle. I live in a rural part of Washington, so no one here can do reconstruction at the same time as the mastecomy around here. I should be hearing from them in a couple days to schedule consults. Needless to say, I didn't have a very good day yesterday. I feel better today. I have been having mammos every 6 months, so this is very new. The doctor kept repeating that this is still very small and caught very early. I appreciated that she called me within a 1/2 hour of the breast care nurse calling me with the results. I didn't think I would be talking to her till next week. So now I get to start a new journey. Luckily my husband is very practical and supportive so I won't be traveling alone.",
