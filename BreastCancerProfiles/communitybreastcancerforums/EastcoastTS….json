      "Content": "Mar 7, 2017 10:31PM - edited Mar 7, 2017 10:40PM by EastcoastTS Hello all March BC friends: Plantchild: I'll be thinking of you on Friday. Again, what is in our minds (fear/angst) I think is worse than the actual when it presents itself for us to face. You'll get through this. Gardener4: We understand. Our fear is great, too. Maybe different in the case-by-case but fear just the same. But you may have very good news waiting just around the corner. All is still going well with me for the most part. However, I'll be honest, I do find this endeavor to be a (excuse my French) bitch at times. For example: My mother (82 and a genetic freak, TNBC survivor who looks and acts 20 years younger!) is helping me with drains twice daily because my hubby has gone back to work and my son back to school. I'm in hotel in TX for post-op appts and heading home Friday. Anyhoo -- I'm naked in front of her while she drains, and I was a bit modest before this point in my life. Well, no more of that! She might as well be changing my diaper again. It's a bit humbling. Tissue expanders are not horrible to date. Pains but nothing that is constant. More of feeling of pressure but even that not terrible. But I am, again, not expanded very much at all. My plan is to go slowly and be small in the end/all, be/all. For the showering question (sorry I'm trying to keep up with names), your doctor must give you instructions based on what you left the hospital covered in/with. You may be able to shower now or not. I safety pin my drains near neck somewhat away from the incisions (beneath breast fold) and do the best I can to not directly spray water on the incisions (as directed) but clean them, too. Again, this is bitch #2 but it's working well enough. I also bought a handy little item called Shower Pockets which are basically koosies on a string that you place the drains in. They hang near the neck and the whole thing dries quickly after shower. A lanyard or even panty hose (I have heard) work well. Pin and just get the drains high enough to get out of your way. It's not rocket science and is an inconvenience but doable. The koosie item would only work with 2 drains. **The best investment I made was to purchase a waist belt with two hanging pockets (don't know name) to place my drains in. I have used it 24/7. However, someone else said they used a carpenter's pocket/waist thing and I also think one used by waitresses (I used to have one in college job) would work very well, too. No pinning of drains -- just place them in the pockets. It's been GREAT! My only negative is my nipples are not perfect. One is black, the other maybe partially discolored. And some red on the black nipple breast. Not huge area but...Sigh. Tomorrow is PS and MO appts, so we'll see. I'm using the cream, ugh, silverdene or some such that they recommended. Perhaps it's helping or maybe they will fall off. Idk. <?> Other than rotting nipples, this has not been awful! Day 7 and really, my best day yet! Over 2000 steps on Fitbit and lessening meds. You can do it!!!!!!!! Warm wishes to all...my thoughts with you. ",

Infection. And am still in a bit of a \"wait and see\" mode as my breast is slightly red in the area still (like 3% from the original, though, however, I'll never feel safe until...well, not sure when!). I did not see an infectious disease doctor but my PS prescribed three antibiotics about 5 days post-surgery. I was horrified at the amount because I eat a lot of probiotic food and take daily probiotic but it did the trick. I hope. Next step for me if comes back, etc., is IV, so perhaps that isn't a bad idea to push for. I also do a lot of Vit C. And for Pugs who asked about my spray paint cat: Yes, there is a homeless gentleman who has a fixation with spraying all his belongings gold. So -- he found a kitten by a dumpster and you get the story. Someone called the police, and the kitten was taken to local shelter I volunteer for. He lost hair, one eye and has some slight issues (neuro?) with legs that no one but me would notice (but I saw him recovering). Chances of survival slim when I brought him into my home. He's now a madman. The one-eyed little bastard!!!!!!!! I do worry about his future. We may be the \"cancer kids\" due to how many toxins he ingested. But he's loving life at the moment.

I eat/drink a lot of probiotic foods (Kefir, kimchi, pickles (which MUST come from the refrigerated section of your grocery store to be truly fermented), miso soup, etc.. In any case, try those daily if your palette agrees. Also, my integrated oncologist just recommended a new probiotic (I take one daily but apparently it's basically useless LOL): VSL#3. Once a day or every other if you feel bloating. I just talked to the pharmacist and he said bloating means it's working on the gut in a good way. I had to go to a pharmacy to find but health food stores should have too. It will also be in the refrigerated section and you must refrig at home. FYI: it's not cheap. The pharmacist said clinical info is truly showing how good these are and in the larger (billions) for the probiotic. Culturelle, etc., he said is just not strong enough especially when we've been on antibiotics. I just finished infection round of THREE! Ugh. But due to food and even my shitty probiotic, I'm not having any issues.",

I'm in a hotel, so that may factor into my even being slower getting into normal routine. I go home on 3/10. I decided upon nipple/skin sparing BMX due to multiple factors: dense breasts and mammo finding nothing, finding another small bump/lump a couple of days before surgery on \"healthy side\", etc. I was scared about more surgery of course and having two arms to deal with and mobility but here goes for my progress. I really was almost not sure up to surgery -- ha ha. Or maybe not ha ha, right? I'm six days out (surgery Monday 2/27) and want to let everyone out there facing this know that my experience has been BETTER than I expected. I had tissue expanders placed, 50 ccs filled at surgery (I'm really small and have very small tissue expanders, too) -- and the discomfort has been fine/manageable. Am I taking meds? YES. Tramadol and valium for muscle spasms. I have hydrocodone but have only taken one. I did the pre-Colace regimen + protein + fluids + arnica/bromelain (no doctor is going to jump for joy about this but it's safe) but had to get something else from the doctor because had constipation. Taking supplements (Juven powder, B6, CQ10, Vit C, too, because it can't hurt). I have Mepilex strips covering the incisions in the breast fold, waterproof derma-something with antibiotic sponge covering the drains (only have 2) so I can shower! These I have not touched. Have had swelling and bruising but not crazy amount (I think arnica helps here!). Range of motion is what I could consider very good but I'm horrible and have not done exercises yet. Going to do that today. I think I can do them all though. YOU CAN DO THIS. I think I'll have drains out next week. Also got news (though I was sleeping when I answered and hope it was not a dream, that my nodes were clear!!!). And that the other spot was fibrous, etc. Still glad I did BMX because it has not been that bad and I was not super attached to my AA/A tiny but perky/youthful breasts. I also will say that my path. report now says I am ILC officially, which I'm not at all surprised about. One path report said ILC the other said IDC/LCIS. I have not seen the report, only got this info on the phone. Good luck and warm wishes to all going through this! Ask any questions. I'm here to answer.",

Though they later told me I looked great in the OR. Go figure. She said T-shirt would be all they would want against my skin. They may place you in a bra (I expected this but had nothing when I woke up). Have not worn one at all but I was tiny before and going braless is normal for me. Others may have better info but your PS will place the bra on you in the hospital I believe. If you need it. And give instructions on what to do. I had a camisole with pockets but have not even put it on. It's looks \"granny\" to me anyway. ;) OH! I also did one other thing. Bought $2 T-shirts at Walmart and cut them down the front -- bought stick on velcro and stuck them on to use as buttons. Have worn these a lot. I made two. And I'm the most UN-crafty person you can imagine. When you wash, just place new velcro stickers on. These are obviously not good for use outside the home. I only placed about 4 stickers per shirt but lots of comfort and EASE of getting in and out of even the first day of post-op. Better than being naked but not much more than this.",

      "Content": "Mar 17, 2017 07:56PM - edited Mar 17, 2017 08:11PM by EastcoastTS Sorry I've been \"offline\" for a bit; will try to answer a few questions. Too many posts since my last visit to name names but good wishes to ALL going through this journey. You're my champions!!! (My excuse: I had surgery out of town -- had to fly home and just getting truly back and settled this week. I flew Day 11 if you count surgery as Day 1 without any issue.) Recliner: Have done beds the entire time with bunch of pillows. I do have a wedge pillow at home. Not sure if it's better than bunch of pillows and have one of those \"dorm\" pillows with arms rests. A recliner would be awesome but if you don't have one, you'll be okay. Small travel or heart pillows for underarms have worked well in situations, too. Drain removal: I only had two, removed 9 days after - and only had pain on one side because the stitches were VERY tight. According to surgeon. Indeed that side/site had been giving me minor issues. But removal is so quick and, really, don't fear it much. I barely felt it but I did not watch and talked the entire time. Just keep blabbering while they do it. TEs: I really dreaded these damn things but could not get surgeons (consulted with 3) that were comfortable doing one-step/direct for me. I'm very small and skin compromise just too possible. I was filled to 50ccs at surgery and that is plenty for me at this time. Complications: I had nipple/skin-sparing and was the one with a nipple that looked like roadkill with possible infection. Well, nipple is fine and going to survive (still looks raw but healing and this was expected, I was not alarmed) but the infection... Finishing course of massive antibiotics (switched from one typical post med. to three when redness on breast (cancer side) started showing up days after surgery. I believe, at least, that it occurred early on. The antibiotics have played havoc with my stomach a little. I eat probiotic foods, etc., all pre-cancer stuff, so I hate this, but I have no choice. The redness has toned down from say an 8/7 to a 1-ish but I can still see it faintly. Two more days of meds, then another appt. Tuesday. If the PS is not satisfied, it's either more antibiotics (IV or oral). Worse case: removal of TE on that side if IV doesn't satisfy her. But I've responded so well to the orals that I think it's going to be okay. If not, wtf, I have to deal, right? (Not to scare anyone. These things occur -- and I had my surgery at MD Anderson, so, um, things just happen.) Pain Following: Pain I have now is I believe (1) mainly TE-focused, though how can we tell? Mainly along the inside breast area/walls. What do we call this area? LOL I do have pain (2) on the incisions, which seems to be just starting for me. They look good, not infected, but I guess healing and \"stinging/burning\". Normal? Mine are in the breast fold but decent length. (3) My nipples, saved, both burn and sting. One is pretty damn good-looking for what occurred. But both hurt some which may be phantom pain. I have no idea! (4) I also get sharp/shooting, very brief pains. Both breasts. This occurred after my biopsy, too. <?> Pain med: Ask for what you need, everyone! I had tramadol but got nerve block during surgery, which really helped. I did have oxy of some type but only took one. Yuck. I have Valium that I'm using for spasms as needed but mostly just doing that and Tylenol at this point (also if needed). Ativan is also another I've heard works well. If you don't have what is working, ask. Overall, sleeping on my back is a bitch, but the surgery has been better than I expected. Except for unexpected/but research-possible-expected infection. Likely will not happen to you. I also can report that I have feeling under both underarms, in middle of chest, chest wall. I'm really not nearly as numb as expected. Though maybe due to skin-sparing? Idk. But I am very tender. Like I don't want to touch it too much. I was not placed in a bra. You guys may not believe it but I have not worn one ONCE. Was told no. Nada. Again, maybe due to sparing nipples and my small size. I was an A cup (maybe truly AA before) and with 50ccs filled, I'm not that much smaller if any. Of course funny ripples were not part of the pre-cancer party drill. I had perky/Kate Hudsons (just saying but they were tiny!). So seeing my same nipples and about the same size in a tank top is wild. Under the tank top is a bit of a mess but whatever. If I lose that TE, though, ugh. Will have to gather skin from somewhere and I don't have much to spare. Back would be only option and not much there. Good thing I'm going small. GOOD LUCK and warm wishes and hugs to everyone!!!",

As far as speaking to someone, even without your insurance while you get that figured out, your nurse practitioner -- if you have one -- OR BS/PS/MO should be able to give you a name of a social worker or therapist, very often without charge. My local cancer center and MD Anderson (where I had surgery) have someone \"on call\" that is without charge (aside from what you decide to do with your insurance, etc.). If you're feeling like this, I'd get in touch tomorrow morning and let them know you need assistance now. Also -- American Cancer Society has folks manning phones all the time, too.

Someone asked about the nuclear injections. I was worried about these and they were a breeze. HOWEVER, I recommend that you ask for EMLA Cream prior (doctor can prescribe). I asked for the prescrip (I had to ask twice) but the nicest nurse during the procedure told me they apply if the patient asks IF they come early. 30 minutes. But you might want to know that first. Someone on this board told me to apply 1 hour prior, cover the breast, wrap in Saranwrap, head to appt. That kept my clothing clean and, really, I did not feel much of anything. It's a topical lodacaine cream. 2FUN: I'd mention the warmth to your PS. Better safe than sorry. I say because I am still dealing with a post-op infection. Warmth, redness, swelling initially (5 days post op). Major load of oral antibiotics really helped. All swelling gone, redness down to I'd say 5%, no heat. I never had a temperature of any kind. But -- still have some redness. My feeling is I may have to do the IV antibiotics at some point. Maybe not. PS was not alarmed by red still being there yesterday -- but I haven't had a fill yet. I'm 23 days post surgery, btw. I'm fine to wait on fills -- I'm really small and not getting many anyway -- but the redness does make me nervous, gotta admit. Would hate to lose my adorable/lovable TE! cdv4251992: I'm sitting here trying to imagine ways to creatively manage your work attire. The strict dress code is a challenge. No larger but professional blazer allowed? I've found some great ones at thrift stores recently. If no workable solution arises, could you talk to management?

My advice: aside from the label, I took them with food after getting nauseous one time but otherwise, no side effects. Cipro can be hard on your stomach. And, yeah, it has some scary stuff out there about it but what are we to do at this point but take it? Take a probiotic, too, if you don't already. I get mine in the refrigerated section.

One question: do you have anyone who can assist during surgical recovery? I chose BMX (bilateral mastectomy) but had a small support system in place (hubby/mom) to help me. And I needed that for a few days. Not that you want to chose based on this, but it is a question to ask. Also -- even if you chose mastectomy, unilateral or bi-, you could still have to have radiation. I did NOT and I'm not saying it's likely. But it is possible if you have lymph node involvement and/or they do not get clean borders with the mastectomy. My tumor was close to a muscle and this was a possibility.

You will be under lifting restrictions for weeks, depending upon your PS. I think I was 2 weeks nothing above shoulder. For 4-5 weeks, nothing over 5 lbs. But very modest even after that. I'm not sure they will want you lifting patients for a bit. Please ask your PS. Overall, the recovery is not bad -- again, more complicated if you have reconstruction at time of BMX. I had drains for 10 days. Factor having those into the mix as well. GOOD luck and ask any/all questions. {hugs}",

Also, my BMX hospital (MD Anderson) recommended Hibiclens (available on Amazon and Google for instructions to use -- something will certainly pop up), however, my Exchange hospital did not. I did it anyway with Exchange, because I had a post-op infection the first time around. It's just strong liquid soap that you wash area to be operated on for 3 days prior to surgery. Another step to reduce chance of infection. Some docs recommend, some don't. But it cannot hurt. (Cannot be used on certain areas and face.) ;)",

Lifting arms hard for me at first (putting arms into T-shirt, etc., impossible that I recall) but not as bad as I expected. I think I could brush hair and teeth pretty soon after without too much pain. And you'll only have one side. That is easier. Follow instructions from your doc. It's easy to do too much too soon. Get button shirts for first week or two. I'd also recommend Colace or something like this starting a couple of days before surgery.

Perhaps they run on biopsy samples sometimes, too? (I'm not sure.) This determined if I was going to do chemo. NO for me on that. Genetics were also done - especially since my mom is a survivor.

Great idea about doing this for veins. I take a probiotic every day and will continue. My plans: arnica and bromelain before and after, good for bruising and recovery. Arnica cream is also effective for bruising but would not use on an open wound. Vitamin C, zinc and protein however I can get it. Also, shoot I can't recall exactly the name, but Juven (is that right?). I've read it's great for tissue healing. You can buy the packets at WalMart and I think mix with water. Not a miracle drug or anything but seems to help from reviews. I plan to let my BS know in our pre-consult which is 4 days before surgery (because my surgery is on a Monday morning) that I'm taking these. Just in case. I am not doing anything docs advised against. (Omega 3, Vit E, Advil, etc.) Good luck and warm wishes to everyone on the BC twister right now. As Tiny Tim said: bless us each and every one! ;)",

I asked about the pain ball and was told they didn't do these but would do Exparel (bupivacaine liposome) instead. I honestly am not sure if they would have done this had I not asked about the pain ball. You gotta manage your own health care, wow! Here's a good article about pain management from Angelina Jolie's surgeon. Ha ha. I know, maybe that topic is over-discussed -- but she must be a good doctor and she used Exparel! I Googled the med and that's how I found this article. My advice: ASK your BS. Because nothing will happen if you don't. But I'm pushy. http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/health-answe... I also talked to a woman today who had BMX in November and her PS used Botox. Which I've just read about. She had one-step and almost NO muscle spasms. I'm going to ask about this, too. Why not? All they can say is: no. I've had it before (just being honest) so my body is cool with it. As far as reconstruction goes, I considered UMX (I'm possibly multi-focal, not sure. I did not do another biopsy on second spot seen on re-review of my MRI because I already had surgery date in place) but I finally just came to the decision that BMX is the best for my situation. Dense breasts, family history, possible high risk depending upon who you're talking to. Also, they found LCIS in my tumor, too, and the first diagnosis was ILC, now changed to IDC, but this is only on the biopsy path. So I wonder what the heck will truly come up with this in the final path -- and at least I won't be like: damn, wish I had known that and just gone BMX. Also, I'm really small (AA cup probably) and everyone concerned with cosmetic (which I realize it NOT getting the cancer out) has told me: girl, do BMX. But the final decision was me/mine/personal. You have to weigh all the factors and go with what you can live with or, heck, live without! But I'm not sure even when they wheel us into the OR -- is everyone completely sure they've made the best decision? I'm not sure there myself. Yes, I worry about more surgery and having to deal with both sides involved but...I want to make the best decision. If I made my decision from fear, I would go UMX. If that makes any sense at all. We're with you! Support, wisdom, kindness, acceptance, understanding. You're not alone.",

I could not have made it through the past year without the great people here!!! Also, everything you are feeling is so normal. The angst when you're first diagnosed is horrible. I remember that well and can PROMISE that it gets better with a treatment plan in place and more information under your belt. Research: My mom went through this 10 years before me and did not do the research that I felt I had to do. And she's fine 10 years later. If you have a great medical team in place, then perhaps you will not feel you have to know everything. If it helps you cope. (And agree -- stay away from blind Google searches.) Just get a solid team (and seek 2nd opinions if you're not sure). I did and it was easy to secure them. Re: telling people. I'm not on FB and I suppose am fairly private (although I spill everything here!) and I didn't want to tell everyone. So I didn't. Now it's gotten easier. But my neighbors still don't know. I guess I'm saying: do what presents the LEAST stress at this moment. If it's easier, I've heard of some people designating a person as their communications lead. They let everyone else know what is happening. How about that? Or wait until after surgery, unless you have to, then let people know. Just do what you need for you right now. Everyone else must slip to second place for a while. BTW, I didn't tell my 10-year-old son until a couple of months ago what the real deal was. At first, we just went with it's surgery and not a lot more detail. I found that easier for me. Idk why exactly. I just did. About waiting for results. Well, I came here and did just what you're doing. Asked for advice and just read other's stories to calm my fears. I also asked for a little happy pill to help me. Sleep if nothing else. And I needed it -- for the first time in my life -- at 3am some mornings. Don't hesitate to ask your doctor for this. Many, many here have done the same. Come back and ask any and all questions when you have more info and have questions in place. I was well prepared for surgery because of my lovely \"friends\" here. I knew what to expect in some manner and, really, I didn't feel so alone. You are not alone!!! {big virtual hug from me to you}",

I may have been a little sleepy from anesthesia the week or so after Exchange but the length of the surgery is shorter (guessing), so this should be less for you this time, too.

Pretty much say 2017 is now devoted to the guest you didn't invite but decided to stay: BC. That's what I've done. Then, I want 2018 to be about other things! Not cancer!!! The more info. you receive and the more you understand your plan and your exact diagnosis, the better this gets. My Oncotype was done after surgery. Because if I had had lymph node involvement, they may not have run it. (Because chemo decision made already.) Not sure if that is always/always the case. You should receive your biopsy sample's hormonal breakdown soon, I'd guess. Ask them! I had to wait about a week for the entire thing -- but you got some info quickly you said. This information is critical for next steps and treatment planning. Along with the MRI, which should give everyone a very good idea of the tumor size and how the rest of the breast -- and it's partner -- are doing. My MRI said my tumor was 1.2mm and it was actually 1.8mm, however, I'm lobular and they are often larger in final path. analysis. You should get a very good idea (I think) since you are IDC. Once the steps fall into place, you'll begin to see where you are headed. Take a breath. Waiting was the absolute hardest part (not knowing my stage until about 2 months after diagnosis). All a guessing game until then. Stay off Google. :) Hugs to you!",

The facility did tell me that they'll do EMLA if a patient calls and asks beforehand because you have to come in early for application. So ask your facility and/or ask your doctor for EMLA. It's can't hurt to do this if you're nervous. ;)",

When she was DX (2009) they only ran BRCA. I was negative for all. My genetics counselor called and told me over the phone (she's at MD Anderson in Houston, so out of town for me). They also uploaded results to an online portal. It only took about 5 days that I recall! Fast. I'd do it and try not to be nervous. More information is beneficial and look at it this way: at some time in the very recent past, women would have loved to know more but science was not there to help them. It is there to help us now.
