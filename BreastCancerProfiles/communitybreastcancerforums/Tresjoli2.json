My first mammo came back bi-rads 0 due to a cluster of coarse heterogenous calcifications in my left breast.  I went for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound the following week, which came back Bi-Rads 4B for the calcifcations. Biopsy was recommended, which I did yesterday. My breast is sore, but other than that I am ok. My doctor told me she wants to review the results with me in person and that is scheduled for Tuesday.  It feels like such a long time to wait.  I keep telling myself that most biopsy's are benign, but this is harder than I thought it would be (the waiting!).

It was mild enough that I was able to finish but it was there and I could feel it trying to fight with the steroids and take over. My MO almost stopped the chemo but I said no way not with ten minutes to go. Now next time I have to take a steroid the night before. My doc wants me to consider switching to abraxane. But I don't want to...the study was with taxol that I used to make my decision. It was almost like my MO was changing her mind on my chemo...sigh. but I made it through!",

My heart rate soars to 145 and my blood pressure goes through the roof. I start having irregular beats. I push the panic button. We stop the taxol..more steriods. I start shaking uncontrollably. We decide to add back the extra Decadron wait a half hour and try again. 4 mind into try 2 the same thing happens. My heart rate soars and begins to beat irregularly and I break out in hives and my blood pressure sky rockets. I get more steroids. So that's it. I've developed some sort of cardiac hypersensitivity. We switch to Abraxane next week. I was so frightened. And I'm bummed about the switch. I know it should work the same but what if it doesnt? I'm so full of steroids I feel anxious and racy...I was at the hospital all day.",
