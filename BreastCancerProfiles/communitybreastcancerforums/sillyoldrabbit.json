They do have an ice machine, though. Has anyone found a clever way to do the icing in this kind of situation? My first infusion is supposed to last about 2 hours. It'll be on March 20, so I've got to get this figured out real soon. My \"teacher\" said they'd only had one other woman do the icing and she used a pair of large oven mitts. She put the ice inside plastic bags, and put the bags in the mitts. No idea how she managed her feet. I'm thinking maybe wear latex gloves so my hands won't be in icy water. I'm drawing a blank about the feet. If they had a freezer, I could use blue ice in a pan of water and swap them out when they warmed up. But that's not do-able. Ideas, please!

Because of its aggressiveness, I'll be doing chemo first, starting on March 20. Will be having a port implanted next Friday. 16 rounds to look forward to. Surgery to follow - type dependent on results of Braca test. I wanted to post earlier, but was so paralyzed with fear that I couldn't concentrate long enough to write a coherent sentence. Now that I've got a treatment plan and have met the oncologist and surgeon, I feel a lot more sane, though it's difficult to stop worrying. My doctors are very upbeat about it, but I'm 70 so don't know how well my body will handle the chemo. Scheduled for a PET scan and brain MRI next week, both of which scare me because I'm afraid of what they'll find. The breast MRI showed no lymph node involvement, but that doesn't mean the wicked little beasties haven't found a home elsewhere. I am NOT in the mood to die. Any hand-holding would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to making new friends here. --Diane Dx 2/28/2018, IDC, Left, 4cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 3/19/2018 Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxol (paclitaxel) Surgery 10/2/2018 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Sentinel Log in to post a reply",
