As soon as my skin started to go pink she used hydra gel which came in tubes, and secured a dressing over the top. I was warned that I would still 'cook' for a week after treatment had finished and the wound would get worse. It did 8-(. But, then it healed really quickly. It was needing dressings for only 3 days after the cooking period and two days later completely healed. That was in February. It now looks like an odd square of sunburn lol",

It happens the day after treatment and then goes away. Quite painful but only lasts for about a minute ir so at a time. I'm now on cycle 6. My registrar told me they only give 6 cycles SO i went to see my oncologist prepared to do battle citing my understanding that in the us they give it until it's no longer effective. My onc grinned at me and said I was the first if his 6 patients that had tried the drug to do well on it. And then said if everything was good at next examination in three weeks time he would sign off on another four! It's a new thing in the uk. I'm so glad of this thread as it prepared me for what I could expect since theres very little info in the uk. My hair thinned but is still there. I get steroids and odansetron in pre med. Odansetron causes constipation so I take a docsulate at night for a couple of days after treatment and it sorts itself out. I also try to eat foods to help things along a bit. I made a lovely apple and rhubarb crumble yesterday. Yum! Also, a couple of dates every now and then help lots. I started eating them instead of eating sweets cos I'm far too over weight now due to stuffing my face and then not being able to exercise too much due to hip. X Sarah",

Cutting edge of research etc. He's biopsied me twice and I am waiting for another appt for one as he wants to see if my status has changed as he has me in mind for a trial targeted therapy treatment and wants everything in place in plenty of time. I'm very fortunate. I'm on top dose at the moment. I'm weaning myself of the steroid dose as I become more confident with this drug. I hate feeling sick. Steroids are ok at the moment because they ease the pain in my hip a bit and also sorted out blocked saliva gland this treatment. So it's been a bit handy! X Sarah",
