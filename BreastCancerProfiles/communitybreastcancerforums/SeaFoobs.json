      "Content": "Feb 5, 2011 10:12AM SeaFoobs wrote: Here's an explanation of the clip and why they use it. Breast Biopsy Marker Clip Marker clips used for breast biopsies are made of titanium or surgical stainless steel and are about 2 millimeters in size.  When the radiologist or surgeon feels a marker should be used, they are inserted at the end of breast core or needle biopsy procedures to mark the site of the biopsy for later reference.  This is an important step to take since most abnormalities biopsied are small or subtle and can become extremely difficult or impossible to identify after a core biopsy procedure.  When a biopsy result is abnormal and an excision or lumpectomy is necessary, the marker clip allows accurate localization of the abnormal site for removal so that as little tissue as necessary is removed while optimizing the chance of clear margins. Most patients have normal (benign) results from these types of biopsy, however the presence of the marker is very reassuring when seen on follow-up mammograms; it shows exactly where the area was biopsied. This avoids confusion in interpretation of follow-up mammograms and can prevent the need for future biopsies in that same area. The marker is safe; sensitivity to the material is very rare.  In general women cannot feel the clip.  They do not set off airport detectors and do not cause interference problems in MRI.",
