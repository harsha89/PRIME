Don't worry really I have 2 paternal aunts both Dx at 45-50 of breast cancer. I'm scheduled for biopsy on Friday. My question I see the lump is small about the size of eraser head but it did get bigger albeit minuscule, anyone have similar results as mine and what did your biopsy results show!!! Should I be worried birads4 with family history Any input or help appreciated to ease my mind... I know waiting is the hardest part Log in to post a reply",
