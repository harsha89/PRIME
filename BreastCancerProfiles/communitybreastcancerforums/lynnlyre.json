Fluid is also settling under my arm.  Saw surgeon again and she said to re-apply compression to try to single to the body to stop sending more fluid to the area and to start sending the fluid there up into the lymph system.   To try to allow breathing she wrapped with ace wrap.  Again, I am a large women!  I went to bed with my check wrapped and woke up with the ace wrap rolled down under my breast line.  Put compression wrap back on as it was the only thing I could apply my self.  By 10:00 p.m. last night I could not breath again so we found a larger ace wrap which has mostly stayed put for 17 hours.   Since I cannot do reconstruction now I was hoping to get fit for prosthesis but I cannot until fluid build up goes down.  Anyone with suggestions for keeping compression on and/or how to go out in public with only one breast?  Any good/bad home made breast options until I can get a prosthesis?  ",
