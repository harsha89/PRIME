I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago, but because of my living situation I have had to move a lot in the last 3 months from when I first found that little bump that got my attention in the first place. I think I am emotionally retarded because it has taken so long to sink in with me. Not kidding one bit. I just passed annoyed an hour ago and went to sad. I am all over the place emotionally, however most of the time I try to just not think about it. I keep talking to myself saying things like it won't do any good to worry about it. I just have to get through it is all. I employ as many coping mechanisms as I can, usually the distracting kind. Which brought me here. I figure I should get with people who understand this sort of thing, and maybe I won't have to distract so much as be able to deal with it and share what I am fixing to go through with people who are like me.",

It sounds like you did indeed find another calling in life and it makes you happy and for that I am very glad. I saw the surgeon. She says mastectomy definitely. I did enter my diagnosis but I don't see it now. My surgery is scheduled for the 21st. I really like my surgeon. She listens and she is very observant. She knows I am having mental problems and she wants to help with that after surgery. She did give me some meds that I need to sleep, and wow, I can't believe what a good night's sleep does for me. Somebody somewhere had mentioned how important it was to like your treatment team and so far, I really like them a lot.  And though I had no one with me this time, I actually remember the conversation well, and I did take some notes and what not, so all in all I feel good about this :)",

I have my voice recorder though, and thanks to this site and you great ladies, I am well armed with the right questions to ask. I may not understand everything they tell me, but that won't stop me from exhausting them with questions! I do have an awesome friend on the other side of the Country, literally, who has said she wants to fly out and be with me when I have surgery. She is such an awesome lady, and her sister had double mastectomy some years ago, so she knows this wole road. Plus she was a nurse in the mental health field, so she understands these crazy emotions that are all over the place. Oh, and she likes to be aggressive with the doctors  to get me good care.

Thankfully my treatment team will be under one roof, but because of the transportation problem my appt with the surgeon has been put off for weeks. I also wish I knew how to not cry when asking for help. I want to be strong, but I get so frustrated. Someone mentioned in the forum that you find out who your friends are. I am starting to see that and it depresses me. Sorry ladies. Just had to spew for a second. I did join here just recently and this has helped quit a bit. I am thankful I have internet and am not quite so disoriented as to not know how to operate google. ha ha",
