    "Content": "chiqui wrote: I just got a Biopsy because my diagnostic mammagram was showing some \"abnormalities\".  The doctor called and said the priliminary report shows cancer.  The final report will come on Monday.  If that also shows Cancer, a Breast MRI is called for.  But, I am being told by someone else who went through BC, that I should get a 2nd opinion, new mammagram, everything.  I agree, as surgery would be the only \"treatment\".  What do you all think?  2nd opinion good?
