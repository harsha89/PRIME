Surgery on the 1st went well but I was in hospital for 3.5 days due to uncontrolled nausea...they tried everything but I couldn't keep stuff down. They took 2 nodes and initial look is good but I should have full pathology back early next week. Pain is there but one Vicodin every 4 hours is helping and I'm still taking nausea meds. Drains are draining and I'm glad to be on the other side of this. Have a lot of support so I'm feeling very blessed",

My only issue now is that I haven't had a bowel movement since 07/31 but I actually don't feel bad- but I am working on resolution!
