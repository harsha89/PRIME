Because of the size of my tumor, all technicians and nurses I saw kept assuming I would do Mx and they almost had me convinced. My BS was very emphatic that it was not necessary. She could do partial mastectomy as long as I was willing to have smaller breasts. Knowing, that I could always opt for Mx later, I went with the partial mx and reconstruction on right and reduction on left. Very happy with result (today is 3 weeks post op). My sentinel node was positive, so I opted for axillary dissection (0/13 nodes). I'm still recovering from that. I start 16 weeks of chemo on 11/19. Best wishes with your treatment! Kathy",
