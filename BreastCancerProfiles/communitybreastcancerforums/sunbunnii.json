PLEASE!!!  I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in 1984 at the ge of 18.  I was treated with radiation therapy only ... My life time dose.  No recurrent issues until April of 2011 when I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast.  After many many prayers and tears, I opted for a Lumpectomy with no radiation being that I cannot have anymore due to receiving my lif-time dose in 1984.  The surgeon did NOT get clean margins so wwe had to go for a 2nd lumpectomy.  This time ... clean margins were reached.  I was to be followed-up every 6 months. I went December 2011 for follow-up mammogram and there was indeed a spot that was suspicious but the radiologist marked the sheet of paper to say \"most probably benign ... follow-up in six months\".  Now looking back and knowing my history ... I wished I had demanded further checking at that time ... But, I didn't. This brings us to now ... June 13 follow-up mammogram #2 ... showed 'abnormal'.  They immediately got more magnified views.  They warranted a core biopsy.  The cor biopsy came back as DCIS again basically in the same area as in 2011.  My breast surgeon and the cancer board discussed my unique case and came to the decision that a mastectomy is highly recommended due to my having a VERY HIGH chance of getting another cancer of the breast and the next time could very easily be a very agressive cancer rather than the DCIS which I have now.  Of course .. I am terrified and this is by no means what I want but ... feel that the chances are indeed of my getting a very agressive cancer that we could do nothing about.   Here is my issue now ... my breast surgeon is not very familiar with us Hodgkins Survivors and our mantle radiation.  I had HD in 1984 with my lifetime dose of radiation.  I want THE BEST to do my mastectomy and reconstruction but HAVE NO CLUE WHO TO GO TO!! My breast surgeon has me in with a Plastic Surgeon on July 3rd but I hear he is quite young and does not have that much experience with reconstruction. I am begging for your alls help as to what you would do????  I have called several Plastics docs and they do not take insurance only private pay .... Wonder what amount we are talking?? Have any of you dealt with this exact problem?  I would love to have a nipple and skin sparing surgery and then have the reconstruction at the same mastectomy surgersparing or nipple sparing???  Then I wonder .. Is this all going to be an un-Godly amount of surgery time (hours)??? I know that a lot of Hodgkins survivors have gone to follow-up clinics (ex: Dr. Steven Hancock at Stanford and I think I remember another late effects clinic in Ohio??  Regardless ... how do i go about finding the PERFECT pair of doctors to work on me??  I am SO confused and have so much on my plate that I don't even know which way to turn. Any and all suggestions and recommendations will be GREATLY appreciated.  I am 46 years old ... was 18 when I had the HD and radiation.  I am sooo very scared and don't know what to do ... other than take the high recommendation to go the double mast. route.  I live in Knoxville, Tennessee ... I would love to not have to travel BUT if that is what is recommended and have done so yourselves ... I'm all in.  I just want a good recovery and excellent reconstructive results. PLEASE HELP ME ... I AM terrified!!!  Thanks so much and I love you ALL for being here on this list exactly for these situations!!!  I look SOOO forward to hearing some responses.   HD IIA - 1984 Tachycardia Asthma DCIS right breast April 2011 DCIS right breast June 2012 Edited by Mods to remove personal information.",
