I had my first TCHP infusion on Tuesday, so this is day 4. I have been doing really well! My major side effect has been indigestion and no appetite. I have been taking Zofran every 8 hours round the clock until today as a prophylactic to nausea. My doctor advised that, as he said that if you get nauseated in the first round, you usually predisposed yourself to get nauseated from there on out. Zofran does constipate, so you have to be careful about that. Today, being the first day without the Zofran, I had some diarrhea which I understand is a side effect of the Perjeta. I took the Claritin the day before chemo the day of chemo and took my last dose yesterday. I have had some aches but am used to it as I have bad joints and arthritis to start with. I and keeping Motrin in my system as I have bad joints and arthritis anyway. I find if I am not keeping food in my stomach, I feel badly. I normally love sweets but can't stand anything sweet now. I can't even put jelly on my toast! I'm not complaining, it's probably a good thing! So I am experimenting, trying to find food that sustains me as I have no expectation that it's going to taste good. I'm taking Zantac twice a day but still have this indigestion. I'm definitely going to talk to the doctor on my appointment next week about the indigestion and see if he has any suggestions. I've been drinking water constantly and I think that has really helped as well. I just don't feel like myself. Just strange. I know that each of you understands. We're going to have to find a new normal. I was on a steroid high for two days and ended up doing too much. Yesterday, day 3, I paid for it. Didn't feel well all day. I am much better today. Any suggestions on indigestion and foods to try would be much appreciated! Protein seems to be the best and stays with me the most. I am so blessed bye each of you!",

Main side effects up until yesterday have been the jittery, buzzy, can't keep my thoughts straight in my head. I couldn't sit still and went non-stop throughout the days doing things. Then yesterday, I slept until 11:30 in the morning, got up and stayed up 7 hours, went back to bed and slept 11 more hours. Yesterday my son took me out to visit some friends and then for a ride and then to the grocery. It wore me out in a good way. I woke up this morning with a clear head. The diarrhea hasn't started yet but it did last round about this time. I took nausea medicine the last 5 days Every six to eight hours. Food, of course, has no taste. I've been eating very light but yesterday had a 6-inch turkey sub from Subway. Didn't want the cheese and lettuce so just had the meat and the bread and some potato chips. For some reason, anything potatoes really taste good to me. French fries are something I'm craving now. Also, ice cream tastes wonderful and I can even taste the vanilla. I wonder if I am hungry as I need something on my stomach those first five days every 2 to 3 hours. I don't know if I should be forcing myself to eat more or not. For those of you with the dry mouth, I got Xylimelts on Amazon and they work great. They were a suggestion somewhere on this site. It says to put 2 in your mouth when you go to bed but I have only been using one. I have a question about vitamins. I have always taken a multivitamin and 1000 mg of vitamin C every day. I asked my oncologist about it and he said it was fine although I read on here not to take vitamins. Can anyone give me some advice please? Reading all of your posts encourages me and helps me to pray for us and to be thankful for how well many of us are doing. Thanks to everyone for posting and encouraging us! ",

      "Content": "May 26, 2017 06:45AM Upheld wrote: I went to Chapel Hill yesterday where the Lineberger Breast Center is located. This hospitals is renowned for breast cancer treatment. I say that so that you will know where the following information came from. I met with a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist. They had all reviewed my case, including the original pathology slides and the actual test themselves, not just the reports. They then had a plan before I met with each of them individually. It was a wonderful experience. I'd like to share some things that I learned in the hopes that it may help someone else. I see above a lot of conversation about projeta. The plan for me was to be on Herceptin alone for a total of a year. That would include the time that I receive it during the next four months while I get my chemo. The Perjeta is a drug that has, according to the medical board joy there, revolutionized the treatment outcomes for patients with triple positive cancers. In fact, there will be a paper presented at the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncologists) conference covering all of the trials and results as well as recommendations for this drug. He advised that I should add the Prejeta to the Herceptin and take both for one year. I asked him about whether or not to take the Zofran prophylactically or just wait until I had symptoms. He told me to take it immediately after I get home, every eight hours. He said that it won't hurt me, except for constipation, and that psychologically, it's better to head off the nausea then go through it one time and then fear having it at every treatment. He said that patients on my regimen, TCHP, typically get diarrhea or constipation. For the diarrhea, he said to take two tablets at the first episode, not one. . He said to take one tablet after each loose stool until the diarrhea abate's. So a positive from the Zofran is that the constipation side effect may be helped with the diarrhea. If constipation is an issue, he says that Power Pudding is the key. There are recipes you can find for it on Google. You mix up a batch and put it in the refrigerator. Every morning, you take 2 tablespoons. He and his nurse swear by it. I discussed icing with him with him during Taxetere. The clinical name for neuropathy is CIPN ( chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy) you can use that acronym and impress your doc! Anyway, if you Google it you will find clinical information and trials that have been completed regarding icing and Taxotere. I asked him about taking vitamin B6 and he said that there has not been any evidence showing that it helps to prevent or improve neuropathy. He said that he does encourage his patients to ice their feet and hands as there are no side effects and if it is effective, it would be well worth it. The radiation oncologist felt strongly that any breast reconstruction or work after the mastectomy should be put off until after radiation is completed. She said the goal is for a cure and you do not want anything making it difficult for the radiation to be effective. On the other hand, radiated skin is harder for a plastic surgeon to work with. Personal choice. When I asked what the 3 most important things to do during chemo, they said to drink a minimum of 100 oz of water a day, keep moving, and make sure you are getting your rest. They talked about exercising in some way every day. That it also really makes a difference with neuropathy. They also stressed speaking up with any side effects or any issues. I have a hard time asking for help or bothering anyone, but this is not the time to be quiet! The rest of the info I got pertained specifically to my case. I hope this information will help someone else!",

You need to keep moving both and your feet do not get the workout that your hands do in the way of movement. So a foot massage every night and covering your feet with a heavy cream and putting them into socks will help. You can also put your hands in cream and put them in gloves at night. She also said to cover your entire body with lotion as chemo really dries out and affects the skin. I like Eucerin because it's thick and it stays on. All the fruity and sweet smelling lotions are not heavy duty enough for this. I put OPI nail Polish on my fingernails and nail Polish on my toes like usual.",

I go from constipation to diarrhea to indigestion to acid reflux. I'm just trying to find what will work. A couple of things I think are important is keeping food on my stomach and balancing Imodium with Zofran. Yesterday, for example, I had eggs and toast, chicken and noodles, cheese and crackers. All went down and felt great. I wanted something cold and creamy. I tried a popsicle but it was too tart. I tried a little bit of vanilla ice cream and it tasted good. So I waited a while and tried yogurt with strawberries and blueberries. I've been eating that for the last couple days with no problem. Boy did it set off my stomach! I felt nauseated, I think it's not acid, and rumbly and burpee. I had three episodes of bad diarrhea and took Imodium after them. But t in the evening, I took some zofran. I don't know quite how to get a handle on this.",

I took Zofran the first 3 Days Every 8 hours, setting my alarm in the middle of the night to not miss a dose. Because Zofran constipates and I naturally run towards constipation, I decided to stop taking it. I still can't determine if what I'm experiencing is nausea or some other stomach upset. I never get sick on my stomach. So this is all new for me. I did have acid reflux prior to this but it was untreated. So I'm trying to figure all this out. When I stop the Zofran, I then had diarrhea. So now I've decided to go back on the Zofran every 8 hours starting today to see if that helps things. It's all so much trial-and-error, isn't it? Nothing sour or sweet tastes good to me and both give me stomach upset. I have to eat bland food only. On another note, today is the first day that I could say I felt noticeable fatigue. I'm doing things around the house and then stop and sit down for a while and get back up. But I'm still tired. This is day 6 for me",

      "Content": "May 26, 2017 07:54AM Upheld wrote: I went to Chapel Hill yesterday where the Lineberger Breast Center is located. This hospitals is renowned for breast cancer treatment. I say that so that you will know where the following information came from. I met with a surgeon, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist. They had all reviewed my case, including the original pathology slides and the actual test themselves, not just the reports. They then had a plan before I met with each of them individually. It was a wonderful experience. I'd like to share some things that I learned in the hopes that it may help someone else. I see above a lot of conversation about projeta. The plan for me was to be on Herceptin alone for a total of a year. That would include the time that I receive it during the next four months while I get my chemo. The Perjeta is a drug that has, according to the medical board joy there, revolutionized the treatment outcomes for patients with triple positive cancers. In fact, there will be a paper presented at the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncologists) conference covering all of the trials and results as well as recommendations for this drug. He advised that I should add the Prejeta to the Herceptin and take both for one year. I asked him about whether or not to take the Zofran prophylactically or just wait until I had symptoms. He told me to take it immediately after I get home, every eight hours. He said that it won't hurt me, except for constipation, and that psychologically, it's better to head off the nausea then go through it one time and then fear having it at every treatment. He said that patients on my regimen, TCHP, typically get diarrhea or constipation. For the diarrhea, he said to take two tablets at the first episode, not one. . He said to take one tablet after each loose stool until the diarrhea abate's. So a positive from the Zofran is that the constipation side effect may be helped with the diarrhea. If constipation is an issue, he says that Power Pudding is the key. There are recipes you can find for it on Google. You mix up a batch and put it in the refrigerator. Every morning, you take 2 tablespoons. He and his nurse swear by it. I discussed icing with him with him during Taxetere. The clinical name for neuropathy is CIPN ( chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy) you can use that acronym and impress your doc! Anyway, if you Google it you will find clinical information and trials that have been completed regarding icing and Taxotere. I asked him about taking vitamin B6 and he said that there has not been any evidence showing that it helps to prevent or improve neuropathy. He said that he does encourage his patients to ice their feet and hands as there are no side effects and if it is effective, it would be well worth it. The radiation oncologist felt strongly that any breast reconstruction or work after the mastectomy should be put off until after radiation is completed. She said the goal is for a cure and you do not want anything making it difficult for the radiation to be effective. On the other hand, radiated skin is harder for a plastic surgeon to work with. Personal choice. When I asked what the 3 most important things to do during chemo, they said to drink a minimum of 100 oz of water a day, keep moving, and make sure you are getting your rest. They talked about exercising in some way every day. That it also really makes a difference with neuropathy. They also stressed speaking up with any side effects or any issues. I have a hard time asking for help or bothering anyone, but this is not the time to be quiet! The rest of the info I got pertained specifically to my case. I hope this information will help someone else!",

On Wednesday, I go for a second opinion to bless the treatment plan my local oncologist has prescribed. I'm really excited about this visit, as I will meet individually with the surgeon, the radiation oncologist, and the medical oncologist. I've got a list of the hard questions for each one. I am stage 3C with a positive lymph node, multiple tumors in one breast and a spot on my sacram that lit up on the PET scan. I am triple positive. I am going to ask about prognosis and treatment I get a port placed on Thursday, then I work my 3 twelve hour shifts Friday - Sunday. My first chemo is scheduled for Tuesday May 30th. I am getting 6 cycles of treatment, once every 3 weeks for a total of 18 weeks I'm to receive Herceptin, Perjeta, Carboplatin, and Taxotere with a Neulasta shot.

I can't decide if it's the steroids, but I stop taking those on Wednesday evening, or if it's the Claritin for the neulasta that's interacting with the Zofran and Compazine that I alternate for nausea. I get up and do some things and then rest and then get up again. It's like I can't keep thoughts easily in my head without concentrating. Is anyone else experiencing the side effects?",

      "Content": "May 31, 2017 12:12PM Upheld wrote: hello June ladies! I have read back over everyone's posts and am so thankful to have each of us here. Isn't it amazing how there are bits and pieces in everyone's comments that can help someone else. So hopefully, this post will help those who are preparing for their first infusion. I am getting TCHP which is taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin, and perjeta. Then I am having the neulasta Pod placed at the end of the infusion. I had my first session today and everything went great! First they gave me my pre-meds, steroids and Zofran like med for nausea. Then it was on to the herceptin and projeta. I had a slight headache that went away after a little bit with these two. Then I had some indigestion where I was burping up stuff in my throat. I didn't want to say anything to the nurse because I have some acid issues anyway. But my friend urged me to say something. I did and she immediately called the doctor and got some Pepcid which she injected into my port. The indigestion went away almost immediately. So, lesson number one, you have to speak up with every little thing. They can't help you if they don't know you're having a problem. And nothing is a little thing.... Then it was on to the tax here. I iced my hands and feet for 15 minutes before the infusion during the entire fusion and 15 minutes after. For my feet, I placed a ziplock sandwich bag full of ice on top of my toes and underneath my toes. I wore a pair of socks which I cut off leaving my toes exposed so the rest of my foot might be a little warmer. On top of the sandwich bags I placed a quart sized baggy and then taped around my ankle so the bag would hold on. My hands, I found some Rachael Ray hot pads with silicone on the back side at Walmart. They're the kind of hot pads that have an opening on top that you slide your hand into. It worked perfect! Again, I filled two sandwich bags with ice. I put the bags into the hot pad and then plunged my hands down into the pad wedging my fingers between the upper and lower ice bags. I then put the hot pads into a Ziploc gallon bag. I then filled my glass with ice chips and had my friend feed me the chips during the entire time. Obviously, this would not be possible without having a dear friend there doing all the work! So, what did we decide we would change next time? We think we left the ice in the baggies too long because when it became water, some of the baggies leaked because they weren't sealed tight as they were over filled with ice. So next time, we decided we would change out the bags quicker and maintain them with solid ice longer. Instead of using tape around the bags on the feet, we determined that we would use Ace bandages so that we could wrap and unwrap them while positioning the bags as we needed to. Also, the Ace bandages would allow us to more easily remove the bags for refilling. The ice in the mouth process worked fine. While it was certainly cold, I had no problem diverting my mind away. I had no pain at all when they accessed the port. Before I left home, I rubbed in a good size pea of Emla cream and then covered it with Glad Press and Seal because you don't have to use tape to keep it on. The nurse sprayed it with numbing spray which she said would sting. I didn't feel anything. I drank water the whole time I was there. I had a snack of crackers and A friend brought lunch, but I could only eat a half of it. I wasn't sick on my stomach, I just wasn't hungry. I had a warm soft comfy blanket I snuggled in. They brought me warm blankets to put over my feet when I was icing I'm keeping a journal of how I feel, what my blood counts were before I started the chemo today, how I feel, what medicine I took, and anything else pertinent. I'll be able to look back at it when I start the second round, knowing what happened the first time. I will also have a record should I need to tell the doctor anything. I took Claritin the day before my chemo today and will for the next three days. The neulasta Pod was placed on my stomach instead of the back of my arm at my suggestion. The nurse said that was a great idea if people bump their arm and it bothers them. Also, if you lay on your side when you sleep it would be awkward. The neulasta injects 27 hours after it is put on. I am planning to take Motrin every 4 to 6 hours as well as the Claritin to head off any bone pain. Tonight I just feel strange. I made dinner for my family and washed the dishes. I ate a very small plate of spaghetti but my taste buds were definitely off. The best way I can describe it is that it just tasted Bland with very little flavor. My head is a little swimmy and I'm a little shaky which I attribute to the steroids. I hate that I have to take steroids again tomorrow but know know it's all for a purpose. In addition, when I got home I took Zofran. I am going to take it every 8 hours for the next couple of days, including setting my alarm at night to not miss a dose. The doctor highly recommended it as even if I might not get sick without it, if I did get sick I would then be predisposed to get sick at every infusion because I would have the fear and the thought in my mind that I was going to be sick. So taking the Zofran prophylactically is a great idea. The only side effect to the Zofran is constipation. But I'm waiting to see if this perjeta causes diarrhea like they say that it does. I'm off to bed! I hope this has been helpful and don't hesitate to ask any more questions should you need to. Prayers for everyone in the coming days! ",

I find if I get enough sleep, it helps immensely. I'm not having any trouble sleeping, but I just have to go back to bed after I see my husband and son off in the morning. I get up early with them and then go back to bed for 3 more hours. If I don't do that or if I do too much I get really fatigued and feel badly. I have finally figured out that what I have been experiencing is nausea more than indigestion or reflux. I started taking Zofran alternating with Compazine every 4 to 6 hours while I'm awake. All of the burping and full feeling have gone away. I was able to eat very well once I started that. The problem has been horrible diarrhea. Is anyone else experiencing that? I think it is from the Prejeta? It hits about an hour after I eat anything. I know I should probably consistently try the Imodium but I hate taking all of these medications. I know, I know. That sounds ridiculous given all the drugs for having pumped into our bodies. I want to go back to work next Friday. As that is day 17, I'm guessing my hair would have already started coming out. Can anyone tell me when there's came out or if it is starting to come out at this point? I so enjoy reading everyone's posts and the encouragement that everyone gives each other. I pray for each of you, to have good days ahead.",

Today, I went and got my hair buzzed off as it was falling out in pieces. Thankfully, it just started falling out yesterday and I had planned to do it today. As you can see from my picture, hair is a pretty major thing for me. So, with lots of prayer, I was able to do it, but it sure was a tiring day. My next chemo is on Tuesday, it is my second TCHP infusion. I'm glad I kept a journal, so we'll see how closely this second round mimics the first. Praying for each of you!",

If you rock the bald head, a scarf, a hat, or a wig - whatever you choose - people are going to respond to your presentation. I have decided not to wear a wig for a few reasons. One, it is summer and it will be hot and uncomfortable. Another is that my hair is my most distinctive feature. People are going to obviously know it's a wig. Ask for strangers, I really don't care what they think. I will smile and be pleasant and friendly. And I am sure they will respond in kind. Finally, I don't want people looking at me thinking what the hell is on her head instead of focusing on talking to me.",

Today, on top of the intestinal issues I've been having, I suddenly felt as if I've been hit by a mack truck. Like I have the flu or something. Have not felt like this up until this point. What has week two been like for you? I receive my treatments once every 3 weeks.",
