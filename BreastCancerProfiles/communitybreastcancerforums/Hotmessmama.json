Over the last couple months, the drainage has continued, I have had nipple changes, and now I have a significant amount of pain. All of my lab work has been normal. Today I had an ultrasound, but she only screened 1/4 of my breast. After the ultrasound, the radiologist told me it was completely normal, and nothing wrong. He basically told me to suck it up, but that he recommends a MRI if symptoms don't resolve in a couple months. I guess I'm wondering if I should request the MRI sooner, wait 2 months, or just forget the whole thing all together. Although I'm concerned, the ultrasound tech and radiologist made me feel completely stupid. Log in to post a reply",
