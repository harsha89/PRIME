I am 37 and was diagnosed in August with BC and then learned weeks later I was BRCA 1 positive. My mom & 2 sisters were tested in October and one of my sisters and my mom tested positive too. My mom had BC 16 years ago and had a unilateral mastectomy & chemo. I had a bilateral mastectomy in Sept with one step implants and am currently on my 12th round of chemo out of 16 rounds. My sister (32) decided to get the BMX when I am done with my chemo after seeing what I have been going through. She began pre-tests in Nov and first had a clean mammo. Then she had breast MRI which showed 6! suspicious areas. My breast surgeon met with her immediately and told her she needed a biopsy & should bump up her BMX. She went for a biopsy, but panicked during it and couldn't go through with the procedure so we had to wait until pathology report after BMX to know if she too had cancer. Waiting 6 weeks for her surgery was absolute torture, but she had it 11 days ago and her pathology report came back all benign! My mom has been told she needs to remove her one breast too, but had a heart attack 2 years ago so they don't know if she could handle the surgery. Needless to say this whole BRCA thing has been a nightmare, but having actual cancer is even worse. I would never want to live my life knowing I had a 80%+ chance of getting it and just get monitored every few months. If someone had tested me (and my family) 16 years ago when my mom was diagnosed, I would have opted for the BMX and maybe spared myself what I am going through now. The BMX was hard, but it's nothing compared to chemo. Obviously this is just my experience and only you know what's right for you, but for those of you that want kids, or have children and lost moms, sisters, etc., to this disease, please consider my experience. Also, for those of you that want kids or more kids, once you are diagnosed with cancer and have to have chemo, chemo kills your eggs. It is unknown how many eggs are destroyed and while some women do get pregnant after chemo, many don't. In addition, once you are told you need chemo everything happens so fast and if you want to freeze eggs (expensive) that has to be decided quickly because it takes weeks. I didn't even have the chance to get into all that beforehand. Now I am experiencing hot flashes and night sweats and haven't had my period since I started chemo, so I am probably going through pre-menopause which means it's highly likely no kids for me. Also, I will have to get my ovaries out soon too, which is certain infertility. Just wanted to give you things to think about that some docs may not explain. It really stinks to have to think of all these things, but unfortunately it's the BRCA reality. I wish you all luck with your decision making, recoveries, etc. ",
