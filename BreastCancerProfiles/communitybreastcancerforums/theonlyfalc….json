I had no idea women were getting that many biopsy's, or that cancer was present for that long before detection. The only thing I know about my first biopsy is that it was a lump, not a cyst. When I asked the surgeon how big it was he gave me some weird answer about it being a lumpy mess. I have already told my doctors office I will find my own surgeon, if I need one.  I am really tired of hearing that I have dense breast. When I got my breast exam last week the doctor pretty much gave up. Didn't even do a full exam. The last time I went through this I had a mammo and ultra sound, heard the same thing your breast are to dense to see anything. How is it that they don't have a way to see through dense breast? When do you start requesting an MRI?  I know they are expensive, but isn't it cheaper and safer than surgery? Cestovatela  Thanks for your response as well. Glad to hear your lump was B9. I didn't want to put anything off, but like you sometimes it can't be helped.  I am more frustrated with all of this more than anything. I don't like waiting for test results, or waiting to see what to do next. I have decided to open my mouth more, and get the answers I need instead of sitting by quitely and just letting things happen. Thanks for letting me ask questions and vent!!!",

I really wasn't expecting anything to show up because I have \"dense breasts\". The last time I went through this I had a mammo and ultra sound, and they couldn't find the lumps either way. So they did a biopsy. It came back b9, that was two years ago. The surgeon said we would just keep an eye on the two lumps in my left breast. Due to no insurance for the past two years, I am just now having it \"looked at\". So I look to you guys for advise. Do I just be happy about the results and wait a year for another mammo? Should I head back to the doctors office? I know for a fact that there are 3 lumps now in my left breast, the 3rd one is deep against the chest wall and seems to be ignored by the doctors. When I went for this last visit she said I was just to hard to examine, so she didn't even look for that one. I feel like I am just being paranoid, but my gut is telling me something is wrong. Everyone is telling me to just be happy and forget about, except my boyfriend, he is telling me to do what I think is right. His father has terminal brain cancer, and was miss diagnosed the first two trips to the doctors. I am waiting to see what you guys think before I do anything. So lots of advice needed here!!!! Thanks you guys are just wonderful!!!!",

I need back up!!! lol Weird thing happened yesterday. I received a letter two days ago from the breast center that everything was normal, and the reports were sent to my doctors office with his name listed. Yesterday I received another letter with only one sentence saying results are in and were sent to your doctor, no name. I checked the dates and the second one is dated after the first one. I would understand a duplicate letter, making sure I get it. But I found that second letter odd. They should not do odd things like that. We are women don't they know we read more into things like that than we should!!! lol I hope everyone has a pleasant weekend. Do one thing for yourself this weekend, you desever it!!",
