The ultrasound control found the tumor size increased from 2.2 to 2.8cm. I can't tell any change by touching it. The doctor wasn't sure and I had MRI done and waiting for the results to come tomorrow. I am very scared now. I am facing the decision if the tumor is still growing under chemo. The doctor mentioned changing chemo regimens.  Please give me some suggestion.",

I will talk with the doctor next Monday for the surgery plan.  But since I didn't have node biopsy before chemo, she thinks the SNB during surgery is not sufficient indication for the other nodes' involvement. They will have to remove all the level 1 and level 2 lymph nodes. I am really shocked by that. Can I say that my doctor made a mistake by doing chemo without SNB? Did everyone here all have done SNB before chemo starting?",

But when I saw my hair falling crazy in the shower, I was very sad and almost crying. I don't want to shave them. But no idea how long it will take to finish. It is also very messy in my house and my hair is everywhere. Is there any advise to avoid the mess or an easy way to clean up the mess?",

      "Content": "Dec 2, 2011 01:35AM - edited Dec 2, 2011 01:39AM by susangermany Thank you, Tammy, for your advice about not overdone exercise. 9 days after the first TAC chemo, I feel better and better. Had my first blood control on 7th day and got call from doctor yesterday and told me the white blood cell was very low. They'd like to test again. The second test result has a big jump from 1.75/nl to 6.92/nl, which is even higher than my white blood cell level before chemo. I couldn't understand, only one day how it can change this rapidly and dramatically. I had Neulasta shot 24h after chemo. I wonder if the Neulasta takes effect only after 5 days? Well, the bone and joint pain also disappeared after 5 days. I think exercise helps.  I had my port installed on Nov. 18th. Now I can move my arm freely, but still feels a little uncomfortable. The cut is recovering well, but feels still a little pain or itch from time to time. I guess it takes time. I have been feeling hungry all the time. But I tried not eat too much at once. After 9 days of the first chemo, I feel more hopeful and less scared and I believe everyone here can get it done and well done. Thank you everyone for the company in this difficult time! ",

I don't have surgery yet and had my first of the 6 TAC secions (3 weeks between each section) 1 week ago (Nov. 23rd). During the first 3 days, I felt really weak and tired. But didn't have nausea, vomiting or mouth sore. I don't sleep very well and wake up every a few hours. In general, it is better than I expected. Today, I had nose bleeding twice. But it stopped within 10 minutes. I tried to walk 1 hour per day when there is the sun or do a little streching at home. I am curious when my hair is going to fall.      ",
