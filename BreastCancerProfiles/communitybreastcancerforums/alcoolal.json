The dizziness is not caused by the anastrozole because I've been taking that since January and it only started up a couple of months ago. Also, what do you make of the unexplained fainting? And why would my reading go from 87 to 138 - that's a big jump, no? The bone pain is new.. it's just one spot on my arm.. it's not constant, it comes and goes, but it's not like the usual aches and pains I have had (many) in the past. My doc called yesterday and said I need a head ct, so I guess I'll start there. Thanks for any input. Happy Tuesday xx",

I had stage 1 er/pr+ Dec 2016. I had a low onco score (13) and did radiation and then started tamoxifen. Did that for 5 months and it messed with the ovaries, so they came out October 2017. Started Anastrazole Jan 2018. I've been feeling off, complaining about a weird sensation in my left arm/leg, then I started having these weird dizzy moments and more recently I feel like I have this bone pain in my right arm; then last week I fainted without any warning. My doc was out, so I saw this other guy and he looked me over and said I seemed fine, ordered blood work, told me I couldn't drive for a month and said to check back in with my regular doctor then. He called a couple of days later to go over my blood work.. he says that my alkaline phosphatase is high (138) and that looking at my blood work history, he could see that it had climbed 20 points since my last blood draw at the onco two weeks previous. A year ago, it was 87, is this kind of climb normal? What are the typical numbers for bone mets (he said he did an additional test to check my liver and it is fine) my calcium was a 9.9 if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance!",
