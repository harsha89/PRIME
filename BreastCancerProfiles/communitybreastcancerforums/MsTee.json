I figure that since I'll not be allowed to use my ovaries for their intended purpose now (which sucks, btw, shouldn't have waited to have kids!) and they are my biggest estrogen factories, I want them out. Â  Can anybody speak to the relative merits of an ooph or a total hysterectomy?",

I can take a bit of time thinking it through, thanks to the Zoladex, but I'll likely do whatever my doctors recommend. I'm BRCA negative too, which reduces some of the urgency around the hysterectomy. CajunQueen - Thanks so much for the empathy, and good luck with your treatments, too!Â ",

They're not even showing on the scans anymore (if the rest of the mets/tumours would just follow suit!:) ) I kind of lost my taste for alcohol...which might just be me listening to my body and my liver saying nope. Since I'm on a trial I have to really limit supplements. I switched from predominantly oral painkillers to a fentanyl patch (although I still use hydromorphone as a breakthrough). Never discount lots of water to flush the liver when you can't have things like milk thistle! :) ",

I'm coming up on 18 months. It has some issues but doesn't everything? Overall, pretty tolerable, just digestive issues, mostly. Rapid bowel transit, bad stomach...not unbearable I just had to pause for rads because I've had some lymph node growth (to an existing tumour), but no spreading since I started the trial. I restart in a couple days.",
