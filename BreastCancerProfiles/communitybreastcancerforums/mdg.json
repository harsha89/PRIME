As far as cold caps.....many doctors are simply uneducated about them because they don't care. Many doctors won't allow people to use them but like everything else in this process it is YOUR choice. I would go to another oncologist. If you are interested in using cold caps there are several offices and hospitals that have freezers and do support cold cap use. I think there is a website that shows which locations have freezers but I can't remember what website it is. Someone on the cold cap thread may be able to tell you. Good luck!",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

SueBee:  the chicken sounds sooooo good.  Another thing to do for seasoning is take your herbs and put them in the food processor with garlic, a little onion, salt, pepper and olive oil.   It will make a paste kind of like pesto texture.  Stuff it under the skin in the bird....now the meat will get all the flavor...I have even added lemon juice to it before too.  Then when you peel the skin there is still some of the herb mixture on the chicken...it tastes so good too!  The fill went good.  I am now 510cc's!  OMG!  THey are huge!  I am so glad I will be smaller after the exchange...now I have ot hide them for then next few months as they are lopsided and noticeably bigger than my pre surgery small size B breasts.  My hubby is very intreagued.......help me!  Not feeling so sexy right now.  Supersally:  The hair is my little secret.  It's so odd when I went to have a fill today a different PA did it.  I mentioned chemo and she said, \"when do you start that\".  I said \"I am almost done\".  SHe just looked at me...not sure what to say so she said nothing.  I said, \"yes, this is my own hair...there are ways to keep it now!\".  If she didn't know I was having chemo, she would have never guessed.  It is definately my little secret.  So glad you are feeling better!  I hope you had a good walk today. ",

Really it won't need to many tweaks to be a good choice based on the Anti Cancer guidelines.  I will get that on my list for the cooking blog for sure!  I am so glad you got moving.  I have been taking aleve when I get sore...it helps.  I also find that taking a hot bath/shower and then light stretching helps loosen me up on the day after workout if I am not up to working out or something....just an idea.  Sue Bee:  Way to go girl!  YOu are going to be pushing me now!  That's awesome!  It's amazing what exercise and a nice day does for you hu? Supersally:  I don't know how I have gotten by with no nausea.....I usually get sea sick very easy.  I also puke after any anesthesia for any type of procedure.  I have not taken any antinausea meds other than Ativan which is given on chemo day.  I have been pounding the water and not missing any workouts....I don't know how I have gotten so lucky with this.  I do get really hungry in the days following chemo though.  I have managed to stay busy and out of the house today so I did not go nuts eating.  This morning I had home made whole grain and buckwheat pancakes.  Snack handful of almonds.  Lunch garlic and olive oil infused whole wheat orzo topped with organic green beans.  I have been trying to eat more veggies at lunch...I make extra at dinner and reheat them for lunch.  I hope the stomach lasts OK.  Last night I chowed on a huge bowl of popcorn....OMG!  Someone stop me with the popcorn!  Although 3 cups of popcorn has a good serving of fiber!  I pop it in EVOO so it's healthy and add a few dashes of salt.  I make  huge bowl so I have some left for a day or two - if I can keep my 4 year old away from it!  I hope you are nausea free and feeling good.  I know this last round made you feel bad..... :(  I am glad you are going to workout tonight.  YOu will feel better...I promise!!! Annie:  soup is my favorite...if you were closer I would be on my way over for a bowl and a tupperware to take home!  Glad you got in that workout!  You ladies amaze me!!!! You are all inspiring me....I do want to do this food blog....I am going to find a way to get this going and my hubby is going to help!  This will be fun! ",

Don't freak out on the Chick Fil A.  It's so hard to stick to the real diet when other people get involved.  I always try to suggest Chipoltle when we are out because at least they are organic and use hormone free meats.  It's not always available though.  You will do the best you can.  As far as the burn...you could tell people that your arm and your head were the only two things burned...no one would think you have BC.  I think if you want to have a true Michael Jackson glove you would have to add a sparkly glove over the bandaged hand and dangle a baby with it as you keep your arm up in the air (ha ha!).  The meatloaf was pretty good surprisingly! Annie:  Thanks but have always not liked the frizz/wave in the hair.  My sister got blessed with dad's nice curls.  I got the frizz mess.  Yes, the grass is always greener.  How is your hair?  Hanging in OK?  Aren't you almost done with chemo now?  I know what you mean about coming up with dinner ideas...especially on last minute nights.  I have been known to keep a jar of organic sauce in the pantry for emergencies (don't tell my mom.....as we are Italian this would be known as a mortal sin!!!!  Jarred sauce...big NO NO!).  Breakfast for dinner is always another last minute option...eggs and pancakes.  Interesting on your PS.  Mine makes me over stretch to place in a smaller implant, not larger.  I am 510cc's now and will get a 450 cc imlant.  Rennasus:  I LOVE brisket.  Eventhough we are 100% Italian, my mom makes a mean brisket!  She had a jewish neighbor when she first got married who shared her brisket secrets.  I have not had it for a long time but may have to splurge on some good, grass fed, organic brisket for a treat.  Things are still not healing?  Ugh!  How frustrating....here is an article I found on healing:  http://www.livestrong.com/article/32778-foods-skin-heal/   Maybe it will help....Keep us posted.  I am off to the gym this morning then grocery shopping (probably two markets....I can never get everything organic that I need at one market these days).  The snow has melted but it's gray and cold here.   I guess I won't need my sunglasses today.....",

I was going to mention the impotance of weight training. When you lift weights you will increase the amount of lean muscle on your body.  Muscle burns more calories than fat does - even when you are resting because it takes more calories to sustain itself than fat does.  Another thing to think about is that fat cells produce more estrogen (that matter for us that are ER/PR+).  So if you can reduce fat on your body by adding muscle mass you are doing yourself a favor.  In addition weight training helps maintain bone density which is also a potential issue if you have to be on meds to block estrogen.  So I guess what I am saying ladies is try to make weight training part of your workout at least three times a week and push yourself to lift a little heavier weights to challenge your muscles.  For me right now I am doing lower body weight training and limited upper body only because of my port in the arm which is uncomfortable at times.  I plan to make sure I lift weights 3x a week. If you are pressed for time and want cardio and weights you can do 30 min of interval training (cardio where you alternate a high and moderate intensity at a ratio of 3 min moderate intensity and 1 minute of higher intensity - you can do this on any equipment - bike, elliptical, treadmill, etc...) and then do 30 min of weight training.  To keep moving during weight training and get it done, I alternate upper body and lower body exercises  so I don't have to do the \"rest time\" in between sets.  Do a set of lunges and then pick up some dumbells and do shoulders while your legs rest and then repeat both.  Another thing you can do is circiut training...alternate high intense weight training exercises and some cardio and get it all done in an hour.  I hope this gives you something else to think about.  Also in general you lose 3-8% of lean muscle mass per decade after age 30.....it's going unless you do something to keep it ladies.  Let me know your thoughts on this.... Annie you are a rock star girl!!!! Hugs!  Woo hoo! Rennasus:  I have seen that blog.  It's good.  I am working on my blog just so you know!  I have had some editing trouble and have not had time to sort it out yet.  I do have it in the works though and it will all be cooking and articles relative to the Anti Cancer book principles.  I am even putting the best food finds I have found that meet the criteria for convenience foods and snacks.  It's so hard to find anything that meets the rules but I have found some things.  I am also going to discuss organic shopping and the best finds by price and store.  I hope all of this will make it easier for people trying to improve their eating.  Oh and I have a fab low sugar brownie recipe to put on there for you all to enjoy! Even my son love them! Have a great day gals.   Keep movin and think about weight training.......seriously!",

I just feel bad that this is not working well for you.....hugs!  Min:  No - you are not doing anything wrong!  My port is in my arm near my bicep and I feel pulling in my veins when I extend my arm.  That is why I have chosen not to do any arm things.  It feels uncomfortable...so I am a bit limited.  Hopefully they won't make me keep this dang port in long after I am done next week...I want it out!!!!  I also have a PS that does not want me to do much with my upper body since I have TE in and have more surgery in June. Supersally:  I have found some hummus with no tahini but they use other bad oils instead.  I have checked whole foods and trader joe's with no luck. I am going to experiment with Italian white bean type hummus and see what I can come up with.  The deodorant I am using is by Bubble and Bee and you can order online.  It is Pitt Putty.  It works well and is natural.  Just don't take it anywhere warm...it will crumble.  I forgot that and took it to the pool last week and it crumbled because the locker room was really warm.   Seeing the big wedding will get me all choked up again about Diana being gone....I cried and watched the whole funeral......what a shame. The fritatta sounds so good.  I love asparagus!! Suebee:  I will look at whole foods.  I did check the regular market but they had nothing without the bad oil.  I am ok with canola or EVOO.  Those are the only two oils I really want to have.  I have tried to eliminate safflower, sunflower, corn and soybean oil since they are all on the bad list for Anti Cancer diet.  It's hard!!",

The job in Amsterdam wants him to come there for a face to face interview...he's in Kansas City next week and will hear back on Austin next week.  Yikes!  Life is nuts right now.  I am busy checking out the cost of living, school systems, cancer centers and stuff like that to see if we should even consider some of these.  That's a full time job! Suebee:  It is still cold here today...gray and icky!  I want spring back!  It is definately easier to hide the strange boob reconstruction issues under layers.  I am sure my aerobics class thinks I just got a bad boob job (since the TE's are so ugly and uneven).  Supersally:  Guess what?  DH is interviewing for a job in Austin.  I may be TX bound!  Yikes!  I guess I can escape the nasty winters here but be super hot in the summer hu?  So glad you are done this week.....you have me smiling on that!  I still have boob greed too...keep wondering should I do another fill?  Talked myself out of anymore...I am done!  Whatever will be - will be, right?  I can't tell by looking at them anymore..... I am glad you don't have an infection though.  I have not had any tightness in my TE's anymore...keep on the stretching and maybe it will help.  When will you have exchange?  I had to wait 6 weeks post chemo. Melanie:  Yippy! You are done with chemo today!  That's great.  Glad you went on the retreat.  I hope it gave you renewed spiritual strength as it certainly drain going through all of this.  I also hope you are rested from that.....with steroids on board it may be a few days. The mammo sounds painful...I never have to get another one since my breasts are gone.  Won't miss that much........Let us know how you feel.  I wish I could bring you a big bowl of Italian Wedding Soup..that was my favorite in the days following chemo.  Hugs! Redsky:  Sometimes I think it would be easier if everyone knew so I would not have to continue \"acting\" like everything is normal.  I am not a good actress but feel exhausted from keeping the secret and acting all the time.  How is the tightness in the chest? Any better?  I hope so. ",

SubBee:  I don't know why no pizza places have wheat crust....I guess if you are going to eat pizza most people don't want it healthy at all....  I am glad you zumba'd.  Good for you.  The fluffing must be getting hard.  Can you buy some padding from the fabric store that you would use in a bathing suit or something?   I don't know how you \"fluff\".....I haven't had to.  A baggy T shirt may help you feel less obvious.   I will look into the photo posting next week.  I have not been on the photo forum in a while.  I think you are right...a few of us are the same size so it may help to see how things look and compare notes.  Thanks. Redsky:  We have similar body sizes. I will try to post photos next week and you can look.  I have a 350 cc TE in right now that is over filled to 510cc's.   That should give you a good idea....just ignore the fact that one of my TE's is 1 inch higher than the other and will be corrected in exchange.  Mine are firm but with the stretching they are not tight at all.  They really don't bother me other than how they look.  I will let you know when I post photos so you can look.    I will also look at yours and see if that is how mine looked at that point.  I do have photos for most of my various fills except the last two I think.  Supersally:  I am so glad you are done!  Eventhough you are in a fog, it will be the last time girl!  Enjoy having your mom there..that's great!  THe job search is going OK.  The Austin job didn't work out...still pushing forward on Amsterdam and Kansas City (what a difference between those two cities!).  Just think ladies...if we wind up in Amsterdam, you will have somewhere nice to visit with a guest room (free rent!) for a vacation!  Wouldn't that be fun to actually finally meet up - especially somewhere so cool?  I told DH that we MUST have a guest room for sure so people can come and enjoy Amsterdam with us!  Renn:  I am so glad you forgot about BC for the weekend.  I hope to do the same next weekend in Chicago.  That darn incision...what are we going to do with that??? I hope it heals up.  Goodness it has been a real pain hasn't it?  How is it today?  I hope drying out.....keep us posted.  Soooo cool you won money in Vegas.  What was your game of choice?  I am a roulette gal when I gamble.  I love it!",

Try to keep stretching....twice a day.  I do believe it will help.  Suebee:  How is your fill pain today?  Better I hope!  I guess I won't complain at all about how my PS handled my scheduling compared to your military situation.  You are truly at their mercy....at least it is covered.  I hope it all works out well for you in the end.  So I am laughing at all of you and the boob greed.  I told my DH about our boob greed conversation last night and then confessed that I had the largest boobs in the group too!  He really thought that was funny and was shocked I was the biggest one with the most boob greed!  LOL!  Workout and eat healthy today ladies....every day makes a difference!",

Her picky 3 year old (does not eat anything) even liked them!  Too funny!  My son loves them and was telling them \"mommy makes good brownies...I love them...they are soooo good\".  Oh how I love my son.  I did NOT workout all weekend and ate way too much.  I teach class tomorrow night so they are going to get worked hard!  Shannon:  I hope your energy level picks back up...I just started tamoxifen and hope my energy does not go down!  How long have you been on it?  I think you should keep moving...I know during chemo I felt better exercising - and on the days I didn't I was way more tired.  Keep moving!  You have to! Suebee:  I love how much we all talk about our boobs!  We talk about boobs more than men do these days (LOL!).  I can't beleive I will have surgery in 2 1/2 weeks too....gosh I hope the implants turn out OK.  I want to have faith I will love the results.....getting worried.  Oh and I bet you look stunning and people are jealous of your hot bod in Zumba!  You got it girl so you \"shake it\" when you are in there!  WIth your new boobs...you will be even hotter!  Just think of all the cute cleavage tops we can buy once we don't have ugly TE's anymore!!!  Shopping for everyone!  I LOVE the underconstruction sign...hilarous!  I am now worried about the 450cc implant being a double D!  I am suppose to get a 450 cc implant.....yikes!  Oh and I am dreading October...too much pink crap everywhere.  I don't need anymore reminders...I think about it all the time on my own thank you very much.  Maybe we should all go out of town together for the month of October....just an idea.  Somewhere without pink reminders....tropical would be good too!  I am also so sorry about your MIL.  Prayers are being said for your family.  So sorry.... Renn: I am sorry about BFF dad.  My BFF lost her mom 2 years ago....it is so hard to see someone you love so much be so sad.  Hugs and prayers to her and her family.  I know you probably want to go but your BFF knows you need to heal yourself right now.  You can find other ways to be there for her.....that's what BFF's do.  I hope you had a good hike.  Also how much things can change in 4 months...this week on the 8th will be 6 mo's since my diagnosis....so much has happened since then.  I still can't believe this is my life!  How are you healing?  I hope better...please tell me it is shrinking.... Supersally:  How was your ride?  Good that you are going early...99 degrees is killer girl!  Without SE's most of us could not handle that!  How are you feeling?  I hope better...so glad you are done with chemo!!  LOL at office space....I work alone though so I have no local co-workers.  I am working from my home office all this week too.  I guess I don't have to worry about how I look or even shower much....nice!  Makes it easier after my morning workout...just rinse off and don't worry about make up or hair.  Redsky:  Glad you found a suit...what a relief. Hiding these things is stressful!  I have no idea what kind of TE's I have...don't know what a 4 tab thing is...I didn't see that on my surgery report so I don't think I have the same kind as you.  I am sorry you are in pain.  You do have to listen to your body.  Remember that I was in a world of pain until I stopped fills for a while so I can relate.  I hope it gets better soon.  Do what you can and listen to your body in the coming weeks.",

Anyone else taking anything like this?  I am still on iron, vitamin D, multi vitamins, B complex and a probiotic.  He also said to pick up some biotin to help with hair growth.  Just curious if anyone else takes supplements/herbs.    Melanie:  Glad to hear from you.  I know family is frustrating....don't feel bad.  My brother lives 10 minutes from me and hardly calls.  Saw him on Easter and not since that....he never even called before my last chemo.  I called him and asked for a favor last week and he said no.  I get it....what is it with brothers anyway???   You will be running marathons again before you know it if I have anythign to say about it!  Don't you worry....when the time is right I will bug you enough!  Let us know how RO appt goes.  I don't have to do rads so I don't know much about it.  Let me know how many and how often.  I hope it goes quick...painless.....  Suebee:  You go girl!   You are so dedicated!  Look at you!

Julie:  Thanks for the encourgement about moving.  I know it will be OK the timing just couldn't be worse given the whole BC thing.  I will get through it..what choice do I have?  As far as the enema...I had on after surgery and during chemo...didn't know I was not suppose to do that until after when the NP yelled at me.  I was desperate.  Both times I had to send DH to the pharmacy at 3:30am and 5am......he made me get another enema to have on hand after my surgery this week so he did not have to go there in the middle of the night.  So gross....nothing like being in the kind of agony where you have NO shame or modesty.  So degrading......just another SE of BC hu?  Shannon:  I noticed I had a small bump from scar tissue from my drain on my R side.  Could it be that?  I also discovered a lump on my Left hip.  I go see the dr on Wed.  I am nervous because I am having a lot of pain in my R hip/glute area and have been on and off for a while.  I am convinced it has spread to my pelvis or something....I know my dr will talk me off the ledge - at least I hope so! Redsky:  Have a fab trip.  HOw fun.  We want to hear all about it when you get back!!! Annie:  Yes..work is dreaded....I am working through Wed and then I am off for a month for surgery.  I am glad about being off....it gets in the way of everything and seems so insignificant now...a waste of my time after the BC dx.  Try to have a good week. ANyone else exercising today?  I am teaching my last class before surgery tonight.  I will miss teaching again.......a whole month of no classes - boo!",

I have moved away from wheat more these days and am trying to eat less inflammatory types of grains when possible.  I stopped obsessing and weighing myself.  I use to have eating disorder issues so I am careful to not go there again.  For me I go by how my clothes fit to keep things in check and every few months I may weigh myself.  I also try to pre-package snacks to have on hand and eat more frequent small meals.  I cut up apples and toss them in lemon and put them in individual sandwich ziplock bags so I can just take them on the go.  I also put 1/4 cup (1 serving) of walnuts or almonds in snack size ziplock bags so they are ready to go too.  I drink 2 water bottles of water (in my stainless bottle of course) while working out and eat a snack of nuts after my workout.  I try to eat carbs in the morning pre workout....multigrain type cereal.  I just don't have the patience to record it all everyday.  I just know that if I have a crazy eating day, the next day I try to buckle down.  I also avoid extra carbs...for dinner tonight we had salsa chicken tacos.  Instead of the spelt flour tortilla, I put my chicken over spinach and made a salad.  I do this often....skip the pasta or carbs and have more salad. ",

I am having BLMX with immediate reconstruction in 4 days.  Am I freaked out?  Yes - I am, but I know I am really OK with my decision and know 100% it is the right thing for me.  The decision is personal and there is no right or wrong answer....just your answer.  Good luck!",

Brows thinned a lot but I just avoided touching them and I did no lose all of them.  Lashes fell out about 6 weeks post chemo.  They grew back super fast! Latisse helped with that I am sure.

You can see my stats below.  My oncotype came back at 17 which is the highest score in the low range.  I had hoped it would be much lower so I could just turn my back on chemo, but it was not.  My doc's said if the score was low, no chemo but if it came back in the mid range it would become a choice.  I got two opinions.  The first one said no chemo based on the oncotype.  The second opinion felt there was potential benefit to me.  The thing that made me choose chemo was that I had angiolymphatic invasion listed as present on my pathology report.  This means the cancer had a pathway to travel by blood even though my lymph nodes were clear.  I was also upgraded from Grade 1 to Grade 2 after my lumpectomy.  Eventhough I ended up doing a BLMX I was still worried about the angiolymphatic invasion.  I have a 4 year old son and I want to do everything I can to blast the cancer now.  I don't want to do this again and I hope by doing it now I will get anything floating out there.  I don't know if it was the right thing or not but I do know that I can live with my decision knowing I did everything I could.  I knew that I would never be OK with skipping chemo if my cancer came back down the road.  I would blame myself.  My compromise was keeping my hair duing chemo.  My doctor is a supporter of the cold caps and I am doing them to keep my hair through chemo.  I will know this next week if it works for me.  It was not as bad as I thought it would be at all...it was very tolerable for me so doing it three more times on my next chemos won't be a big deal.  So I have a total of 4 rounds of chemo over 9 weeks and at the end of that I hope to have my hair and just close the door on cancer.  This is a hard decision.  I agonized over the chemo debate for weeks and it caused me the most stress of the entire BC process.  Once I made the decision it was like a sigh of relief for me.  I was scared to start but once getting started it's OK.  I tolerated the first round OK with a few minor side effects, but all is normal now.  I get my son up for school every morning, run errands, workout daily and cook dinner for my family just like I always did.  It's only 9 weeks...that's what I keep telling myself.  Now I only have 7 weeks left! Good luck with your decision.  I know how hard it is. ",

I assured him the surgeon said I would be OK but I would be sore and recovering for a while and I could not run, play and lift him for a while.  I told him what I could do though...play wii, read books, color, watch movies etc.....  I also told him I had special treats for him (I got him a goodie bag full of things we could do together during my recovery...movies, games, etc...) and that he would have a sleepover at his cousin's house when  I had surgery.  After explaining all of it...I asked \"do you have any questions?\"  He said \"yes, can I bring my light saber to uncle John's for the sleepever\"?  My husband and I laughed.....kids handle more than you think.  I think less information is better and if they ask questions, just answer them with a very light simple answer....they will indicate to you if they want more information.  My son only asked once where the boo boo was....I said in my chest.  That was enough for him.  While I realize your daughter is older and the conversation will look different....I just wanted to let you know that the conversation was way easier than I imagined....he went on playing right after we were done talking.  Good luck....I know how hard it is. ",

Despite my family and husband's family sucking royally, our friends rose to the occasion like you couldn't believe.  My one friend hugged me 3 times on Saturday when we spent the afternoon with them - with tears in her eyes each time saying \"I am so glad you are done with chemo and have done so well...\"  My family didn't even call....(except my sister - she calls and brought meals - even came to chemo with me).  So I am hurt and have realized that I can't count on them for anything so I won't expect anything.  I guess they probably care but have a shitty way of showing it or acting like it.  Whatever.  I am not wasting my time on that.  I am done hosting all the holidays for all of them - and doing nice things for them.  They too will get nothing from me.  I guess I have realized what others said....those I thought I could count on let me down and others really rose to the occasion.  I am blessed to have such good friends and to have found out how much they really care about me.  I have also realized that I expect people to be more like me (I am the kind that calls, sends cards, sends food etc... when someone is in need) and I guess my expecations of others are too high.  I am trying to expect less but I am still hurt and will not rely on them for anything anymore.  I don't know how to not be upset with my mom.  I am really hurt by her behavior......I just don't feel like spending much time around her lately because of it......",

You did the right thing by getting the biopsy now - I wish someone would have offered that to me 6 months ago.  I had my first mammo in Sep 09 and nothing showed on it.  I found the lump in June and by then it was 1cm and showed on the mammo/us.  I can't answer the other question as I had a lump.  I do have calcifications in the same breast but won't know what that means until after my surgery and final pathology.  I don't want to tell you that each situation is different and most of the ladies on here have been DX with BC so you may get biased results in your questions.  I hope for you that this is nothing and your tests come back clean.  If for some reason they don't, you have come to the right place.   YOu will find amazing support, help and encouragement here as I have since my DX in early Dec.  I wish you good luck and good health.   Please post an update when you know!",

They can't guarantee they can remove 100% of breast tissue so there is a possiblity it can come back locally though it is a low chance.  One thing you have to consider is the difference between recurrence rates of Lump+rads vs. MX.  I evaluated it and because of many reasons (including my 4 year old son) I selected BLMX.  Though the survival rates are the same for both options, the recurrence rates are not the same. That mattered enough to me.  My doc also told me I had twice as much risk of getting BC in my good breast now that I had it in the other.  There are so many things you have to consider even if you have the choice of either sugery.  Some people are not given a choice based on the way their case presents.  In the end the decision was mine.  My doc's did not push me either way.  I am happy with my decision.  It was the right one for me.  I hope you don't have to make this decision and all is benign.  Good luck!",

I am glad it can be used by someone in need.  So how did we do on workouts over the weekend?  I did not workout...I take Sat and Sun off.  I did do an hour on the elliptical this morning and some weights.  My legs are feeling the effects of chemo today.  I feel like I ran 10 miles!  I made sure to stretch really good after working out but I can still feel burning in my R thigh.  Oh well..I will take it easy this afternoon.  Another news flash...it is snowing here!  We are suppose to get 2-4 inches!  Gosh I hope this is our last blast before spring.  My flowers are completely blooming and covered with snow......I was completely lazy this weekend and did no real cooking.  I have to get my act together today though.  I think I am going to use what I have on hand and make some type of a mexican/southwest turkey meatloaf.  I have some refiried beans, turkey, black beans and veggies to use up.  I am gonna get creative with that since my family loves mexican anyway.  Otherwise I may have to work on the mexican lasagna idea already posted.......another option.  Who's working out today???  Anyone? Don't leave me hanging!!!",

The kiddie part was so much fun for him.  Maybe we will go again this Labor Day weekend. My BFF lives in No. KY so we usually stay with her when we go.  You guys are good for trying to talk me off the ledge on the food thing.  I am just paranoid.  I guess it's because I have been so focused on surgeries and chemo for the last few months and now I am not \"doing\" anything to beat cancer.  I guess the diet and exercise is all I can do to help myself.  I am LOL at Melianies comment about sharing my food ideas with my MIL....we barely talk to each other now! I can't imagine sitting down and having a full discussion with her about anything....that would require lots of wine which is also very bad for me (hehe!).  I did get some bras the other day (thought of you) that have no wires and really defined cups.  They were called Bandini and they are comfortable.  I found them at Kohl's.  I don't know how they would work though with padding the real boob.....just wanted to share in case it helps.  I needed something to wear under my work clothes when I go back to work next week (boo!!!).   I too have boob greed and think that my boobs will be too small...they are 501 ccs........oh well.  I am done filling because it will delay my surgery.  I am hoping for the best...... Well that's all I got going on today.  I get my port out tomorrow....another surgical procedure oh joy. Wish me luck!  I wil try to post tomorrow.  Obviously no workout for me tomorrow...I may try to get a walk in tomorrow morning before I go but since I can't eat anything it won't be much of a workout.  You ladies better workout good for me tomorrow!!!",

It's so nice to hear someone say they are 7 years out.....we are still in the thick of this crap!  Thanks!  Shannon:  I love that you are foob obsessed!  I too am foob obsessed and hair obsessed!  (I just got done with chemo and kept my hair with cold caps but it has thinned a little and needs a color job horribly).  I have never worried about hair, boobs, eyebrows and eyelashes so much in my life - not even when I was single!  So glad to hear you had a nice walk today.  Keep it up!  The exercise makes a huge difference!",

Right now my legs and cardio are so strong...my arms even look decent considering I have not done much with arms until lately. I am bummed to lose all my progress......poop!  My son had his end of the year preschool show today.  They sang 6 songs and did two with singing and sign language.  It was adorable......  The pre op appt went well except they said no more steroids for the rash (I finished them yesterday) and if it comes back I have to cancel my surgery and reschedule once they resolve it.  NOw I am scared.....if you can spare a prayer for me that the rash stays away, I would appreciate it! Melanie:  I am sorry that nights are so hard for you too with your arm.  It seems like sometimes the oddest moments bring me to tears.  I really also hate the night time..I still take xanax and watch TV until I fall asleep with the tv on.  I just can't be left alone with my thoughts in the dark and silence yet.  I too would be completely upset if I had the lymphedema...I can only imagine how hard this is for you.  Just keep doing what you are doing.  Did you meet with the new PT yet?  I am glad you are getting started on rads so you can get it over with.  As far as the pool, with my rash, I can't go in either.  We were at the pool over the weekend and I hid in the shade and had to go take a cold shower instead of getting in the refreshing pool.  I have to stay out of the sun given my skin issues right now....usually I am an olive skinned gal with a dark tan after a few days at the pool....no suntan for me this summer I guess.  Oh and I wanted to give you hope...my chemo legs are gone I think!  I have not noticed it anymore!  Hang in there...... Shannon: thanks for the support and understanding.  Some days are just easier than others.  It's nice to know I can share that here anytime and you all \"get it\".  There is so much I don't even have to say to you gals and you just know.  I can't imagine having teenagers through this...I thought a 4 year old was hard but now I am not sure!!  Hi Julie:  Welcome!  Feel free to join us.  We like to chat about exercise, diet, cooking and our families (oh and some of us are obsessed with boobs and foobs right now!).  Congrats on finishing chemo! I finished on 5/4.  I had a BLMX on 1/27.  I do my exchange surgery in 2 weeks.  Suebee;  You crack me up with the old man and your tshirt!  OMG!  I am 45 and no one has ever checked out my boobs and recently and old guy did and I was shocked (especially since they are ugly tissue expanders which makes it hilarious!).  I do like his creativity that he was \"trying to read your shirt\".  Give him some points for being creative at least!  LOL!  Pre op went well.  As long as the rash stays away I am OK otherwise I am going to lose it!!!  It is super hot here too...heat alert all day.  96 degrees today!  I stayed inside!! Renn:  Instead of an academy award that they give, ours should be a foob with good projection, don't you think?  I would have several lined up on my mantel from all of my \"outstanding actress awards\".  I too played \"happy girl\" during xmas after having a secret lumpectomy on 12/23 without my family even knowing......good thing there is vicodine!  You are right....my inner little girl is terrified because a giant monster is chasing her!  I never let family or friends see the \"inner little girl\" side though...they see the put together, OK version of me.  At least here I can let the little girl out all I want.  Thanks for that ladies.....really!  Sappy is good now and then....no apologies necessary girl!  Thanks for understanding.... :)",

Julie:  I am not so worried about him missing school....I am selfishly worried about myself (being able to take care of his needs all day....I may just want me time after surgery.......there, I put it in print...yes, I am being a bit selfish for once!!!)  I just may need to hibernate in my bed with my shows on and trashy magazines vs. playing Candyland, making snacks and watching Jake and the Neverland Pirates all day - LOL!!!   I have been a fitness instructor since college and I use to be a personal trainer and sports conditioning coach.  Right now I teach an advanced step aerobics class twice a week...I wish I could teach more but I work full time right now.  I have pretty much taught everything other than yoga and pilates.  I really want to get back into teaching weight training and boot camp conditioning classes.  ONce we move I will be able to teach more.  I am looking forward to that.  On the foob front...I am filled to 550cc's and I think that will be a full B or small C.  They told me they would most likely use a 450 cc implant for exchange.  Who knows...I will let you all know in a few days!  OK here we go...you said you wanted accountability on the fitness front.....I am gonna get that started girl!  I know the lack of energy that exists after all of this, but you can start slow.  It can be a walk or a few light exercises at home.  For me I know I can't do regular exercise after surgery for a month, but I am planning on focusing a lot on my diet...getting 5-6 servings of fruits/veggies a day and lots of water.   There are so many things you CAN do when you don't have energy that help your overall health and well being.  Even meditation and relaxation can be helpful and don't require lots of energy.  Just make a committment to do something everyday.  Tell us what you are going to commit to and we will check you on it daily!  We are here to support and encourage you.  Many of us have also read The Anti Cancer book and it really enpowered me to take control of my diet and help myself avoid recurrence.  I learned so much even with a degree in Health....it made a difference for me and makes me want to try harder.  You CAN do anything if you set your mind to it.  You have a little control in this whole BC thing..your attitude, your diet and exercise...the rest is out of your hands.  Take control of those things for yourself.....be the best you can be and do the best you can do.  :)  OK, I am putting the soap box away..... :) Melanie; I hope you like your new roomates and get into the new swing of things there.  It will be nice to have more people that are supportive right now.  I am glad radiation seemed so easy.  I hope you breeze through that part easier than chemo for sure.  It's great you got outside and got to enjoy nature.   Don't worry, next summer you will be back at that camp better than before!  Let us know how rads go.  I don't have to do that so I don't know much about it.  I am so glad you did exercise on Sat.....come on, keep going girl! Renn:  I totally get it on the helping (or lack there of) when it comes to hosting.  I love to entertain but it is so much work when you work full time, teach aerobics and have a family.  I find that the longer I have done it the less help I get.  I am done hosting for a while and I guess if we move I won't have to anymore.  I do enjoy it but the aftermath of cleaning the house and everything is exhausting especially since my family is full of kids so the house looks like a tornado hit after they all leave.  I am not going to worry about the help for my surgery....I will do it all myself.  I know you all want me to ask for help, but I have and they say no or simply don't offer.  I was at my moms last night talking about how DH is traveling after surgery and stuff...she never offered to come over or bring a meal.  When she does help because I ask her, I end up doing everything myself anyway because she is 79 and she likes to be waited on.  I told DH not to invite her over to help because I end up having to cook her dinner....when she's not there, I can simply eat cereal for me and pull from the freezer for my DS.  I know that sounds terrible, but it is more work for me to have my mom here......though I love her and appreciate her.  After my port surgery, she sat there and waited for me to cook dinner on the same day I had my surgery...never offered to help.  Shannon:  I hope the lump is nothing as your doc suspects.  Glad you are getting it checked out.  I have a lump on my L hip I am talking to the med onc about tomorrow....freaking me out!  You are so right how exercise helps clear the head. I find that when I do it in the morning I am better all day. WHen I teach class on Monday nights...I am a bundle of stress most of the day.  Keep walking and moving....let us know how the lump situation is..a prayer for you on that! SueBee:  I hope you get whatever job you want...I like the idea of tuition reimbursement and having a plan for job C.  You may as well get some benefit out of that.....keep us posted on what you do! As far as the DH job update:  Interview in Chicago yesterday.  Not sure he's really exciteda about that one.  He is still waiting for a renegotiated offer from KC as the first offer was not acceptable to us.  Seattle interview is next Monday.  We will see...... Marie:  Welcome!  I am an aerobics instructor and had BLMX on 1/27 with TE's and SNB.  Many of us gals have been chatting since then and we have a few newer gals that just joined in.  Feel free to hang with us!  As far as recovery..it was not as bad as I ever imagined and I do believe because I was more fit it helped me a ton.  I did the PT exercises twice a day that I got in the booklet from my Breast Cancer Center.  It really helped me get range of motion back...they did hurt like heck somedays but I never skipped them. I wanted to work with a physical therapist and asked for a referral as I wanted to get my mobility back quick.  I am glad I did that...insurance covered it so I did it.  My PT was great....she had experience with BLMX patients so she knew what to do with me.  I started walking at the mall about 2 1/2 weeks post OP - not quite power walking as my PS would not let me, but kind of brisk walking for about 30-40 min per day.  At 1 month post OP I was back to the gym on the ellpitical with no arms (held stationary handles) for 45 min a day.  Soon I was up to an hour and several weeks later started using arms.  Now I do 60 min a day with arms at level 15.  I could have done more weights with arms but I had a port in my arm from chemo and that was uncomfortable.  My PS would not let me lift more than 5 lbs for at least a month.  Feel free to PM me about other questions since I had the same concerns as you.  I also have the exercises on my computer I can email to you for post OP and you can ask your PS if they are ok for you to do....Best of luck!  The BLMX was not as bad as I thought..honestly! OK - I have to get back to work now!  Surgery is on Thursday...I will check in before then!",

I have been off the pain meds mostly - except I did take one at 11pm before bed just to relax me.  I slept well last night.  I did wake up a few times but I feel rested today.  Not much new here....making DH do the cooking tonight - Spaghetti Pie.  I will have to get that recipe on the blog....family friendly recipe and something yummy to make ahead of time if you have guests.  DH asked me to let him know when my boobs were going to do tricks....he doesn't want to miss it. ",

Supersally: I won't tell anyone if you crush up the xanax and it makes it to the coffee!!!  LOL!  My DH is not cranky, just stressed over the whole job search extravaganza.  No, I have never seen a corgi swim, but it sounds adorable!  I am so happy to hear you are being so active!!  I am super jealous too.....  I have heard the Marissa Tomei likeness before...it's such a compliment...thank you!  Everyone also always says \"you look like a Maria\".....I guess it's the Italian thing.... I will keep you updated on the job thing.  Right now I am waiting for the realtor in Chicago to call me back for some information on housing so we can weigh this out. Oh and this morning I was kind of busy...I am knee deep into planning Jayden's 5th birthday party for 7/30.  He threw me for a loop about a week ago when he declared he wanted a Harry Potter birthday party...for the last year all he has talked about was Star Wars...I had the whole SW party planned in my head already...now I am researching Harry Potter....called the cake lady, ordered cookie party favors and designed the invitation - sending it out to printer today.  Now I have to order party supplies and decide the menu..... Suebee:  Is there such a word - boobalicious?  If so, it would be you!  You are so gitty now that the boobie fairy came.  Your messages crack me up girl!  Now - just a reminder when shopping...look for professional attire...no shopping at Forever 21 or for boob shirts - LOL!  Be careful with packing..don't lift those suitcases!  I hope you have a good time and I also hope you have internet access.  What would you do without us while you are gone???  What will we do without your boob talk??? ",

Shannon:  Thanks for the tea suggestion.  So far the rash seems a little better this morning...I took the antihistamine last night...I slept like I was drugged....I feel so tired today.  I guess maybe I should be using that instead xanax at night for sleeping - LOL!  I also make the crustless quiches in the muffin pans.  I love them.....I freeze them and then reheat them and sandwich them with a whole wheat english muffin.  DH loves those in the morning...so do I as he can have eggs without messing up my kitchen!  I also hard boil a bunch of eggs at the begining of the week and slice them and put them on toast or chop them and put them in salads.  I toss black beans and garbanzo beans in salad too.  Have you tried quinoa?  I have only made it once and it has protein in it...can be used like a rice or pasta so it may give you some new ideas and different choices.  I am trying to only eat some type of meat once a day and some days no meats.  I am just trying to reduce it too and trying to embrace more vegetarian things when I can.  Renn:  I have to get caught back up on your blog.  Will do that this morning.  Blogging has been a great way to release all the crap in my head from BC.  It's kind of therapeutic in a way.  I am going to check it out again.  I can't believe you get that TE out this week.  How long before your doc will try to reconstruct again?  Just curious.....  I was fine driving..really this recovery is much easier than BLMX for sure....barely even feel anything unless I really reach far for something.  So glad it was an easier recovery this time. ",

(gentle of course!) Sue Bee:  sounds like you are having a blast!  I am sure no one knows what to say about your new \"rack\"....LOL!  I just decided I would start asking my friends - \"so, what do you think of my new rack\"?  Good for a laugh!  Shannone:  I am SO impressed!  I am so glad you are hitting the gym in my absence.  I am going to start walking daily after the holiday..too much going on now to have time.  Good for you.  Glad the foobs are more comfy. Supersally:  Hey girl!  I hope you are staying cool....thought of you yesterday as it was in the 90's here !  I so wish I could go in the pool...until the rash is gone I am scared though! Melanie;  THat would be cool to work for your doc.  My sis is a chemo nurse and she has done that for years. Maybe you could be more the nurse that works closely with him and have more patient contact...answer questions about SE's and discuss treatment and what they will go through.  My BFF works for a breast surgeon in this capacity and loves it.  Keep us posted.  That would be a cool thing if it works out when your contract is done and the job is interesting for you.  Renn;  Sorry about the parking ticket...boo!  As far as cans, I suggest checking out Amy's website and see if they note anything......Like I said I am going to do more research into this hopefully this week and post it on the blog.  As far as antihistamines and Tammi.....I believe it's claritin that interacts with tammi.  I talked to the PA at the derm office and she checked for me...whatever she prescribed for me was fine with tammi.  So if you gals are taking tammi - it may be a good idea to check what drugs/food interact with it.  I am off to the pool today (to hide in the shade) but let the girls make their first \"debut\" in my regular bathing suit!  I am going upstairs to try it on...but I must do something about the bikini line hair...yes, unfortuantely it started growing back after chemo and now I have to do something about it.  I was hoping it would just stay away....boo!  I will catch up more tomorrow or Tuesday.  Oh and the foobs are good.  No pain.  I am driving easily.  They feel so much softer and I have no feeling of tightness like the TE's did.  Happy with them.  I decided they look pretty much like I use to look in a padded bra before surgery when I was 15 lbs heavier.  I can't wait to add a padded bra and see what I look like...then they will look a big bigger.  I was hoping they would be a bit bigger than they are, but I am OK with it. Chat with you all later!  Happy 4th!",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

For now - DH is accepting the job formally tomorrow morning.  I have the first realtor coming tomorrow to look at our house.  The other one is coming Thursday.  My house is a mess....I have been lazy since surgery and my cleaning gals don't come until Thursday.  I did some cleaning tonight but I got sore..had to stop.  I am going to just pick up a bit in the morning and call it done for now...... Now I am off to see when schools start in Chicago so I know when we have to move..I think it will be in about 5 weeks....OMG!  I am freaking out! I will check in tomorrow.  I am dealing with all this stuff with DH right now.  Oh and the black bean brownies are good....I like them.  Add in a little organic dark chocolate chips if you like....my 4 year old eats them and likes them...well, maybe he doesn't know better!  LOL!

I have been to the gym every day this week. I am checking out gyms to teach at next week. I want to get back to teaching soon. I did take a weights class today so I will be sore tomorrow. I did not like the chest exercises...it feels really strange and kind of uncomfortable. I hope that gets better in time. I drove around and checked out neighborhoods all aftrrnoon.

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

Today I did a 35 minute mall walk and a good 5 minutes of leg stretching.  I was going to remind you all to stretch out those legs good after your walks. I don't know about you guys, but my hips and butt have been kind of sore and tight and I think it's from sitting around so much because of surgery.  Stretching the lower body is just as important....just choose stretches that won't involve your upper body (pulling with arms or such) to stretch your lower body. So a funny story about my mall walk.  I was lazy this morning and just put on a cute baseball hat, no make up, a long sleeve fitted shirt and some yoga pants for my walk.  I was walking and got totally checked out by two younger guys (maybe in their 30's).  So for a split second I felt really good - then I realized quickly that I was the only non-elderly person walking in the mall....Here I thought I looked good with my size B boobs that don't move around and stand up by themselves..... he he!  Gotta love men....they must like them anyhow and any shape/size....tissue expanders and all!  LOL! I went back to phys therapy today and she had me doing a lot more.  It felt so good to move my arms.  I did the bike thing for your arms for a few minutes.  I also did a back machine for a few sets and used the elastic bands for a few exercises.  She then stretched me out and massaged my tight area to loosen it up.  I felt good after.  I did my exercises this morning and will do them again tonight.  I promise!  So tonight's healthy dinner is all natural fed/hormone free chicken topped with tomatoes, basil, garlic and artichokes served with brown rice and garlic green beans.  I also picked up some fat free, organic greek yogurt - in a chocolate flavor as a treat.  I will let you know if it is good.  Sounds good...they also had a carmel flavor, but I had to take the chocolate. :)  How are we on food?  What are you cooking healthy these days?  I need a healthy dinner menu for next week - please share your ideas....please!  How are we on fruit, veggies and water for the day?  I am having a hard time getting 5 servings of fruit/veggies in...I just can't eat that much.  I did get spinach and an apple in at lunch.  I am struggling with this a lot - I just can't eat that much!  Are you guys on track with that?",

I was happy that I got my 35 minute walk in before my fill as I would not have wanted to do it after that experience~ So made a tasty appetizer last week I wanted to share - it's healthy for us too! I sauted organic veggies (garlic, onion, spinach, mushrooms, red pepper) in olive oil.  I tossed in some organic finely chopped sundried tomatoes (they were in oil, but I drained them first) and some S & P to taste.  I then toasted whole grain wheat bread slices (I got a good, hearty fresh loaf from Whole Foods and sliced it and then cut it in smaller pieces) in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes on each side.  I then topped the bread with some hormone free/organic goat cheese (just a little smear...not much) and put the veggies on top.  I served it to friends (I also did some without the cheese too) and they were yummy!  That is a good appetizer to bring to a party and you can actually enjoy it!  Thought I would share.....I love bruschetta and this is my twist on it.  I am going to  a party tonight and making a canellini bean hummous with olive oil ( I can't have sesame oil or tahini) and making some herb baked whole wheat pita triangles.  I will also serve it with some organic baby carrots.....so I guess what I am saying ladies is be creative with the foods you CAN have!  We can still eat really good and really healthy.  Annielynn...good job on the treadmill!  That's great!  I agree with you on the rounded shoulder thing...it is so easy to do as those chest muscles shorten when they tighten up.  As they shorten up, the back rounds out.  We need to keep stretching the chest muscles (pectorals) by contracting the back muscles (as your doctor directed).  I do this exercise throughout the day instead of just twice a day because I am sure it can't hurt.  I am gentle and listen to my body.  Also if you don't correct it, you have so many other muscles that can get out of whack.  Nip it in the bud now and you will benefit! Annie 3:  I am so jealous you are on the elliptical!  My doc still says no and I am being a very good patient right now.  That's great. Doesn't it feel good to sweat and feel your body working?  After is a great time to do your streches when everything is really warmed up.  It will ensure you have good range of motion. I am so happy you are half way through chemo.  Which one are you on an how many cycles?  I can't wait to say I am half way through.  You are my hero today!!!  Redsky...I know you are waiting and my heart goes out to you!  How many more days til surgery??  You are smart to keep active now.  I can tell you I think my recovery is going so well because I was in good shape before.  My NP at the PS office is just amazed at how much I am able to do and move around and she said I am much more fit than other patients and she is sure that is what makes the difference.  I can tell you that I used my abdominal strength A LOT in the first few days post surgery to move around in the bed.  Don't forget your abs!  I would think that pectoral stretches and strengthening would be good and upper back strengthening (seated type rows) and stretches would be good.  Let me know what the PT tells you for sure, but for the chest strengthening push ups (do them on your knees if you can't do them on your toes), dumbell presses or dumbell flys (laying on your back and doing them in an upward movement towards the ceiling) would be easy one's to do.  To stretch the pecs you need to move your ams in the opposite direction - I like to put hands behind my back with palms facing back wall and hands placed on back of hips.  Pull elbows backwards and feel the pecs stretch in the front.  For the upper back streching, extend arms in front of you at chest height, clasp hands and round your upper back forward.  This will allow the musles in your back stretch.  For strengthening, the seated rows where you pull your elbows back and almost stick your chest out work well.  Again these are normal exercises that work well for a regular fitness routine - NOT post surgery until the doc directs you to.  So who else is checking in today???? Anyone? Are you exercising? I hope so.  I have a birthday party tonight and will try to dodge the cake!  Thank goodness my friend orders me pizza with tons of veggies and sauce but no cheese so I can have a little piece of pizza.  If you like pizza, try it that way.  I just add a sprinkle of parmesan and it's good!  (and without the added fat, hormones and calories from the cheese).  Let me know how you did today ladies!",

I can't wait to tell all of you the same thing...it will be on March 24th (not that I am counting or anything.....).  Good for you walking on a chemo day a bit.  Treat your body kind in those days following chemo.  Drink lots of water to stay hydrated! Did my morning rehab exercises.....no walk today for me as all the schools were closed and my son was home with me today.  I am going to do my rehab exercises again tonight.  They felt easier today which is good considering how tight I was after Friday's fill.  I wanted to share a good and healthy dinner idea with all of you.  Tonight I made the lemon, garlic and oregano chicken with tatziki sauce and garlic broccoli on the side with wheat pita bread.  Simple....just marinate the chicken (cut in small pieces) in the juice from a lemon, a few cloves of garlic minced, oregano, S&P.  Marinate for a few hours or overnight.  Put a little olive oil in a large skillet, saute the chicken.  As the juice builds up, pour it off so the chicken will brown a bit as you cook it.  I like to make a lot of this and keep extra to put on salad or in sandwiches.  It's the best and it's healthy!  Just something simple...but you have to like garlic (I am Italian so no problem here).  Give it a try.  It also makes you get you water in for the day much easier...I was pretty thirsty from the garlic! :)  Just a reminder - hormone free chicken is best for us hormone positive gals.  I know what is for tomorrow's lunch....wheat pita, chicken, roasted red peppers and spinach with leftover tatziki!!! Who else did the exercises today???",

Tomorrow I am going to the gym!  It will be the first time I have been there since 1/26!  I don't know what to do first.  I will definately do some cardio and my rehab stuff.  My legs have been neglected so the leg machines too.  Even if you can't do arm exercises yet, ask your PS about leg exercises.  There are a lot of leg exercises you can do while your upper body heals.  Who's going to the gym tomorrow?  Anyone????  I feel like my class is getting smaller....where is everyone? Reminders: Re-hab exercises twice daily!  (this is a must) 8 glasses of water per day! 5 servings of fruits/veggies per day! Get moving....walk, ride the bike, whatever.....20 min minimum per day if you can!  Avoid fat and refined sugar products....whole grain pasta and brown rice a good substitute!!!  For oils - stick to olive oil and canola - both are better for you.",

I would love to hear about it.  As far as the fills, I am 360cc's now.  I still feel like they are filling more sideways than forward.  They want to do one or two more fills.  I will see how that goes.  I am dreading the fill this week after last week's painful experience.  I am glad you are going to the gym and feeling OK without your foobs.  I have always been flat so I never wore any foobs.  After a fill I was back to my pre-surgery size!  So I am off to the gym for my workout and to do my rehab exercises.  Today I am also going to do weights machines on my legs.  I was noticing yesterday after I did cardio and was stretching, how tight my torso and lower body was.  Just think about all of the sitting and laying around we all did during recovery in the past few weeks.  When you do workout, definately give some good stretches for the lower body and hips as things may shift and get tight do to all of the down time we have had.  I can feel it in my hips especially and my lower back.  Just try to keep that in mind so your whole body feels balanced.  Let me know how you did with exercise today!  I am on the pre-chemo steroids so I should have all kinds of energy today! ",

Sue - I was not a bad eater either.  It must have been the wine and birth control pills or something.  I don't know how the heck I got BC!  I am glad you are getting back into Zumba.  What a great way to clear your mind and lose yourself in the music while doing good for your body!  Enjoy that!  Just listen to your body and do the parts that don't hurt anything.  Soon enough you will be doing all of it with no problem!  You are GOOD on the nightie!  I haven't even thought of going there though we had our first intimate experience since surgery...(sorry if this is too much information.....no one else understands but you gals!).  I kept a tank top on and was nervous....it made my kind of emotional after feeling uncomfortable with my body.  My husband was so reassuring and said none of that mattered....I guess this will take some time to get use to.  I guess when I get more use to things it will settle....for now it gets me feeling a little strange and self conscious.  Post your progress for the day.  Anyone cooking anything else healthy and good this weekend and want to share the menu so we can get some ideas?  Just remeber, the rehab exercises are twice a day!  No slacking ladies...you will lose progress.  Stay on top of it and we will be going full force by April!",

Annie - I am so glad to be back to cooking too.  It feels nice to do something \"normal\" again! :)  Tonight I am making chicken and whole grain pasta with a fresh broccoli and shallot sauce.  My little one likes broccoli so I have to make him eat the veggies he WILL eat!  That's a battle for him...veggies! So I went to the physical therapist today for my evaluation.  SHe measured my range of motion and it is pretty good.  She was impressed but it is not 100% yet on two areas so we will work on that.  She also did a few stretches with my overhead range of motion.  It actually felt good - better than when I do my exercises.  She also did some massage of the pec muscle where it inserts up under your arm (in the arm pit area) which is where I feel tightness.  That actually felt good too.  We spent most of the time doing the evaluation but she said in thursday she is taking me into the gym for some more stuff and is going to get me moving.  I will keep you posted. One thing I wanted to share in case anyone else is switching to all natural body care products (chemical free, organic and paraben free).  Meijer has quite a selection - the best I have seen outside of Whole Foods and way better than Target.  They had lots of choices for face care, body care (soaps, lotions, scrubs) and shampoo/conditioner.  They did also carry the PHysician's Formula Organic Make Up.  They had quite a bit but no real eye shadows, consealor or lipstick.  It's a start though.  I just thought I would share in case anyone else is making the big switch as it has been hard to track down organic products.  Keep up the good work ladies!  I have 6 of my glasses of water in already today and feel like I am going to float away!  Ugh!  Drink that water girls - it's good for you!",

That is good news.  I know you are disappointed but if your doc is cool with you walking than do that.  It is still good for your body!  You are doing some good regardless.  Eat lots of beef hu?  So you are eating steak every day?   I am not a big beef eater so I would be in trouble! So ladies....today is another day.  I am hoping all are on track with rehab exercises.  I did my 35 min mall walk (stopped and window shopped at Pandora...yes I have picked out 4 cute, inexpensive rings I plan to get - 1 after each of my 4 chemo sessions!).  I also did my physical therapy.  SHe actually is letting me do some of the exercises now with the elastic bands and since I already have them at home I can add those exercises to my daily routine.  I will do those again tonight!  Tomorrow I get more chemo port in....so I won't be checking in until later as I will be all doped up for the surgery.  I will try and do my rehab exercises..hopefully I can do those after surgery but I am not sure they will let me since my port is going in my upper arm. Here's an interesting tidbit on eating out.  I was out running errands all day and needed to get lunch because I did not have time to come home in between things to eat.  Chipotle has hormone free chicken and organic veggies in their food.  I am not a fast food gal, but getting a salad with organic veggies and black beans worked well for me.  I just wanted to share in case anyone else is avoiding hormones in meat and eating more organic.  Just a little tip I learned today :) Keep your exercise updates coming ladies!  I can't wait til this snow melts so I can walk outside....maybe next week. ",

I packed chicken, spinach, sundried tomato and goat cheese sandwiches on low cal wheat bread, apple slices, baby carrots, lemonade, sugar free candies, organic whole wheat pretzels, low fat pumpkin spice muffins and lots of water.  My friend has recently lost 20lbs so I told her I was packing a guilt free lunch for all of us!   I also made a huge pot of organic chicken and roasted veggie soup for the week since that is good comfort food.  I am as ready as it get's for chemo.....I guess exercising won't happen tomorrow, but I will make it up on Saturday which has usually been my day off.   That's my plan!  I hope to exercise 5 days a week all through chemo....please hold me to that!  It may be hard!  Oh and by the way, my legs are sore from the machines this morning.  It feels good to workout again!

I will stop complaining about being cold here...Montana has to be way worse, although tomorrow with the cold caps I will feel like I am in Montana........ick!

A modified diet rich in vitamin B12, folate and iron is essential for the rapid rise in hemoglobin level. Folate is commonly present in liver, kidney, spinach, cabbage, yeast, nuts and fruits. Vitamin B12 is exclusively present in foods of animal origin. Meat, liver, eggs, dairy products contain adequate amount of the vitamin B12. Vegetable sources do not contain vitamin B12. Iron is present in red meat, liver, egg yolk, green leafy vegetables, dry fruits, jaggery, brown bread, unpolished rice. Milk is a poor source of iron. Other foods which can help are bananas, black grapes, plums, strawberries, raisins, carrots, radish, celery, tomatoes, beets, almonds, soyabeans, fenugreek seeds etc. I eat almonds every day, I had zucchini the last few nights with dinner and I eat spinach almost daily.  How can my levels be low?  I also take multivitamins and B12.  I am doing great though and drinking water (peeing a lot too!).   Supersally:  The chicken chili sounds good!   Unfortunately due to BC I had to give up beef....that sounds good too but no more for me.  Now I am stuck on your chili.....I would rather have that than the chicken/veggie stir fry I am making tonight.  Darn it...now I am craving chili!!!  I don't mean to make you feel guilty...but I do want you to exercise:)   I hope you were able to get that fill today.  For sure do your stretches in the next few days.  I always get tight after fills! SueBee:  I did not know you were in Dayton.  I use to live in Cinci!  We were neighbors at one time!  You are so lucky girl that you don't need the chemo!  Ugh!  I am jealous!  That's great that you got to Zumba.  Keep it up girl!",

SueBee:  I am so glad the \"booby fairy\" has started to visit!  (I have been waiting since I was 11 and she finally visited me too!).  You will be amazed after only a few fills how quick they grow!  I have 410cc's in right now and have to stop filling for now.  He is planning to put in a 375 implant at exchange - FYI.  I guess I will be a B cup (that's his best estimation) but I am still hoping for one more fill if my back gets better.  It was feeling a little better again today.  Don't forget to stretch the chest and shoulders around those fill times!  I always got sooo tight and that really helped! Anniemomof3:  Glad you got the exericse in today!  Good job.  As far as the sweets.....I just posted all about sugar on my blog a few days ago and how it fuels cancer....worth a read.  I got the information from the book The Anti Cancer:  A New Way of Life.  Very eye opening...and scary.  I too crave sweets and I am finding healthier alternatives.  I am baking a lot.  I keep some low fat/low sugar whole grain muffins on hand (banana, pumpkin spice, cinnamon) and since I use organic ingredients they are healthy and low cal - about 140 calories.  I also found some dark chocolates at Trader Joes.  They only have 5 gms of sugar per serving which is two small pieces.  I am also making some brownies using unsweetened cocoa and agave for sweetness....lower glycemic index with that than any sugar.  I also found some ice cream pops made of coconut milk (I am avoiding most dairy) and they have a low amount of sugar too (I just bought them today and have not tried them yet).  I guess I am saying if you can find healthier, lower sugar options to keep on hand you can at least still indulge but with less guilt and less sugar which is soooo much better for you.  Just some ideas........",

I then told her that she took that away from me....and started bawling.  I told her it was unacceptable....I don't know what to do.  My hubby is out of town...feel so low tonight.    I have to now cancel our vacation with 4 other families because they won't schedule my surgery and won't tell me when they will.  I have to make those phone calls tomorrow.  WTF?  Am I crazy or would you be mad?  I am completely shocked by this.  I NEVER go this type of impression from my PS.  He is so nice, thorough and has been nothing but generous with his time with me on every appointment I have had.  I love my PS.  I just can't believe he is OK with his patients being treated like this...maybe he is OK with it.  How can this be the same PS that actually called me the night before my BLMX surgery at home to discuss some things with me and put me at ease for the next day????  What would you ladies do????  Advice?  Someone calm me down, please.  I am so upset tonight.  I just feel drained....I so wish my hubby was not out of town...........",

I am not in the mood to cook dinner...which is odd for me.  I guess I am just lazy today.  I have to come up with something quick I guess!  Melanie:  Great that you did 3 miles.  I have not been running in so long...I was letting a foot injury heal up and never tried again since surgery.  Foot is better though.....if I start running my Med Onc will lose it though, right???  Oh well...I can wait.  Hope you are feeling good! Supersally:  Your trip sounds so nice!  I have not been to the Keys in years but it was so beautiful and fun!  Can I also tell you I have never been on a horse?  I have always been scared.  I wish we were closer...I could use a push to do something out of the box.  I would feel better on your gentle horse!  I am LOL at your granny.  It gives me something to shoot for!  Rennasus:  Dust off that workout equipment!  Come on girl!  You can do it and you will feel better after you do!

I was able to find some whole wheat pizza dough at Trader Joe's that does not contain the bad oils.  It is not oranic though, but it is whole wheat.  I buy a few and put them in the freezer so we have them when needed.  I am doing veggie pizza with a sprinkle of parmesan for me and DH and a regular cheese and spinach for my son.  My son loves making pizza..rolling out the dough and putting the toppings on.  So if you think pizza can't be healthy...make it yourself and it can be.  I saute up a bunch of onion, garlic, spinach, red peppers and anything else I have that sounds good.  Put the pizza sauce on, then the veggies and just a few sprinkles of cheese (I do parmesan but you could do a little organic mozzarella if you want) and serve with a large salad. It's so good I can hardly order pizza out anymore.  Other favorite toppings...artichokes, banana peppers, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, fresh tomato slices...roasted garlic....SO Good.  Don't forget to add in fresh herbs...basil, oregano, parsley or whatever you have on hand. Just a dinner idea that everyone likes....it also works well on Fridays during lent for us Catholics.  I hope you all have a healthy weekend!  Get to the gym ladies!  It's time to shop for bathing suits..... :)",

I just mean things that are not refined and don't contain the bad oils.    It makes me only want to have people over to my house so I can control the food that's offered!  I do try to always bring an appetizer I know I can have but then if dinner is out of my control then I am stuck.  Based on that situation, I ate bad this weekend. My friends picked up Chinese for dinner on Fri night.  Sat my sister made dinner which was not too much off my diet.  Today we went to brunch and then an Easter dinner at my cousins - nothing really too healthy offered.  Back on track tomorrow I guess......  Did anyone else workout?  We all have to tomorrow for sure after the \"food fest\" weekend!  Get your workout in tomorrow!  Don't make me get pushy......... :) Melanie: How is the arm doing? I hope it's getting better.  What do you do for lymphadema - just rest it?  I can't imagine how frustrating this is for you.  Rennasus: How is the healing going?  Getting better?  (I hope so!) SueBee:  About the TE hurting a little..keep strecthing.  It really helped me - especially stretches in the supine (on the back) position.  That loosened me up quickly and I now do it every time I workout just to keep things loose. ",

I have lost so much strength since before my surgery.  Oh well....it will come back if I work at it slowly.  I was back on the healthier eating today.  I am addicted to organic almond butter on organic 7 grain bread.   I wolfed down a sandwich in 30 seconds at lunch.....so good!  I have read almonds are better for you than peanut butter so I gave up peanut butter (which I love!!!) so I am glad the almond butter is hitting the spot!  Let me know what you all did today.  Annie had her last chemo today!  Hurray!!!! Supersally:  I think the weekend got all of us off track...we are human.  As long as we get back on the healthy track we are good!  I am impressed that I only ate one tiny piece of candy while I was filling all the eggs for my son.  I did eat chocolate cake on Easter....damn it was good!  It was a small sliver piece.....sooooo wickedly good though!  Melanie:  OK - NO working out for you!  You will get me giving you the \"sit on your butt\" lecture!!!! You have to rest now...really.  I know emotionally it's hard, but the benefits of taking time off and getting your arm better will be better in the long run.  As far as food for nausea...I have not had any nausea I just crave carbs like crazy in the days following chemo.  I have gained 5 lbs since starting chemo! (I did lose 18 lbs before starting chemo though).  I love lowfat banana muffins, toast, pasta, english muffins and such in the days following chemo.  Wheat crackers and pretzels too.  Mashed potatoes may be bland enough.  I also cook orzo or pastina in chicken broth and sprinkle a little fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese on it...yum!  I hope your chemo goes OK this time around girl.....rest if you need it!  Keep us posted when you can. Redsky:  Keep doing those exercises/stretches.  It seemed like once I took a break after my 4th fill I was able to really stretch things out a lot more.  I don't even feel the tightness anymore even with my gargantuan boobs (510cc's).  You will get there.  You are doing great!  I forgot about the hardboiled eggs....eating them in the morning and on some salad.  I love them but forgot as I usually eat healthy muffins or fiber cereal in the morning. ",

I got Hilfiger, The Limited and Izod capri's - each for only $14.99!  What a designer deal!  I also got more workout clothes for summer - shorter workout pants since it's hot.....so $170 later I got out of there with my new clothes!  I did also get 2 new shirts for work.....sooooo dreading going back to work in a few weeks. MelanieAnn:  I am so glad the new LE specialist is helping so much.  That's great that you have gotten back to baseline.  That is a step in the right direction for sure.  It seems like I have read that exercise helps prevent LE now in some of the new studies.  Who knows.....whatever you are doing, it's working though and that's great.  I hope you can get in some walks at least - the weather has been sooooo beautiful here. Anyway gals....hope you all had a healthy day!  Keep moving and working out!",

I think he is worrying about me....I finally said \"we have had to make much more difficult decisions in the past few months - we will get through this too - somehow it will all work out\".  So for now our most likely move cities would be Kansas City or Amsterdam.  What a difference between the two......he has some other things in the works so who knows.  I am taking a deep breath...............sigh.   I did some more retail therapy today...I needed work clothes.  I bought 2 pairs of pants, 2 summer sweater sets, 2 professional dresses.  Now I need some new shoes and I should be set for a while.  I kept putting off getting clothes like I was not going back to work or something....nothing in the closet fits.  Tomorrow I will get some shoes.  Cha Ching! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUPERSALLY!  I hope you are having a fabulous day!  I hope all heals up and it's not an infection.  I have been bruising horribly...I had over 20 bruises on my left thigh alone!  It is nuts!  Now that chemo is over hopefully that will stop.  My hemoglobin is a bit low so they hope it will go back up.  Are your blood levels OK right now?  Hopefully blood is good and that doesn't change.  Melanie:  It's great that you were able to get out and walk.  I am wiped out a bit from my final chemo.  Today it was like doing the elliptical in molasses or something....I felt like I could barely force myself to do it.  Oh well..hopefully my energy will come back soon.  OK on the 15 lbs.....that's a goal.  Just promise you will do it slow and steady?  You still need to be eating good through all this chemo to heal your body.  I know you can do it! ",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

DH's job interviews are moving forward.  He is going to Kansas City next week for an interview.  The company in Amsterdam wants him to come there for an interview.  We are trying to get more information on the relocation package before he goes there to see if it would even work financially.  We are still hoping to hear he will move forward for the job in Austin - that's a great opportunity. Renn:  I am so sorry about your doc appt.  I am taking a deep breath for you!  Lord!  I too got 2 opinions and one said \"no chemo\" based on oncotype score of 17 (highest score in the low risk/no chemo range).  The other onc said I may benefit from chemo and recommended it (based on angiolymphatic invasion).  I had to make the decision myself...that was the hardest decision I had to make through this whole thing.  What type of chemo would the doc recommend?  I got the 4 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan.  PM if you want to discuss....Please let us know what happens and what you think you are going to do.  I am sure you are completely overwhelmed by this.  Hugs!  Glad you are heading to LV for a few days of R&R. Suebee:  Glad the choir event was fun.  Get in that zumba girl!  Keep shakin' it!  I have not even gone there with photos....I have taken some but have not posted anything or gone to the photo board in some time.  I am trying to get psyched up for my exchange next month.....ugh!  Maybe after that I can think about photos.  I am also jealous your BFF is going to Hawaii......oh how I love Maui - one of my favorite places ever!  Redsky:  Interval training is a great way to challenge yourself!   I do that on the treadmill sometimes....it will kick your butt!  If you keep that up you will notice a big difference in a few weeks for sure!  Glad the fill pain is settling down.  I too was worried about my skin but so far it has done OK.  I will most likely laser the scars after all the surgeries are done to fade the scars.  I am so sorry about your mom.  I am saying some prayers that she will do well with the chemo....hugs!  I can only try to imagine how you feel right now.......",

I kind of thought that would start going away....I wonder how long that takes to go away after chemo.....  Trying to be good on the food front tonight but it's so hard going out or to anyone elses house...no one else eats healthy.  I am bringing a large salad tonight - southwest chopped salad.  They are ordering pizza.....I try to avoid white flour because it's evil.  There is no where to order pizza with wheat crust around here that I can find.  I order the pizza with just veggies, sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan to avoid the cheese (I can't have the hormones) and it's good, but the white crust is also a big no no.....why can't anyone make wheat crust pizza anyway???  Just a vent....I can't help it as pizza use to be my FAVORITE food to eat......now I make it myself so I know it's healthy. Melanie:  I will post the bagel recipe next week.  The bagels were good but not enough cinnamon so I wanted to try another batch.  They were easy to make though and it was so nice to have a bagel again (have not had one in months due to the soybean oil in them).  They toasted up fine too.  Stay tuned. I am also going to post the Italian Bulgar Wheat Salad recipe.  It was a hit...DH liked it a lot.  I have to rely on him as my tastebuds are still a bit off.  I am also going to make more of the black bean brownies today (did anyone try those??).  My son loves them....I laugh as he stuffs it in is mouth knowing there are black beans in them - he he! Have a fab weekend ladies.  Be well!",

Supersally: Sorry the last chemo kicked your butt.  Me too on the last one.  My legs are still feeling like I have run a marathon!  It's worse now than it was during chemo.  I hope you had some quality time with your mom while she was there.  Let us know how your follow up appts go tomorrow.  I have my med onc appt this week to discuss tamoxifen and follow up.  Do you have any fun plans for Memorial Day to celebrate being done with chemo?  We are doing Chicago!  Can't wait.  As far as the food....I am going to try to stick to my plan as much as possible.  I would rather save my splurging for fun things and really GOOD food..not MIL's junk food.  At this point I am going to bring my own food.  Don't care what anyone thinks.....  I hope your energy level comes back up before the weekend! ",

Redsky:  How is your mom doing?  Did she start chemo or is that starting this week?  Let us know an update....saying a prayer.  GLad you got some new PT exercises.  I really did not do any exercises for my chest muscles...my exercises were for shoulders and upper back to strengthen things and keep range of motion along with stretches for shoulders and chest.  I hope the new things you are doing help you and feel OK.  Suebee:  You must take the family to Chicago when you can.  There are so many fun things to do there and the drive it not bad.  We got a decent hotel deal - Marriott Residence Inn Miracle Mile - they had a small kitchen and separate bedroom and the rate included Shedd Aquarium tickets.  The room was nice too - oh and it included breakfast in the rate too! (I packed my own breakfast by DH and my son enjoyed the included breakfast!).  I am glad you went to Zumba on Sat....good for you!  What is your Zumba schedule for this week?  I need to start doing more abs - I have not done much because I was kind of worried it would bother the alloderm if I did upper abs.  I guess I could do lower ones...I have done them a few times in the past month but not consistant.  You have inspired me to do abs regularly again.  I will most likely be cursing you later this week when I am sore! (LOL!).  I hope this week to get on the photo thread and see how you girls look and post my photos.  With starting work this week...who knows if that will happen or not.  I am glad you found some bras that work..who knew shopping for bras and shirts would be so difficult?  I tried on 10 shirts before packing for the weekend before Icould find one in my closet that best hid the ugly TE's!  Can't wait until they are gone!  I hope that TE pain is gone...what a bummer!  I noticed when I was filling I had much more pain and discomfort with TE's.  I felt pressure in my ribs under them too and it even bothered me when I was eating food.  Not that fills are done, the pressure and pain is all gone...hope it's the same for you! Renn:  What's the latest on the incision?  Please tell me it is getting better!!!  Gosh what a pain that thing has been.  I hope so badly it is improving so you can move on with it already.  I know you must be frustrated.......sending \"healing vibes\" and prayers your way!!!  I hope you got some good R&R on your beach trip. Rehm46:  My cancer center gave me a booklet of post op exercises and stretches I could start after surgery.  I would ask your PT - give them a call and see if they can provide something.  If not, you can PM me your email address and I can email you the booklet I have (I scanned it) and you could show it to your PS and see if they would allow you do to them.  I don't want to recommend anything for anyone to do as I am not a PT or surgeon.  If your doc is cool with you doing them than it may help.  As far as getting back into exercise...my PS said lesiure walking was OK for the first month and no gym until 4 weeks post op.  I was not allowed to even drive for 3 weeks post op.  I started back at the gym on the elliptical with no arms at 4 weeks post op.  I have not done much upper body other than PT exercises as I got a port in my arm for chemo.  I got the port out last week so in the next week plan to do more upper body.  I am not sure how the docs would feel about getting back into yoga quickly as you do use a lot of upper body in yoga.  I bet my PS would have told me to avoid it for a while (he's super conservative).  I would ask and see what your doc says.  I would also ask to work with a physical therapist post OP if you can..a lot of us here did and it has helped a lot.  Feel free to ask questions...we are happy to help.  We have all been there. ",

Red Sky:  I have a bikini from before that fits and covers most of my ugly coconuts/scars OK.  I took the padding out of it (lord I don't need that anymore with these coconuts!) and it works OK for now.  It has the triangle type top but not with thin string ties...it is thicker so the triangle ends tie behind my neck (the triangle part is all one piece that goes right into a thick strap that ties behind the head).  It also has a thicker strap (about 1 inch thick) that goes under the triangles and goes around the torso that ties in the back - again it is thicker instead of the bikini's with the thin string like ties.  Do you know what I mean?  I don't have a photo...it's an old bathing suit I got a long time ago from The Loft.  Annie;  I thought shingles were more like blisters...I will look into that in case.  I am desperate....trying everything right now to get rid of this shit!  I am sorry you have to go back to work too...it stinks!  It gets in the way of my workouts!!!! Glad you had good energy to workout and have a good day!  Let me know how the hair coloring went...I am dying to try it too but scared..... Melanie:  I was thinking you deserted us!  Glad you are back and got to head out of town for a few days.  That must have been nice despite the heat.  Sorry about your arm...I know how frustrating that is for you.  I am glad it went back down and I am really glad you are trying another PT.  Hopefully they can help you....and fix that arm! Suebee:  I think you should give us the hiring manager's address and we can all write and tell her how wonderful you are and she should hire you!!!! I hope so badly this works out.  Just getting your foot in the door will be a good start.  You never know what happens from there once you are in, right?  So you are showing off your \"knockers\" in your FB page?  Too funny!  I have not changed my FP pic in a while...it still has my old small boobs in the photo.  I think post OP we all need new FP pics with our new bodies.  You could add a thought down like \"check out my new boobs\"....LOL!  I am at my witts end with the dang rash....it was a bit better today on the steroids.  I will stay on them for a week because I just need relief............I think it's hilarious you asked your BFF to go with you to get a nipple.  If we move I may be asking someone to take me to get my nipples (if I have to fly back here to see my PS and need someone to go with me).  That may be an awkward phone call too \"so I am coming in town, can I stay with you for a few days and can you take me to get some nipples?\".  LOL!  My friend Deb would do it in a heartbeat and crack up out of control.   Too funny!  Oh and I have my pre-OP appt next week even though my surgery isn't for a few weeks. Renn: I did not start the T yet as my med onc office forgot to call in the Rx last week.  I just picked it up today. I was going to take it tonight but since I am on so much crap for the rash I am waiting until DH gets home tomorrow night to take it in case of any reaction to that.  DH is out of town tonight.  He has a job interview in Kansas City tomorrow.....yikes!  I can't imagine having my skin more dry with all of this going on.....now I am scared to take the T!!!  Thanks for the job sympathy.  It is overwhelming at this point because I just don't even care at all.....I feel like I am decieving my boss (I got a new boss when I was out...he's a dear friend of mine that I have worked with for over 4 years - a super nice guy that I respect) because I don't want to be here and don't plan to be here.....I have to do what is best for me and my family.  I know he will get that but I hate my attitude because I am a super hones person and feel like no one would want someone with this attitude working for them.  How is the incision today????  Need an update please! Supersally:  Well I think we will pass the \"boob greed\" crown to you girl!  Over 550 cc's???? Wow!  Good for you!  I guess if you are taller it would be less noticeable than on my 5 foot 2 1/2 inch tall body!  You do officially wear the crown in this group unless Renn pulls it out after the incision heals up!  Oh - Melanie is a double D....you may have a rival!  LOL!  I thought women only got cankles from being pregnant....what a bummer. I am thinking about one of us actually having ALL of the symptoms we have experienced at once....incision issue, lymphadema, no hair, rash, cankles/swelling, etc.....Ugh!  How awful would that be??? BC stinks for sure!  As far as swimming.....with my rash I am afraid to get near a pool. I promised I would take my son to the pool this weekend (it just opened last week) so now I am nervous my skin will go nuts.  As far as arms I am only doing the elliptical and some shoulder exercises with lighter weights.  My arms look a little better than a few months ago.  My PS would probably frown...he's super conservative!",

Resky: I obviously don't have those type of TE's.  One of mine migrated....I am lopsided....only for 2 more weeks though! Well, I am off to get on my teleconference for work and I do see my holistic MD today for a chemo follow up and complete blood panel I am sure (last time he drew 8 vials of blood!!!!) so I am worrying about my veins!  I wil see what he says I should be taking for vitamins/supplements.  I will teach my step class tonight after work - I miss working out in the mornings now that I am back to work (darn work getting in my way!).  Have a good day.  Be healthy!",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

LOL!  Well Shannon...I will be stuck in the house so we can chat back and forth all day. I will long for the day I can run errands again....and drive...sigh............  I went to the grocery store today and stocked up...you would think I have 12 kids with what I bought but I figured I can't drive for a few weeks and just wanted to save DH from tons of trips to the store.  Oh and I love the \"no nipples\" comment...you are too funny girl!  Renn: Thanks for the good thoughts.  I will post tomorrow..you know me...I can't stay away from you girls.  If my message is messed up you will know I am on pain meds...or typing on my phone instead of my laptop.  I have to see Bridesmaids.....maybe my other cousin will take me (DH will say \"that's a chick flick\".....) now that she is off from schools (she's a teacher...).  I am going to ask her :) Suebee:  I am here!  I have been busy today but I am here for my last messages to you gals!  Thanks for the cheer...now I am picturing you jumping up and down saying the cheer with your boobs shaking everywhere!  LOL!  Well I am ready for surgery.  We have to leave here at 5:15am (yikes) and be there at 6:30am.  My surgery is suppose to start at 8:30am and they said it would be a few hours long (I think including OR prep time and stuff...).  My PS does have to completely re-do the alloderm on my L side as it is an inch lower than righty....I hope it all gets corrected.  That is one of my fears...being this lopsided forever.  I am ready.  I am not as nervous as I was for BLMX at all...I just want this crap over with at this point.  I am going to stay up and watch TV and pop a xanax later.  I hope to rest tomorrow afternoon.  I guess I am as ready as it gets....I will try to post an update tomorrow.  Thanks for all the support ladies..... :)  I can feel the love.....",

So I get it....it doesn't bother me too much.  I got more ignored by my family.  Although, my brother called the day before surgery and the day after surgery...shocking.  My mom came over yesterday and brought me some beautiful flowers.  My sister called each day but she's super busy this week.  Anyone have a skin burn from the tape during surgery?  It looks like a sunburn in the shape of exactly where the tape was.  It is red and raised up a bit and it's super itchy and feels like a sunburn.  Ouch!  I don't know what  to put on it....ideas?  I just posted on another board hoping someone can tell me what to do before I can call the PS office tomorrow. ",

I keep finding myself saying to DH \"you know, you don't have to stay with me and live this life...you have a choice\".  That's horrible!  I just feel like I am ruining his life..and my son's life because I am sick.  I know we have to talk about this job thing this week but I just don't have answers.  I don't know what we should do.  I think we would have just taken the job in Kansas if they had made a good offer but I guess that would have been to easy.  OK - I am done venting right now....I keep saying \"stay calm.....breath......relax.....\".  I think I will go for a short, leisure type walk later today.  I am trying to keep stress at bay but it seems to be more like I am avoiding dealing with these difficult decisions we have to make. SueBee:  I am sorry your BFF is letting you down.  I have been let down so much by family that I understand.   I guess this is one more great little treat that comes along with the BC diagnosis that no one told us about.  As sad and hurt as I am, I am trying to let it go.  I have to.  I can will someone to change or act differently all I want, but that does not mean they will change or act differently and then all that come out of it is me being disappointed AGAIN.  It's the same horrible cycle over and over again.  I am beginning to feel like I am setting myself again by expecting something they are not capable of.  I guess the soon we can both expect nothing then the disappointment will go away.  I know how lonely BC can be so having people be \"with us\" in this means so much but some people just don't get it and never will.....We are all here though.  We always respond and always ask about your foobs!  I am done on my soapbox right now....So hamburger bun hu?  I have not experienced that yet......I can't tell what is going on with them.  I will let you know how things look in the next week or so.  DH is obsessed with drop and fluff...he got it all mixed up and told my sister yesterday they were going to fall and poof - LOL!  I think he thinks they are going to turn into DD's or something by his use of the word \"poof\"...he will be sadly disappointed.  I did let him touch them to see how soft they were....I am sure that will only get him chasing me more now that I did that....what was I thinking??? Renn:  There is a thread about tape and non allergic tapes.  I started to read it but I needed solutions, not tape suggestions.  It may be helpful to you though.  My BFF is a nurse for a breast surgeon and she told me to use triple antibiotic creme on it.  I put some on yesterday..I hope it helps.  I actually have some blisters too from the tape!  Gross!  It is supper itchy too....like I really want more itching after all my rash issues!  I too had the whole BC avoidance thing.  Don't they realize we can see the two ton PINK elephant in the room????  Good lord...people are so dumb at times.  Why can't they say things like \"I have been thinking about you and don't really know what to say....I hope you are well\".  That would be better than nothing at all!  I guess it just makes us feel like people don't care or don't understand the magnitude of what we have gone through and have to continue living with for the rest of our lives.......we all need some serious counseling about the people issues after all of this.......I am glad I am not alone with these feelings though, but am sorry you have to go through it.  Annie: I am glad you are taking time off..no need to have the added stress of work since we already have enough stress with all the BC crap.  It is the time to take care of yourself.......really!  You sound so busy.....I am tired listening to you girl! Melanie:  How was your weekend?  Sounds fun with all the visitors.  LOL at the wig thing!  I can see you getting some super fun wigs....maybe you should get a hot pink Lady GaGa wig to wear to church next week!  That would get people talking!  I hope you are well.  How is the skin with rads?  I heard it burns over time...I hope it doesn't hurt too much.  Hey Redsky:  Hope you are well.  How is the chest pain?  Better I hope. ",

I have nothing going on today except the derm appt....ohhhh.  Tomorrow I am going to spend the day with my sister and her kids and Jayden.  We may go to the zoo or something...not sure.  DH will be in Seattle until Saturday...anyone else hate when their DH travels??  I do.  I will sleep like crap the next two nights for sure.  I never sleep when he's gone.  Oh well....it's only two days.  I did go for a 15 min walk last night.

Renn:  Where do I begin...I was so sad reading your post.  I am sorry.  I don't even know what to say.  I do remember looking at my chest post OP for the first time and I only had 120 cc's in there.  It looked so odd....I was petrified to let my DH see me the first time when he had to clear my drains.  I cried when he saw me....I couldn't even look at him.  I know all of this is so emotional and I am sorry that you have to drag this out even longer.  I hope in a few days when you have all the anesthesia out of your system and are off the pain meds you will feel a bit better.  I am sure the stress plus all of that  has made things worse.  I had a meltdown on night two after my exchange....crying and just sick of all the shit that goes with BC.  You are entitled.  This is HARD.  No one else gets it except us going through it.  We have to live this every day and every moment - not like family and friends that just go on with their lives after they talk with us about this.  I so wish we were all closer....I would be over with chocolate, ice cream, People magazine and a chick flick for sure......Hang in there.  I hope you feel better tomorrow.  Supersally:  I can't imagine us actually graduating from BC.org and just doing FB.  That will take some time.  The planning is nuts...I had the contractor here today - we need to replace the kitchen floor before getting the house on the market. I also need them to paint the master bath.  Other than a few minor things we don't have to do anything to the house...it is in good shape (thank God) but then again we have already done so many improvements.  So glad we finally furnished and finshed the basement so someone else can enjoy it....I am sad to leave our home.  We bough this house when we first got married - it was our dream to build a life here.  Jayden was a baby here..he took his first steps here.  I will miss his room the most...I will think of memories sitting in his room holding him as a baby.  I will cry for sure....I love my house and am sad do leave.........  As far as a dog...we are going to rent for a while and then try to buy a fixer upper home so we can do everything the way WE want.  I never got my dream kitchen in this house (which is a sin considering how much DH and I LOVE to cook) because the home values dropped so much we could not justify putting the $$ into it.  My next house will have a kitchen I design....I am looking forward to that part.   I can't imagine having a dog in a rental unless it has a yard.  Right now we are considering a townhouse or an apartment so we can get a shorter term lease if we find a house to buy.  I had the other realtor here today....the house will be listed in the next week!  We will probably head to Chicago next weekend to check out housing.  Help!  I can't imagine discussing \"thongs\" with MIL.  I can't imagine how I will cope the first time she wants to come and visit us in Chicago....lord there won't be enough xanax for that.....can you imagine me hanging out with her while DH is at work????  That will stink for sure. How is your little Supersally?  I hope OK.  Aussies are adorable....smart like border collies too I bet.  Shannon:  Glad you are having fun.  I am feeling better that we know what is going on now but there is so much to do.  I am glad I am off from work right now.  I spend my days making phone calls to deal with all the relocation stuff.  I used some pillows but I found it was more comfortable for me to lay flat after the first night...it was more uncomfortable being propped up. ",

I feel like I need a nap today.....I did pick up my new car after working out.  It is super nice :)   I talked it over with DH and I think I am going to give notice at work before vacation and we can just take the new car on vacation with us.  It is causing me major stress because we move 2 days after getting back.  My boss would have to meet me to pick up stuff and and get my car....how do I explain why my house is empty and how I am moving that fast if I just found out we were moving?  I am going to just talk to him Monday and drop the bomb I think.   DH said he did not want me to be stressed out any more than I already am.....he is still trying to climb out of the dog house from the golf trip he took last week........ So on another note....we were taking cupcakes to DS's school this afternoon for his birthday party at preschool and DH was checking out my rack and staring at it.  I asked what he was looking at.....he said \"just checkin' out your cupcakes\".   Nice.........he is like a kid on xmas with the new foobs but he tells me I am selfish and keep them all to myself.   I am too stressed and exhausted to even think about any \"action' these days....I guess he will be trying to add that to my master list of things to do.....

Melanie:  congrats on finishing rads and getting an ugly mug.  You can definately negotiate some time off..I have done that with every job.  I hope the interview goes well.  Oh and you wondered how I am doing it all with the move - simple answer.  It's like getting BC..you just do it whether you want to or not.  I am stressed completely.  Shannon:  Love the pizza dough story.  My son loves making pizza and thank god he is to young to compare the dough to boobs......

THe muscles on the front of your hips will be tight and the other muscles on the back side can be a little overstretched from so much sitting.  It is a good idea to loosen those things up. If your docs are OK with it, some lower body stretching can also help work out some of the aches!  Jill - you will be looking fab by spring!  Have fun shopping.  Buy something cute!",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2011 01:33PM - edited Feb 8, 2011 04:22PM by mdg I am glad we are getting a group of exercise gals.  My doc said no treadmill because he says when people get tired they hold on or use their arms on the handles....blah, blah, blah.  I think I know better but oh well....I am heading to the mall for indoor walking which is fine for now.  As far as the exercises, I got the booklet at my Breast Cancer Center.  I have been searching today and can't find anything on line that is similar with photos or anything.  Some of the exercises are easy. Before drains come out they had me doing: Chin Tucks, shoulder shrugs, squeeze shoulder blades together and shoulder rolls. After drains came out they have me doing other exercises.  Things to help stretch chest out a bit and contract upper back muscles.  They also have me doing things that work on being able to straighten arms out and raise them overhead while getting them closer to my ears when in overhead position with arms striaght.  Some of the others have me pushing away from the wall with my arms a little and pushing  the palms of my hands together.  They do also have 2 exercises that have 2 lb dumbells that work on the tricep/rear shoulder area as well as the overhead press with a 2 lb dumbell.   Maybe I should scan some things.....hmmm.  That may work but I don't want anyone doing anything their doc has not approved.  I also want people to remember that some of us had different types of surgery so the recommendations may not be the same.  If you were treated at a cancer center, can you ask if they have an exercise handout?  I will work on scanning things tomorrow and then maybe I can email what I have out.  I am shocked that more docs have not given something proactively as rehabilitation early on is usually a good thing (I had my knee put back together once and rehab got me back to normal in a few months so I know from experience...I also worked with athletes on post injury rehabilitation for sports teams in the past).  So I will work on getting things scanned.  If you want the information I have, send me a PM with your email address.  I will work on scanning things tomorrow!",

So I survived chemo yesterday and felt great today.  I did the elliptical for 40 minutes and my stretches.  I did PT today and she is doing more weight training with me - light weights, but none the less it feels good!  She re-evaluated my range of motion on both sides.  The Left side improved significantly, but the right side was 10 degrees less.  So I have decided to do all unilateral stretches so that I can stretch each side separately so maybe I can get the R side up to par.  It still improved but I was disappointed it was less than the other side.  I am hoping to workout through all this chemo crap.....I am gonna try my best to hit the gym 5 days per week!  I plan to teach a few classes in April.  I am setting some goals.....I have not tried aerobics yet at all....my PS is so strict!   I will give it some time and try in a week or so at home on my own.  Any other exercise updates?  Anyone noticing one side doing better than the other?  It's funny because my L side was way more sore due to SNB and I think I over compensated on that side and pushed harder...funny that's the better side now.  I also notice that my TE on the R is placed higher and hurts more than the one on the left in the pecs.  Is anyone else lop-sided like me? What other health topics would be helpful?  Are you chugging water daily?  I drank 20 glasses yesterday to flush the chemo.  Still trying to force down more tonight to get 20 glasses in....gotta hit the ladies room - again.  Go figure! I hope you are all doing well!  Post those updates daily....no slacking you young little ladies! ",

I am just curious if your doctors have talked to you about this or if you have taken some things on your own.  For me personally, I also see a wholistic MD (I have been seeing him since before BC) and I am on vitamin D, Multi Vitamins, Magnesium, B Complex and pro biotics.  He had me on a few more things but my onc wanted me off that stuff for now.  He also asked me to start some Floresence Tea and a pectin that is full of fiber to detox.  My med onc wants me to wait til after chemo to try that stuff too.  I wish there was more agreement on this, but you know how it goes.  I am just curious how you all are managing vitamins and supplements.    Silia:  Thanks for the encouragement.  I am going to hit the gym, go get my shot for neulasta (boo!) and then come home for a shower.  After my PT appt I am going to the mall to shop!  I also got an Aveda gift card from a friend so I am getting some more make up (I switched to all natural and mostly organic make up and am still building up my supply).  I am also going to get my sister a ring too since she helped me all day - as a thank you for taking the day off and supporting me.  So glad you got your workout in...20 minutes is great and your personal trainer will really keep you motivated.  What kind of stuff did your PT have you do?  Don't forget some weights....as we get older we lose lots of muscle mass.  Keep me posted.  Your chemo time will fly by even though it is more than mine...hang in there! SueBee:  We will see how it goes and when the chemo \"hangover\" hits.  I am excited though because I already pooped today (yes use BC patients get excited of such gross, little things....).  Last time I had issues so I have been taking meds since yesterday to move things along as a precaution.  I am so glad it is working.  I want to avoid the horrible constipation I had for days last time.  Keep your fingers crossed and throw in a \"poop prayer\" for me if possible!  :)",

Supersally:  I have been doing the make up thing too.  It is really expensive!  Lord!  I have replaced make up, all soap in the house, dish soap, dishwasher soap, cleaning supplies, make up, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, and more!  I need to do toothpaste next.  I have even changed the products for my whole family.....Wait til you read the book.....I threw out and gave away so much food to family and friends.  I feel better though knowing the crap is out of my house.  I am also so jealous of the weather you are having....riding must have felt so good to you!",

Melanie:  In the days following chemo I noticed pressure and a lump like feeling in my esophagus after eating.  It was pretty uncomfortable. I talked to my sister about it as she is a chemo infusion nurse.  She said the chemo dries out your GI tract and esophagus.  I started drinking more water and that helped.   I also had some burning in my stomach so I took Prilosec and that cleared it all up.  I don't know if this helps you or not.  Sorry you are feeling crappy.  I hope you wake up and feel better today.  You will get better and get back to working out when you feel up to it.  Chemo will knock you down a few days...it's OK to be lazy on those days.  I do hope you can muster up even a small walk though..you will probably feel better after.  Rennasus:  Your stroll sounds so nice...we have no citrus farms here in Detroit.  If I walk it's in suburbia but we do have protected wetlands behind oursubdivision and have lots of wildlife.  It is really pretty back there but I have waited to go back there figuring it is really muddy since we have been thawing out.  I am going to check it out this weekend though.  Considering we live in a suburban area right near I-75 it's nice to go back there and see beavers, cranes, deer, ducks and lots of birds....makes me feel like I am somewhere nicer.  I LOVE soup too.  I have been making it lately with roasted veggies.  Cut up all the veggies, toss them in olive oil and some seasonings.  Roast them in the oven for aboug 45 minutes.  Then throw them in a large pot with broth of your choice and some more spices and let it cook down.  SO good.  I have done minastrone, southwest veggie and chicken and veggie this way.  I usually make a HUGE pot and freeze it in small portions so I can just pull a small amount from the freezer for lunch when I want it.  So yummy!  Annie: Don't you just love the hair wash days?  It's a big deal around here for me....I am on a chemo week so my hair will be disgusting this week.  Washed it on Sat and can't wash again til Sat.  I have chemo tomorrow....blech!  I hope you are all feeling healthy today and full of energy for the workouts!'",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

I hope that arm is doing better.  You sound so much more upbeat so I am sure it is!  I can't wait til you get over this hump with the arm and feel better.  I can only imagine how difficult it is for you....you are doing good!  Keep it up girl! Supersally:  Let me know how the meditation app is.  I should do some more relaxing things like that.  Iooked into BC yoga and they have it during the day at my cancer center.  I had planned to try it but with the port in my arm I waiting as it was pulling.  It now feels fine but since I get it out in another week or two I will just wait. By then I will be going back to work so I won't do the BC class but I have 2 yoga DVD's I have tried a few times in the past. I am going to try to get those going again after my port stuff heals.  I am doing about 10 minutes of stretching every time I workout and that feels sooooo good.  I always felt much looser when I did the yoga DVD's.  I would do them in the morning before work and I felt so different all day.  I hope to do Yoga once or twice a week.  Yes I get short and snippy with my DH for no reason sometimes and I just can't help myself.  I hate that I do that but know it has to be the chemo, hormones and stress.  I do try to apologize to DH after....it makes me feel bad but I just get this way at times.  I am going through a lot and it is what it is..... Sue Bee:  No job news yet?  Get that DH doing home projects while he's home.  Beef up that \"honey-do\" list and get him moving!  That's what I would do!  I hope something happens on the job front.  Job searching is horrible here so I know how frustrating it can be. Unemployment is horrific in Detroit.  Oh - black bean and corn salsa sounds good.   We had mexican this week too but I did it before my chemo so I could enjoy it just in case!  We did turkey taco's.  Redsky:  So glad you got to the gym!  I am sure that was such a great feeling to sweat and move again!  Good for you. I too started on the elliptical with no arms for a long time.  You can really get a great cardio workout and work those legs...worry about the arms later.  How has the tightness from the fills been?  Is it better?  You probably have another fill next week - right?  The massage sounds divine!  I have 2 gift cards for massages but couldn't do them because of chemo and surgery.  I am lining them up as soon as I get the OK!  Can't wait to use them!  I am also going to treat myself to a salon pedicure in a few weeks now that chemo is done (that's a no no during chemo).  I will feel like a whole new woman...Oh and I can color my hair again hopefully in a month!  Yippy! Rennasus:  So glad your sis has been there.  Having my BFF here has done wonders for me!  It's so nice to have that good, quality time with those you love especially now.  I am sorry your energy level is down.  When did you start tamoxifen?  I start in a few weeks....happy happy joy joy (said sarcastically of course).  I keep telling myself I am going to be optimistic that being on it won't be a big deal and I will have no side effects.....we shall see.  So are things healing up - finally???  Gosh I hope so!  You need a pick me up with that.  Let us know the latest!",

Happy Anniversary! Renn:  So glad you are doing better - that's GREAT news!  I hope it continues and you can just get those fills going with no issues.  That sounds so much better than sugery to remove things and start over.....I am saying more prayers in your honor girl!  The walk with your friends sounds sooooo nice.  None of my friends have time for anything...they all have young kids and work full time.  I hardly see them......Enjoy the day with your girls!  Where are you going in May for a getaway?  We are doing Chicago for Memorial Day weekend!  I can't wait! Melanie: That's so cool that your parents are doing this with you!  I just make my family eat what I eat....it's not exactly the same as having them \"on board\"!  Oh well....at least they are eating what I eat for the most part so I don't have to cook 2 dinners each night.  I am glad you were able to walk and your arm is responding well.  I too would look for a new PT if you don't find one aggressive enough...you have a lot to lose here so I would be aggressive.  I think it's amazing that you are working through chemo.  I just could not do it and I have a great STD plan so I decided to take advantage of it.  I am completely scatter-brained so I don't know how you do it!  I am glad you will be closer for radiation treatment....that will save so much time in the car and give you more time to rest or do other things.  When do you start that?  Are you staying with a friend during rads?  Oh and I was one of those jealous gals....I was an A+/small B before surgery....can't wait to be a C!",

Perfect..   I do know what you mean about people forgetting about what you are going through.  It's odd how they just move on with their life....no one helped or gave a crap when I went through 9 weeks of chemo....that was a bit hurtful.  I guess since that happened 2 months after my surgery by then everyone was \"over it\"....too bad I wasn't (and am still not over it).  I just wanted to wish you good luck tomorrow...I will be praying for you.  I know everything will go perfectly!  Annie:  I too wonder if it will ever get easier.....if so when.  I think the mind takes longer to heal than the body.  I don't think you can ever really get over the fear associated with this.  It permanently alters your mind.  It's like a tattoo or something...no matter what you do it is still there as a reminder.  I hope that in time we can find a way to have peace in our mind at least 95% of the time.  I wish for 100% of the time but we all know that would never happen.  The chemo did stink Annie, but think of it doing it's job.....makes me feel better knowing it was trying to kill off anything lingering around.  Shannon:  The BC does feel a little isolating....and lonely.  It is hard to realize everyone is \"over\" my diagnosis and just moves on with their life.  I wish I could \"just move on with my life\".  It's like they think this is all over or something...I wish it was all over!  No one gets it...that's the lonely part.  I wish someone would just send a card to say \"how are you today?  I am thinking of you\" at this point.....It is hard to do this with kids.  They add more stress as they don't get it either and misbave and it adds so much stress at times.  Sometimes I just had to excuse myself and go up stairs when my 4 year old was unmanageable - I would just say to my DH  \"I don't have the energy to deal with this right now\".  That is hard to feel like you can't even parent....makes me feel like a failure at times but it was all I was capbable of during chemo at times.  I hope you survive the trip.  When is your exchange date?   I go in 10 days......I want it over with. My TE's don't bother me much, but I can't wait til they are gone! So you all want the BBQ update hu?  Well it was torture for me for the first several hours.  I got there and DH's SIL and neice didn't even say Hi to me when I got there (they have never called, emailed, sent a card or aknowldedged my BC since my DX and they live 35 min from us).  MIL of course acts like we are best friends...hugs and kisses as soon as we got there (blech!).  So about an hour into the party DH's SIL comes over..\"Hi Maria, how ARE you?\"  A few exchanges of doing ok etc...there were several awkward silences (because I think she is an a-hole for not even sending a card)..and she says \"well you look good\".  That was it...nice.  I am so DONE with them.  We were there all day and her daughter never even said hello to me (she is 9).  Nice hu?  Would you allow your kids that behavior?  My son is alwasys instructed to go say \"hi\" to aunts, uncles, friends, etc...when we arrive somewhere.  He is always told to give a proper goodbye before we leave with hugs too.  Her daugher never even said goodbye...my SIL kind of waived and say \"by Maria\" when I left.  I am glad we will move away from his family - then we won't have to deal with them.  I brought all my own food - snack, appetizer and black bean brownies for dessert.  I popped a huge bowl of popcorn to bring so I also snacked on that.  We had some really good friends of ours there so I hung out with them.  I avoided MIL and SIL for the rest of the party.  They never really talked to me (which was fine with me really).  I did teach my class yesterday...that was fun.  Today we may head to the pool for a while (I will hide in the shade of course - no pool for me just in case the rash wants to make a return). THe rash has been gone (knock on wood - please!).  I hope it stays away so surgery can go off as scheduled.  That's all for me ladies.....nothing else going on.  I hope you are all having a good weekend. ",

Suebee - how are you doing this?  I feel completely fine...I can't stand not working out or doing anything....I am so bored!  I know what you mean about shopping for work clothes. I did before I went back to work last month.  I went to Loehman's...do you have that store?  I got a few summer weight sweater sets, black pants, gray pants and two cute dresses.  A black A-line skirt can go far with your wardrobe too.  It was not that expensive.  Another place that has good sales and nice business clothes is The Loft.  I shop there a lot.  If you hit the clearance rack you can find lots of cute stuff...they always have lots in small sizes too but I am not sure those will house your new ta-ta's!  If I tell my DH there won't be a \"ka-bam\" he will be so bummed out.  I will wait to tell him.. Thanks for understanding how I feel.  You are so lucky you did not have to do chemo...I know that's why I look like crap. Renn:  LOL at the mojo comment.  Certainly mojo is still on hiatus......can't find mojo anywhere.  I know I have to look harder for poor DH.  I cannot imagine DH taking tammy....men are babies anyway....can you imagine?  I am glad you have surgery scheduled...oh and don't need a colonoscopy!  How long will you have to wait for your dr to try the TE again?  Are you a candidate for any other types of reconstruction?  Just curious.....  Oh and I am trying to embrace dear old tammy.....this is day 3.  Yippee...... Redsky:  If I remember correctly we had similar measurements, right?  (I am 5' 3\", 31 inch ribcage, weigh about 122 lbs now).  I don't feel like my implants are too wide though they are larger on the side than my pre-BC breasts.  But then again, they are bigger all over.  I was worried about them being too wide and discussed this with the PS before surgery and he assured me he would use the largest size he could that were still in correct proportion to my body.  My PS filled me to 510cc's with TE's and then downsized me to a 450cc implant.  I did get the high profile smooth type implants...FYI.   I did hold up just one of the cups on my size B bra from before surgery....I am not sure it wil fully house my new foob.  I think I may be a C after this.  It seems like the whole breast may not fit within the wire area.  I can't tell though and my PS sad NO bras for a month...not even jog bras.   I would say I don't have a lot of cleavage without a bra on but when I lay down on my side they push together more (they actually move - unlike the TE's!) and I can see that once I put a bra on it will give some cleavage.  I do wish I was a bit bigger but I am OK with what I have.  I would be curious what your PS says.....let me know how the pre-OP goes. Melanie:  OK just because he is married with kids it does not mean anything...some men are just like that!  I think he has a little crush on you! :)   When do you do your modeling photo shoot?  I am dying to see it...you have to get the photos so we can see them..... Oh and thanks for saying he's \"not old\".....as I am in my mid 40's too!  LOL!  Oh and I needed to update you all...my itching subsided and a few days before surgery my skin actually felt completely normal again.  Well...the itching is back....ugh!  I woke up at 5:30am with ny arms, neck, chest all itchy....by 6am I was in the shower seeking relief.  I am so frustrated....no doc's have taken me seriously and solved the problem.  This has been going on since Easter...UGH!!!!!  I am trying a new lotion my sister brought over the other day.....maybe this will help.  I am not optimistic as I have googled and found a whole bunch of people online that have the same unsolved problem due to chemo......no one told me about this.  They all act like it's not a big deal too....you try itching for 2 months!!!  My skin is super sensitive to anything that touches it too......this ain't any fun! What should I make for dinner tonight?  I am thinking a chicken piccata (lemon, caper sauce) and adding in some portabella mushrooms I need to use up.....sound good?  I have had no motivation to cook lately...what's wrong with me? ",

The one cream seemed to help for a while this afternoon. I will check in tonight...I am going to pick my son up at school.....shhhhh!  Yes, I drove today.  I had to get to the derm and then made a Target run to pick up DS's birthday invitations I had printed....I can drive fine.  I am not waiting 2 more weeks!

Annie - I looked at the coobies online last night.  I think I may need to do some shopping online today!  They look good.  Weight watchers is a great program to help keep you in check.  We will have to share some healthy recipes too!  The refined things are hard to avoid...I am trying too. I cleaned out my cabinets and pantry yesterday and got rid of all white rice, pasta, bad oils that I can't have and such.  I replaced all of those things with good, healthy, organic alternatives.  I feel good now that most of the junk is out of the house!  Good job on the elliptical!  Keep it up!",

Cindy - that's great you are getting those exercises in.  I am also so glad you are seeing a PT.  I noticed a difference on the first visit!  I am using that pully thing in my PT sessions.  It does help stretch things for me.  So nice people can actually buy one if needed.  Thanks for the link!  I totally agree on the strength vs endurance thing.  I have just been cleared to go to the gym!  (yea!).  I plan on starting with very light weights and doing sets of 20 reps of things to work the shoulders, chest and upper back.  I am also focusing on rotator cuff as those muscles are easily weakend and I was injured during my first surgery (lumpectomy and SNB) in December and have had rotator cuff pain since.  I can't wait to do something for my legs and butt again too!  My first gym visit will be Monday.  Will let you know how it goes!  That's great on the exchange!  I am hopefully doing mine at the beginning of June (my chemo is delaying mine - boo!) Anniemomof3:  Sorry you are feeling fatigued....if you can get in a little exercise - do it for less time and a little less intensity.  Everyone says if you keep moving you feel better.  Have you been drinking your water? You need it so much around those chemo days.....drink a lot to flush that chemo out of your body!  As far as exercises - my PS nurse cleared me to do what I want as long as I use good judgement and listen to my body and start off very light and progress slowly.  THe main thing is stretching so none of the muscles tighten up (which they will after surgery).  I don't remember, but do you have TE's?  THe main muscles effected by our surgery would most likely be the shoulders, chest and upper back.  I also think it is important to continue to include the abs/core strength as your body is weakened in some areas and if your body is weak you may need your abs and lower back for more support in doing things and moving around. I also wanted to share some information on magnesium.  It is also important to make sure you are getting good amounts of that in your diet daily.  The daily recommended amount is 310mg for adult women.   It works in production and transport of energy within the body. It is also important for the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Magnesium is involved in the synthesis of protein, and it assists in the functioning of certain enzymes in the body.  Black beans - 1 cup - 120mg Broccoli - 1 cup - 22mg Halibut - 1/2 fillet - 170mg Peanuts - 1 oz - 64mg Frozen okra - 1 cup - 94mg Oysters - 3 oz - 49 Plantain raw - 1 medium - 66mg Rockfish - 1 medium - 51mg scallops - six - 55mg squash/pumpkin seeds - 1 oz - 155mg soy milk - 1 cup - 47mg (not best for ER/PR+ gals!) Spinach - 1 cup cooked - 157mg Whole grain cereal ready to eat - 3/4 cup - 22mg Whole grain cereal cooked - 1 cup - 56mg Whole wheat bread - 1 slice - 24mg USDA Nutrient Database for Standard References, Release 15 for Magnesium, Mg (mg) Just thought this may be helpful. So today I got up and did my 40 min walk.  I was tired and had a headache, but I went anyway.  I also did my exercises this morning before I went to get my fill.  I am now at 360cc's!  I am feeling tight now and having some pain so I am going to take my tylenol and do another hot shower before stretching and rehab exercises.  I know I won't be sleeping well tonight...oh well! So, no one has suggestions of how I should cook that awful cauliflower?  Ick.  I need to find a way to enjoy it so I can benefit from it - right?  I doubled up on broccoli today at lunch so I am one up on my veggies.....so I could avoid the leftover cauliflower..... :) Get those exercises is gals...you are on your way to a new you by spring!!!! ",

So last night was a long night.  My back was so tight.  The tylenol and xanax helped me get about 5 hours of sleep.  I was hurting this morning too, but I did already do my exercises.  I do know that it really helps even if they hurt.  Keep doing them ladies.  I am doing them 3x today since I am so sore from my fill yesterday.  Last night I made stuffed peppers...yummy!  This is a great, healthy option.  I like to saute garlic, onion, mushrooms (chopped fine), diced tomatoes, hormone free ground turkey and some fresh herbs in olive oil.  Mix in some raw parmesan cheese and cooked brown long grain rice.  Blanch the red or green pepper for 5 min in boiling water.  Fill them with the mixture.  Put some of your favorite spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish...put the peppers in and top them with more sauce.  Cover and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  I served with a spinach salad with lots of fresh veggies...I also like to double the stuffing recipe and freeze the rest for use at a later date.  When peppers are on sale, I pick up a few and thaw the mixture and dinner is ready quick!  Just wanted to share something healthy and fairly easy.  If you have little one's like me, just take the stuffing out of the pepper.  My son will eat the stuffing...we are working on the pepper part!  Let me know what your exercise plans are for the day.  Normally every Saturday morning I am teaching my aerobics class at 9am....I miss my real class but am so happy to have you all in my virtual class here :)   Be healthy today! ",

I did all my exercises and stretches for rehab right at the gym.  I feel so nice and loose today after all that.  I can tell you that my range of motion has increased so much since 2 weeks ago even with getting weekly fills.  This just reminds me to tell you all how impotant it is to do those stretches EVERY day!! It does make a difference!  Really!   Not too much on the agenda today.  I did my grocery shopping at Meijer - I went to check out what they offer organic.  I got almost everything I needed so if you havea Meijer near you and are looking for organic foods, they have a good amount of choices.  It was limited for produce but I was able to find enough.  They don't offer hormone free meat though...making a separate trip somewhere else for that.  Costco does have organic chicken - FYI in case you are looking for some.  My bill was way less than shopping at Whole Foods (which I love, but is so expensive!!!). So what exercise are you all doing today?  Anyone started any light weight training or yoga?  Let me know!  Supersally:  What kind of puppies do you have?  I had two border collies but sadly lost them both in the past few years.  I miss having a dog but am not ready now to adopt one just yet.  What a great way to get motivated to exercise!  I am glad you have a support group there - that's awesome!  It must be a tremendous help to have friends to talk to that understand!!! Keep up your good exercise!  I am going to keep trying all through chemo to do my exercise.  ",

So today is going better....I slept better last night and feel like a new woman today.  I did my 30 min on the elliptical and a few weights but my chest is feeling tight so I backed off a bit.  I went and got my blood drawn to check blood counts and they were normal.  It's officially 1 week after my first chemo.  Let's hope it goes just like this for the next 8 weeks.  Did you all excercise today?  What's everyone cooking for dinner tonight?  Last night I made ravioli and used the wonton wrappers as the noodles.  They came out good.  Stuffed them with a mixture of organic ground turkey, spinach, garlic, onion, herbs, parmesan cheese, egg and some tomato paste.  My 4 year old even loved them.  Tonight is taco turkey burgers.....yep.  Mixing up some diced small veggies with organic turkey meat, egg, wheat bread crumbs and taco spices.  I am going to serve it up with a little organic pepper jack cheese, salsa and sauted poblano peppers/onions.  I need some more cooking ideas....ladies, what are you making that's healthy?  I am always looking for ideas....I love cooking!  Tonight I have to bake more banana muffins.  I made them for me on Sunday.  I make them with honey to avoid refined sugar, egg whites (no fat), and wheat flour.  My hubby and son love them...they ate them all!  I am glad I found something healthy I like, but they ate my stash!  My 4 year old had a melt down this morning because there was only 1 muffin left and he wanted two!  He was mad that daddy ate the other one....I didn't even get one!  LOL!  Oh well...I am happy they like my healthy stuff.  I can't decide whether to start a BC cooking blog or just do a cookbook for BC ladies.  Since I am hormone receptor positive, it's hard to know what is good to eat and I am doing a lot of creating my own recipes so my family can eat what I eat.   I need some cooking inspiration for next week....as I have my menu planned for this week already. Redsky:  I was just thinking about you last night and wondering when the  big day was.  I am so glad you are almost there!!! You will get through this OK.  Please continue to pop in and hang with us!  We will get you back in shape in no time!",

SueBee:  Sorry they couldn't fill...don't worry you will catch up to us \"coconut\" girls!  It only takes a few fills.....really!  I am glad you are healing and can exercise!  That's great news.....don't you go nuts in zumba or anything...be good!",

Oh how she would have been such a comfort to me through all of this......I miss her.  Hug your pup for me today!  I too have been having all kinds of odd pains in my upper back and sometimes my arm since all the surgery....I don't kwow what it is from.  Glad I am not alone!  Maybe it's age! Annieof3:  It is strangly deceptive..good description.  It makes me feel like I am lying or something...oh well.  Whatever.  I am over it now. Hillck:  those fills are getting me sore too!  I get my fills on Fridays and then I don't exercise on the weekends much (I just to do the rehab stuff) so by Monday I can workout again.  So take a day off if you need to.  The fills are not comfortable and things do get tight.  Try to continue to stretch though if you can.  It always is easiest after a warm shower.  I also liked to do it before bed so I would be less tight and could be more relaxed to fall asleep.  Supersally:  That's a good book.  There's some deep stuff in there about how the body works.....crazy.  I too am doing all the same healthy stuff.  You may want to read my blog later (when I get done).  I am talking about hormones and dairy products and am sharing what I have learned and how to find good products to eat.  I decided to add my learnings on all of this to my blog because I know it's so confusing and thought it may be helpful to others that read my blog.  I will have it posted tonight...I stil have a few things to add.  Redsky:  hang in there girl!  You are doing great!",

SueBee:  I am glad I am skipping the fill!  It finally does not feel like I have bricks in my chest which is a welcomed break.  After the next fill I will be over 450cc's for sure....lordy!  My back feels a little better this morning...I hope the pain goes away soon.  How sore are you legs today?  Hurts so good hu? Annieof3:  I would love another dog I just can't do it with a puppy and breast cancer.  I am actually waiting til later this year to see if I get laid off from work.  If I will be laid off and working out of my home (I have a side business I have been starting while working full time and it's my plan B should I get laid off) I would be more likely to get a dog so I would be home more to take care of it.  WIth my other dogs (I had two highly energetic border collies) I had to hire a dog walker for a few days a week to get them out otherwise they were too rambunctious.  We would walk them when we could in the evening, but being a mom, wife, working full time plus teaching aerobics (oh and all of the entertaining we do) was making it hard.  For now I will continue to dodge my son when he says \"when can we get another dog?\" .  He wants another border collie just like our other dog....they require a lot of work because they are SO smart and so full of energy and if they don't get that out of their system, the are destructive.  Supersally:  How are you feeling post chemo?  Double up on the water to flush the chemo out of your body.  Just force yourself to drink water.  My SE didn't hit until day 3 post chemo.....I hope you feel good the whole time and have no SE! Annielynn:  WHen do you find out more about the lump on the sternum?  What exactly does your doc think about it?  I hope it is nothing.  HOw does it feel after that fill? I am 410 cc's and the last fill is what messed up my back.  I hope you are feeling ok and the bricks in the chest feeling goes away in a few days.  Is this your last fill or do you have more? I am glad you hit the gym girl!",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

SueBee:  for lipstick I finally gave in and went to Aveda.  I feel like woman again with good lipstick!  I got two shades and like them so far.  I have not tried that specific Burt's Bees lip stuff though but so far had trouble finding organic or more natural lipsticks.  So glad you got go zumba!  I wish we could all go workout together......so wish there was not so much distance between us girls! Supersally:  Good choice on dinner!  Good for you.  I bet it tasted good too afterall.  There is nothing wrong with splurging here and there, but it does feel good to make a good choice and still enjoy the meal!  Another thing that is a great price at Costo is Organic Olive Oil.  I got a large bottle for $9 and some change.  It's Fillipo Berio organic brand too which is what my mama uses (since I was a kid).  Add that to your list.  I was there yesterday and they had a 12 pack of large, organic braeburn apples for $4.99.  There were SO GOOD!  I don't usually see those there..I hope they start carrying them because it's my favorite snack!  I will have to post my good finds at other markets for you guys.  Please do the same as it will help all of us save some money and know what's available.  Those pancakes sound great...you must post the recipe!  I just bought buckwheat with the intention to make a bunch of pancakes and freeze them for quick re-heating in microwave.  I haven't settled on a recipe yet though! As far as getting more veggies...here is my tip.  Once a week I saute a huge pan of the following:  (all organic) mushrooms, onions, garlic, red pepper, parsley, spinach and olive oil.  Through the week I use it for panini sandwiches with lowfat organic cheese, toss it in whole wheat orzo with parmesan as a side for dinner, throw it on wheat pizza crust with a sprinkle of parmesan for healthy pizza, put it over chicken, toss it with brown rice.  By the end of the week it has been eaten and if it's that easy because it is already cooked you can easily get creative.  You could even throw a layer over some wheat lasagna noodles with sauce and some organic ricotta for veggie lasagna.  Just an idea.....it's working for me. Rennasus: Glad you are going hiking.  I am being lazy today...I rest on the weekends after my M-F workouts right now.  I feel great!  I had a decent time getting through chemo #2 with minimal side effects. I was busy this week...not much time for blogging with my DH out of town.  I want to blog about fats....oh there is some bad stuff in the fats in our pre-packaged foods (from Anti Cancer book).  It shocks me how the bad crap is in EVERYTHING!  Don't get me started....I am so jealous it is 90 degrees there!  I was happy it was just a bit sunny this morning....it's still a bit cold but getting warmer slowly.  My hyacinths are coming up...crocus still blooming. Tulips are coming up too.  Can't wait til they actually bloom! I want to get some pansies in my pots in the next week or two! I just wanted to share that this month's Cooking Light (April) magazine is worth picking up.  Not only does it have some GREAT recipes (I have picked too many to try in the coming weeks!) but there is a really good article on Whole Grains and another really good article on Meats (grain fed animals vs. grass fed animals)  really worth reading!  I would pick it up if you can or at least read a bit at the store when you have a few minutes.  The article on whole grains really explains the differences and what kinds are the best and how much you should have.  Let me know if you pick up the magazine.  Would love to hear what you think.  You fit gals have a FAB weekend! ",

Redsky:  What did your doc say about the black stool?  That can be an issue with GI bleeding...I don't want to worry you, I just want to make sure you are OK.  I hope you are feeling better....Hugs!  It will get better.  I can honestly say that 2 months after my surgery is the BEST I have felt in the past few years!  All of my other body aches are gone (injured foot and hip) because I have been taking such good care of myself.  You will feel better....a little more each day!! Hang in there.  Soon you will be like me - 9 weeks out and feel wonderful.  Supersally:  I have chemo next week.  How do the weeks in between go SO FAST????  Ugh!  Good luck!  I hope you do OK this round.  Melanie:  Awesome on the 10K.  You amaze me!  How did chemo go?  I hope you have NO side effects this time......hugs! Annieof3:  Wow you world traveler!  Sounds so fun and so needed!  I hope you are rested and feeling better.  My hemoglobin and iron are low from the chemo now.  I am taking Iron pills and hope it helps.  I keep eating spinach...gave up red meat so not doing that.  Trying to build up the iron but they told me it does not rebound quick..takes time.  I hope you are healing up well.  I picture you at the beach or pool with that hat and sunglasses looking like a movie star or something!  How did it work in a bathing suit?  I am so scared of the TE's in my bikini.  I guess I have to go shopping for a new bathing suit to get me through early summer with the TE while the stores have a good selection.  Here is the first recipe for our collection. My husband LOVES this one (it's my own recipe) and always has seconds.  Tomato and Artichoke Bruschetta Chicken 4 boneless chicken breasts (I use organic) 9 oz artichokes (from jar or frozen and thawed) - quartered (can't find any organic) 4 fresh vine ripened or roma tomatoes diced (I use organic) 1T balsamic vinegar 1T Olive Oil 1 cup chicken broth (I use organic) ¼ cup bread crumbs (I use whole wheat) ¼ cup parmesan 3 T basil - chopped fine (fresh - organic if possible) S & P Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.  Pour chicken broth into casserole dish (11x 13 or so).  Place chicken breasts in casserole dish.  S & P chicken to your liking.  In a bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and toss well.  Spoon the mixture over each chicken breast to cover most of it.  Cover with tin foil and bake for 25 minutes.  You may need to cut into chicken to see if it is cooked through depending on how big chicken breasts are.  When chicken is almost done, remove tin foil and bake 5 more minutes to let top get a little color.  I like to serve this with organic brown rice and steamed broccoli with EVOO and garlic.  Calories:  240; Fat:  7.6 grams; Carbs:  21 grams; Fiber:  5 grams;  Protein:  23 grams Let me know if you give it a try. ",

If my surgery gets delayed, I told my friends they can just wait on me hand and foot all week and carry my bags up to my room.  I am not putting anything else on hold that is fun right now!  I am done with that and plan on going on vacation!  Oh and the other PS did call back and was willing to take me if I needed to change.  Nice to know I have an option.  SueBee:  My boobs look huge right now!  At leas this is bigger than what my real impants will be....my hubby is obsessed with them but that is a whole other story I won't go into.....and just think, I was worried he would no longer find me attractive after surgery....don't know what I was thinking! Renasus:  So glad you are healing well.  That is great news!  I am glad you found a new trail...maybe some new motivation to keep you moving!  Fabulous!  I am glad you can start fills in May.  It's fun to watch them grow!  I have been waiting all my life for the \"booby fairy\" to come....and she finally came! Annieof3:  glad you are staying away from the other stuff...me too.  I get too freaked out.  I need to stay positive and focus on what I can do to be healthy and get through all of this.  I am reading the Anti Cancer book.  I also read the Foods That Fight Cancer book....both are great and really help you overhaul things.  I am LOL at the coconuts.  I am worried about getting through Memorial Day weekend and early June covering these things up!  I think I will go shopping for a suit now.  I am going to find something that looks distracting....maybe a print or one that has the straps that come up and tie behind the neck.  I am a bikini gal...don't know how I am going to keep them both in a top since they are uneven.  Should be interesting......hopefully I won't be kicked out of the public pool! Silia:  I too am considering therapy just to cope with all that has happend.  Right now I didn't schedule it because I am still going to PT twice a week, getting weekly fills, chemo every three weeks and a blood draw weekly.  I just don't want any more appts!!!! I finish PT after next week I think so now may be a good time.  I think there is so much to process that it will help to have someone to talk to and provide perspective.  I hope it helps you through all of this.  It is one LOOOOONG road!  Glad you have a personal trainer....that should be some great movitation!  Do whatever exercise you can - when you can.  If you have 10 minutes, go for a walk.  You don't have to do some big, structured activity to get exercise in.  Try do to a little each day!  You can do it and you will feel better when you do.  Supersally:  Good luck tomorrow in the chair.  I will be thinking of you.  I am always so busy the day before chemo too....trying to get everything organized and meals prepared for a few days in case I feel crappy.  I hope it goes well and you feel great!!!",

I wanted you to know I am seriously considering starting a cooking blog using the principles in the Anti Cancer book.  I talked to my DH about it and he was even excited as he loves to cook too (we had guests over for dinner last night..he made chicken marsala, orzo with garlic/parsley, garlic green beans, and a spinach salad with goat cheese, almonds, goat cheese and sundried tomatoes).   I am trying to figure out how I am going to juggle my new art business, cooking blog, full time job, aerobics classes, being a mom/wife, working out and taking care of me.....  Yes I am completely type A and completely crazy (pazzo completo in Italiano).   I really want to do it though and my husband wants to contribute with me on the blog.  It would be fun to do it together...we are both foodies and cook together all the time.   You will be the first people to know about it when I get it going.  Rennasus: I am so jealous you are near a beach....the best I can do is the Detroit River!  Ha!  It's not even worth the effort to get there going downtown and all (it's not a nice area as you can imagine).  I am glad the pizza sounds good...it does feel good to eat REAL food that is actually healthy.  My son loves making pizza so it's fun to teach him how to cook and he is learning about healthy food in school (at age 4!) so now he asks me \"is this healthy?\" before he eats just about everything!  I am so glad I can teach him this at such a young age!  SueBee:  I will have to make the business or the current job work...there are NO jobs in Detroit since the auto companies are the only industry here.  THe unemployment rate is really high here.  I don't even want to think about it.  I hope you can find something job-wise.  I am so jealous you got BFF time.  Mine is 5 hours away.  She is coming for my last chemo for 2 days though.  I can't wait to see her!  She is also coming in early June with her kids for the weekend.  She is also going on vacation with us in August.  I am so glad I get to see her so much.  We try to talk on the phone but it is usually limited to her time driving to/from work when we don't have kids around or dinner to make.  It was almost 80 degrees here today!  I guess I have to paint my toenails tomorrow - it will be sandal season!  Have you ever tried turkey burgers?  I do all kinds...southwest, italian, greek...if you add a lot of seaonings and stuff they are really good!  I do it as an alternative to beef.  Just another guilt free idea. MelanieAnn:  sorry you felt so bad...glad you are getting better.  I am so jealous you can do a 10K run.  I use to run and would run one longer run each week - 6 miles or so and a few shorter runs (3/4 miles).  I have not gotten back into it for longer runs since my son was born (he's 4 1/2).  The most I have run in the past few years is 4 miles.  I keep having injuries......so I have avoided it.  I actually have wanted to start running again but figure my docs will have a fit if I do it now.  Oh well....maybe later this summer when I am done with chemo...then I can do whatever I want without getting grilled about it.  That is awesome on the running.  I now have a new goal.......thanks for the inspiration!",

I want spring to come!!!! Redsky:  that's great that all is going well!  After like 2 fills you feel like a woman again!  Keep up the range of motion exercises after the fills.  I always got so tight again for a few days after fills.  I usually do the stretches after a hot shower when I am warmed up and again before bed so I loosen up so I can sleep well and not be so tight when I lay down.  I noticed that after each fill it would take about 5 days for me to feel not so tight but I was getting 100cc's on some fills which was a lot!  Keep us posted.  You are doing great!!! Supersally:  what a wonderful day!  I so wish I could have been with you....that lunch is making me hungry now!!!!  I know what I am having tomorrow...as it is Friday during lent so no meat for me....I usually do omelettes for lunch if I am home on Friday.....sounds so good.  I am jealous it was warm...it was 20 degrees this morning...brrr!  I am glad those pups are keeping you going if I am not around - ha ha!  I also went to the mall today and got my rings (link at the top) and went to Aveda and treated myself to some more make up.  Two new shades of lipstick to give my face some life.  It felt good!  Rennasus: that is great news!  I know what you mean on this stuff.....it seems like you are always waiting for the other shoe to drop and it's hard to really relax.  For me oncotype was 17 but I am grade 2, pre-menopausal and had angiolymphatic invasion present.  I am going the chemo route...it stinks, but I have to for my son and husband.  I am so happy for you.  I too will get tamoxefin when I am done...just another adventure after chemo I guess.  All of this is so emotional...it's hard to believe good news...but you did get good news so try to relax and celebrate.  You can pull me up from my chemo hangover in the coming week as you will have the strength...I need your strength on this one my friend!  I think you should make those brownies I posted and celebrate a little... :)  Now you can focus on healing that incision and move on.  Stay focused on that. ",

Saturday night DH is taking us out (he doesn't know that yet....but he is - he he!).  I hope you all exercised for me today!  What else are you cooking for dinner the next few nights?  I am working on next week's menu.....

I have taught there for 9 years!  I emailed her back and politely told her to shuv it and rubbed it in her face that I was out for BC and it never crossed my mind that while I was fighting cancer I would be replaced.....I totally played the \"cancer card\" and I don't care!!!!  I am soooo bummed.  I never even got to say good bye to my class. I have known many of these people for 9 years.  I guess I will email the few people from my class I coorespond with and tell them what happened and try to meet them out for breakfast on a Saturday.   I am just so sad about this.  I have decided it is OK to be sad about this today but I will not waste time and energy stressing over it like the \"pre cancer\" Maria would.  I am going to let it go and move on and find another place near my home to teach (that club was 30 min from my house but we use to live over there so I kept teaching there for the past 7 years after we moved because of the people in my class).  I am taking a deep breath and moving on.....I guess I have to put together my aerobics resume now.  Another thing...I don't have to worry about whether to tell my class I had BC or not anymore...I guess it won't really matter, right?  Enough said on that.....or as Forest Gump says \"I don't have anything else to say about that\".   I hope you all had a healthy day!  It is a short week - yea!  I am going to get the Easter goodies ready tomorrow.....Jayden is so excited!!  SueBee:  I too had boob greed...I am 510cc's now.....that makes me very greedy considering I was an A+ or very small B before BLMX!  I am excited about finally having clevage!  (so is my DH!).  I never thought I would fill this much.....but the boob greed got me!  I hope to be a C too with a 450cc implant.  That's my plan......  Did you ZUmba today???  Hope so! Supersally:  Nice little rack you have going at 480cc's!  You are almost catching up to me!  What size implant will your PS use at exchange?  Just curious....  Good for you going out without the wig.....who cares what people think?  You are beautiful and this stupid BC does not define you at all girl!  Did the person you know ask you about your hair?  Just curious what someone would say to you in that situation....I can't imagine saying anything if I ran into someone I knew that no longer had their hair.....So glad you got to workout a bit....it will keep you moving!  My PS also does fat grafting from thighs and make nipples from the tummy.  I asked if it would be like liposuction and a tummy tuck and he said no.  He said they need such small amounts it would not really be noticable.  Should I ask him to use a lot of fat then and make huge nipples??? LOL!  I was hoping for lipsuction and a small tummy tuck in all of this too! Annie:  Glad the girls are \"perfect\".  That's nice to hear.  My PS does the fat grafting when he does nipples which is 3 months after exchange at the quickest.  It will be a long time before I have everything done....probably next year since he won't do tatto's until 3 months after nipples. ",

Annie: Your dinner sounds so good.  I love sundried tomatoes and always try to find ways to include them!  That is so awesome that you finish on Monday.  What are you doing to celebrate that when you are feeling good????  Retail therapy?  Spa day?  Dinner and tons of wine???  I can't wait to be done in 2 weeks (not like I am counting or anything.....).   Maybe we should start posting an exercise of the day along with the meal of the day.  I am working out with my sister tomorrow and told her I was going to make her do the really sore hamstring exercise with me so we can both be in pain in the coming days.....he he! SueBee:  Love the marsala recipe.  I make mine with shallots, EVOO, WW flour, chicken stock, marsala and tons of mushrooms.  Now I am craving it....no, there is no more in the freezer - I ate it the other day!  Did you get to workout today?  I love the green onion tip.....very cool.  I often have some left over and don't know what to use it in and it goes bad.  I will remember that.  I also do that with chopotle peppers in adobe.  A small can has several in there and since they are so hot I can't use much and then  I have leftovers.  I put 1-2 peppers in a baggie or small tupperware and freeze it for the next batch of chili or something else spicy.  Redsky:  I am fillled to 510 in a 350 cc TE right now.  They are not really bad....not as hard as I thought they would be really so don't let that stop you.  I am going for a 450 cc implant at exchange which my doc thinks I will give me a C cup.  Isn't it funny how all of our docs have a different formula for size?  I don't know who to believe.  Whippetmom told me I would probably want a 425-450 cc implant based on my measurements.  OH and I had surgery on 1/27 and I have only vacuumed twice (yes I have cleaning people come every 2 weeks but I have been avoiding it and milking it...he he!).  As far as the swimsuit I have one from before surger that worked without the padding in it (LOL!).  I can't believe it fits these boobs considering I use to wear it before as small as I was.  Boy it must have really sagged....even with the padding before surgery.  Oh well....this is a 3 piece set I have.  It has a bikini top, long top that covers tummy and bottoms.  THe bikini top has the triangle type shaped fabric over the boobs and ties behind the neck.  The trick is that the triangle part needs to come up higher to hide my ugly R side (TE is really high and looks like a shelf).  There is also a thin strip of fabric that goes under the breasts that is about an inch thick and is flat and then ties behind the back.  I like this because some of the bikini's are like a string bikini which has a thin string like thing that goes under the breasts and ties in back (and you feed the triangle boob part on to it - do you know what I mean?).  The string one's move around too much....look for one that has more fabric under the boobs.  I hope that helps.....I don't know how to describe that! Anyway....ladies it's a long weekend for some of us so enjoy.  I am spending tomorrow with my little guy as he's off school.  Yes - I am working out first thing in the morning so you all better hop to it too!",

Tonight's dinner for us is chicken enchiladas in a green chili sauce.  I add in food processed white beans with the chicken to add more fiber and to hide them from my son!  Works like a charm.  I will get it on the cooking blog.  I am having a hard time getting it started with some editing challenges, but hopefully it will be up soon!  Did my 60 min on the elliptical today and I was a maniac!  I had a lot of energy and I have no idea why but it was nice to burn almost 600 calories!  No wonder why I was so hungry at lunch!  OK and off topic here, but who is watching the big wedding on Friday?  I am a sucker...I will be watching......I rember watching Diana's wedding when I was young(er). ",

I am not sure I can answer your question exactly as I had BLMX with immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders.  I can tell you having the TE's under my pec muscles and expanding them with fills weekly had caused me SO much tightness.  I worked with a PT 2 days a week for several weeks and did the PT exercises faithfully twice a day for at least 6 weeks post op.  I started walking about 2 1/2 weeks post surgery and was back at the gym doing cardio and my PT exercises and streches about 4 weeks post OP.  I don't know exactly what cording is, but my tightness was in the peck muscle itself and where it inserts up into the upper arm area.  My PT use to massage that area and manually stretch me which helped.  I also started doing more stretches on my back and letting my arms/elbows fall open to stretch the pecs about 1 1/2 months post op and that really helped me.  I do not want to recommend any specific exercises/stretches as your doctor and PT may not approve....but if you are not getting relief I would be talking to the PT.  If he/she has not worked with MX patients before I would get another referral.  My PT was great and extremely knowledgeable on MX which was a benefit to me.  I can tell you I had surgery 1/27 and had tissue expanders put in.  I was tiny chested before.  I now have 510 cc's in each TE and have NO tightness in chest/pecs at all.  I believe doing the PT stuff, stretching and exercising did it for me.  Best of luck!  I hope it gets better for you soon.  Hey ladies.....I am enjoying Saturday with family. I got my blog started with only a few things posted right now.....I have some formatting issues and editing I can't figure out yet but at least I got it up and running for a start.  I have more recipes to add.....oh if I only had more time!  I will get on it in the next few weeks and add some things in.  Link should be below.....The Healthy Cucina is the name.  Tonight I made chicken marsala burgers.  If they taste good I will post the recipe!   Cross your fingers...they smell soooo good!  Making me hungry! SueBee: That's great on the job interview....sending GOOD vibes your way on that.  It is SO hard to plan anything for the future with all the treatments and surgeries...I am trying to have some fun along the way though.  I can't wait to spend a weekend with my boys in Chi-town!  Will be a blast.  I am going to splurge and get Garrett's Popcorn and some pizza....you have to live a little right???  So a trip to NH?  That would be a looong drive, or would you fly?  By the way - where are you in Ohio?  I can't remember if I asked.  I use to live in Cinci.  I LOVE your dedication to exercise on Friday night....good job!  I hope it warms up a bit so we can enjoy the days outside.  It was only about 60 here today.  Not bad though... Annie: I get done this Wed.  I will let you know how it goes.  Did this last round for you make you feel crappy?  Sorry.....but you know, it was your LAST one girl!  Once you get feelin' better you won't have to worry about that nasty old chemo again!  Well gals...it's the weekend so I have no exercise to report.  I take the weekend off to rest.  I ate a lot today though....I am on steroids from an allergic reaction from last week and they are making me hungry!!! I tried to be good...popcorn popped in organic EVOO with just a bit of salt.  Then the lowfat whole grain banana muffins started calling me.....ohhhhhh sooo good.  Will post them in the blog.

I did workout today and my chemo legs were dying!  OMG!  My legs are so heavy and feel like a ran a marathon even before I do anything.  I got on the elliptical and after 5 minutes thought I was going to get off and leave.  I did it though...slower than usual but I stayed on there for the full 60 minutes.  Thank God for good TV and good music in the IPod. Now I am pooped.  I treated myself to a healthy brownie (black bean brownies) and am relaxing now...........I thought I would be getting better and have more energy after chemo - maybe it's the anemia like Annie.....who knows.  Oh well........I will keep pushing through.",

Won't need suits so I guess a good resale shop will be an option (they are mostly from Ann Taylor...nice suits!).  Bathing suits and TE's do not go together.  I found that the one's that have the triangle like shaped fabric over the TE's is the best as long as they are thicker straps and tie behind the neck.  This tends to cover the top part of the ugly TE's better than lower cut tops.  I have one from last year that works OK without the padding in it (that I use to need!).  I can't wear any of my other bikini's - they have more spaghetti straps that are thin and expose too much of the upper chest/TE area.  Bathing suit shopping will be much more fun with my new breasts!!  I hope you get to ride today...the weather is bad here again. Annie:  I am DREADING going back to work.  Ugh!  It is especially hard knowing that as soon as DH gets a job I will probably just quit.  For now we are on my insurance and I have my exchange surgery next month so I will work from Tuesday until 6/22 then go out for exchange surgery for another month.  Hopefully by then DH will have a new job....then I can quit.  I am sorry the exchange got delayed....what is with the PS's?  It seems like everyone keeps getting delayed......I am waiting for them to call and reschedule mine.  I will lose it since DH is interviewing and we are trying to coordinate everything around my surgery.  Supersally:  Your weekend sounds busy but so fun!  We leave tomorrow for Chicago as soon as DH gets off work.  I will have everything ready.  It's a 5 hour drive with no traffic but we are driving about 4 hours and I have a hotel about 1 hour outside of Chicago for tomorrow night.  We will get on the move early Sat morning to drive the last hour.  It's just cheaper that way (parking is $45 a night in Chicago!).  Can't wait.....I need Garrett's Popcorn. Anyone ever had it?  It is sooooooooooo good.  I hope it is not painfully warm at the golf event.....90 degrees is hot!  I would be in trouble as I am still fighting this allergic rash from chemo and the heat gets it going worse.  Have a great weekend!",

I plan on going to the gym before work tomorrow - that should make for an early morning.  Oh what fun..... Renn:  So I guess you should nap daily and not attend anymore BBQ's...gosh I wish I could not attend BBQs and that would get me out of going to the monster in laws BBQ in two weeks!  I am glad the incision is getting smaller....that is good news.  I am only bummed it is taking it's sweet time in healing completely.  I can't imagine how frustrating this must be for you......I am sorry it has been so uncooperative!  It's not fair!  Too funny your PS was in Vegas.  Maybe he was checking up on you to make sure you were not out dancing and partying with that incision!  Supersally:  thanks for the encouragement with work...I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel but it's nice to hear someone else say it too!  How is your energy level?  I am still a little tired here and there but the itching just won't go away!  I hope your energy level is back.  Have you been able to exercise yet or is the body not ready?  I do need to find a counselor.....now with the pending move I may wait...I don't want to start with one and then have to start all over again.  Since DH has interviews this week/next week I will just see what happens.  If it looks like the move will be soon - I am waiting.  If no job offers I am going to get started.  Gosh I wish someone would give me a do not see or call list - I can think of a few people that have acted less than appropriate to me since my dx that I would like to not see or not call ever again.......(I guess I am a little bitter towards some family members that have not supported us in any way during my BC situation or even acknowledged my BC since dx in Jan).  I guess this gives me even more to talk with a counselor about! (LOL!)  Renn:  Glad your mom did OK.  I know how scary the first chemo is.....once she gets into things she will hopefully know what to expect.  That's too bad her first infusion lasted so long...but glad they were careful and made sure she was responding OK.  My tastebuds were off for a while.....food is finally tasting real again.  It makes eating not appealing when you can't really taste anything.  I hope she continues to eat so she has strength.  Hang in there with the chest pain...mine was like that too for a long time but it went away.  I hope yours will too with time and finishing the fills.  I will check in tomorrow night.....now that I am a working gal again I can't play on the computer all day!  Have a great Wednesday - be fit and healthy!",

Suebee:  Good luck tomorrow..I have a good feeling about you getting the job!  Oh and you surpassed me on the \"boob greed\" since I am a mere 510 cc's and you are 550.  You go girl!  What size implant will you get???  As my DH says \"those are some ginormous boobies\" ....ha ha!  I think you get the \"largest boob award\" in our group!  Anyone going to surpass 550 cc's???  Supersally:  I hear you on the chemo legs...mine have turned a corner in the last few days.... I notice the burning less.  I am 4 weeks out of chemo and you are a little behind me.  Hopefully you will have less chemo legs in the next week.  Hang in there.  It's good you have been able to walk.  You just do what you can do....it's all good for your body.  I am so glad you are getting to take a girls trip.  You deserve it!  WHat do you have planned on the girl trip?  Shopping, lunch, spa, chick flix???  It all sounds fun to me!  I don't remember the last girl trip I had...maybe before I got married (I have been married 7 years....that's frightening....).  When do you leave?   Renn;  I am so glad your PS is so optimistic this will heal OK.  He would not say that if he didn't think it was true.  I know it is taking forever, but getting you healthy before doing anything else is the most important thing.  Hang in there!  I am sorry you too have not had family members be supportive or understanding about your situation.  It has really bothered me....I just don't want to spend time around those people anymore despite the fact that it includes most of DH's family and my own brother and his wife.  I know I should not harber negative feelings about things like this, but it does hurt especially when I am the type of person that tries to help others and be there for others.  I know I have to get over it......I am giving myself time to be bitter for a while and then I need to move on.  I guess I also look at it like this...I now know what I can expect from these people so don't expect anything different than what they have already done (or \"not done\" if you know what I mean).  On the topic of BBQ's...if you get that \"out of control\" at a BBQ, I want to party with you girl!!! (ha ha!).  I do hope you rest and get that incision healed up!  I want to hear that it is shrinking in the next few days!!!! Pattibear:  welcome!  I know my PS would not have let me do yoga, but your PS may feel different.  I did not do much upper body stuff for a while but I had a port put in my arm for chemo not long after surgery.  I just got the port out last week and will start doing some weight training for my arms but I have surgery again in 3 weeks.  I would see if your PS will refer you to a physical therapist that specializes in MX patients.  They can give you some exercises and stretches.  Mine also massaged the areas where it was tight in the arm pit (where the chest muscle inserts) and that helped a lot.  It was super tight there.  If your PT gives you exercises and stretches, you can do them with them on the days you are there and then at home on your own the other days.  I did my PT twice a day faithfully and have no tightness at all in my chest.  Shannon:  I do agree it is odd to put my arms up above my head or something when I am sleeping.  It seems like that was hard to do for so long I forget I can do it now!  It feels good.  I can tell you all that stretching daily is SO important.  I don't exercise on the weekends much - I usually take Sat/Sun off.  By Monday, I am definately tighter in the arm pits and chest when I move around.  After I stretch, it feels so much looser.  You can't stop stretching...those TE's try to take control of those muscles I am convinced!  I also didn't know the Cancer Society had a booklet with exercises (my cancer center had their own booklet).  That's good to know because several people have asked where they can get a booklet of exercises.  That's also great you have been able to start yoga again!  I wanted to during chemo but when I got the port in my arm I knew it wouldn't work.  I just got the port out but I have surgery again in 3 weeks.  I guess starting yoga will have to wait until recovery from surgery.......",

Renn:  How is the incision today?   You better be resting.....eating well too.  Suebee: I like \"flattered and repulsed\".....too funny!  I too have had men check them out but I figure they are wondering why one is an inch higher than the other and why they are in my arm pits..... I am off to meet with my boss this morning.  I will have to hit the gym later today after that.  We are going to some friend's house tonight for dinner....I will be bringing a good salad so I have something to eat with whatever they may serve that is not so good for me.  I know wine will be involved......we always have wine when together.  At least I can taste it again so I may have a small glass.  Hit the gym if you can ladies...it's the weekend and it's too easy to not eat healthy when the weekend comes.  Oh and I have a fab recipe for slow roasted tomatoes I have to post on the blog.  They are sooooo good.  You can make bruschetta with them, toss them in pasta/couscous, put them on meat (chicken or seafood), put them on pizza....whatever.  They taste so good....me and DH are hooked!  I have not been cooking much since going back to work...a bit overwhelmed. ",

DH often wonders how I can watch it so much.  Cupcake wars is another one on late night I watch before bed.  I am an HGTV, Food TV and Cooking Channel junkie.....  I always wonder during Drive In's Diners and Drives what Guy Fieri's cholesterol levels are....anyone else?  That show features the most unhealthy food ever and I always wonder about his health because he eats it all!  My stomach would be a mess after filming that show if I was the host.  SueBee:  Hope you are getting some sleep....you are reminding me of what my next week or two will be like...blech!  After reading your posts I know I have to get my wedge pillow back out and stock up on stool softeners and laxitives.  My last surgery and first chemo had me needing an enema things were so bad.  I am so worried it will happen again after this surgery so I am going to take a ton of that stuff just in case.  Julie:  Welcome!  Stay a while and hang out with us.  We like to talk about good food, exercise, our foobs of course and families.  I think we even mentioned sex recently so you never know what is going to come up!  This is a fun group of gals.....I am sure you know that if you read the posts!  As far as constipation, I seem to be the queen of that around surgery or chemo times so here is my advice.  I take Senakot S in the morning and Docolax in the evening.  This gives me a stool softener and laxitive.  That worked for me.  I does leave me with some cramping before going, but at least I go (that is the lesser of two evils I guess knowing the alternative is an enema!!!).  Oh and Melanie, Supersally and I all had chemo and finished in the last month or two.....ask any questions you have. Renn:  What's the latest healing report????  I forgot to check out your photos on the photo forum.  I will do that...I hope it is improving.  I need to get my photos on there.  Maybe after surgery I will have time since I will be sitting around 24/7.  I took pre-surgery photos, photos after various fills but I have to take a photo before exchange of my 510cc TE ta ta's too.  So strange....did you ever think you would be taking photos of you boobs and sharing them with people on the internet?  At least it's not in a \"Weiner\" way!  LOL!!!  We don't have that bundt store.....sounds fabulous if they sell bundts!!!  Every time I hear the word \"bundt\" I think of my Big Fat Greek Wedding when the groom's parents bring the bride's Greek parents a bundt and they don't know what it is...anyone remember that?  Sorry...I am rambling...  Oh - also I think we all want to come to CA for a girls weekend.  Can you imagine us all hanging out at Renn's house saying \"look at my foob\" and cooking good food in the kitchen over wine????  Can we take over your house for a weekend Renn?  LOL! Redsky:  Your photos look great!  I am going to work on getting my photos on there soon so you can all check out my foobs too (this is so strange......to be saying that LOL!).  You know how you have gotten some pain in the chest area?  Yesterday I went for a walk and I had chest pain under my R foob and I had this pain back when I was getting fills and doing walking for exercise.  I have not been walking for months and I think it's something to do with the arm movements.  The elliptical does not bother me, but swinging my arms during walking does.....maybe if you are still having pain, change the type of exercise you are doing and it will go away???  Just an idea. Supersally:  I am a big fan of xanax.....SueBee I never would even take aspirin for a headache before BC...now I look forward to xanax every night.  Works like a charm.  How are those ankles Sally?  I hope better.  I wonder what is causing it??!?!?  The heat alone could cause that.  I can't imagine it being 100 degrees daily....we have had mid-upper 70's and sun this weekend.  It's been perfect weather. Shannon:  I told my sister about the kickstand comment....she was laughing her butt off!  She's a chemo infusion nurse so she deals with gals like us all day.  She told me she has actually had patients come in and lift their shirts and show her there foobs in the office!  LOL!  Can you imagine?  I could maybe share the foobs with you gals over cocktails, but never do that!  If you guys want more laughs, go over to the thread \"you know you are a cancer patient when\".  I laughed so hard I was crying one night.  I sent the link to my sis at work and the nurses will all in stitches!  I guess you have to find humor in all of this at times....even if it seems a bit sick.",

Melanie:  You are going to be sore tomorrow girl!  I love the energy coming from you!  Awesome!  You should ask your PT about bras and if that will contribute.  Maybe new one's would be good and could help a bit.  I have no idea on that as I have TE's that don't move when I jump up and down and don't require much of a bra......LOL!  Nothing like jumping around and your boobs stay still...very strange.  SueBee:  Glad you made a decision....good for you!  I like stable hours and a set schedule because I am a control freak and like to plan things... :)  Renn:  I am sorry that you have to get the TE removed :(  You know though if you get it out and get healed up things could be so different when you go back and try to start this process over.  I know it must be disappointing to you but at least you have made a decision.  Some times the anticipation of the outcomes or decisions is emotionally exhausting and draining.  Maybe you are breathing a small sigh of relief now?  As far as that comment about chemo.....it was not validating what you are going through and would have been offensive to me too.  People always seem to deminish things to others because they have not walked a mile in their shoes!  Disregard that comment from her and just realize that we get it....not many people do.  I often think people think \"well you are only stage 1 so what are you worried about\".  We all worry.  When you live it, you will worry and be scared.  I don't know why people don't understand that!  Your walk sound amazing.....I want to come to CA and hike with you!! Supersally:  I feel the same way about doing stupid crap at work..seems like such a waste of my time and energy!   Some of it is so worthless but the bad part is that some of the other people I work with have not learned that lesson yet and they think it's all \"productive\" and \"great\"...blech!  I hear ya girl!  Work and jobs have a whole new meaning after BC or something similar..........I think others may say I have a bad attitude or something...he he!  Oh well...walk in my shoes a mile and maybe they will understand too!",

I left at 5:30am got to the hospital at 6:30am and surgery was at 8:30am.  It was 3 hours at least as my PS had to revise both sides to even things out....I did not get home until 7pm last night.  I got realy nasesous after surgery and they gave me all kinds of stuff for that which knocked me out (compazine and a patch).  I could not wake up and get moving. We finally left and on the hour plus trip home I got sick twice (thank God my cousin had a bucket ready and waiting for me in the car!).  I went right to bed when I got home.  My son walked me up the stairs - he insisted and gave me tons of hugs.  So cute.....  I am popping vicodine every 4 hours.  I am pretty sore from the revision part I think...it hurts most where he was going to move things around (undrneath and down on the sides under arms).  I slept on and off since surgery yesterday.  I would sleep an hour and wake up and be up for an hour or so....but I do feel more rested today for sure.  So much to catch up on.  Suebee and her bra shopping extraviganza is hilarious!  I think she should just get a shirt that says \"32DD\" on it!  LOL!  Shannon...love the balancing tricks.  I never tried that but I bet I could have put the TV remote between my boobs for safe keeping (you know how you always misplace it??).  Melanie...people asking if boobs are real....really?  I can't imagine anyone having the nerve (or stupidity for that matter) asking that!  That's like asking someone if they are pregnant when you don't know if they are for sure...a big NO NO!  People are nuts.  Supersally - glad you were swimming..I am watching you girl so keep moving!  Also I expect a hair measurement update next week!  I bet it will be 1/2 inch for sure by then!  Renn:  glad you are well!  Annie:  work does stink...I am going to enjoy my month off but then I will be back into it again..blech!  As far as the foob results which I know you are all dying to hear about...I got a 450cc high profile round smooth implant.  I looked this morning....they look like they may be even (not lopsided) and they are a little smaller than my TE's.  The shape obviously looks different than the TE's (thank the Lord!). I am still a little bandaged so it's hard to tell...Sue Bee:  I am not in a bra or anything..my PS said no bras at all and if I do a jog bra if I need to put something under clothes, only one that hooks/unhooks so I don't pull any stitches pulling a tight one over my head.  Interesting how he does not want me in anything and your PS has you all strapped in tight......wonder why they all do it different.??!?  Oh well.  Once my boobs don't hurt I will try to balance something on them so I can say I did it too!  LOL!  I will write more later...Have a healthy day ladies!  Thanks for all the well wishes and cyber hugs!  I felt them all!",

Where do I start to respond?  You have all posted so much.  About plastic wear for food...I have replaced most of mine with glass wear from Anchor Hocking.  They have plastic lids that have no BPA.  The glass part can go in the oven (up do 425 degrees), freezer or microwave. (no lids in microwave though).  Some of the glass wear does not allow the oven so make sure you read all the info first.  I love the glasswear and lids because when you put them in the freezer or fridge, they are stackable.  Better than corning wear with those lids with handles that you can't stack.  I don't know why more companies don't use BPA free cans and packaging....I wish I knew.  I will do some more reading on this in the next week and let you know what I find out.  As far as non bean protein...quinoa is an option and oatmeal.  Here is a link with a few ideas:  http://commonsensehealth.com/Diet-and-Nutrition/List_of_High_Protein_Foods.shtml The foob sensation....I don't even know yet really.  I still have some numbness and since I still have my steri strips until Tuesday I just have kind of stayed away from the foobs a lot.   The rash is still bothering me...I am just putting special creams on about 10x a day to manage the symptoms....I am sick of it......I really have no idea if/when it will go away and the dermatologist doesn't know either.  They said up to 12 weeks from the end of chemo to get that out of my body.  I am bummed...we leave for vacation on 8/5 and now it seems like I won't even be able to be in the sun......that in addition to the fact that my sister can't join us now has me really bummed out.  I guess I will be sitting in the house by myself all week while everyone enjoys the sun and beach.....that will suck.  I can't even drink either.... Well..I have to go back and re-read everyone's posts and respond to everything else tomorrow...off to look at houses.  I can't believe we could be out of here in a month or so...........things are about to get even more crazy here.....bring on the xanax! ",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

Sue Bee....what are we going to do with you and your leaking?   OK - yes you must back off some things for now but it will be worth it.  Let things heal.  Work on relaxation and your nutrition.  That is still part of the big picture in getting your energy and body back.  Keep me posted on your progress. Glad some of you endulged today too with some chocolate.  It's that time of year:)  Everything in moderation ladies - that's just fine! One more round of my exercises before bed....get your secound round in for the day!  Oh and my dinner tonight was good and healthy.  I made tacos with lowfat ground turkey (hormone free and vegetarian fed), with fat free organic refried beans on a whole wheat flour tortilla (I found some that were without soybean oil and bad fats at Whole Foods) and garden fresh salsa.  I had a nice salad on the side.  It was really good, healthy and my 4 year old even ate it (minus the salad).  Think of some healthier ways to make some things you enjoy.  My dinner was guilt free and tasty.  Just an idea for you all.  Have a good night!",

Let me know how you are all doing on exercises.  I didn't get to the mall to walk today but I had a ton of erronds to run today so I did a lot of walking around anyway.  That will have to do for today.  I will do my exercises again tonight.  Get that second round in ladies! ",

I was busy with stuff all day today - grocery and cooking and my sis and her kids here all day...I am doing my exercises tonight though!  I need to for sure.  Just so you know, we are getting blasted here with 6-9 inches of snow and an ice storm.  My sis and I got in an accident in her car today on the way home from the grocery store...we are fine - shaken but her poor car....not drivable.  Boo!  My poor sis.....  Leesie - welcome to our workout club!  As far as the exercises...did you do TE's?  I would first get some direction from you PS so you know that you are not doing anything you shouldn't be doing.  If you want a copy of the booklet I got from the cancer center where I am getting treated, PM me with your email address and I will email it to you.  I would then sugget you show it to your doc before doing anything since I don't know what your doc has for your restrictions.  I too had BLMX and TE so this is what I am doing in addition to physical therapy twice a week.  They are mostly stretches and some range of motion movements - with some very easy strengthening with 2 lb weights.  Let me know!  I personally think I keep my energy level up by walking and staying busy.  I notice that around dinner time I get tired, but after dinner in the evening I get a second wind.  I think the fatigue can be a normal part of this process....so listen to your body.  If your doctor allows you to walk, do it!  I have been hitting the mall several mornings a week.  Be careful with stretching things as you don't want any stitches to tear.  Talk to your PS for restrictions first.  So glad you joined us!  Also, where are you in MI?  We may be neighbors! Cody...your walks sound so much better than my mall walk...and less expensive.  No one should have to walk by Pandora jewelry in the mall on a daily basis.....it's torture!  LOL!  That's great you are doing 45 minutes so many days a week!  By spring you will be good to go!  Let me know what your doc says about stretches.  If you want my booklet from the cancer center to show your doc, let me know.  I can email it..PM me your email address.  LLL6500 - I just started the PT.  I am going to go as long as I can as I think it will help me get back to teaching my fitness classes.  I have found it helpful at this point in addition to the exercises and stretches I do on my own.  I am sorry you are having a bad few days...don't fret!  That's probably normal. Your body is going through so much.  On those days where you are fatigued from chemo and such, just treat your body and mind well. Put in a relaxation CD and take a long hot shower to relax or a bath.  Eat right and healthy those days.  Even if you are not \"exercising\" you are treating your body well and helping it rebuild itself.  All of that is part of the process.....give yourself permission to have tired days...It's OK.  Try a short walk - even 10 minutes is better than nothing if you can.  My IPOD is my best friend on those days where I don't feel like it.  Good music helps pick me up!  As far as massage, it could help with overall body aches and helping you relax.  Just make sure to see a massage therapist that has had special training for lymph drainage as we are all more at risk of lymphedema after surgery.  Hang in there...I hope tomorrow is better :) Anyone else checking in???? I am off to do my exercises for the night....we'll chat tomorrow!",

SueBee - As far as suplements, talk to your doc.  Most don't have an issue with you taking a multi-vitamin but I would ask about other things just in case.   If you are feeling like you are doing too much, then you probably are!  Slow down a bit....let's get you healed!  Again eating right, resting and such are part of getting your body back to a healthy state.  If you are still doing those things and not exerising, you are still doing your body good! ReSky - Yea!  I am glad you have a date.  I hope this one sticks for sure!  I am sure you are getting tired of the waiting.  I am so glad you are exercising now...it will make a difference later.  Like I said, don't forget those ab and back exercises now as you need them a lot those first several days post surgery to move around.  I could really feel my abs and needed that strength to move around in bed and get up!  We will be coaching you through your surgery and after....keep joining on this thread throughout!  You will have a lot of cheerleaders here! Did you all get your rehab exercises in?  I am feeling less tight in the arm pits these days...the exercises and stretches work ladies if you do them daily!  No skipping out on me now..... (smile)",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

Suebee:  Yes, they keep filling me up.  It's odd though because they don't project out forward...the TE sit more towards the arm pits and they seem to fill sideways...not out as much.  They are definately bigger than I was before surgery and I too hoped to be a fully B or small C.  I am going to call the nurse and discuss this with her.  I wonder what 410cc's will yield with my exchange surgery and real implants......They don't look huge on my frame...I am 5'3\" and weigh about 119 lbs and wear a size 2/4 now (due to the weight loss and dietary changes with BC).  I hope to stay about this weight (as this was my normal size for years and year...working full time and kids has made me get bigger in the past 3 years!).  The other thing to think about is if you do gain some weight back, with implants, your breasts will not get bigger with weight gain.  I am curious what your doc says on how many cc's he wants to fill you to in order to achieve a full B or small C with exchange....let me know. ",

I did my elliptical for 45 min this morning and then headed to the PS office.  Good news and bad news.....the good news is skin looks good and has room for more fills.  The bad news is my PS thinks I have capsule contracture going on in the R TE.  If I was not on chemo he would recommend surgery to take it out and fix it and put another TE in.  Because of chemo that is not an option.  He thinks that is causing the back pain too because there is more scar tissue building up.  He wants me to keep doing the PT in hopes that it helps a bit.  For now no more fills. I am at 410ccs and he thinks he can make me a full B with a 375 cc smooth high profile implant.  I wanted to be a full be or small C.  I wish I had a little more projection but since I can't fill anymore that isn't going to happen....boo!  He said if my back heals and I really want one more fill we could try in a few weeks, but he doesn't think that will make much difference.  He also said he can do some microfat injections when he does my nipples under the nipple area to add a bit of a projection under the nipple.  Now I am worried the same thing will happen to the new implant and the scar tissue will come back......I am also bummed because he said he won't do my exchange surgery until at least 6 weeks post chemo.  I was originally told 4 weeks.  My summer is going to be screwed up because of this.  I know a few weeks shouldn't matter, but it does at this point to me. I am sick of this crap and want my life back.  I had hoped to be at the pool with my son by late June.   Now I can't even have surgery until mid to late June.   I know there is nothing I can do about it.  It just is disappointing.  Oh well.   It's not the end of the world - I will get over it.  It's the least of my worries right now I guess. ",

So, here is our official daily check in thread.  If you all don't remember, I am an aerobics instructor so you will now be me virtual class :)  Get off your behinds ladies....get those rehab exercises going.  If you don't have any exercises, please call your doctor and ask for them.   I don't want to tell people to do things they shouldn't be doing.   I am looking for a website or online resource that mirrors some of the exercises I have been assigned for BLMX with TE surgery as a reference.  I have not found anything yet.....will keep looking and post a link when I find something.  Let me hear about today's activities ladies!!!!  Don't make me shout at you :) Let's get those bodies moving!  Think spring with new bodies and nice new breasts!  We are all going to be looking beautiful ladies...just beautiful!

I would see another doctor and get whatever it is removed. It's not worth ignoring in my opinion. After my experience I was angry that they basically let BC grow in me for 6 months because they didn't want to do a biopsy on the lump.  My mammogram was done a few months before I found the lump and nothing showed on that mammogram.   The diagnostics they used clearly didn't work for me at all. ",

I got up every morning and got my son off to preschool too...never missed a morning all through chemo.  I cooked dinner every night.  I had a few days where I was not feeling great, but I never even had to take one pill for nasuea other than what they gave me on infusion day.   I am not advocating chemo, I am just sharing my experience.  I did have some side effects...for me the worst was the skin rash that lasted 3 mo's.  It was awful!  I had burning, itchy hive like skin for months.  It finally went away in July eventhough I finished chemo in May.  I knew for me that I could not sleep at night knowing I passed up the chemo...especially since my son is so young.  I know there are no guarantees but I know I did everything I could.  I don't want any regret....  Oh and you can see photos of my hair on my blog.  I posted a few weeks ago.  I usually wear my hair blown out straight but with cold caps you have to air dry.  It looks frizzy, wavy and shorter because of air drying.  My hair is down to the bra line on my back now that I wear it straight again.  I cut off 3 inches after chemo...my hair continued to grow all through chemo.  If you have any other quesions, PM me.  I don't mind.  Good luck with your decision.

I had to make a choice ultimatly.  I opted for chemo based on grade 2, angiolymphatic invasion and the fact that I am a mom of a 4 year old.  I want to do everything I can to be here and see him grow up.  I knew I would never forgive myself if I skipped chemo and the cancer came back, but I also know there is no guarantee it won't come back.   My compromise was doing cold caps to keep my hair during chemo.  My med onc supports cold caps and has them in her office.  I hope they work...I am 15 days post my first chemo and no signs of any shedding on my head though I am losing other body hairs.  I have another week of waiting to see if it works well but the cold caps have a very good success rate with my type of chemo treatment (taxotere and cytoxan).  My treatment takes 9 weeks....4 cycles, one every 3 weeks.  I will be done by the first week of May and the summer will be mine, hopefully with my hair still in tact! ",

It would have been nice to have people continue to send things for laughs and encouragement.  The days I got things like this...brought me to tears with joy in knowing how much I was loved. 3.  If she is having surgery, there is a thread on the surgery board that explains items that are helpful to have on hand.  My friend brought over button down PJ's for me which was great because I could not put clothes over my head for a while right after surgery.  4.  Since she is having chemo, there is a chemo thread that also tells what things are good on hand.  As far as food for her, I liked bland things like graham crackers, wheat crackers, homemade soup (my favorite), pasta dishes, toast, bagels.  Carbs were what I wanted.....I did lose my ability to taste things after several weeks so food didn't taste good at all. They do tell you to avoid lots of raw foods during chemo in case of bacteria so keep that in mind.  I also did all organic foods and if she has a hormone related BC then anything with hormones is out unless you get it organic or homone free.  5.  Care packages:  I got a few and they were great!  These are some of the things I got: prayerblanket, small pillow, spa booties, spa hot pad thing (you put in in the microwave to warm it up), lotions (skin dries out from chemo!!!), magazines, healthy cooking magazines, books, movies, quote books, pajamas, snacks. My biggest advice is listen, don't tell cancer stories, don't say \"you are strong\" (I HATED that!!!), support her family (kids or spouse) and ask how they are too, check in frequently, don't complain about trivial things in your life (it's hard to listen to trivial things when you are going through BC), tell her how much she means to you..... You are a good friend....good luck to your friend.  I know how hard this is....",

I realize this is much more tolerable than other chemo options.  I am not afraid so much of being tired or nauseated.  I am more afraid of having it be visually obvious to my son.  I also don't like the idea of my cancer being so public (no hair = cancer, right?).  I just want to fight this battle privately and we have only told family and a few friends with specific instructions that it is not to be discussed with others.  I am usually a private person.  That is just who I am. I know if the doctors tell me there is benefit to chemo for me with my specific tumor, I have to strongly consider that as my #1 goal is to live and be here for my son.  I just wish that the surgeries would be my only treatment now so it would not potentially scare him as much.  I know it probably seems odd to some of you that are moms too that have gone through having chemo already.  For me, I just want to protect my son.  It's hard to think I will have to tell him potentially scary things or have him see things that may scare him.  I know we will have to be reassuring to him and as honest as we need to be with a 4 year old, but it will break my heart.  All I want to do is keep him happy, feeling safe and loved over everything.  It doesn't mean I can't do that with chemo, but it will be probably harder for me.  It kind of feels like you are sending your child over to a hot stove and you can't do anything to stop him from touching it and you know it will hurt him.  Maybe I sould irrational, but I am still getting use to the fact that I have cancer and am only at the beginning stage of this.  I have not gotten to a place where I believe everything will be OK again.  I guess since I lost a parent at a young age but not to cancer (I was 2 1/2), it had a profound effect on my life and still does.  I am not saying my son will lose me, but I know all the thoughts I grew up with after having something so traumatic happen to me at a young age.  I just want him to have a \"normal\" childhood.....more than anything.  Somehow cancer was just something that I considered \"normal\" I guess.  I know you can't protect your child from everything, but as a mom you want to.  I know a lot of you ladies are moms and have gone through chemo and had your kids see what that is like.  I know it was probably hard for you too.  I am sure many of you will tell me your kids are doing OK after everything.  For now, I continue to pray that my tumor will be not likely to return so I can push through the next year of BLMX and reconstruction and close the door on BC in several months.  Thank you again for all of the support and sharing your experiences. ",

Today I got up and took a bath alone!  Got dressed alone.   Brought my lunch up to my bedroom by myself (I feel like this is something my 4 year old would say and be proud of!).  I have not taken any pain meds since 5am this morning...getting my drains out tomorrow!  I could have had them out today but we have a blizzard....darn snow!  These are the things I used the most in the past few days: lip balm, hand lotion, tons of pillows, wedge pillow, pillows under my knees, blanket to throw over shoulders, camisole provided by hospital with pockets to hold drains (this was the best!), tank tops with shelf bra, soft open front hoodie like sweat shirts, heating pad (well, something you put in the microwave and heat up and put on neck/legs or sore body parts - or under the covers to warm you when you are cold), laxitives, stool softeners, sleeping pills (ambien), water, lots of healthy food (veggies/fiber, protein), wheat crackers, nice comfy jammies.  As far as medical supplies - shoe laces for keeping drains out of the way when you bathe, drain gauze pad dressings, peroxide, q tips, paper medical tape, alcohol wipes to strip drains and antibiotic cream to clean drain sites.  I guess I felt compelled to come over here and try my best to ease your mind just a little.  I know how it feels.....please know you will be OK.  You can get through this.......HUGS to all of you.  If you have questions PM me.  I don't mind at all.......Best of luck to all of you wonderful gals!!!!  I am sending healthy vibes, quick recovery thoughts and prayers!!!!!  :)",

I did exceptionally well - better than anyone expected.  The things that helped me were: I chose not to buy in to feeling like crap because of chemo.  Yes, sometimes you do feel like crap, but I started every day saying I feel good and tried to live that.  I worked out daily - even on the day I had bad bone pain.  I kept moving.  That made all the difference for me.  I exercised 5 days a week through all of chemo...didn't miss any workouts except infusion day. I also planned for side effects...iced fingers/toes, took prilosec for heartburn, took claritin/aleve for bone pain, took stool softeners/senakot for constipation, etc.....Once I had my experience from the first round (body aches, bone pain, constipation) I knew how to plan for the other treatments.  The other treatments were much better. I also planned ahead at home...I made food and froze it before chemo so I had stuff to eat that sounded good.  I loved home made soup.  I also ate tons of pasta - carbs was all I wanted. I tried to do normal things...I got up and got my son off to school every morning..didn't miss one.  I feel like if I laid around, I would buy into feeling crappy so I just tried to do normal things.  On the weekends after chemo I just didn't plan much in case I felt crappy but the rest of the time we did everything we normally do.  It's only 9 weeks...then you will be done. It went really fast for me.  I still can't believe I am done.  I hope this encourages you...I was petrified before chemo....I get it!  I didn't think I could do it..now I can't believe I did it.  You will say the same thing in 8 1/2 more weeks girl!  Feel free to PM me if I can help support you.  I would love to do that...so many others did that for me through all of this. Best of luck! ",

I am freaking out! If you were stage I, did you get chemo?  If so, what made the doctors decide it was important for your treatment (age, dx, oncotype dx, etc.)?  I am meeting with the medical oncologist on Monday.  I also plan to have BLMX and for now they say I won't need radiation.  They do recommend Tamoxofin though as I am pre-menopausal.  Chemo is the last thing I am freaking out about!  Just let me know your experiences.  I know I have to do what they tell me if it's the best thing, but I am trying to get my mind ready to accept it.  Ugh....I hate BC -can I just say that????

They BS will want to access the situation for surgical options.  Depending on what your test results indicate, they may want to do surgery first.  If that is the case, it is not uncommon to meet with an oncologist after surgery when all final pathology is available.  If they think you should have other treatment first, then you will see an oncologist earlier and have surgery later.  Best of luck!  Keep the faith!  ",

I had benedryl in my premeds to help avoid allergy to the chemo....still got a rash after chemo 3 and 4. I took prilosec the day of chemo and for 2 days after just in case. I also drank lots of water the day of chemo and the following days - probably at least 15 large glasses of water per day. I also got super hungry from steroids....ate tons of carbs!!! It was the only thing I wanted other than home made organic veggie soup.  I did not have any nausea and never took the nausea meds at all..I was really lucky.  I did also ice my fingers and toes during taxotere to avoid neuropathy in fingers and toes.  That worked fine for me - I had no issues with that. ",

The exercises make all the difference!  Ask your doc for some range of motion exercises and stretches.  Be pro-active!   I know how scary this is and how much anticipation anxiety there is....I just want to say good luck and send a big HUG to all of you.  You WILL get through this...I am proof!  If you have questions or if I can help, PM me.  I start chemo this week so I will have a lot of time on my hands in the next few months! ",

I am freaking out! If you were stage I, did you get chemo?  If so, what made the doctors decide it was important for your treatment (age, dx, oncotype dx, etc.)?  I am meeting with the medical oncologist on Monday.  I also plan to have BLMX and for now they say I won't need radiation.  They do recommend Tamoxofin though as I am pre-menopausal.  Chemo is the last thing I am freaking out about!  Just let me know your experiences.  I know I have to do what they tell me if it's the best thing, but I am trying to get my mind ready to accept it.  Ugh....I hate BC -can I just say that????

YOu can't even tell other than the incision.  The incision is small and closed nicely.  I am sure it won't be noticeable, but then again I won't have my breasts anyway.  Like everyone else said, the decision is yours to make.  I have elected to go more aggressive despite the fact that I am stage I with a less aggressive, low grade, hormone receptor positive cancer.  I am a worry person with a young child. I hope this will be my one and only dealing with BC and after my surgery I can close the BC door forever.  I know I would worry too much about lumpectomy.  That's just who I am.  I am very at peace with my decision and know I am doing the right thing for ME.  Please continue to ask questions and post your concerns.  The experienced gals here will help and support you. Educate yourself on these tests and what the results mean so you can factor that into your decision making.  You are doing great.....you will make the right decision for YOU and feel OK with that.  I wish you good luck and health in 2011!",

Taking pain meds every 4 hours around the clock to keep pain away, drinking lots of water.  I feel really good.  You ladies will do great!  OK - can we talk poop?   Is anyone pooping yet?  Good lord!  I have not gone since Thursday morning and I have been taking stool softeners and such since Friday.  I can't possible eat any more food until I go!  I feel like my stomach is distended and solid.  I keep eating high fiber food too..bean soup, salad, etc.....Please tell me the tummy will start moving again soon!",

I am trying to do everything I can to be healthy...eat right, exercise, reduce stress, etc. I am trying to slowly put this BC thing behind me as best as I can. It will get better in time. I have also been on effexor and that has helped me deal with things better for sure. Just know most of us have been there. What you are feeling is normal. Six months is not a long time to deal with all that BC brings. Take it one day at a time. Try to see the joy in the time you spend with your son. Have faith and know you are not alone. Hugs!",

Get your test results sent to your PCP and gyno.  That will keep your current doc's informed.  Don't be surprised if they call you..both of mine did to check up on me and talk with me (which was so nice).  They are not so involved in my care at all, but you will want them knowing all that is going on. The BS will not be the second opinion (I don't think) because he/she is the specialist that will just do your surgery (MX or lumpectomy).  I would however suggest meeting with more than one breast surgeon just to see what they say and to find the one you feel most comfortable with as they will be handling your care.  I saw 2 breast surgeons - both were at national cancer institutes.  As far as resources....if you have a local cancer center they can put you in touch with everything.  If not, ask your surgeon for information/referrals for information.  I personally did not pursue a support group right away as I was too scared to hear worse stories than my diagnosis -so keep that in mind.  I was Stage 1 and was just not ready to hear the stories emotionally from patients with more advanced situations as I was having huge anxiety about my own situation.  I have chosen to do online support here which has been great.  I am also starting counseling to just help get through the rest of this.  I would also look into seeing a plastic surgeon.  If you do need to consider having a MX they can help you understand your choices.  I met with PS's from the start to weigh out all my options.  Again - I met with 2 PS's from national cancer institutes.  Get copies of your reports, scans, mammo's and full pathology report.  You will want to start a file and have it with you. When you get our pathology report, read it completely and understand everything on there.   That will help you formulate good questions for your surgeons.   Best of luck!  Hugs!",

I am in no way telling people to do the extreme things I did.  Each person has to make their own decisions and do what they feel is right for them.  This was what I felt was right for me after my dx. ",

They let me keep my IPOD on during the whole procedure......I listened to some calming music and just closed my eyes....what a long day!  Chemo in a week.  Anyone else doing chemo?  I need a chemo buddy or two.  I start March 2nd on taxotere and cytoxan.  Anyone else???",

I had a SNB and lumpectomy on 12/23 and am doing ok.  I got a late Xmas present today when they called and told me.    It was nice to know nodes were clear.  Now I just wait for Her2 and oncotype and the upcoming BLMX.  One step at a time, right?  I keep hoping somehow I can dodge the chemo bullet for my son's sake (he's 4 and I was hoping we would not have to teach him about cancer at this age if I only need surgery).  I know if I need the chemo I have to do it and will get through it.  I just don't want to do it...like everyone else right?  I keep praying for some more good news.  I hope 2011 brings all of you a little good news too.  Cheers!

I agonized over to do chemo or not...I know how hard it is.  Hugs!",
