I don't suggest anyone else try using will power alone as I have no idea how it works, but I do believe that a lot more of our health could be affected by our stress levels, attitude, beliefs and more, but it's a very hard thing to study as even I don't even know how I'm bringing my temperature up. It could return to the usual low levels tomorrow for all I know. Note well, this does not mean I believe we negatively thought our way to BC which I find a very blaming, offensive idea when anyone dares to say that to cancer patients. ",

In the past I have experimented with changing different things with limited success, mostly because I lose interest.  One area that always worked for me for decades was waking myself in the morning, even as early as 5am to get to the airport.  I would set an alarm to go off 5 minutes later as a backup then turn it off when I predictably woke on time.  I always woke on time when I worked after I started this method. So now I have declared my intention to experiment with raising my temperature through willpower alone, hopefully I won't lose interest as I feel it's important for health in so many ways. Today I've been on 36.6 all day which is closer to normal than my usual 36C, so I'm getting there. ",

Since this is the stage III forum I do prefer to know I'm chatting with others in the same stage, otherwise we may as well just have one general forum where everyone joins in.  At the same time I appreciate hearing from anyone with their experience or thoughts if they are helpful, no matter what their stage. I ask that people just show the respect and compassion they would like for themselves.  I appreciate that many are under incredible stress and so I just say to please do whatever it takes to find peace in your life.

Stage IIb `... and has spread to the axillary lymph nodes.\" Stage IIIa `... and has spread to axillary lymph nodes that are clumped together or sticking to other structures.\" When the tumour is larger than 5cms it belongs in IIb if there are no nodes and IIIa if nodes have \"clumped or stuck\" but then there is nowhere when nodes have not \"clumped or stuck\" with a tumour greater than 5cms. Of course there are other reasons for staging not affected by the nodes. I assume these changes are the result of prognostic statistics gathered from many studies and wonder why they haven't been more widely publicised. I know one of my cancerous nodes had ruptured but have no idea whether that puts me in stage II or III.",

Beesie, I welcome your comments which were well informed and impressively put and I've found this an interesting discussion. It's a juggling act trying to, on the one hand express our grief and fear and on the other hand try to keep upbeat and enjoy our lives without too much fear.   When one expresses fear and another is trying to look ahead to a long happy life we clash but in the end we've all been on both sides of the fence and we need to acknowledge our sisters feelings whatever their stage or outlook. In the end we're on the same journey. Love and hugs to all my wonderful sisters. (Said with tears in my eyes, literally).",

If more elderly women get it than younger then there may be a percentage of women dying from other causes after getting mets which would upset the statistics, but surely not by such a huge amount. One in 4 or 5 looks much more likely and a lot less scary.",

Click on that link to go to the start and you'll see what sort of reception your question may attract.  82 pages, nearly 2500 posts of sometimes heated discussion.  I'm sure you've heard it all before. If you click on the name of the originator of that thread, wornoutmom, look for the link to send her a message and you'll find her a lovely person who has a lot in common with you who can answer some of your questions. The Alternative section has just been started and you're welcome to ask the same question over there. Unfortunately your title will attract a lot of people when it shows on the Active Topics every time anyone replies and most will be fearful for your wellbeing, but as 13 months have passed it's too late for chemo etc now anyway.  If you start a new thread you might want to give it a different title though it's a shame we alternative ladies need to do that.  Feel free to send me a personal message any time.
