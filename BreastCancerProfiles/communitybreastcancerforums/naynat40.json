I am overweight and highly claustrophobic, and even with an oral sedative I could not remain in the space for even a few seconds. Ive been searching for a place in MN that can perform the breast MRI with an open MRI, or maybe even a larger bore. I have to get this done, and Im on the verge of panic. Any suggestions??
