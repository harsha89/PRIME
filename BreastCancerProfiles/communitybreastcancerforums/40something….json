I hope I can keep my 3.5 rating! Did you have the expanders immediatly?  I am waiting till after chemo, just wonder how that might have went. I have an expensive wig I have not been using too much yet,seems to be itchy and a little tight and hair could be thinned more to match what I'm use to, I had it hand made and I have a recheck/size/style day next week --I need to build the courage to tell them my complaints and have them adjust it for me. The color and overall style looks just like the old me!--- but I'm real glad I have options.  Around the house I love my bandanna's.",

I also am so relieved when I hear someone feels or has symptoms I am having-- for me it makes me feel it's not all in my head. Oddly that is one reason I put off having my 1st mammogram, I felt the lump but thought I was imaging things.  I also vow to be an advicate to young women to NOT IGNORE any lump!  And do not ask your boyfriend or husband(bless their hearts) if they feel it too, go directly to the doctors. I appreciate every exchange of idea or imput on this site---but the idea to exchange  gifts is too much for me juggling the house, kids and all these appointments makes my head spin.  My husband also is so busy with work and trying to make appointments with me. (I'm trying to find the time to thank all the wonderful people who have sent me warm wishes and are helping me though all of this) I feel sorry for those having to pay for the wig, my insurance will cover, but we have a high deductible and seeing my treatment has been in two calender years we are screwed with two years of high deductible!!  I know the exchange rate thing I would call and dispute the charge!  I have done that before and got my money back.",

Margaret- Good to hear your first tx went well, I hit (tennis)balls against the wall the other day at my gym. Arm felt great. Last week my hair all came out and I am adjusting, next week 2nd tx, I'm hoping if all goes well I will meet up with a friend the following week to hit.  Fingers crossed.  I have a cute tennis hat with the breast cancer logo, funny I bought it before I was diagnosed! I hope everyone is enjoying their weekends!  Cold here in Michigan, I was suppose to be in Florida this week, Oh well, at least I have all of you to hang out with.",

This is starting week 3 and I feel great, but I'm anxious about my hair falling out, not so much because I will loose it, but the unknown, people keep saying \"maybe you won't loose your hair\" or \"I know someone who had chemo and did not loose their hair\"-- it all drives me nuts, especially since I already ordered a wig. Today it is day 12 of TX on Cytoxan& Taxotere my head has been tingling for a couple days and when I run my hand through my hair I get about 6-8 strands every time.  I think it's starting.  I guess time will tell.Expectation and Anxiety have been overriding emotions in all of this. ",

I ordered it on ebay.  My Great nurse even let us use their tv/dvd player since my sister's laptop was not working.  How nice is that!! I made scones and everyone in the chemo room seemed to like them.  My nurse said \"Excellent choice for an English woman\" She even told us we could have lunch delivered to my chair for the movie (which we did) total time today was 6 hours, TC with Aloxi and Benedryl IV--pre meds emend, steroids,stool softeners, ativan(for all that anxiety) & tons of H2O Slept for a couple hours when I got home.  My lower back is throbbing tonight, but overall I feel pretty good.  I am anxious if I will experience accumulative reaction, time will tell.  Neulasta shot tomorrow--- last time I had a lot of bone pain and severe lower back pain days 5-7---this time I have the vicadin ready to go fingers crossed. Hair was shaved last week after all the loss, very itchy.  I enjoy the bandanna look the best so far.  My fav is the one from my breast cancer walk FordCares a few years ago.  Today my hubby brought home 6 new colors of bandannas from our favorite outdoor store.  I asked my 8yr old son if I drew an arrow on my forehead would I look like Avatar (cartoon character/nicktoons) he laughed and said yes. check out my new avatar(pic) no pun intended",

Neulasta is not covered by all insurances very expensive , I hear that is why some take the 7 neupogen shots.  H2O- I feel is very important even for port or no port, I think it helps flush your system better especially when we are taking so many pre meds not to mention the chemo again  oh YEAH  AURORA-  Love seeing your the face that matches the spirit, you are beautiful GOOD LUCK TO ALL STARTING",

Good luck on TC my first tx was just fine. 2nd was rough but I was told again today by nurses I need to make sure I do the full steroid dose for tx#3 and hopefully I will not have the trouble I have encountered.  anyone from Florida, I'm sorry to hear about the situation there!",

Reading the report is even more interesting ( one part said--there is a .5 mm nodule in the lung--can not rule out metastasis)Yikes--  not to worry my onc says that is sooo small and not in a common place for metastasis, we will watch and recheck after chemo-- and chemo would address it if it was anything.... so don't get too worried I'm trying to say those scans are very hyper sensitive and my onc says it shows everything and sometimes worries people too much about nothing grannie, krista, laura,bridgit everyone--the best",
