The place where I am being treated does not offer radiation in prone position... but I keep hearing that prone is much safer, especially since my cancer is on the left. I'm trying to find another place where they would offer the prone option, but it's hard to find out until I actually have a visit with the radiation oncologist somewhere... Anyone know anywhere in the San Francisco Bay Area where they would offer a prone option?",
