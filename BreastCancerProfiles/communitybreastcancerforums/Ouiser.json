It had been exactly 1 yr since my last exam. I went for a diagnostic mammogram on Monday however they did a bilateral diagnostic because it was time for it. On the right side they found nothing- however on the left they found something that I could not feel. They preformed a sonogram, the radiologist herself came in to tell me that she was concerned and I would need a biopsy, that my doctor would call me back with the appointment time. I know they have many patients- however I am really anxious. How long should I wait for a call Log in to post a reply",
