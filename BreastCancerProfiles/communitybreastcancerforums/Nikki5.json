My surgeon suggested that I get a lumpectomy since my tumor seemed small & local. My gut told me to \"get it over with now,\" instead of having the constant fear or my cancer returning. I also felt that from a cosmetic standpoint at least my breasts would look the same. I found this decision to be extremely difficult as well. You're not alone. I spent many nights reading posts/research and crying over my frustration. I also had a tough time after surgery looking at myself in the mirror and my self esteem was definitely affected.  I'd say my only suggestion is to do what you feel in your gut. There is a lot of gray area with the lumpectomy/mastectomy question and the choice is very personal. Although the day of my mastectomy was one of the scariest days of my life I got through it and have no regrets. After my final pathology my surgeon even said the mastectomy (of one breast especially) was the right choice...due to the fact that my tumor was bigger than expected. Every few weeks, after each new tissue expansion, I feel better about my new breasts. I'm confident that in a few months they will feel like my own.  Good luck with your decision.",

My question is...if my nails start falling out what do I do? Should I wear gloves or wrap them in bandaids or let them breathe? Also, is there a way to help them grow back faster?   Thank you for your help.",
