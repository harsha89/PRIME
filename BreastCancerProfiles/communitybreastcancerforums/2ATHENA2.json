      "Content": "Jan 24, 2016 08:55PM - edited Jan 24, 2016 08:59PM by 2ATHENA2 I was on Xeloda. My tumor marker dropped into the normal level from about 700. An interim oncologist said \"Congratulations! we are going to take you off of this chemo.\" Why? Once metastatic, always metastatic I heard. Naturally, tumor marker bolted back up, but oncologist wanted to use Afinitor. Do Not Do It. I developed Pellagra (the mouth sores, stomachache, headache and rash they tell you about. Niacin and potassium helps that.) I had to have a tooth pulled. Wound has never healed. Bone at the bottom of a big hole. This condition, and the use of rinses containing alcohol and peroxide, gave me Trigeminal Neurosis on the left side of the face. I thought I felt pain when every bone in my torso and hips broke, but let me tell you! Neuralgia hurts. Super B Complex, Vit C, Magnesium and Manganese helped. For many of your side symptoms find books written by Adele Davis, such as Let's Get Well and Let's Eat Right To Get Fit.  She is a nutritionist in the 50's giving you the scientific lowdown on experiments with vitamins and exact dosages. Ebay, Amazon Used, or your own used bookstore. Afinitor doesn't get better. They only tell you it does.",
