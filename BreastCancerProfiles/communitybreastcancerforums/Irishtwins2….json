I went to the doctor and he sent for me an ultrasound and than I had a mammogram. I am now just waiting on my biopsy results. Going and talking to the doctor is scary, and I honestly felt stupid for worrying but its better to be safe. I cant see the harm in going to your doctor, especially if you are feeling worried.Â  Jenny :)",
