I lived in a super healthy part of the world, ate lots of veggies, berries, and some other fruits and wild game and fresh caught fish for decades and my own breads and cookies--absolutely no chemicals in my foods yet here I am. I was well exercised, very low BMI, good strength and endurance, yet here I am. My mother fed her children unprocessed foods and lots of veggies and fruit and not much sugar in the house (except for Dad's secret stash). I have never used chemicals to clean my house, never nasty bug killers or anything like that in house or garden and few skin products that weren't organic. Yet here I am. That said, I don't know what my mother was eating, breathing, drinking, using to clean her house with, etc, when I was in utero. I quit dieting when I was in my 20s, telling myself I would eat whatever I wanted as long as it tasted good and I didn't stuff myself. Sometimes I only ate oatmeal chocolate chip walnut cookies and milk for dinner, most times I ate lots of veggies and a little protein. Well, here I am. Was it all the sugar in the cookies I baked that brought me here? Maybe it was too much Haagen Das coffee ice cream. Venison? Salmon? Probably the red wine or gin and tonics? Yeah, too much tonic water. I guess at this point of NED I'm all for quality of life--food that tastes really really good and is grown by local farmers, baked by me or good bakeries and that makes me feel good and energetic. Good restaurants, wine dinners with other foodies--whatever I feel like eating each day (or whatever DH cooks)! I'm lucky in that I don't worry about how much I eat, since I quit worrying about food and started paying attention to my stomach I don't overeat. My Onc too thinks quality of life is first, food doesn't have that much influence but should be eaten in moderation. Fresh air and as little stress as possible. Few drugs, a healthy house. Life now feels, more than ever, short. I aim to enjoy the here and now, food and all. There seems to be other things to stress about-- bigger fish to fry, so to speak.",

A year ago I had tumors and spots all over my liver with no pain and no clue I had mets but insisted they investigate an enlarged node under my arm that had been enlarged for years but then changed shape. They biopsied which led to scans and liver mets. Chemo ended May 29th with no pain in my liver even while being poked and prodded and then this fall I started getting pain in my liver area. Ultrasound and PET scan and blood tests in December showed nothing. Still it hurts. Why? It frightens me. It makes me feel like they're missing something. Shoot, maybe it's just back pain--or referred pain. I wish I knew. It's a nagging worry. Otherwise--how are people with liver mets doing? I cannot complain! The Taxotere plus Perjeta and Herceptin knocked the tumors to nothing. Perjeta and Herceptin are keeping them undetectable. Hip-Hip Hooray! Miche",

One day, one hour, one minute--look to the beauty that is life, however much of it we get. Syrmom, I also have muscle cramps which started during Taxotere + H&P and have continued with the H&P. Can be feet, calves, hamstrings, arms, between my jawbones, stomach and are alleviated by vigorously stretching the affected muscle but a slight movement can bring it back. Electrolytes, all blood work is good. Taking calcium/Mag doesn't help, exercise doesn't seem to influence it, can happen anytime. So I can't say I've figured it out at all. None of the docs or PAs seem to know what drugs it's from or how to treat it. The Physiatrist just gave me gabipentin in the hope it will help with the neuropathy and just in case it helps with muscle cramps. I'll let you know if it helps. He also sent me to PT thinking that better posture and movement might help. anyone else on Gabepentin for neuropathy?  ",

Yea!!! for all of you! My sister came for my last chemo and stayed another week--that was heavenly since I usually take care of house, horses, and dogs no matter what's going on. But, hmmm, it was hard to let her do things--I kept having to tell myself--it's ok, you have liver mets and just did your 6th treatment of Taxotere, you can take it easy this one week. We did manage to get to Acadia National Park's carriage trails with 2 horses for a nice hack the day before she left--it was beautiful in the park and, even though I could hardly get out of a walk, a fabulous day to spend with my sister.  I was slated to do 6 rounds of Taxotere but now, if my scans this coming Monday show continued shrinking, I'll do #7 on Tuesday. That is hard to contemplate and has sent me into a spin. I was so looking forward to being done with the big T. My onc told me I was her healthiest patient and while she recommends 6 rounds she's ok with continuing based on tumor response and my response to chemo. I asked for it after reading this discussion. I've had mostly a fairly easy time. Some weakness and cramping in my muscles; mostly mild, sometimes worse, gastro distress; cracking skin; and many very tired days. Now tired and bad tasting food and a little neuropathy and muscle cramping seems to be the new norm. Oh, plus my mind has turned to mush. I think I've just settled in to feeling like crap but not terrible... so I asked for more.  SpiceyPetunia, how long will your MO continue with Taxotere? My MO wasn't reluctant but wasn't totally for it either. She's going along. Looks like we're looking at doing 8--so 2 more rounds. What's your MO's thoughts about more? ",

It doesn't hurt so much as theirs a weird feeling when I exert my legs and when foot or calf seizes up it's hard to do anything. Well, I take care of 3 horses so it's not that I do nothing, just not the more fun stuff so much. Now I'm wondering how long it will take for it to go away so I can get back to exercise. Today it happened while I was riding my dressage horse and I've been pissed off all spring for the delay this FC has done on my horse training so that really made me mad--plus I wasn't sure how I was going to get off! Luckily it went away before I needed to dismount. Now I'm wondering how long it takes to come down from Taxotere and about SEs from Herceptin/Perjeta and exercise. ",

Before the end I asked about more chemo but then got the quality of life and robust immune system speech plus my tumor markers seemed to be a good indicator and my Onc really thinks 6 rounds of Taxotere plus the monoclonals is usually sufficient. The last 2 rounds of Taxotere kicked me hard. Took months to recover. My onc is big on quality of life and not poisoning the patient unnecessarily. The research shows adding carboplatin doesn't improve results (Cleopatra study I believe). She does what she can according to the latest research and asks her patients to do what they can (eat right, stay active, reduce stress). I'm still NED and am just finishing a vaccine trial and keeping my fingers crossed for more time. I feel pretty good one year out from hard chemo (like being condemned to months of hard labor).
