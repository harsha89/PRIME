      "Content": "Truffles1968 wrote: While waiting for my delayed surgery, I have been reading lots of breast cancer studies. There seems to be some studies showing an affect on outcomes for women who have surgery on Day 0-7 of their cycle (if they have lymph involvement) and an almost equal number of studies that show no correlation. Has anyone's BS or MO discussed this? Of course I am freaking out since my period started today so I will be Day 6 on the day of my surgery. I won't know if I have lymph involvement until after my surgery. I begged to have my surgery moved up 2 weeks so I could be feeling okay for Christmas since I have 4 young kids- will I regret that???.

The scheduler just called to tell me I am on the schedule for 12/17/15! I have young triplets, I can't imagine having surgery the week before Christmas. I planned on spending 2 weeks up there at my parents' house recovering so that I could get the drains out before coming home. I am so upset. I can't imagine waiting so long. I was dxed 3 weeks ago and thought waiting month for surgery was brutal. This is just awful.

He said my MRI and ultrasound were clear but not to depend on that. I am nervous now especially since I have read about micromets on BCO. Do they show up on ultrasound or MRI? All this extra time just gives me more time to think. Dx 10/13/2015, ILC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Log in to post a reply",
