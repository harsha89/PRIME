Terrified of it spreading because of the large number of lymph nodes and the size. I feel like I cannot escape the feelings of dread and terror about what is going to happen to me. I want to be able to go on and enjoy the days that are good but I don't know how to escape this and move on with my treatment and life.. Any suggestions?? ",

There is also a well known oncologist who is only 5 minutes from me and has a good reputation. I am trying to decide which to use. Any advice.",

I will be getting a port on April 29 and beginning chemo and radiation after that. I am Stage 3C also and scared to death.. I am frightened of chemo and I wonder if the treatment might kill me before the cancer does. I am absolutely terrified of reoccurance that I keep being reminded is high in my case. My oncologist told me I have a 60% of no reoccurance but I am on 24/7 blast that I will never get through it and will spend the rest of my life in treatment. Can anyone help me to understand how to get past this... If my life is to be short from now I want to enjoy what I have and not be sick all the time worrying about the future. How do you guys keep it together?? ",
