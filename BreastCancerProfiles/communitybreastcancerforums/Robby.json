But I had the spacer put in on Tuesday and the itching and redness is spreading all over my body. I have had lots of allergies in the past but nothing was used that I was aware of. I have a prescription for Prednisone and would take it but am worried about possible infections.  (I am now taking Z pack as an antibiotic).  Any advice on this.  Feel free to send a private message.

It was scary and some folks don't want to hear it for the first time over the phone.  However, I think it's best to learn ASAP, and then if problems, don't go to the Dr. alone.  Bring a loved one to help you sort through the details, advice.  Bring a recording tape machine and use if the physician allows it. It's all SO SO confusing at first -- and the burst of high anxiety can mask useful information transfer.  As professional and talented as one hopes one's physicians are, its our breasts and our lives and ultimately we have to learn all we can and get multiple opinions and then reach our decisions -- which may or may not be the first approach that the first MD suggests.  ",

      "Content": "Feb 23, 2009 11:30PM - edited Feb 23, 2009 11:32PM by Robby DonnaDio:  I  was negative for BRAC1 and 2 Ashkenazic founders Genes but they discovered a variant of uncertain significance in BRAC1.  One thing you may be able to do is have others in your family who have cancer tested for free for that variant.  Myriad has a form which tells you who can be tested. I didn't initially get the form from my oncologist but someone on the FORCE website told me about it.  As CarynRose noted, there are lots of different variants listed on FORCE, but you probably won't learn much even if you find others with it.  Only professionals can figure out the significance.  I also did a google search for my variant and found out it had an \"interesting\" evolutionary history, but again this didn't really tell me anything.  But getting more data for Myriad (and other clinical studies) is of value for the future and may help classify the variant at some time and may also provide insight for yourself and family members -- if the variant is ever reclassified.  The more data Myriad gets to more likely it may someday be reclassified.",
