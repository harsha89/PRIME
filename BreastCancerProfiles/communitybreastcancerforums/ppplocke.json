I would definitely get a second opinion as I have never heard of someone being too large for this type of surgery. I live in San Antonio, Texas and we have a group that specializes in what I call the \" fat transfer surgeries\" and people come from all over the country to use them. My doctor is from this group but I did not have enough fat so I had to go the TE/implant route...a huge drawback to being thin! Please look this group up. Google PRMA in San Antonio. Stay strong. Once you have more information and a plan you will feel tons better.",

I was urged by docs to do lumpectomy with rads but I wanted to live with NO REGRETS. So the decision to do bilateral mx was easy. And, one year later, I still feel the same way. Just my two cents. We all make the best decisions for us and for our families...there are likely no \"rights\" or \"wrongs\".",
