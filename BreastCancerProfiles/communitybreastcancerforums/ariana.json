While taking a shower tonight, I felt a large lump in my breast in that area. Went to my HMO late at night, and after waiting for about an hour, the doctor came in and told me \"It's Friday night, and there's no doctor or specialist around to do anything regarding this, and I don't really know anything about breast lumps.\" In the triage, they took my blood pressure and sent me in as though I could get a real check up and some answers, and possibly a mammogram. I got nothing except a bill for $150.00. I'm extremely scared and it's the weekend. Has anyone had this kind of bruise with a lump that was a problem? Â  Log in to post a reply",
