    "Content": "cindyS1 wrote: I had a partial mastectomy and feel very fortunate to have had such a small problem when I know the horror some women face. However, as it has been such a long time, I'm wondering why the affected breast has become larger than the other one. It is a bother to me and my bras do not fit right. I had the surgery in January of 2016. Grateful that the tumor was at the 6 o'clock position so it is less obvious and mangled. I had 3 lymph nodes removed (all clear) praise the Lord. 10 weeks of radiation therapy. I started a chemo drug after the radiation was finished, but had horrible reactions to two different aromatase inhibitors, so stopped them cold. My oncologist agreed with me that I did not have to start the Tamoxifen, so I have done nothing since then. I developed a swelling of lymph like tissue on the opposite side from the surgery. Around my neck especially. Really puffy looking to me as I am tall and thin and have never had that before. I cannot see my collar bone. :( I have been told by my radiation oncologist that I might try the Thermismooth treatment for the larger breast. Has anyone ever heard of that or tried it? I'm unhappy with the obvious shape difference and I would prefer the smaller breast I used to have. Log in to post a reply",
