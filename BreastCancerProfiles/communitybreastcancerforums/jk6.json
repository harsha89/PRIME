The lump came back in the same spot and the ultrasound found another area that also had cancer. Am so blessed that everything progressed so quickly although at times I felt as if time was standing still. This is my 3rd day home.  I've got a wicked headache and hoping that the pain medication will take are of it. Not able to take tylenol since it's already in the pain medication I'm taking. Today I'm really having a hard time getting comfortable and it's hot.  I've asked my son to turn the heat down since my daughter is here from Texas (I live in upstate NY) and she was cold yesterday.  I took off my PJ top and put on a tank top. I see the medical oncologist tomorrow and he'll let me know if I have to have chemo this time around. I had a bone scan and abdomen & pelvic CT scan which shows the cancer didn't spread any place else. The tests they do on the tissue will determine if I have chemo.  Last time I had a lumpectomy, 6 moths of chemo and 36 treatments of radiation. Would be nice to not have chemo ago. I see the plastic surgeon Thursday so he can check the stitches. Hoping the drains come out next week. Also had a visit yesterday from the county nurse who was sent by the hospital. Not sure how long she'll be involved but it will be nice to have someone else in my corner. My daughter who is 31 is staying till the 25th and that weekend my sister is bringing up my mom to stay for 2 weeks.  My son is 29 and lives with me. He's developmentally handicapped but very high functioning. He's a big help when it comes to feeding pets and making that cup of tea. He also brings me toast in the morning so I can take my pain meds with food.  My daughter has already cleaned the house and is taking me to appointments.  Mom is elderly and tires easy but just having someone to sit with me will be great. Last time around she took me to every single doctor visit. We don't live close any more so I'm sure that having her stay for 2 weeks eases her mind a bit. My best friend coordinated a list for work friends to cook meals. She will be brining dinner a few times a week.  Since my daughter is here now and loves to cook we'll freeze those meals for when my mother is here.   I'm longing to sleep on my side. Keeping good thoughts for all of us going through this.  Janice",

It felt wonderful.  We have a 2nd shower scheduled for tomorrow. I go back to him on Tuesday and he thinks he may remove 2 of the 4 drains.  I'm hoping the following week the other 2 will be removed. There was more internal radiation damage to the right breast than he expected so might not get to a full C but we shall see. I saw the medical oncologist and he's running tests on the tissue they removed and hopefully in 2 weeks we'll have the results. Originally he said no chemo but since seeing him this past week I'm kind of getting the impression that I will have chemo. I'm OK with having to have it again.  I had it in the past (1995) and was cancer free till January of this year.  I did have problems with the pain medication. It stopped working since I was only allowed 6 pain pills per day so to get through the day I was only taking 1 every 5 hours. It had been prescribed by the surgical oncologist. He had me on Vicoden 1-2 every 4-6 hours with a maximum of 6 per day. The plastic surgeon now has me on Percocet and have been allowed the limit of 10 per day.  I can also take Motrin in between.  It took us a few days to get back on track but now I feel uncomfortable (the compression bra is really annoying) but not in pain. He's told me he's looking for 0% pain and I should call him day or night if this pain medication doesn't work. My daugher is leaving a week from Monday but my Mom is coming Friday to stay with me for 2 week.  I am so blessed that my daughter was able to come. Her mother in law has my 3 grand daughters with her for the time my daughter is here. They are ages 4, 3 and the little one will be 2 in September. What a blessing Irma has been in taking the girls.  I enjoyed a wonderful spaghetti casserole made by a co-worker tonight for dinner. My best friend who I work with has coordinated with friends I work with and every other day she brings me a dinner. Since my daughter loves to cook we've frozen the dinners for when my mom is here but that spaghetti casserole was calling my name. We only cooked 1/2 and other other 1/2 is in the freezer. Boy was it great. Glad that I'm feeling better so quickly but I do need to remember to not overdo. I think that's why I slept most of the day today.  Sending good thoughts and prayers for those who are recovering and those who are anxiously awaiting their surgery.",
