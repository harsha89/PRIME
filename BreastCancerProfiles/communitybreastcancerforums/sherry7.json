Isn't live a joy...good luck and take care, sherry",

However there is a big BUTT.  A discharge from a single nipple not both is a concern very real to be pursued as you are.  Yes it can be a ductal breast papilloma which will cause bloody discharge, but also discomfort and such.  If you have this discharge on one side only, don't let them waste a day to find out.  Get it biopseyed and we will pray your result is papilloma and they will take it out.  I had a discharge that started clear almost like breast milk that turned to a tea stain or coffee stain color, I showed my breast to the docs, they did ultra sounds and mammogram and it all came up fine.  But, heres the BUTT, I woke up a year after first notice of discharge with my breast swollen like a rock, hot, in pain and leaking like a nursing mom.  I called my breast specialist that I just hired and went in, she had me on the table in two days for lumpectomy.  Two weeks later I had a mastectomy and reconstruction.  My breast was so full of DCIS that I had no choice to keep the breast.  Now almost three years later I am looking at mets to my liver.  Be aggressive, build the team you most feel comfortable.  And the rest of us will pray for your next results to be a papilloma.  And, just in case if they say leave the papilloma and watch it, find another specialist.  They must not be left.  My docs assumed it was papilloma and put me off almost long enough for the dcis to run out of space, it would of had to break out somewhere if not stopped.  Your life, your day is precious.  Good luck, Sherry",

I did not develope the LE until six months following my surgeries and I did not have any nodes touch or removed. I don't know what percentage that would of put me at but the reality is that I have LE. As a massage therapist, the diagnosis slammed a door on several styles of bodywork that I am trained to do. I am weak, it is painful, I do better early in the day and it gets cranky in the evenings. It has dictated my life almost more than the BC did. I had every intention of being strong afterwards and returning to the work I love. When the LE came about I had to look at my whole existance differently and still have tizzy fits when I think about all the things I still had plans on doing. My two year old grandson still wants to be picked up and he's over my limit. I can wash one window a day, mop one room floor a day. This is insane, I feel beaten before the day starts at times. What I am experimenting with toward helping LE is getting five cranial sacral sessions for five consectutive weeks, I have had two sessions and seem to be benefiting. I am a professional massage therapist and I will be happy to share the outcome if it continues to prove beneficial. I wish you all the best, don't give up, there is so much to learn about the magic of our bodies systems yet. Take care, a kindred spirit, Sherry",
