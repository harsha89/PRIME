While my wife was not diagnosed with agressive cancer, Grade 2, we were a bit shocked at the thought of waiting 5 weeks to have the surgery.  5 weeks has seemed like both an eternity as well as the shortest 5 weeks in our lives. You might think you wish you had 5 weeks too, but my wife needed almost imstantly that she wanted a bi-lateral mastectomy even thought the physician said she was eligible for a single lumpectomy. Hopefully your wife will be taking this week to make her decision a well informed one.  I'm sure you will be a strong guide in all of this.  If  you do have time to get the second opinion, you should do so though.  Our physician offered us that chance and although my wife had tons of brochures with her of other medical groups with some incredible press and resumes, she had done her research and did not bother with second opinions. We are going in for surgery in 2 days and I'm glad the date is finally here. Route53 http://route53.wordpress.com",

I become her eyes and ears and tell her what I heard the doctors say and just try to make it more palatable. I echo Shirlann.  Just tell them, \"Things are moving along.  Its just one step at a time and we'll wait and see.  It's a long process\" You can also read my blog which roughly mimicks your timeframe from a husband's persepective. http://route53.wordpress.com Good luck to you and here's to giving husband's a good name in these forums.  Really...we do care (in our own individual ways).  Route53",

Well my wife is currently 3 hours into her 5 hour surgery and I'm sitting here doing the one thing I was dreading.  I kidded the doctor to give me \"what she's having\" so I could get knocked out for a few hours. Well surprisingly the first 3 hours have been okay.  For those technically inclined, I highly recommend during the pre-surgery visits to ask if they have wireless computing.  It has enabled me to work here very productively while waiting.  Bring your cell phone of course to field all calls.  If cell phones aren't allowed, make sure to bring an iPod or other music player and some light reading, \"People, Golf Digest, etc.\".  The guy next to me is watching \"Old School\" on his DVD player.  Inappropriate I know, but if it takes the edge off, I guess it works. My stressed out wife was a little worried about me this morning and was a little in tears.  When she asked if I was going to be okay waiting.  I told her I thought so although, \"The weather doesn't look good today, so I won't be able to play golf\"  Yes it was a joke, but it relieved the tension. On a more serious note, I want to thank everyone on these boards.  Husbands always need support too and these forums with both husbands and wives has been a great support community for me.  You all rock and I look forward to moving on to the \"After Surgery\" forums tomorrow!

I am personally not going to look until she wants me to look.  What she is looking for is just a baseline from other women as to when they were ready to look and maybe if there was a proper time to take a look without being too shocked.  She's already flipflopped on whether she wants me to see, and I told her what ever she wants is up to her.  Again, she is just looking for some opinions based upon what other women say.  Many say, \"when she's ready\", but she'd like to know when other women thought that was for them. NJNative- thanks she's actually surprised she's not feeling any loss for her girls.  Maybe it is because she still has the outer skin.  Thanks for your insight. Next Tuesday will be two weeks and after her drains are taken out.  She told me she thinks that might be too early for her.  yes, this is very good in the larger scheme of things,  Very fortunate.",

Well the surgeon moved and I saw.  It was nowhere near what I thought it would be like.  When I told the physician about this thread, she smiled and said that is one of the most often asked post-surgery questions.  She said she tells people it looks like a dried apple.  I told her about RoseG saying it looked like a pug dog and she and the nurse both said they were going to use that in the future. My impression was that it more looked like a melting sundae.  When my wife saw my eyes, she dropped her hands and looked.  We both said it wasn't anywhere near what we thought.  So here we are on day 9 and we're both a lot more relieved.

Well morning, I have to tell you.  My respect and love for all the women on this board is mutual.  I've always said it is the spirit in a woman that shines through the brightest and attracts me.  My wife laughs when she always used to point at a gorgeous young actress like girl with a grimace on her face and I would say she wasn't attractive to me.  Any woman who has gone through what all of you are going through has an inner fortitude and strength that is very attractive.  As far as women who must go through this alone, I'm all the more in awe.  This morning my wife woke up to a leaky drain and we had blood everywhere.  The calmness my wife exhibited was amazing.  I think I needed the Atavin.  The way she handled the situation was amazing.  I've known my wife for almost 25 years and the strength she showed this morning was  truly something I'd never ever seen from her. Ironically, I used to work for a cruise line that developed the concept of \"escorts\".  We were a luxury line and most women were traveling alone as in many cases they were divorced or their husbands were deceased.  The women outnumbered the men 8 to 1.  We hired widowers and trained them in manners and gave them dance lessons as well as history lessons and sent them on cruises as paid \"escorts to dance, eat with and go on tours.  They were required to dance no more than two dances in a row with the ladies, etc. Okay....can't figure out how that would work here...but..just thought I'd lighten things up a bit. I know what you mean about people who are dying.   I was a young freshman in college when I met a grad student named Randy Pausch.  We drove home and back to school in a car for 4 hours each way one Thanksgiving and I will never forget that first meeting.  Randy was the Carnegie Mellon Professor who wrote \"The Last Lecture\" while he was dying and leaving behind a young family.  Watch him die this year was one of the most humbling and inspirational things in my life.

What we really found useful was the way communication was managed.  Appointments are stressful.  We all want answers and are listening with a biased ear.  My wife knew that she would only be listening to the terrible stuff and brought me along to make sure that I would be able to provide her with all the pros and cons.  The Decisions Support Services group was always calling to make sure we had all the information we needed and that all of our questions were answered.  Before each appt, we crafted long questionnaires that were given to the physician ahead of time and she answered them all.  Decision Support Services then transcribed all of our meetings and gave us a copy at the end of each appointment. Sometimes when my wife and I disagreed about something the doctor mentioned, we were able to look at the notes.  It really saved us a lot of heartache and headaches. Now these services really empower the patient and help them move forward.  If you are a passive patient this might all seem a bit of a put off as if the doctor isn't taking responsibility.  On the contrary, the doctors will counter you if they think you are making the wrong decision.  When at first the physician told my wife about a lumpectomy, my wife immediately asked about a bliateral mastectomy and walked my wife through it all.  She didn't push my wife into one decision or another.  I read so much about how many women felt as though their doctor was walking them down a one lane path and I thik this helps alleviate that situation. Any downsides to this?  Well yes, your appointments might go longer and you might wait longer as some people have lots of questions, but the most important thing is that you get all the information that you need.

Etc.  These helped to make sure the questions were addressed whether we asked them directly or not...and then afterwards, any questions we had about what we thought the doctor had converyed were calrified and then we were able to make the most educated decisions.

We were leaning away from Tamoxifen but my wife said that if she could just knock off a few points and do everything she could to make sure she could see her kids have kids, then the decison was easy.  My wife also volunteered to be part of a research test for those with low oncotype scores so that there would be a sample size worth measuring in her category.

My wife felt fortunate that the cancer was detected and did not want to rely on luck again to save her life.  Since her mother had a bilateral mastectomy 20 years prior and my own mother had a single mastectomy 5 years prior, my wife felt this decision was a no brainer.

I'm not a doctor, but if either of you are anxious, your physician can prescribe something for you like they did for my wife although if you can avoid it and keep your nerves intact naturally through the support of friends and family, that is highly recommended. MDempsey, I highly recommend perusing these boards about telling your child.  You didn't mention their age, but there are lots of tips here.  Obviously you know your child best and how they will react.  I thik a lot of how they react will come from your delivery.  Strength comes from strength.  You will need her to be strong for you, so share what strength you have together.

Yes, the drains are a pain in the neck.  I hate to say it, but my stripping of the drains has been our intimate moment of the day.  I definitely won't miss them though and although our 9 year old thinks it's \"Cool\" we were worrying about the pain of removing them. I'm guessing with larger breasts, my wife might have more to drain, but we'll see.  Already down to 40ccs. Good to know that the pathology report will be back then too.

Although we were at 30-35ccs for 3 straight days, he told us to hold off for another 4 days through the weekend before removing the drains. He said that even after he takes the drains out the body can absorb about 30ccs a day naturally.  If you lay dormant for a few days and reduce the fluid release to below 30ccs the fluid emitters will seal themselves (you are giving them time to heal and dry up) and thus if the drains are taken out and you resume some light activity your fluid emission should not increase again and cause infections as have been documented by others in this thread.  Route53 http//route53.wordpress.com",
