I am nervous because the last time we were there, the cancer in her skull had \"moderately spread\", but nothing was in her brain. On the last appointment, he had sent his intern in to suggest WBR \"on the skull\". I was totally appalled-especially when he came back in and told my mom that she would not need it if she didnt have any symptoms. I know chemo takes longer to work on the skull, but will still work. My question is, is it possible to have brain mets without any symptoms? She has no headache, no nothing. I would hate to see her do so well on the chemo (mass in breast has disappeared, lymph nodes can no longer be felt) and then have to do WBR \"on the skull\" (???????) She is 56, still working, and is still very active. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

She has mets to breast, ONE lymph node (I know-weird), hip, skull, and spine. She had the soft spine tumor removed in February, which destroyed two vertebraes, and had her spine reconstructed-11 radiation treatments followed. Since then, she has been taking Anastrozole, Herceptin every 3 weeks through IV, and Zometa every six weeks through IV. We are blessed to be near a great hospital (Cleveland Clinic), and she has been responding well to treatment. Zero pain/fatigue, fully functioning, and her blood counts resemble those of a slightly anemic but healthy person. The C word has been the easiest thing to deal with so far-her anesthesiologist pulled out her breathing tube too early after her spine surgery and she had to be trached and almost died.  Her doctors have been studying a calcified brain lesion (about the size of half of a pea!) she has and have brought up whole brain radiation if it grows, since her skull is too weak to have the halo inserted for gamma knife. She is freaked out. She had two MRI's 3 weeks apart which showed the lesion did not grow at all. She has zero neurological impairment (she had four doctors do the same exam on her and come up with nothing). Her general doctor told her women with HER2+ cancer are likely to develop these, but are usually not cancer. Any thoughts? We are scared! She has gone back to work three days a week, and is planning on having surgery this summer. Her doctors are saying that she has made the quickest recovery they have ever seen (her breast mass was 5cm but has started to significantly shrink). She doesn't want to do WBR when she has no issues. I am watching her play Wii Fit right now!  No pain, no fatigue, no headache. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
