      "Content": "Oct 13, 2010 08:56AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 02:55AM by Margerie Melinda~  Your story and your photo are so powerful.  I was diagnosed in October 5 years ago.  I had Pinktober Rage for a few years.  It is truly an emotional mixed bag for me. Mostly I was pissed that these companies try to paint a pretty little pink picture of this horrible BEAST of a disease for COMPANY PROFIT.  That is really despicable.  The true philanthropists will not have caps on donations, no crappy percentage donated, and frankly will support breast cancer research/survivors/awareness/detection all year long.  I got all the pink ribbon stuff from well-meaning friends.  I gave them away, could not wear them.  It seemed like somehow wearing that stuff meant I was celebrating having breast cancer.  Early detection is not a cure, and it didn't exist at all for me or most of my bc friends.  How about the not-so-pretty awareness: you are never too young for breast cancer, you can still get it with no risk factors and no family history.  There is nothing fun or cute about breast cancer. Anyway, I still do not like the pink marketing.  It hurts less and less the further I get from diagnosis.  But this year was a truly turning point for me.  My son's peewee football coach asked the boys (I help coach the team, but no one knew I had bc) if they wanted to wear a hot pink sock on game days in October to support breast cancer awareness and the women who are fighting the disease.  These 8 &9 year old boys voted an unanimous yes.  They are so proud to wear their socks and support this cause.  They don't even make any money off of it.  I know my son is especially touched (not sure if he has told his team mates yet) that his friends are supporting a cause that has affected our family so tremendously.  Who knew a bunch of little kids could warm my cold pinkwashed heart?? My tag line \"Are we there yet?\" is sadly still there, because NO we are not there.  No Cause. No Cure. Still beautiful women fighting this disease every day. Beautiful women dying every day.  ",

But what they should have said was \"We don't see any abnormality, but since your breasts are so dense, it would be hard to see any problem so we should follow up in 6 months.\"  Come to think of it- my breasts will never be saggy now because they are gone I also have two younger sisters (I was 38) and they are only able to get mammograms too.",

The idea is those er+ cells are so deprived and so greedy for estrogen, that if you flood them with estrogen, the cancer cells can't handle it and they die.  I am looking for some articles.  Here is what I have found so far: http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/4/4/133 http://www.springerlink.com/content/x55x31t348723650/ I couldn't really find more info on Dr. Google, but maybe your onc has some information on it.
