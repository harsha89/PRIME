There are a couple of different things going on in my breasts but the surgeon isn't recommending surgery at this time. I was just starting to relax but want to make sure we don't miss anything",

Says I have busy breasts which is common for my age (43). She is going to have my biopsies re-read by a pathologist who specializes in breasts. She agreed to let me get a MRI but I kind of had to talk her into it. As far as the PASH goes her plan is to leave it in unless it gets bigger",

According to that report I have extremely dense breasts which makes mammography less useful. The breast specialist says they are not that dense.. Not a fan of conflicting info. But I am so glad I asked for the MRI and I will look into it further because I think insurance should help pay due to the density issue.",

She said not to be concerned if they call me back because the MRI can pick up false positives. Good luck to you",
