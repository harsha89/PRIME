Today I have almost no sensation when I touch the dorsum of my hand, (it like neuropathy) and  my fingers are colder then my other hand with a colder sensation. The size of both my wrists seems the same, however near my elbow it is a bit bigger than my other arm but not much. I had lymp node removed in Jan 2007. Is it possible that be LE or something else?  does it start in the hand or it is only the arm.  Sig   ",
