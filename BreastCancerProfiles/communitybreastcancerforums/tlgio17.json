Dr said i was not a candidate for lumpectomy due to the fact that my biopsies showed a mass and an additional spot that they are still not sure is in lymph or not. Could be in fat layer and not lymph, but she wont know until they remove via surgery. She also mentioned that some people are able to get the immediate reconstruction at time of mastectomy, but that because we are not sure yet of lymph involvement and treatment plan, most plastic surgeons prefer to wait on reconstructions after radiation (if that should apply). With all of that weighing on my mind, i am now completely overwhelmed with deciding on A---should i do a double (would be for asymmetry and cosmetic purposes mostly) or just do the one side for now. B) Whenever i do have the reconstruction, what is the best option to go with, I researched both regular implants and also the DIEP, etc. Just wondered what others have opted for and if you are happy, or had issues, etc etc. My apt w plastic surgeon is 11/21 so have some time still.

I still do not even know what my treatment plan will be until they do the surgery and check lymph nodes. So hard not to be able to plan things ahead for me. It makes me sad too that there are so many on here battling it. My son is 13 as well, and he is definitely my motivation to fight. Take care and prayers for treatment for you! Traci ",

Dr said i was not a candidate for lumpectomy due to the fact that my biopsies showed a mass and an additional spot that they are still not sure is in lymph or not. Could be in fat layer and not lymph, but she wont know until they remove via surgery. She also mentioned that some people are able to get the immediate reconstruction at time of mastectomy, but that because we are not sure yet of lymph involvement and treatment plan, most plastic surgeons prefer to wait on reconstructions after radiation (if that should apply). With all of that weighing on my mind, i am now completely overwhelmed with deciding on A---should i do a double (would be for asymmetry and cosmetic purposes mostly) or just do the one side for now. B) Whenever i do have the reconstruction, what is the best option to go with, I researched both regular implants and also the DIEP, etc. Just wondered what others have opted for and if you are happy, or had issues, etc etc. My apt w plastic surgeon is 11/21 so have some time still. My brain is too full and all of this is so overwhelming and exhausting! Thanks!!! Appreciate any feedback.

Chemo class is overwhelming because they go over every possible side effect. I was so nervous after that class, and I did not have nearly as many side effects as they reviewed. Also, the premeds they give you w the chemo helped me a lot! Yes, I felt \"off\" for the few days after chemo and definately by the end of it all was fatigued, etc. But, compared to what I have seen some of my family members deal w back before all these additional premeds was way worse. I never got sick, just felt nauseaus on occasion, but never enough to hinder. My counts did drop, so I had Nuepogen shots which where once a day for 5 days after chemo. The very first chemo was the hardest, not knowing what to expect. Once you get that done, you feel better because you know exactly what to expect and how you will feel. I hope that yours goes as well and you have a lot of support to help you get thru it all. I am here if you have any questions!! You will be amazed at how strong you can be! Hugs, Traci",

And you said everything I have been feeling as most of all are I am sure. Rough road ahead but we can do it! Ang905-how did your treatment go. You dont have to explain how you were feeling to me, I have been feeling the exact same way! My first treatment is the 12th. So nervous and worried about SE's/reactions. Praying everything went well for you, let us know. SweatyBetsy, Awesome that your 1st treatment went well so far. I have chemo education class tomorrow and hope to get all my details/info packets to review. Hope you continue to feel well and thanks for posting for us behind a week or two as well so we can check in! Hugs to all, Traci",

(Traci Giorgio)--thank you for getting that all set up.Â  Much appreciated! Getting Port Tues, and supposed to start first AC treatment on Thurs.Â  All my bloodwork came back that I was iron deficient and have anemia so hoping that doesn't change my plan. I have been fretting about chemo and just want to get it rolling so I can count down to the last one! Hope everyone is having a good weekend, Traci",
