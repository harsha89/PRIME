So I got another 3D mammogram, then bilateral ultrasound and after review I had consultation with radiologist. She told me that I have BC, that it is going to be a rough year, but they will get me through it. She stayed late and biopsied 3 sites on my right breast (2 on breast and 1 for lymphnode in armpit). When I asked why she was doing a biopsy on one that she believes is benign, she said your surgeon is going to want a definitive answer since there it is a little suspect. She said that only pathology can confirm a diagnosis, but with all she said to me, I feel certain I am not getting good news.",

She said she needed to do 3 biopsies and that she would stay late after her last appointment and do the biopsies, which she did.  Apparently, she talked to my doctor as well...is that normal?  I already have a breast cancer team at MD Anderson on standby if the results are confirmed.  I am suppose to have results tomorrow.  Are radiologists pretty accurate?  She seemed to believe I had cancer.  I am so nervous.",
