Thanks, guys!\" OMFG, I have the EXACT same thing going on, to the letter! How insane is that?! I've looked up my symptoms, and it sounds like something called De Quervain syndrome. The pain's so bad sometimes that it takes my breath away. Also, when I wake up, whether it's from a night's sleep or from a nap, I find that my fingers are clenched like claws, my fingertips are numb, and the first joint of each finger (closest to the nail) feels like someone's taken a hammer to it. The throbbing pain is unreal. It's hours before I can use my hands normally each day. This is absofriggin'lutely unacceptable! Yet my onco team essentially said that there's nothing they can do. GREAT. I NEED the use of my hands for the (sporadic) work that I can still do from home!",

If being tall were truly linked to cancer, then why aren't the Netherlands and Scandinavia plagued by the nightmare like we are?
