It is very different from yours, it is a different perspective. I just had my mx on my left breast. While having recon is the norm and I did have a consultation w/ a plastic surgeon, I decided against it because of the concerns of potential complications and long term uncertainty of ruptures, etc. Maybe I am overly cautious, I just don't want to take any chance that may risk my health or affect my active life style. I read a lot about women's experience in \"living without recon\" and also a lot of happy or unhappy recon experience on this website. I wanted to know all sides of the coin. I read \"breastfree.org\" and \"flat and fabulous\" on facebook. From what I read, I learned that there are a lot of women at all ages who decided not to have recon and are very happy with their decision. So, I concluded that it was the way to go for me. So far, I am 2.5 wks post mx, life is almost back to normal. I am happy with my look and very happy about how great I feel. Initially, my DH thought that I was out of my mind when I told him what I was thinking. He knew that looking beautiful was very important to me, and he worried that I'd be unhappy about myself. But once he knew that I had thought through the issue carefully, he was very supportive. So, please take your time to heal - 6 months or even longer. That'll give you a better chance for a successful recon. I hope that your bf will be understanding and loving during this difficult time. It is a test for him, if he fails to pass it, he is not the right one for you. Also, you may want to read some threads in \"living without reconstruction\" -- they are very inspiring and may help you go through this challenging time. All the best.",

      "Content": "plover wrote: A member posted a topic about some specific anesthesia may reduce recurrence and block pain. I was very lucky to have read it and felt extremely grateful for her posting. I'd like to post a follow up on the thread, but couldn't find it back anymore. So I will start a new thread so that more people can be aware of it. The member mentioned that  IV Ketorolac (an anti-inflammatory drug) pre-incision and paravertebral blocks may reduce recurrence, and that she had them as part of her anesthesia. I researched about the subject. A study of 372 breast cancer patients in Belgium showed that IV Ketorola pre-incision reduced cancer recurrence risk by 5 times in the 1st 2 yrs post mx. Also studies showed that paravertebral blocks could reduce pain post surgery. If you google the topic, you will find the papers. I was definitely interested in getting them as part of my anesthesia, so I brought it up w/ my BS at Mayo. Here is what I learned: It is Mayo's standard practice to use paravertebral blocks for mastectomy cases with reconstruction. But my BS usually avoids ketorolac due to its antiplatelet effect and increased risk of bleeding. We discussed the risk of bleeding vs. the risk of recurrence, and agreed that given my overall excellent health condition, I had low risk of bleeding. The potential benefit outweighed the risk. She thought it reasonable to incorporate IV Ketorolac in the general anesthesia for me. So I had them both. At the pre-op room, an anesthesia who specialized in paraverbral blocks administered the injection for me. It was 2 injections on my back. I was sedated, and didn't feel pain at all. She told me that it was important to have someone who was experienced do it, as the injection was very close to the lung and had a small risk of puncturing it. I could not remember when I got Ketorolac (15ml - 30ml) in IV. It must have happened after I was put to sleep.  After my mx, I never experienced pain above level 1. A few Tylenols a day were sufficient to keep me pain free. My not having reconstruction probably helped a lot as well. It is worthwhile to have a conversation with your BS, and see whether you are eligible for the IV and whether the hospital offers the block. Good luck!

My recovery was super fast, no pain, in 2 wks, my life was back to normal. I learned about coobie bra from fellows on this website, and bought a few. The bras have worked out perfectly for me. I don't need to use foobs. The bra's thin padding helps me appear small boobed, but not completely flat. So I have not bothered to get my prescription mx bras/foobs. I also like to swim and want to continue to wear my beautiful swimwear. Without a foob, my chest under the swimwear looks like a deflated ball. Breastfree.org gave me the perfect solution -- bath puff. I cut a piece to match my un-operated side and sewed it to the swimwear, it filled up the void nicely. It doesn't add any weight, doesn't move and dries fast after swimming. A huge thanks to Erica for sharing this great idea on her website! I am even tempted to sew a piece to my un-operated side to make myself look prettier:-) One challenge I had to face was changing in the locker room at my gym. The first day (wk 5), when I had to change in front of others, I was very conscious of my body and tried to turn away and hide my chest. Then I realized that it was all in my head, and I had to get over it. I didn't want to hide forever. So I made a point not to turn away and even showed my scars to a fellow swimmer. Now, I often forget that I have a uni boob when changing clothe. Another info: I had nipple sparing mx as I am small breasted. Having kept the nipple definitely gives me a more normal look. So, talk to your bs about it. The nipple sparing mx may not be possible if the breast size is too large or the bs may have to trim off some skin. Good luck with your decision and surgery! ",
