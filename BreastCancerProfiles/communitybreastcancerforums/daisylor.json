Had my mammogram on Thursday with a new oncologist because i moved to another state. The hospital (Dartmouth Hitchcock) lets you view the visit notes and of course i jumped on it as soon as they were posted. The summary has my vitals for the day, that i used to be a smoker, what medications i was taking as well as the new one (Arimidex) that he just prescribed me that visit. Under the section of Visit Diagnosis, it says \"Malignant neoplasm of breast (female), unspecified site\" Ummmmm, what???? Below that it says \"Memory Deficits\" because we also discussed my memory issues. Has anyone ever seen this on a report before they got their mammogram results? I had the mammogram 45 minutes before i saw the oncologist. Any thoughts or insite would be appreciated. I'm trying not to get too wrapped up in but can't help it.

That's why i got soooooo freaked out by him putting that on there. Have you logged in to look at yours before? If so, you may understand a little better as to what i saw and how the wording was on the page. It's a hell of a thing to see listed under Visit Diagnosis. Thank you again for those who said it was the old diagnosis. It my rational head that's what i thought i was, but in my holy crap i don't want to have to go through this again head i got a bit freaked out. ",

Actually got my results from my mammogram back in 2012 and read that it was cancer before the doctor told me days later. Was stupid as anything doing that to myself but i'd rather know than play the waiting game. i think that's just the cruelest part of all of this in my opinion. Once you know what it is you're up against, fine, let's do this...but waiting..ugh, not a nice thing for someone to have to go through.",
