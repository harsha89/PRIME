I keep getting confused by the ones that are not my own and could use a cheat sheet. 2. I'll be starting AC firstand wanted good insight about if it expected to impact my nails and if neuropathy could be an issue. If anyone knows or could point me in the right direction, that would be great. If I'm thinking about icing, just want to make sure it is necessary!",

They did a great job. When the bruising is healed, I don't think it will be noticeable at all unless you touch it.",

I've been using the Nioxin scalp recovery shampoo and conditioner even while completely bald - I think it has helped keep my scalp healthy. Have any of you used the Nioxin System 2 to help the regrowth process? Like it? Not like it? It is for noticeably thinning fine natural hair. TIA!",
