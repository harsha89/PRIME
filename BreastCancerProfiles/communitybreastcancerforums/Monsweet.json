    "Content": "Monsweet wrote: Hello all, Where do I start, August 2012 I sadly had a miscarriage but ever since then my left breast has always been tender. About 10 weeks ago I found a lump about the size of a kidney bean to the upper left just above my areola,. It's very sore to touch especially around my period. My doctor referred me to the breast clinic, she thought it could be a cyst as it being so painful. I went to my appointment yesterday and the consultant could definitely feel it and sent me for an ultrasound, which nothing could be detected. So he took a biopsy but said in his opinion it could just be lumpy breasts but is hoping the biopsy would tell him more. I go back in 2 weeks for results. Could this just be lumpy breast tissue with it being very painful every day? Has anyone had any experiences like mine good or bad? Many thanks :) Log in to post a reply",
