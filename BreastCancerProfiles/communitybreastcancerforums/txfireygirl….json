I was recently diagnosed (Sept 27, 2011) with Stage IV Mets of the bone, it was found on accident when I went to talk to a surgeon about a hernia I wanted re-repaired.  I had had Stage 2 BC in 2007, had a bi-lateral masectomy, chemo, radiation and DIEP reconstruction, when that reconstruction, took tummy fat to create new boobs, I got a hernia then, and it had to be repaired a second time due to my body rejecting the initial mesh, well anyway it looked like it was getting big again so I complained to my OBGYN when I thought I had a cyst on my ovary, thinking my cancer came back, well not in my ovary, whew, she told me to see a surgeon about the hernia, and I asked what to do about my back pain that had been hurting me for 6 weeks, she said see my MD.  So the surgeon planned on surgerey and asked me to get CAT scan so she could plan the surgery.  I then got a call friday afternoon at work that she saw masses on each hip and had called my oncologist.  I then had a bone biopsy and sure enough, cancer was back!  I have tumors in my hips, my spine and also my skull.  But wait, I thought I was cancer free!  You told me I had 1% chance of reccurance!  I have finally met the man of my dreams and plan to marry him, this can't be happening!!  I now have had 15 radiation treatments and realize the pain I described as back pain was actually hip pain from the tumor breaking through the capsule in my hip joint.  I have been off work for 10 weeks now and my FMLA is running out in 2 weeks.  I have a surgery scheduled to remove my ovaries since the cancer is estrogen/progest positive, and my surgeon reccommended going ahead and doing a hysterectomy at the same time.  I asked if they could fix my hernia while they are at it so that is scheduled to all be done in 2 weeks.  I have been in pain and was told the cancer was the reason for the pain that after the radiation was done that the pain would be gone, it has been over 4 weeks since I finished rads treatments and the pain is not gone.  I went to a pain center to have a procedure done where they injected steriod in the nerve and that didn't work, but it wasn't a good experience, since they did the procedure with no sedation, it was painful and I have been in more pain since then.  I am getting worried about my job, since I guess I was thinking the pain would go away after radiation, then I thought it would after 2-3 weeks and it hasn't, now my time is running out of FMLA and my boss told me that he would have to post for my position.  At the bank I work at what happens then is I will then be on a 90 day work leave of absence where I can look for a job within the company and if I don't find a job during that time I will be terminated.  I am starting to panic since like I said the pain isn't going away and I am in worse pain when standing or sitting for more than an hour or two (I have been on a 50mg fentanyl pain patch since Oct and taking Diladad for breakthrough pain).  If I lay down it seems to be ok, but what kind of work can I do laying down?  I have been working since I was 14 years old, and I have accumulated bills, mortgage, car, etc etc and worked very hard to pay on time to have good credit, so if I can't work and have to get on disability, I don't know how I can afford to live, and what kind of insurance will I get, does Medicaid cover oncology treatments etc?  This is all very scary.  I know you all can relate.",
