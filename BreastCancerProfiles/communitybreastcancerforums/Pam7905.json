I have had several medical scares over the years... but I have never felt terrified like I am now. I think a lot of it is the bone pain is so bad- I can't keep the negative thoughts away. I hate seeing my kids, husband & family so scared. I have a bone/disk or something that sometimes clicks back and forth in my spine area right between my shoulder blades.It hurts so bad. I have switched PC doctors and the new one says she can't give me anything for pain until these results are back and she knows what she's dealing with.Why can't they just do a bone scan now?  Have any of you had bone pain like this before you were dx? Thanks for any info or comments- it means so much.    ",

Oh well, I guess they are the doctors. So, I am just trying to NOT think- \"what if\"  and just be happy. I still have to find out what all this bone pain is about.  THANK YOU to each one that answered questions and explained how your dx and needle core biopsy went.

I first will tell you that for the past year I have had horrible pain that started in my pelvis then moved to my spine in 2 places. now I have severe pain in various places in my ribs and my left shoulder. Seven year ago I had a big 5 cm X 2 cm benign tumor removed from the 10 o'clock area of my right breast. Before the removal of it I had an MRI done at St. Louis Barnes Jewish Hospital. The MRI showed everything looked benign in the right breast - but something the size of a bb showed up as a suspicious lesion in my left breast. I begged the surgeon to remove both lesions- the one in my right breast the was big and causing swelling and pain under my arm & the tiny suspious one that showed in the MRI. The surgeon refused to remove the one on the left. He said I came in to address the right breast not the left and he would not do anything to the left breast. I was so upset I cried. I decided then that I was just forgetting about it until after I turned 40.I've had some horrible experiences with doctors-even with cervical carcinoma 8 yrs. ago.  I have been to the doctor for the horrible pain I have been having and the doctor I saw refused to order any tests on my spine or pelvis. She said it is too much hassle to get tests like a CT scan or MRI covered by my insurance. Her nurse did set up a mammogram. I got results a week later that I need a core needle biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion in the left spot...same place where the suspicious lesion showed up 7 yrs. ago. I'm terried that all this bone pain & shortness of breath is related. My question is what can I expect during the core needle biopsy? Is there any way they can tell me if it's cancer that same day? I have a lot of people praying for me. I have a strong faith. It is hard not to have horrible toughts when the pain gets so bad, especially at night. Please help me with any words of wisdom.  Pam- age 41 ...Core Biopsy scheduled for Aug. 31, 2010 Log in to post a reply",

I am scared and worried and I don't want to be, because it is making me sick. When the pain is so bad it is so hard to not think the worst. I appreciate you telling me that if it is cancer it is not an emergency. I find myself thinking about all the stuff I need to get in order to make things easier on my family...especially when the pain is SO intense.When the pain eases up I can think more positive thoughts like -this bone pain could be so many other things, it CAN'T BE CANCER! I just want this nightmare to be over and I want to feel good again. It has been SO long since I have felt good.Talking to ladies here gives me hope to know if this is cancer I could still see all of my kids raised and maybe even grandkids someday.Thank you!",
