It is so true about the gut feeling, this is a guy/girl you probably will think of everytime you take a shower, so trust and good communication are essential!  Personally, I chose lumpectomy & radiation; couldn't stand the thought of losing my dear little nipple: I've never loved my breast so much as when my surgeon told me that if I didn't do neo-adj chemo they'd have to take it all (A-cup, tumor just behind the nipple which is how I noticed the lump in the first place). Today, one month after surgery I find my breast to be much smaller, but perky as ever! And, it is still my little girlygirl :-) In the beginning I thought 'What's the big deal? They can just chop it off and I'll get new ones'. No idea why I had those thoughts, maybe I was in acute survival mode, but boy am I glad I didn't think like that for long. In France atleast, clinics are really into the mental impact of having a mastectomy, as they are regarding your looks while on chemo. Losing hair, brows, eyelashes and nails is never fun, but they do come back. About the radiation, I'm no fan, but as I won't have any to my axilla, only the breast, I feel it's manageable. I've heard stories, seen pictures of really bad burns, but one day at a time and taking care of my skin should do it, I have been successful in my other treatments, so why should radiation be any worse?  Having different options & making decisions is so hard, but it is a blessing. ",

My acupuncturer told me neuropathy stays longer if the body (i.e the liver) cannot get rid of the toxins (chemo in my case) quick enough.

An endocrinologist I saw only once wanted to give me pills for my hot flashes: SE's included a nasty, tingling sensation in the whole body for an hour she said, so I didn't take them. With more and more drugs in your system, your poor liver will just be on overdrive, and if a burdened liver chooses to release estradiol and other bad estrogen (provoking excess estrogen and all the niceties that go with it) in the blood due to lack of energy and too much ingested toxins, well the meds wont do any good in the long run.  I would like to avoid this squirrel wheel of meds, meds, meds and believe you me; France is one of the first countries trying to cure SE's with even more medication, it's a pharmaceutical orgy which is very unhealthy and certainly doesn't solve the initial problem for real.

I have very fine Scandinavian hair, although a lot of it, and it actually worked! I'm on FEC100 since Jan 24th and all the oncs told me I'd loose my hair no matter what about 15 days after my first IV. They seemed very pessimistic about it which was quite annoying. The nurses on the other hand were very optimistic, and although I had lost a little on my second date with the red rain, my chemonurse convinced me to put the hell hat on for the second time, so as to delay the baldness even more. It's been over a month since my first session and just now I start looking like a punkrocker if you look closely :-) There are no real 'holes' and my hair falls off very slowly; I know it's just a question of days before I'll start using my wig outside, but it has really been a great help to not lose hair immediately, and more importantly, not losing it while lying in bed agonizing with side effects. I must add that I cut my hair pixiestyle with bangs to my nosetip before chemo, following the nurses advice. Of course this depends on treatment you receive, I get 4xFEC and 4xTaxotere = Hairloss guaranteed!   Another tips is to put an icedbeautymask over your eye for lash and brow protection, it works the same way. It's funny though, and quite nice, 'cause the first hair that I lost was under my arms and the bikiniline! I guess all the waxing throughout the years helped! Know that the first 10 minutes the ice cap is some nasty business, make sure the nurse puts like a thin cottonhat (or bring one yourself)  on your head first, otherwise it's just pure hell, and that she changes the cap every 20-30 minutes.  All my best, Carola.",

So far, I haven't gained a pound, I've maybe lost six. I think it's important what you eat during chemo, as so many factors can make you gain weight; steroids that trick you into thinking you're hungry, days of lying in bed (depending on how you're feeling) nausea that can only be calmed with special foods, not as much workout as before (I've heard and read people on this forum that do actually work out on chemo day, but I guess it's very personal, and depending on which treatment you get). I could hardly eat during FEC because of nausea and when I ate it was mostly noodles and rice (not so good, made me feel heavy and tired), but now I'm on Taxotere (and a lot of steroids) with a sometimes raging appetite. I take every opportunity to move around, even invested in a crosstrainer, cause sometimes I just don't feel like going outside), taking the stairs, doing yoga to destress the organism, including the liver which can get quite angry if you don't take care of it, especially during chemo (like not exercizing at all, not drinking enough, eating too much acid foods...) You can also gain weight because of the water retention from some treatments, but that, I guess, disappears mostly after treatment, my toes look like small sausages, but hey it's all part of the process.. If I could give you some advice, I would drink a lot of water, stay mobile, massage your legs & feet with cream or oils (organic please) to help with circulation and stiffness and bring calm (I learned how to massage myself, it takes some patience but is so beneficial). Since I'm on chemo it's crazy how much I drink, about three litres a day, and my body keeps asking for more :-) Vegetables, lentils, beans and fruit are my friends from now on, and my body seems to really like it. I think the most important thing is to take care of yourself, but eat right, feel good and indulge sometimes. When I had mouth sores with FEC I ate about a ton of sherbet :-)  Bon courage!",

My young age apparently has something to do with it (diagnosed just before my 30th b-day).  Does anyone know/have links or studies that show by how much radiation minimizes the recurrence risk? Thank you!  /Carola Log in to post a reply",

I have had neo-adjuvant chemo for five months and then had lumpectomy & sentinel node biopsy in July. No problems there but unfortunately they found many ITC's in the node, so we opted for a partial node dissection two weeks ago. I have absolutely nothing or noone to compare with, how the armpit should look, what I should feel..What bothers me is that I have the impression of walking around with a smaller balloon stuck in my armpit; when I'm walking I have no idea what to do with my arm! I imagine the armpit will never look the same again, but frankly it is quite swollen. When I palp the area very slightly it doesn't hurt a lot, but enough to hinder me from raising my arm above shoulderheight. My shoulder is ok for now, but the area just feels so incredibly stiff. If I do my stretching the area warms up and it feels better and is movable, but I feel like something wants to break off in my biceps..Also, I've noticed a cordy thing (which is still quite soft to touch thank god). I hope I haven't overdone anything, as I saw exaggerated exercise can cause cording. I'm aware of the patience needed for this kind of intervention, but if anyone would like to share her experience I would be so grateful. Maybe all of this is normal, as I'm only 17 days post surgery? I have a post-op appointment on Monday (final path report! Moment of truth!), but perhaps someone has a few tricks to learn out while I wait for Monday morning...?  I'm taking my temperature just in case by the way. Wishing a very nice weekend to all of us!

If there has been an appointment where I haven't had my list, I've always been 'Darn, forgot to ask'..so I know what you mean :-) On my last appointment with my surgeon, he took my list looked at it and started writing/draw answers while he spoke so I would remember them :-D I'm sure I'm overly concerned about swelling, I just have to think about the lumpectomy and its swelling for about two, three weeks to realize it may be way too early to say anything. Hope the doctors can enlighten me further tomorrow. Meanwhile, I try to stay positive & do my exercizes! Thanks again and enjoy your Sunday. ",

I was just wondering what to do with my scar, not the lumpectomy one that I'll have in July, but the portable catheter scar..It's true, I haven't been worrying about erasing scars (have quite many on my body) but just saw this one (had the cat placed in the end of January) and decided I wanted it gone after all. The scar itself is nice and straight, but very visible if I have sleeveless clothes. Do you think it will help massaging it with oil and vitamine E three months later? Or is another possibility laser? I wish you all a nice weekend!",
