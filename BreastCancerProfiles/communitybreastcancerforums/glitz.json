It's about 2 inches long, on the outside of my breast but doesn't go along the curve of my breast. It's horizontal. I feel disfigured and dumb because there could be more wrong but I'm crying about looking hideous Log in to post a reply",

Walmart has a Danskin brand that has a zipper front and it has been such a help. I had bought some back closing sports bras but material is more irritating. I've also been sleeping sitting up and that seems to help too. Good luck",
