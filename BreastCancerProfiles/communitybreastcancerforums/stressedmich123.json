I went to have my biopsy a few weeks ago i could not tolerate the pain of the clamping of the breast while having mammogram as they do not numb the breast until about 20 mins in(the nurse told me as have to get pictures ect) also i had to lie on the edge of a hard rock table nearly hanging off i have scoliosis chronic pain all over my body and i also have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disease. when i went to see the consultant after the biopsy appointment he told me there is no alternative they do not sedate for this procedure they only can mammogram in a years time but the problem is i have intermidate calcifications which he said there is no way of telling if cancerous or not unless i have this biopsy. i am scheduled in for next week to try again but i cant see me doing it so just wondered if any of you have had it done a different way also if you are disabled did they offer you any alternatives and how did you get on? would be grateful for any replies worried sick Log in to post a reply",
