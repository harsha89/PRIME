I am encouraged by the women who are still here 10 years! No one but God knows how long we will be here. Mine started out stage 1 three years ago . I was shocked to find myself stage 1V when I was told that it was a small tumor and I really did not need chemo. My mother had the same thing and died of something else 26 years later. Oh well, that's life I guess. Anyway I told my Oncologist that I am determined to live as long as possible or die trying! She got a kick out of that. I am on Taxol and going to do a Liver biopsy which I'm scared about. Is it bad? Any info any one has would be helpful! Thank you!",
