(today will be my third down-to-town-twice-in-one-day trip)   My biggest concern is if this machine breaks down so regularly (always something different it seems), then how safe is it really?  Are breakdowns like this a common occurence, and nothing to worry about?

With immediate therapy, exercise, compression, MLD, I've managed to avoid the dx of \"stage one\" - and was dx at  \"stage 0, but LE definitely there\".  In 2010 I only lost 3 nodes, but I'm small, and pretty strong & lean especially for a senior. Fast forward to May 2012. About an hour after my all-clear 2-yr mammo. (IDC, lumpectomy), I realized I had a lump on my upper arm at the shoulder, same side - upper outer arm almost opposite from where the SN incision. The lump felt doughey. Saw PCP 3 days later, he dx lipoma - a fatty tumor. After xrays and MRI & ortho surgeon visits, it is a lipoma, and it looks like it needs to be taken out.  My concern is that this is the arm with \"no sticks, no bp, etc.\"  I don't want to compromise the lymph system any more than it already is.  I am already feeling the effects of this extra mass in the arm - more swelling in my hand, the numb & tingly feeling.  (so I'm doing some MLD & exercises.)    What do I need to know before I pre-surgery consult with the surgeon? I just don't know what to questions to ask or ????. Thanks very much for any suggestions. Log in to post a reply",

So I'm having second thoughts about waiting.  I have appts this month with PCP & onc, and will listen to their opinions as well.  I just like to try to be a good Girl Scout - prepared. Thanks again and I truly appreciate your last line cautionary note!!!",
