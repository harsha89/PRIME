      "Content": "amc1106 wrote: Sorry if this is long- I am 38 and had and ultrasound done as I had two lumps my ob-gyn wanted to make sure they were benign as BC runs in my family.  Few days later received a call that my doctor wanted to have them biopsied and I had a mammotome biopsy done on 7/12/13. During the biopsy surgeon hit a blood vessel and acted like no big deal and said he could not remove the lumps completely because they were too big. My follow-up wasn't until 7/31/13 and was told to keep steri-strips on until that appointment. In the mean time I waited to hear back on my results. Finally, it was 7/30/13 and I still had not heard from the surgeons office, so I called them for my results.  They said they couldn't find them. So I waited an hour and finally got a call back saying they didn't know where the original went to and had to call the hospital for a copy (date stamp reveals they had this in their office on 7/22/13). Results were benign, which is awesome. The nurse proceeded to ask me if I was still going to come in tomorrow for my FU and I said yes thinking the doctor would go into detail about everything and take steri-strips off and examine the area. So, my husband and I went in, nurse was in the room with us longer than the doctor was. He basically rushed us out of there in about 5 minutes. The surgeon told me to take the strips off myself (no exam done), that the lumps were fibroids, and since I had a mammogram done already to redo one next year...I stopped him in his tracks because I had never had a mammy, and he was like \"ok, well get one next year\" and he said he basically removed the lumps and anything left would go away during menopause. The lumps are NOT removed. They are there pretty close to the same size as before the biopsy (1.63 x 1.51 x 1.0 cm & 2.51 x 3.52 x 2.43 cm). He then scooted us out of the office in a flash. We were dumfounded. Before we left the office we asked for copies of the US and PATH reports, both in which told us things the surgeon never did. One lump has its own blood flow and has a dx of a fibroadenoma with ductal hyperplasia, not atypical.  The other, smaller one, is listed as just a fibroadenoma. Now it is 8 weeks later and the lumps, which never before biopsy, are hurting me. The more active I am, the more they hurt. So, I called the surgeons office and they said to ice it and take motrin and if I have any problems to call them in a couple weeks. Can anyone tell me if they think I should get a second opinion or go see someone else for the pain or just wait it out? I just kind of feel the surgeon thinks I am wasting his time. Any advice? Thank you for taking the time... Blessings, Ann Log in to post a reply",

I guess my question to ask would be what does my dx mean (fibroadenoma with ductal hyperplasia, not atypical) and is the blood flow any concern? Surgeon never talked with me about this or told me, so I'm not sure.  Thank you, again...blessings and prayers to each of you. ~Ann",
