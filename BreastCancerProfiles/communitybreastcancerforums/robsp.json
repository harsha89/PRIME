Sentinel Lymph Node Injection: Very little pain and my node was found in 30 minutes. Anesthesia: I received an injection at my room and do not remember anything. I only remember at recovery room with the anesthetist. After Surgery: Not much pain. It´s hard the first time to urinate after surgery. It´s difficult to sleep with drain. Day After Surgery: I could come back to my home the morning after surgery. I´m just taking antibiotics and do not need pain medications at home. Unfortunately my nodes were removed, but the surgeon made only a single incision and I´m using single drain. Constipation: I had some constipation after surgery, 3 days. I drink a lot of water and eat many vegetables, whole brain bread, fruits and I´m fine now. Drain: I have little pain from the drain. I hope remove my drain 1 week after surgery. Yesterday was 65 ml of fluid. Shower: The surgeon use superbonder like glue and I can take shower with drain. Arm movement: I can not move arm above my shoulder. I will begin exercises after removing my drain. My major worries now are with future chemo and the results of my pathology report. The first report shows Perineural Inavasion present, T1c size , pN1a (1 to 3 nodes), but 9 nodes with microscopic cancer cells.",

My MO give me 7 days of antibiotics (Levofloxacin).  I am reading some information about neutropenia related to chemotherapy and says that 85% of infections is due the bacterias that is already inside our body. We have about 10 times more bacterias than human cells, maybe these neutropenic precautions with food , contact with other people, etc it is exaggerated if our major enemies live  with us.   I hope that in the next 10 days my neuthophil count is enough to next infusion. ",

I am neutropenic now , 0.1 of neutrophil count. I do not know if is possible in your case change chemo protocol, but in my case I had weekly taxol instead of Taxotere, both drugs are the same class of taxanes. My neutrophil count was always above 2 during weekly taxol and many people had few side effects, although I have some neuropathy in my feet that I hope go away, but there is no treatment. Some links that I found where MO changed from Taxotere to taxol. http://forum.breastcancercare.org.uk/t5/Chemothera... http://breastcancerat38.blogspot.com/2012/09/taxot... You had no lymph nodes with cancer, Oncotype test could help you but I think should be done after surgery, maybe you do not need chemo , but it´s a very expensive exam. Do you know if your pathology report indicate something where you have more chance of recurrence like Tumor Grade 3 , high ki67 , vascular invasion ? It´s very hard to suggest something. Maybe you can try to continue your chemo if you think you can deal with your side effects and risk of severe infection.",
