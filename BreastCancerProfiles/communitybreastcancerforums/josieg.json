I had IDC/DCIS (diagnosed in June last year), had lumpectomy July, radiation August/September, and have been on Tamoxifen since October. Mammogram last week showed suspicious calcifications on left side (same side as DX) and I had to get a stereotactic biopsy on Friday. Results have just come in as ADH, and they are referring me to breast surgeon. RO thinks I may not even need another incision since the area was so small, but clearly with my history, and the fact that I'm taking Tamoxifen and have had lumpectomy/radiation I'm concerned I even got this diagnosis. (ps - stereotactic biopsy was horrible! I have had them before lying down but this one was sitting up and I fainted in the middle of it - they let me do it again lying down).",
