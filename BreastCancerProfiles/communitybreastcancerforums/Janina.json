Until recently, the breast did not hurt.  Now it has an irrating feeling, a burning sensation around the area of the lump. I am 39, turning 40 in April.  I have a 19 and 17 yr old and started over having a baby 2 yrs ago (which is why a recent loss in weight...still was working on getting baby fat off).  I am so scared at this point.  I have prepared for bad news, but praying for good!!  dx at age 39.
