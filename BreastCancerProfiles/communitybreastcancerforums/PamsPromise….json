I wish you all the best in your biopsy and that your results will be B9. I'm playing the waiting game myself with a biopsy planned for July 18. I alternate between being strong and then being a wreck....today I'm a wreck. My suggestion would be to share it with your family. This is way to stressful to handle alone. I will keep you in my prayers. Take care, Pam",

Suggested repeat mammo in 6 months. Both my mother and grandmother had breast cancer. My mother is a 15 year survivor. I have worried about it for most of my life and since June 30 when I received my abnormal mammo and US results it has been just about the only thing on my mind. I don't know what I would have done without this site. The information on here is outstanding. My best to all of you going through this struggle. You are amazing women.
