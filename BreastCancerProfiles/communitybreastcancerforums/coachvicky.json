I know the people meant well but I think you don't remember or know how I used to look. My husband reminds me that I get more compliments on my hair style now than I ever did before but in my heart I that does not matter. I know I should be more grateful that I have hair. I am grateful. But it is like wanting a 32 ounce prime rib dinner with a fully loaded potato and instead getting a veggie burger on a lettuce wrap. I miss me before cancer. Will I ever feel different about this?

My lashes went three times and the first was early January 2017 when I was over chemo and on Herceptin. I lost them three times but they returned fairly quickly. I did use Latisse to help with the growth. The first two times the lashes came back the hair felt funny (too fine, wrinkled ...). As for my brows, last week I stopped filling them end. The gaps have finally closed. My brows are better than ever. I doubt that I ever wax again! I finally have girly shaped brows and not my Daddy's brows. Coach Vicky ",

My husband likes short hair and tells me all the time how nice my hair looks. I thank him. I know he means it. My hair is grey. I have probably been ever color in the Clairol line. I hate grey hair. My barber, friends, husband tell me my hair is silver. I appreciate their kind words. It still looks grey to me. I miss the person I was before cancer. I don't think she will ever come back. In some ways that it OK. I know I am a nicer person now. I think my different hair is the epitome of what it means to have cancer. Fixing my hair and makeup has always been such a big part of my life. Now, all that is over in a few minutes. I spend my time trying to look like I use to. I have not been late for anything since my diagnosis. It just doesn't take me long to get ready anymore. I don't even have to shave my legs. I have accepted this is the way my life is and there is no going back. That is probably the hardest decision I have had to made. Deciding to have my breasts amputated was an easier decision. So that has been the struggle. Now for the good news. My husband and I were on a road trip and checked into a hotel Sunday night. Some 20 something hotel clerk that checked us in looked at me and said \"I want to cut my hair like yours but I don't have the courage. Your hair looks great.\" There is hope. Coach Vicky  ",

I've been able to sit on my hair, perm my hair, and do just about anything I wanted to it before chemo And now that it isshort and buzzed with more black than gray (this is my first time with black hair), I don't think I'll ever go back to anything else. My husband loves shorthair and my friends tell me I can carry the short style off. I believe them. But mostly, I just love the ease of taking care of it. I'm looking forward to the fuzzy new growth gone and my hair being thicker. I guess this is a positive of the journey. Coach Vicky",

I have a letter from my Oncologist stating my cancer diagnosis and where my port is located. I had a letter from my Plastic Surgeon stating I had tissue expanders (those are gone now since I have had reconstruction). These were simply \"to whom it may concern\" on my doctors' letterhead stationary. You can go to the TSA website for additional guidance. When I checked in at Delta the first time I flew after all this happened, I started to cry. I explained to the agent what had happened and I was afraid to go thru security with TSA, She told the other agents that she was going to walk me to TSA. Once there she explained my condition. Because I was pre-screened (this appears at the bottom of the boarding pass) TSA had me simply walk thru the scanner. One TSA male agent carried my bag for me and I didn't even have to open my lap top. BTW, I always use my passport for identification when flying. I look nothing like the picture anymore! There are some really caring people in the world. So ...seq24 ...have a ball on vacation! Coach Vicky    ",

Wanted to share this: I still have some numbness on the back of my left arm and under my arms. This is where I itch. My BMX was July 2016. Implant surgery was January 2017. The back of my right arm just feels different. I used a coffee scrub on these areas once I healed and I think that brought back a lot of feeling. I still use a coffee scrub but not everyday anymore. I can live with this and I don't want to live with this. So ... I asked my Physical Therapist if she thought dry needling would help. She made no promises but agreed to try it. I had my first dry needling on Tuesday. I have not itched and I have a little greater feeling on the back on my left arm. The back of my right arm feels almost normal. I have three sessions, each a week apart, to go. She also recommends some home techniques such as gently rubbing a cotton ball over the areas followed by a sharp end of a paperclip. I have no idea if this will work for the long term. My insurance covers seeing the Physical Therapist and the exercises but not dry needling. The charge is $35.00 for the dry needling plus my co-pay of $30.00. Coach Vicky ",
