      "Content": "Jun 7, 2010 04:03PM - edited Jun 7, 2010 04:05PM by hotsyta WARNING: This may be too morbid, but I too am concerned, newly dx and have so many questions that I can't ask others or discuss with friends and family. When I was first dx there was a website that I found on here that showed the percentage rate of likely recurrence based on chemo or none and a whole bunch of other factors. They said it was just for docs but we were able to access it without a prob. Perhaps try to post this question on the main board and see what you can find or maybe do a search on it. I myself am also very new and I felt as you do my first time around. This time I am understanding that those stats don't really matter, and I will gladly take the chemo if it means a little longer with my little ones and dh. If the poisons make me soooooo sick I still think it will be better than w/o tx. My mom passed 6 months after dx. She was in too much pain for rads and chose no chemo. Without tx and it was pretty horrible. I think the difference may be if you don't have chemo you wait for the cancer to take over some system that is necessary for life to function. If you do have chemo and you still die it is because your body eventually gets too tired to manage after some time and your death may be more peaceful. I may be totally wrong, but this is my impression. Please forgive me if this post offends anyone, I am pretty scared too. mets: liver, lung, bones and lymph system ",

I am relieved to see that most people have liked Gemzar (Sorry to hear you had such a rough time with it Pee). Once again this treatment plan has progressed very fast and my head is spinning. I just found the new mass on 4-30, had surgery 5-14 and now chemo starting tomorrow. I am still waiting to find out when the PET scan will be. Dana, are you able to continue in all your normal activities since you have been taking Gemzar? My onc says I will have it weekly for one hour each time. I really wanted to keep working a few hours each week and I'm hoping I will feel well enough to do that. I also just graduated from college and I wanted to start substitute teaching in the fall.  I REALLY don't want to put that on hold too! But I suppose it doesn't matter that much how long it takes to complete my goals. I need to be patient with myself. I'm so thankful to find people to talk to here. Tennille ",

My BFF was incredibly worried about no chemo, but my BS says some types of cancer (which is apparently mine) don't respond well to chemo and I will be tx w/ Tamoxifen after my MX. Hopefully no rads!! I am here on this board to prepare myself. I won't know about the rads until after the surgery. Joelle, I don't think it matters why you came here, if you find love and support here then we did our job to each other. We don't always--heck most of the time for me, understand why we face such terrible afflictions, but we always know someone is looking out for us and protecting us from things we can't handle. I have strange grief issues with the loss of my parents but I know that there is nothing I can do to change that so I just have to be confident and I am grieving \"okay\" and in time I will have learned how to handle the pain. I sometimes think I keep myself from the grieving to lessen the pain, maybe I couldn't handle it all at once. Hope this helps, and Jesus bless you too, church makes a HUGE difference for me. I was very involved in church during my father's illness and death but I stayed out of church during my mother's BC battle and death. I have so much peace about my dad's death but boy howdy did I deal with the pain from my mom's death in a twisted up way!! I have gone back to church since my dx, hoping to come through this with a closer spiritual rel w/ Jesus as well as a more intact spirit. Hope this helps! Ta",

I was in severe pain prior to treatment and that really escalated till I finally got some relief on Friday. So far still no pain and I even had my scan on Sunday night and I was able to sit still the entire time. I will be relieved to find out if the pain is cancer related or not. PCP is treating me for Bursitis in one area and really has no explanation for all the other areas of pain. At least they are treating it though. Labs today and off for round two tomorrow! Starting chemo again has been such a daunting prospect. I really felt like I was not going to be able to handle it, but I am feeling much more hopeful now. I am soooooo thankful to have options. @Denise: Thanks so much for the word on Gemzar in your life. Can't seem to find the RED grape juice so far, but will keep looking. I have been drinking pomegranate juice, which I love! We'll see how the labs turn out.  @Alison:  Here's to getting \"time off\"!!    Tennille ",

I think what happens with these refurb beds is that they replace all of the foam and soft support but the springs will always have the \"memory\" of being squished from who knows how long they were used. I am now considering a new mattress or maybe the memory topper from costco. My BFF just purchase an off brand memory mattress that is foam on the top and springs on the bottom, Eastern King, for $595. I need to go there to see about a queen.  Ta ",

I am hurting so bad and it seems to be moving around. my new dx is so recent that I am still getting the run around about pain management. Onc referred me to PCP to r/o non cancer related causes of pain. He perscribed me one week of pain meds and 1 month out appt to physical therapy dept. Luckily they moved me up and gave cortisone shots to three areas. I had surgery to remove the new lump on the 14th and surgeon gave me another week rx for pain meds. Now that I have a new severe area of pain that has developed I went to surgeon for refill. Problem is Vic 5-500 is really not doing the job and I am still up all night and a little scared of the amount I'm having to take to just sit still long enough to fall asleep for two hours. Is this as good as it gets!!! Do I really have to have scan results to prove my pain should be taken seriously? Shouldn't my onc be the one handling this issue?!!!",
