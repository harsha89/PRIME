I geuss it is safe to assume that I need to find another physical therapist?",

      "Content": "ladycsi1970 wrote: I had stage 2 Melanoma, which is the sister cancer to breast cancer. The Melanoma was located just above my left breast. It is the same surgery and treatment as breast cancer. I have about a 5 inch incision above my left breast, and 4 lymph nodes were removed from under my left armpit. The surgery was in September of 2008. All of the cancer was removed, and I did not have to undergo any further treatment. My doctors did not educate me about Lymphedema, and now I have it. It drains into my left breast, around the nipple. I saw a breast cancer specialist, who told me to wear a good supportive bra at all times. When my breast is supported by the bra, the fluids go away (well, I am not sure where they really go). However, the cleavage part of my breast, while wearing a bra, fills back up with fluid, leaving what feels like a lump. When I am in the bed sleeping, it all goes away. I was given a prescription to go to physical therapy where they will teach me how to do a manual drain. However, they told me that it will come right back and be a problem on a daily basis. There is currently no pain associated with it. ONTO MY QUESTION: I am 7 months pregnant. Given everything above, is breastfeeding going to be possible? Or, due to the fluid build-up around my nipple, is it \"not\" a good idea to breast feed? This is my 4th baby (I've had 8 miscarriages). After having 3 boys it is finally a girl, and this will be our last baby. I am 38 and my husband is 51. I am a stay at home mom. My oldest boys (12 and 17) are in school during the day. My youngest boy (3) stays home with me. So, with a newborn and a 3 year old at home, it will not be possible for me to do a manual drain of my lymph fluids every time I need to pump or feed. Furthermore, doing a manual drain when my breast will be full of milk is not going to work either...I am trying to rule this possibility out and hoping for an answer as to whether or not it will be safe or even possible to breast feed \"with\" the fluids built up around my breast. ~Thank you for reading!!
