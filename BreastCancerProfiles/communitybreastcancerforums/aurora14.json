Next to start soon is the Kisqali or ribociclib tablets. Has anyone experienced this treatment and was hair loss a side effect? Any comments appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Oct 6, 2018 11:30PM - edited Oct 6, 2018 11:50PM by aurora14 Thank you all for your quick replies to my inquiry . I have been on the Kisqali (ribociclib) for almost a week now. Along with the Falsodex injections monthly and the zomeda infusion every 3 months so far. Thursday I had the shots and infusion so along with the ribociclib daily , I am feeling a bit lousy but I am hoping it will pass in a couple more days and I will get back to \"less\" lousy. I wonder if the side effects of the ribociclib get worse the longer you take it or if the body settles down to another \"normal\". I have to say though, that although I have only been on it almost a week, I feel the effects are easier to deal with than chemotherapy for sure. Less intrusive on normal activity during the day. The 15th I get a bone scan to see if anything has changed. I was happy to hear that with just the Falsodex the tumor marker went down substantially much to my relief. Hope you all are hanging in there, facing each of the daily challenges as best you can and not let this get you too side tracked from enjoying the days now and the days ahead.",
