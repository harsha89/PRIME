As far as the skin problems I had very little.  BUT, during the radiation I started having shoulder pain, and numbness and tingling down to my fingertips.  I would wake at night with my hands burning, tingling and numb.  I have not had any sensation in the tips of my thumb, pointer and middle fingers now for over 5 weeks.  I have been referred to a neurologist for these problems.  It is belived to be a nerve problem from my neck. I had radiation only to the right side, but my nerve problems are on both sides. I never had any pain or health problems prior to being told I had this cancer.  I thought I was extremely healthy.  I don't smoke, drink only a glass of wine once in a while, and watch what I eat.  I am 5' 6\" and weigh 128.  I also work regularly in my gardens and am used to strenuous work.  However, I now feel like I hurt so bad some of the time that I wish I never had the surgery or radiation.  I can't wait to see the neurologist (May 8).  Nothing like having to wait almost two months to get in with one of these guys! I do believe that if this pain was not caused by the radiation that it at least exacerbated the situation.  PJ",
