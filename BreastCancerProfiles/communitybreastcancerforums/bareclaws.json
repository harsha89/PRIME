I unwrapped the ace bandage this morning and and took a full on shower. Got a good look at my incisions. Longer than I would have liked but whatever. I wiill be able to wear a tank top, even v-neck. Scars may show a little bit under arms but I don't care. The two drains are a PITA but with an empire top, or something with lower bodice gathers, they're camouflaged. No pain meds needed. Experiencing a bit of muscle soreness when I do the arm exercises but nothing remotely bad. Walked a bit yesterday and I will do more today. I guess my message to those of you who haven't had your surgery yet is, don't fear it. Surgeon just called with lab reports. Clear margins. Some lymph nodes came out with the tumor on left side and they were negative. There was small residual tumor on left side and more diffusedcancer on the right, but non-invasive. I really don't think this could have been any better for me, unless all the cancer had disappeared. It's gone now. So why didn't my surgeon sound upbeat and positive? Maybe I was expecting too much.",

Careful look at my uncovered incisions this morning, a lump here, a bump there. Please tell me that this will all even out in time. And uncovered, the numbness of incision area and around them is disconcerting. I do have feeling at center of breastbone. Does any of this come back? Another thing, I had a total of seven lymph nodes removed on left side. Five of those came out with the left breast tissue. The sentinel node and another one tangled up with it had been taken a few months ago. So today, no drains and ace bandage only, I'm starting to feel little twinges on the underside of my upper left arm. Could this be the first warning sign of lymphedema? Could the tight ace bandage cause that?",

You can't put the genie back in the bottle. I was organic before organic was a thing. I was the healthiest 64 year old you can imagine, running three marathons and several halves this last year. With bilateral breast cancer. I'm not saying that it's not environmentally triggered, because I think It may well be, but those are larger issues not within our personal control-our water supply, poisons in the air we breathe, etc. I see a lot of crazy ideas here. Our bodies need a balance of protein, fats and carbs (yes, carbs! High quality, though, I'm not talking about sugar) to repair the damage done during chemo. Cutting one of those drastically is not going to be helpful and may harm. Personally, I find that I'm eating a lot more calories and not gaining weight at all because it's being used. Balancing all of these heavy hitting drugs is a tightrope act for the doctors. Add everyone's personal mix of OTC supplements to that and it becomes that much harder to keep everything in sync. My strategy is going be to eat well, keep exercising as much as possible, rest, and trust the doctors as much as my control freak self can",

It's absurd that this is now unavailable to us (at least in my state). It doesn't make you high. Big Pharma has a long reach. Forgot to mention that all my doctors and nurses (and even pharmacist) know that I'm using mj for nausea relief. While they can't recommend it, no one has said don't do it, and one nurse told me it does no harm to breast cancer patient. They know. But their hands are tied. I really don't care who knows. Come and arrest the small white-haired (soon to be bald) widow who has bilateral breast cancer and is on chemo. That will play well online.",

If no relapse, then continue with Herceptin and Taxol. If Herceptin causes my ITP to come roaring back, I'll have to have my spleen removed. In any case, I'm glad to know there's a plan, and options for different scenarios,",

While I often just feel like crawling under the blanket fort and staying there for the duration, I've come to the realization that I'm just too mean and nasty to do that. (The political climate has given me a target for my rage, other than my own personal situation. There are certainly others out there who have it far worse.) And I fight for my kids, who have had way too much to deal with in recent months. For some reason, they think they still need me. It helps me to focus on the now and plan only a little bit for the future. Thinking too far ahead has been counterproductive as things tend to change quickly. I'm going to run this morning, third time this week. That's huge. I've been such a slug for the last eight weeks and my weight is creeping up with the steroids and crazy eating patterns. Not being able to smell or taste much has made me eat MORE, not less. Nothing satisfies. But I am tapering the steroids so there's hope to get off of those eventually. Scared witless about Taxol coming up and the possible neuropathy SE. I should chill, but. Running. I would be devastated if that became impossible. (I'm a barefoot runner.) Also fingers.

They can't get my platelets to go up and stay up. The highest they've been so far is 47 but then drop back down the next morning. The steroids (solumedrol) make me feel like a zombie. Can't sleep, agitated, myriad of other side effects. My DIL brought me dinner tonight from a favorite Mediterranean chain, so that was a nice change of pace. The food here is not as healthy as what I would ordinarily eat and that's taking a toll. I have had no exercise in a week now. Haven't been outdoors. Drinking dandelion tea at the moment in an attempt to flush some of the extra fluid buildup from steroids. And of course holidays, so I don't feel like I'm getting the continuity of care that one could expect otherwise. The oncologist on call today told me that any drug can cause ITP. But of course they don't know which one caused mine. This compromises future treatment. As you can tell, I'm pretty discouraged. PS to all who worry about getting a port. I can't imagine how much worse all of this would be right now if I didn't have the port. While the onc lab didn't use it and my right arm suffered for it, the hospital does everything through the port and so far there's been a LOT of everything. You just never know what chemo is going to do to you, so get the port! ",

It was 9 hours at the infusion center, mostly extra time for cap fitting, adjusting and the extra cooling after infusion and slow first time infusions to watch for reactions (none). So next time should go faster. I was really tired by the time it was over, came home, ate dinner, fell asleep in a chair watching Rachel Maddow and gave it up. The good thing is I DID sleep for at least a few hours last night. Physically, today I just feel sort of odd, off, if you will. Dry, fuzzy mouth and I am addressing that. No GI issues, but I consume a lot of probiotic foods already, like miso, sauerkraut, kombucha, kefir, etc. Adding more of that kind of thing is no problem for me. I'm going to try a three mile walk here in a few minutes. Tomorrow, after this damn Neulasta bomb goes off-a short run. I've gained four lbs from the steroids. AAGH!!

Landed in hospital for five days and two IG infusions. The two oncologists ( one is also a hematologist)gave me a month off and then switched me to AC for now. After that's done,,they're going to try Herceptin alone to see if that was the culprit. Because I need the Herceptin. In the meantime, lots of blood labs to watch platelet count. It was scary for awhile. If your nose starts bleeding and won't stop, go to the ER. But that is rare.",

You may not have pain or need pain killers at all after you leave the hospital. I didn't. DO the exercises. My BS had me doing them the very next day. It was hard the first day but worth the effort to quickly regain full range of motion. My biggest problem was dealing with the compression bandage, which I could not wait to ditch, along with the drains. You should have no trouble caring for your little dog. He will be a comfort for you. Oh, after the bandages came off, I just wore a cotton camisole for a few weeks.",

I started with TCHP, supposed to be every three weeks, but due to bad reaction, I'm now doing AC every two weeks x 4, then Taxol every week x 12. Started the AC today and it went swimmingly. Of course, I don't know what the next week will bring.  Ang905, thanks for reminding me of the water. I just got up and retrieved a bottle, forcing myself to drink it. I sucked on ice during the Adriamycin, but it was only a 7-minute \"push\", so no big deal. Hope it helps. I'm only now starting to get my taste buds back from the first chemo a month ago (TCHP). I go back in tomorrow for anti-nausea fluids and the Neulasta shot. Hated wearing it on-body. But I had no pain associated with it. Hear a lot of people talking about bone pain, but not everyone gets it. I took one Claritin last time, but think I'll skip it this time around.",

Lilo and Positive2strong, I am hearing you about your husbands. My husband of 44 years died unexpectedly in August, and I am so glad he's not here for this. It would have made it harder in many ways, although it would be also good to have someone to share this burden with. As it is, I dump it on my kids and their spouses. They willingly accept that but so much in their plates too with the death of their dad. All we can do is put one foot in front of the other and try to move forward. I have nothing but admiration for those of you who are working and taking care of children through this. Trying to remind myself that my life is easy by comparison. Stay strong",
