Bit of history....Oct/11 I found a large lump on my throat after testing and much waiting and finally surgery I was diagnosised with thyroid cancer Aug/12. I had Radioactive Iodine treatment 3 weeks ago followed by 4 days isolation than a Whole Body Scan 10 days later. Imagine my surprise when I got a call back from my family Dr less than a week later to go over results and they results showed a totally unrelated 1.5cm lump in my left breast that is \"likely\" cancer than he said i'm really sorry but you need to have mammogram and ultrasound. Really?!?!?!?!? I was lucky enough to get them both done a few days later and was all prepared to wait a week to hear back from Dr office. Well imagine my surprise AGAIN when the lab calls 3 days later to say they can move my biopsy up to that morning. My obvious reply was my what???? I haven't even spoken to Dr regarding ultrasound test! After checking to make sure they informed me that Dr office requested FNA biopsy and it was booked for Dec 14 but my Dr asked them to move it up and they were able to get me in so I took the appt and called dr office to confirm. So I had the u/s guided FNA biopsy 2 days ago and have been a nervous wreak since! I've tried not to read too much online for fear of really scary myself but from the little I have read it doesn't look too good for me as well as the fact that it showed up on Whole Body Scan which will \"light up\" areas of concern. I have a cyst on my ovaries that we've been watching for a few yrs now and that didn't show up and that just makes me all the more concerned! I'm glad to have found this group as my Thyroid cancer support group has been a God send with all the support and knowledge from other traveling along the same path. I really don't know how I'm gonna take hearing that i have cancer for the 2nd time within months of each otther??? Log in to post a reply",

I said I had a FNA but it's likely it could have been a core biopsy as lump in not visible and can't be felt and they took about 4 smalples with a neddle that made a loud clicking sound. I have to add I have been \"hypo\" since being off thyroid replacement meds and my brain is not functioning properly yet so confusion is very likely. I won't be going to any more appts alone. Thanks for mentioning the oncotype testing. should i still ask for it no matter what results from biopsy are??",
