Now 10 years later I have found a lump that feels just like the other one, but in the other breast, almost directly behind the nipple.  I was scheduled for my annual screening mammogram the following day.  They did it as a diagnostic mammogram which showed nothing.  Followed by and ultrasound which also showed absolutely nothing. It's been a couple months and I saw my nurse practitioner for my annual pap and such and she could feel this lump and said I should not trust the negative mammogram and ultrasound.  I saw the surgeon who did my previous surgery and he has scheduled me for a biopsy next week.  He thinks it's probably benign, but given my history and how I was told last time that it was probably nothing, he agrees we should get it out and see. Don't let anyone tell you it is nothing.  Hopefully it will be benign, but they don't know until they remove it.  You know your body better than anyone else and when something doesn't seem right, trust your instincts.  Get it removed and if it's benign at least you'll have peace of mind.",
