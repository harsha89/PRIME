But recently, I thought about my situation, and I am now considering about doing BMX.. I have extremely dense breast, and my DCIS in the left side is grade 3 with necrosis, there are additional two unknown enhancements was found during MRI test after I was dx as DCIS. All these make me feel supper anxious and raised my worries. So I asked my surgeon if I can switch to do BMX. She comes back to say, if I want to do BMX, then there is no need to take hormone therapy medicine, I just need to go see her every six month. However, if I do MX, then I need to do image exam my right breast (currently healthy one) every six month, plus I need to take the hormone medicine. So, it is kind of hard for me to make decision. I know there are some side effect of the medicine, but I know it can help reducing the reoccurring. If I leave the right breast untouched, also means I need to experiences the anxious stressful test every 6 month.. Anyone can help me and provide some suggestions?

Since my surgery date is already set next Thursday, if I change to BMX, then it will postpone my surgery date for removing DCIS, which I definitely do not want to. So I will probably still go with MX on 11/3, then during the recovering time, I have more time to think, if I decide to do another MX on my right, I will not take the Tamoxifen. I was told that normally we should start Tamoxifen about one month after sugery?",

She just say, if I want to go with LX, then we need to do MRI guided biopsy for those new areas. if we decide to do MX, then no need to do biopsy and the after surgery PATh report will show what it is. I told her that I can't handle the stress of doing the mammogram check every 6 month, also I am not big fan of radiation treatment. So she said then we will go ahead to do MX. I also asked her about the margin, she said she has confidence to clean my margin.. ",

I had a DCIS grade 3 on my left breast, and Dr asked to do MRI scan before we finalize the treatment plan. Now the MRI returns two suspicious enhancements both on my left breast. Right side is fine. They suggests to do MRI guided biopsy if US can not detect these areas. Yesterday I went to do US, and it can not find anything. So I had to go back to try the MRI biopsy next week. I am going to see my Dr today and if i told her that i prefer to do MX for my DCIS, I am not sure if the MRI biopsy is still needed or not. ",
