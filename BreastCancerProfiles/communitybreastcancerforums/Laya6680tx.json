My tumor was a little bigger than yours, but due to the triple positive status, I did have to do chemo :( I'm sure you are full of questions, so just take it one day at a time! The best advice I can give is to research ahead of time, ask lots of questions, and write everything down, or take someone to your appointments to write everything down for you. You are your own best advocate! ~Bethany",
