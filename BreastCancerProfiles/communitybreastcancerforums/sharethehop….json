Many of the drugs I hear you ladies taking now are from the co. I was associated with & gratefully they do send us info on them. And there is always so much more to learn. I am also not saying that cancer medicine wouldn't always be needed even if you are said to be NED. I have had cancer since 1995 & in that time have had 8 different onc. Some because I move & some because they moved. I've had a sister die of cancer, a brother, a grandfather had cancer my mom had cancer, my grandmother had cancer, an aunt died of bc & several friends have died. Talked to a lot of onc thought the years. I do realize I'm old but have yet to be declared senile so I think I have the terminology correct. Besides its in writing. This onc is negative & I am tired of it. I guess his being neg is my call to make. I had a pos attitude after all its been over 20 yrs.

This onc just is so depressing. I had my visit w/him the day he wrote the notes & he didn't say these things face to face, in fact he hadn't even met w/the committee yet. He just says the most distressing things. He believes that even if cancer doesn't show up on a scan you still have it. So there are no NED patients because even if it cant be seen its there. Well, it could be but maybe not. Yet he also says newly diagnosed breast cancer is curable. I could go on but won't. He is just such a downer. About the mountain. Mom, the mts are ugly this time of yr so won't sit & look down. Besides, I really don't like heights. Actually the mt thing is from an old cartoon.  The words are: \"I'd like to die in my sleep like my grandpa ...................... not screaming & yelling like the passengers in his car.\" Has a picture of old timey car going over a mt.  Its funny unless some jackass is telling you to get measured for a coffin. Besides I have a houseful of delightful legal drugs available.  Wish cannabis were legal here but not medical for adults. Plan to get a 3rd opinion -  don't think a second from one of my onc compadres will be of much help. We were suppose to be considering Zoleda or a trial. Thought there might be something positive there. Apparently he doesn't.  You all know we go through so much. They cut off parts of our bodies, we lose our hair, were sick, were exhausted, our emotions are all over the place, we live with death by our side even if we try not to, then we have to deal with medical personnel that should be working with cars instead of people. Where's karma when you need it.",

Always so cold at these places & they don't always have blankets outside the scan area, but I will now make sure I get one while waiting the hr. Having scan in weeks & will ask them & my onc when I see him. He probably never heard of it. Looking in to change onc as this one doesn't seem interested in being of help. Just doesn't seem up on latest BC news. April",
