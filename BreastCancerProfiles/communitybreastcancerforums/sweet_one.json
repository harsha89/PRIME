A 3 cm mass was found during the test.  It appeared to both the tech and the MD to be B9, however they didn't biopsy it. The radiologist recommend removal based on size. Before I meet with the surgeon, I'd like to be as informed as possible.  My questions:  Would my mass be given a BI-RADS score at this point? Is it prudent to ask for a core biopsy before moving forward? What is the healing process like for a  core biopsy? In someone with small breasts, is excisional biopsy disfiguring?  How much does cryoablation cost?   Thanks so much!  sweet_one Log in to post a reply",
