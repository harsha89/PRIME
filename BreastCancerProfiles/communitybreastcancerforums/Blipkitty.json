I'm starting to be able to move to my side more now. Lack of sleep has not been fun but this too shall pass. The discomfort is definitely starting to get better now - a very supportive bra made the difference and I wear it 24/7. My Surgeon had to dig deeper for the SNB which recovery from that has been more challenging than the breast itself. I'm hopeful that you are feeling better and you are able to sleep on your side soon. Best of luck to you and keep in touch! Kindest regards, Blipkitty",
