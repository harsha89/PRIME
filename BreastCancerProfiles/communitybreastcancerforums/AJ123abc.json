Underwent double mastectomy in January. I was also diagnosed being BRCA 2 positive.  Exactly a year ago Sept. 25, 2012 I had a complete blood test done - This was prior to coming to know that I had breast cancer. The ALT/AST levels were 17 and 18 respectively - very normal. I then came to know of the breast cancer, and also the fact that I am BRCA2 positive. And the rest is history now... I under went a double mastectomy last January (Jan 2013). And a follow up surgery to remove skin necrosis. My onc wanted me to take tamoxifin and also under go chemo after double mastectomy. Both of which I refused to do (and will continue to refuse doing for many many reasons all of which are my concerns for negative side effects). Since January of this year, I have become a total vegan (just organic). with lots of water, carrot juice, and vegetables. I just did a complete blood test again last week. And the most recent test shows ALT/AST at 84 and 53 respectively which are off the scale. And just reviewing what has changed since Sept. 25, 2012, I can think of only the following 1) Went through the mastactomy surgery (January 23, 2013) 2) Went through the removal of the skin necrosis surgery (last April/May time frame) 3) re-did my old teeth filling (last June) 4) Became a vegan since last January (only organic food, lots of carrot and vegetable juice) 5) no alcoholic drinks (never drank before either except occasional wine) 6) No smoking (never smoke before either) 7) I do not feel having any of the classic signs of liver disease (e.g. being fatigue, abdominal pain, No Jaundice, etc.) I am wondering if medications I took for #1, #2 (e.g. anensthetic, anti-biotics, etc.) or #3 (IBPruphin) may have caused some liver irritation that has not gone away completely yet, but I wished I had a point of reference after my surgeries to compare the ALT/AST levels to what they are now to see if things have worsened or improved... (or for that matter if this is something new). I am going to do a blood test for hepatitis- but I doubt very much to have hepatitis I do not have any of the symptoms associated with hepatitis (but then of course I do not know... If you happen to have had a similar situation as mine or any thoughts...? I am a bit scared of what this could mean (and this is to say the least).  Thank you, AJ",
