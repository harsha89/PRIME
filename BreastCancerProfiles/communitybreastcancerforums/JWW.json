The sentinal node was positive. She's still got the drain in to remove the excess fluid. QUESTION...how much longer should she expect to have the drain in place? They tell her she can't have it out until she's down to 20cc's per day for 2 days in a row. She's at about 110-140 cc's per day now -- 12 days after the surgery. Log in to post a reply",
