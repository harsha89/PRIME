We woke up at 5 am to 10 inches of fresh snow...took us 2 hours to get into town for the blood draw and meeting with onc...dodging hwy closures and city snow/ice drivers crashing left and right all the way.   We love our 4wd beast more and more on days like today!   J's (my wife) wbc was perfect per the onc.  He noted that he had gotten the chemo tx right as it had knocked her down at nadir, but her body had picked up the slack and rebuilt the wbc's right back where they should be.  We don't even need to come in for a nadir bloodwork session after #2. Session #2 went faster than #1.  Our nurse was fantastic.  spent lots of time talking se's and what to expect from taxol.  She slowed the Cyto drip down to 1 hour and that eliminated the headache that J had dreaded getting this time...instead only a bit of \"bubbly feeling\" in the nose.  J was lightheaded throughout...probably from the decablahblah as this was administered with the emend. J is resting at her aunt's - stopped at whole foods for a chicken salad sammich which she polished off and reported tasting every bite of.  Sleeping now...I will pick her and our son up this evening after work and then we head back up the mountain to home sweet home. J's weight has stayed steady at 106 lbs (she is 5 ft 4 inches tall). We havta keep her eating and drinking water throughout this whole deal!!! @Gayle56:  We are hoping to avoid the Neulasta at all costs.  So far so good. @PCBarbie66:  This cracks me up everytime I read it.  I can so relate.  Not quite myself these days.  In fact today in the infusion room J turns to me and says \"you are so strange in social situations...you act like you are high, but don't even know it.  what you are saying is not making sense to anyone else but you.\"  Oh boy... @CharB22:  That pepermint oil trick is a doozy.  After my wife's MX the home nurse came out to our place in the middle of a snowstorm to change J's dressing.  J started feeling very nauseated at the sight of the MX and wanted to vomit.  The nurse suggested some peppermint oil.  I had some Dr Bronners peppermint soap around - soaked up a papertowel and after one whiff all was well again!  Amazing how far a little folk know how willl get you... If I have missed anyone I sincerely apologize.  You all have been absolutely amaziing!!!  I am going to keep checkin in if it's ok... If I can help or be of any support to anyone please let me know.  ",

That being said, people have different systems and time-frames for emotionally processing and dealing with monumental moments in life.  I would hope that your husband is working through this in his own way...hard as it may be to understand.  I hope he will in time come around and share his hope, doubts and fears with you in a way that will be meaningful to YOU. Believe it or not, I think the complete crap situation created by this disease can be an amazing opportunity to grow individually and also mature our closest, most important relationships. ",

So far (thank God) things are going well.  \"j\" is doing better than on tx #2.  Less brain fog / curtains, still some fatigue, but some weird neuropathy in both hands the day of tx (MO doesn't know what this is since we have not started Taxol yet), and finger nails turning black (nurse sez this is the Red Devil). \"J\" has had some really weird food cravings too...Spaghetti and Meatballs are the number one focus, especially day of infusion...that is all she talks about during the infusion.  Craving meat, pizza, pasta.  I told her that she needs to eat what her body is craving.  Her WBC were excellent according to the MO (6.5), so no  nadir bloodwork or neulasta for \"J\".  We are chalking this up to eating lots of strawberries, white beans, spinach, and garbonzos. Both of us are super tired today.  Baby boy (in new avatar photo w/ his mommy) was up all night and inconsolable.  Teething pain getting the best of him now, 4 new teeth on the top / bottom fronts and his molars are peeking in through the swelling...poor thing. Jealous that most of you have moved on to Taxol, but we can definitely see the light at the end of the AC tunnel.  I really like the way Nancy puts this...\"eating the elephant one bite at a time\". DeniseGardenter ~ you and my wife do have similar diags!  My wife had a history of cysts leading up to pregnancy.  She thought that was what the one huge lump was, but then it started hurting.  She still is kicking herself for not catching it sooner.  I keep telling her that we can't Monday Morning Quarterback this one.  There is no way she would have known...she had a mammo the year prior to pregnancy and was told all was well and that the lumps were just cysts...turns out pregnancy really may have accelerated the growth of her tumor since it was estrogen +.  You are all in our thoughts and prayers...daily!",
