Had 6 months chemo, 37 radiation treatments, double mastectomy, latissimus flap both sides and several other surgeries including hysterectomy. I\u2019ve been in remission 8 years and recently I\u2019ve been having itching, burning, pain and rash in the original cancer breast. Should I be concerned? Any help from anyone would be appreciated. I know in the beginning there was itching because of the nerves but I haven\u2019t experienced any in the past couple of years. Dx 9/11/2008, 6cm+, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
