I don't want to seem difficult, but I must let my disappointment out.  It seems it's very very hard to find a doctor who would be completely forthright and honest with you, in all aspects of your treatment.  Nothing can be presumed nowadays, not even if it's totally reasonable.  In all of my contact with the team and the surgeon, I was always under the impression that the surgery would be performed by the surgeon, and never received a hint as to having someone else operate. I still thank the people who cared for me, and hope this is the last that I will need to see them again.  I hope I am wrong in my assumptions regarding my operation.  Trust broken can never be truly repaired.

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2011 12:21PM - edited Jul 21, 2011 12:31PM by geyser Hi NatsFan, I have decided that I will definitely ask during the post-opt appointment.  Even though I knew I would be haveing a duct excision, after the surgery I still wished to know what the surgical outcome was, i.e. how many ducts were removed?  Did they take out both lumps?  How much tissue was removed?  It's very frustrating I could not get any of those answers after surgery.   I know the anesthesiologist was a 4th year intern but when I did the wire placement procedure, I had the same experience you mentioned -- the attending introduced herself and asked my name, DOB, what I was there for.  So when the operation turned out that way, I was immediately suspicious, and, like I said, very disappointed.",
