Your clarity, your insight, your strength and your stamina are truly remarkable. The fact that these are qualities are here, that you are here, and making yourself available to all of us while you struggle with the battle you and Diane have in front of you is truly astounding. Your compassion and caring move me deeply. Please know that I have followed your threads quietly but with genuine regard. I hope that I never have to face what you and Diane have gone through, but if I do, I will be better armed for your efforts. I have no way to truly thank you, but please know I am sending you the biggest hug in the world. Deepest regard, Cathy.",
