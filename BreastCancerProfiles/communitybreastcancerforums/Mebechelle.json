She said that during the ultrasound, they scanned a lot in her armpit and spent a long time on it, but never wound up mentioning seeing anything there. Would they have mentioned seeing nodal involvement with an ultrasound? Would they do more than a needle biopsy if that was the case? Is it more probable that they were just taking a really hard look to make sure nothing is there? She's just trying to figure out if they would've said something about possible node involvement at this point if she hasn't even had needle biopsy yet. Log in to post a reply",

Just wondering if they HAD seen something suspicious on node if they'd mention at this point or wait till after the biopsy. Since doc had to talk with her about the follow up mammo and need for a biopsy, I figured they wouldn't wait to mention if they already saw something suspicious in a node. But maybe they don't want to freak her out...? Ill give an update!",
