      "Content": "Dana25 wrote: Hi everyone-need some advice. I started TAC in Feb and was scheduled to have 6 rounds. After round 3 I had neutropenic colitis causing a perforated bowel, an ICU stay and surgery. After recovering from surgery, I did BMX. Path came back clean except for 1 node with macrometastases. After surgery asked MO if I need any additional chemo and he said no. I went on to rads. After rads asked MO again if I need chemo and again no. Went for second opinion at Stanford and immediately the MO recommended ACx3 more rounds to complete my treatment being TNBC stage 3 minus the taxotere to decrease my risk of reoccurrence. I am very scared to get more chemo after the bowel perforation however I want to throw everything at it I can. Nervous!!
