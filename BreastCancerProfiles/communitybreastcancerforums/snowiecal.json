Had a my mastectomy March 3, 2010 and glad I did it.  Best of Luck and take it one day at a time.  You will do fine. ",

Had an excisional biopsy (lumpectomy) done and was told it was LCIS...(they saw calcifications on the mammo.) Oncologist recommended that I just have clinical breast exams every three months and reg. mammo once a year.  She also told me that IF the LCIS decided to spread into something else, it would not be more agressive, just sneaky.  I didn't like that word!  After doing research I decided that I could not deal with the worry of BC popping up in my life whenever it felt like it so I took control and scheduled a double mastectomy. My oncologist almost laughed in my face.  Mastectomy was done March 3, 2010 and when the pathology report came back, I knew that I had made the right decision...for me.  They found 4 areas of DCIS  ranging from 1.1cm to 2.3cm that Never showed up on the Mammo.  If i had followed the Onc. recommendations, I would have been looking at chemo and radiation within the year.  As it is now, I am free and clear!  Saw my oncologist ( a different one) on april 8th and he told me that the cancer was completely gone from my body and I didn't need any additional treatment.  Thank God.  Now I can continue to plan my daughter's wedding for August.  Good luck to you and remember, this is a personal decision and You have TIME. Take it and educate yourself before making your decision.  Take Control Sister!",

He was better able to explain why I needed to have a biopsy since it was his field. If my regular physician had told me to have a biopsy I would have said NO.  Glad I saw a surgeon first...this was in Nov. 09. Had a double Mastectomy a month ago and what showed up as LCIS in the excisonal biopsy turned into DCIS with the Mastectomy results.  ",
