My onc wants to start me on TCH to run for 6 cycles, after which Herceptin alone for the balance of one year, and also after chemo to have radiation for 6-1/2 weeks.  At first I thought this was a bit like hitting a gnat with a sledgehammer but then he explained to me that the lump was small but ugly, and chemo/rad is necessary to prevent a recurrence.  So I have reluctantly resigned myself and will go for my first treatment 6/5. I have the world's thickest hair so I'm crossing my fingers that perhaps it won't all fall out.  But with two extra cycles of chemo I suppose it probably will.  Have bought a \"do-rag\" to wear in case it does.  Wow--I'll probably be the only librarian around who'll look like a biker! My FISH ratio turned out to be 14.69.  Is that really high, low, or indifferent?  My Ki-67 was 20% and the report said \"Unfavorable,\" but the actual guidelines are 10-20% borderline and >20% unfavorable, so I guess I'm really borderline.  It's really sort of splitting hairs, anyway, I guess. I have one question--I have an appointment coming up in a few weeks with my GYN.  Is it OK to have a pap smear done while you're in the process of receiving chemo? Thanks, everybody, and God bless!
