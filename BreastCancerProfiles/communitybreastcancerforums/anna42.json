My insurance only has one provider in my network and he has horrible reviews online. I had the DR I wanted to use submit a request for an exception it was denied even though they have privledges at my hospitaland offered to do the surgery for any fee BCBS would pay. Has anyone had any luck fighting for options of surgeons? It seems so unfair to only have one option when my city has some of the best plastics in the world! Any advice??? Log in to post a reply",

I just feel like it is really crazy that I have only one choice of DR! Especially since that one DR has such a bad reputation...I feel scared and frustrated.",
