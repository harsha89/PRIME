The way I feel about it if the cancer comes back I can always have a mastectomy but u can't put your breast back on after it is gone. It si a proven face that lumpectomy and radiation is just as effective as mastectomy so I would do more research yourself and make sure of what u want to do. An educated decison would be your best decision not one that is brought on by fear. I know it is a hard decison to make and you want to make the right one. I was like u at first. I wanted them both removed but I have since changed my mind because a mastectomy does mean it less likely to come back as compared to lumpectomy and rads. Good luck.",

They can't even find bone mets or liver mets she had when she was diagnosised. They are gone thanks to the tamoxfen. Also studies have shown a better outcome with zometa added. She did not have surgery either because the cancer had already spread. The doctor didn't see any reason to put her through surgery. So the doctors are treating you right and they are not giving up on you. I think u will be around for a long time. There are women on these boards with stage 4 that they have had for 20 years. So take care and try not to freak out the tamoxfen will keep the cancer under control. Good luck Icey",

I find out the results thursday of my lumpectomy but the breast surgon told my husband that he was pretty sure the lump was cancer because it was so hard. Why would the steriotactic biopsy turn out b9? Do surgons miss alot of the time or what? I am fearing the worst. The surgon said he had to take more breast tissue than he anticipated maybe to get clear margins I really don't know. Do any of you have and input. This is very new to me.

Patients on zometa do better than patient who do with out it. My friends sister has stage 4 and she is on tamoxifen and zometa and they can't find any mets anywhere now.
