However, a few hours ago I looked online and found the pathology report for the two sentinel nodes removed. I am disappointed to learn that micrometastases are found in one of them. Probably won't be able to talk to my doctor until Friday to learn what this might mean for my treatment. ",

I have a consult with the radiologist scheduled for Dec. 14, and I assume radiation treatment will begin shortly after. My tumor is in the 4:00 - 5:00 position on left breast; I'm not sure what I will need to wear or do in order to look normal in clothes. Luckily, chemo treatment is not recommended for me. Naturally, I am concerned about the years ahead on hormone blocking meds; I'd like to avoid thinning hair and bones (I have osteoporosis), but like everyone else, will somehow deal with whatever I have to. Heartfelt best wishes to all!",
