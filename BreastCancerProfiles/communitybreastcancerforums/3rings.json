Eight days on the river.  I was exhausted when it was over but it was wonderful.  In May I have rented and oceanfront house on the Outer Banks in NC for two weeks, a little more tame.  Going to take my girls and my husband parents the first week, family friends will be coming the second week. But at some point soon i will go on long term disability, i want to spend more time with family and I do run out of energy a lot faster than before.  I'm going to get as much in as I can while I can.",

I think it is because we had gotten such great results the first time, but i guess i'll have to wait and see what he says.   I know that there are only so many 'tricks' in the bag and i hate to move to another one if the one i've had will still work.  Dumb stable boy,",

One of the side effects listed for Faslodex was loss of appetite, i was wanted that one. My onc said that he had 3 other people that he has kept on AI along with the Faslodex and they have all had good results. Sorry if i made anyone repeat their information, i was just tring to get a handle on SE and others experience with this combination.",

You deserve better and they need to know that there worth is greater than the likes of him.  You can't fix him, he is not broke, he's an ass and he is acting just like what he is.   I say all this but i also know that sometime there are financial reasons that don't allow for the split to occur.  Bottom line is you have to do what is right for you.  Just ignore me, it just makes me mad that anyone would treat anyone else this way, especially when they already have so much on there plate.  ",

If i'm out and about people stare like i'm going through some kind of withdrawal or something.  I just smile and say 'hot flash' one lady said back, 'Ive never seen a hot flash like that before you should look into taking estrogen supplements.  LOL  But as you said if this leads to NED I am with the program! ",

I went on Faslodex after my first progression as well.  Because I also have a lot of organ involvement I had Chemo first then went on AI, and was stable with some regression for about a year.  Then had progression so we started Faslodex and from everything I have read it does take some time to start working my doctor also kept me on my AI. Unlike the others I do have some SE, joint pain and fatigue, it may be because I'm taking it with my AI.  But everyone is different I started getting Faslodex the first of July and my doctor said it was to soon to do scans, so I have no idea if it is working.   Best of luck to you, please keep us posted on how you are doing.",

I thought about this for a long time and decided because the tumor in my breast was gone, (The lab report indicated that the cells where the tumor was look like the surounding cells.)  that for now i would pass.  i'm not sure what i would have done if that was not the case. I tend to feel the less cancer in my body the better, and a lumpectomy would be much easier to take than a mastectomy.  Wouldn't it be great if this wasn't so much of a crap shoot!",
