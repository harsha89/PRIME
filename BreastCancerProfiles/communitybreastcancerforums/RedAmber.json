    "Content": "RedAmber wrote: In Nov '10, I had a palpable lump appear on the areola of my left breast (no pain/tenderness). In Jan '11, saw my family doc, had a mammogram & u/s. Report came back as suspicious & I was referred to a breast specialist. In Feb '2011, had a surgical biopsy, in which, the report showed a chronic & histoic inflammation involving breast parachyma. Focal apocrine metaplasia was also noted. Following, in July '11 @ 3-4 months pregnant, the same location on my breast became very sore with a lump appearing virtually overnight. Soreness went away after about a week, but lump remained. Over next several months, antibiotics were taken with no change. Finally, in Nov '11, my breast surgeon attempted to drain it with no success moving on to lance it in office. I finally had relief for awhile until in April '12 when I began to have burning & cold sensations in my nipple off/on, some days more intense than others. However, no lump during this time until Jan '13. Surgical biopsy in April '13 revealed duct ecstasia & peri ductal chronic inflammation. Now, each time, this problem has occurred within the same are behind nipple/areola. A month has passed & I have been having sensational burning & coldness again with a what I truly feel is a lump & not scar tissue as it has grown in 2 weeks time. Any advice on why this could keep happening? Could the biopsy possibly be wrong? I will be 33 next month & my BS has a wonderful reputation, but I can't help but worry & wonder. Everything I read, says surgical removal is the answer to eliminating the problem of duct ecstasia. So, why would I have such sudden return of symptoms. I am seeing my BS soon but any advice in the mean time would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
