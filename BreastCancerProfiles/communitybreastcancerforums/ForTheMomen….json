Kayleigh is feeling much better.  Still a bit of a snotty nose, but her fever is gone and she is in a much better mood.  We are enjoying my parents and being spoiled.  Her Grandpa just took her outside to swing.  They are teaching her to throw the ball for their dog, etc.  So cute!! Love watching her play with them.  Her eyes just light up when either one of them walk into the room.  So neat. I think, while I have been feeling sick, I've also been feeling sorry for myself.  I've been tired, hurt all over, sick, but I think a lot of that has been depression.  I'm trying to get a new attitude and get myself out of bed, get out and enjoy the beautiful fall weather, etc.  I think I get into this downward spin when I don't feel well, and if I let myself, I'll stay there and forget to get out of bed.  That is no way to beat cancer.. So, here I go again.. dust myself, get up and suck it up.  Or, as I used to say when I was training horses..cowgirl up. Thanks again to everyone for responding.  I say it often, but so nice to not feel alone.",

Like the others have said.. you couldn't have known, and I really really doubt he was hiding it because of your own sickness.  While kids have huge hearts, I don't think they can hide physical pain any better than we can.  You took him as soon as you noticed anything.  A lot of people would have waited even longer thinking the fever, etc. would clear up.  You are a wonderful mom!  I think all of us mothers have the same thoughts.  Having Kayleigh, while the best blessing in my life, is also the hardest part of this disease.  I cry more tears over worrying about not being there for her when she is sick, not being able to rock her to sleep... than I do anything else.  She is a mommie's girl when she is sad or not feeling well.  Daddy just won't do.  Only mommies hugs and cuddles are acceptable.  While I know, he will do wonderful with her if I am ever gone, I still so strongly feel that she deserves her mommy... ALL OF OUR CHILDREN deserve their mommies... I don't care if they are 2 or 30.  I'm going home next weekend to spend a couple months at my parents home in Iowa and receive my treatments there.  Only because, at 31... I still want my mommy.  I still feel safe in their house, I still find comfort in my mom tucking me in.  I think of all of these things, and hope so much, that Kayleigh has me for as long as she needs me.  Ok.. now I'm rambling.  What I really wanted to say, is we all sooo understand your feelings.  Also, I truly feel sick when I hear people saying \"cancer was a gift\".. Though I must confess... when I completed treatment when I was Stage 1, and thought it was all behind me, I may have actually uttered those words to people.  Because, like others have said.. cancer did make me appreciate things more, make changes in my life, etc.  Now though... knowing I will never be free of this disease until a miracle, or death... I kick myself for ever saying it.  Almost like the cancer said.. \"oh... you think I'm a gift??? Well here you go.. here's some more gift for ya\".  Eye opener?.. perhaps.. gift?... piss off.  (for lack of better words) Hugs again.. hope your son is feeling much better, and your spirits are back up!

Erin here.  I' ve not been posting as much since we are in Iowa with family, dealing with a litter of 5 week old puppies (fun and crazy at the same time) Also, of course our daughter keeps me very busy.... However, to update everyone... my treatments are going ok.. On only navelbine and Zometa now.  Have my next scans on November 19th.  I've been feeling a lot better, trying to walk 30 minutes a day, my spirits have been lifted (probably partially to effexor, partially due to exercise, etc.) I truly believe this treatment is working, because I'm feeling better than I've felt in a long time.  I do take 800 mg ibuprofen for my bone mets pain which really really works for me.  1 pill every 8 hours, and I wouldn't know I had any pain at all. :) As far as WendyV, I received a PM from her the other day.  Her home modem isn't working, so she has only been checking in from work and doesn't have much time to post.  I can tell you she is feeling great and doing a lot of fun things, living life to the fullest.  Hope to hear from the rest of the MIA's soon! Thanks for posting this Traci... Love and hugs, Erin",

None of us want to be here, but it is such a warm place to fine support.  I have bone and liver mets, found in January 07.  I have had progression a couple times, stable a couple times, etc.  I'm on my second chemo now and hoping for some good results.  My point is, there are sooo many drugs/options out there.  This is no time to give up hope and read stats.  This is the time to put your game face on and fight like crazy.  That being said, every one of us that have been diagnosed go through the scared, crying at the drop of a hat, screaming rage fit times... have those.. then move on.  Have them again and again if you need to.  I guess like the saying goes, just get up, one more time than you fall down. Love and hugs... Erin",
