You've really helped me to understand a little more about the future.  However, I hear many of you saying you are in and out of chemo on a constant basis and that is what is keeping you here.  Does that mean that we, the Fabulous IV's, have to live bald the rest of our lives, or is that just if our journey leads us that way?  I think that is what I am most afraid of because I am only 32 and single.  I'm busy being a single mommy of my 3 darlings, but still divorced and never had that dream wedding that every wishful little girl always wanted, as the first one I was too young to afford it and in a hurry...no, not pregnant....LOL, just young and restless.  Or maybe it's not so much the dream wedding but the guy that is supposed to come with it as the first one turned out to be the perfect opposite of the perfect guy.  Should I just chalk that up to \"too bad, so sad\" just one of them thangs?  Not many men come a'callin' to a bald chicks house unless these fellers wear black lipstick and guyliner and well, gee, that's ok for some, but not for me.  Just sayin'.  Ha ha..  Guess beggers don't really get to do much choosing do they?  Well, I sincerely hope that's not the case but if it is I suppose I will cross that river when I get there.  And yes, I said RIVER.  I think for the others, they can cross their bridges easy enough, but cancer patients...we usually have a little more thinking to do when we get to our crossings...too cold?  too hot?  rocky? current?  which way will benefit me most???? LOL!  or do we just head straight through and say whatever happens...happens! Love to you all for your strength and never ending courage and thanks for the advice! God Bless and many hugs! Connie",

So far I've had several complications just by having mets to my lymphnodes (neck, abdomen and chest).  Almost died due to the cancer pushing on one of my bile ducts in my liver which made it collapse, causing me to vomit constantly and lack of appetite - couldn't eat.  Ended up losing 20 lbs in 1 month.  Doc finally figured out the bile duct was blocked and they put a stent in to open it.  Stent ended up causing problems in my liver again, later which caused a hematoma the size of my liver to bleed out.  I was bleeding to death and only knew the pain was so severe I couldn't stand it and don't remember most of it due to shock, I think!  Was in ICU for 2 weeks and had to have blood transfusions often.  It was the closest I'd ever come to death and that scared me.  Have any of you had any complications with where your mets are located?  I once read about a woman who had bone mets to her spine and 2 of her vertebrae collapsed and she lost inches to her height!  Ugh!  I couldn't imagine!  I'm just trying to reach out and get a little peace of mind by talking to some of you inspiring ladies!
