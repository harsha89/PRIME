My mom stayed wih me when I went through chemo, her love made everything seem less scary. You're a good daughter :)  You're mom is just being proud, it's probably not easy for her to have you see her as anything but strong and independent. It's all about quality time. I got to know my mom, I asked her a lot of questions I never asked, simple ones, favorite movies, favorite memories, lots and lots of quality time, that is what it's about. Hang in there, I know other people will post, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents for what it's worth. ",
