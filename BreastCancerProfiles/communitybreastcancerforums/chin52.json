I will comment that I am surprised by the professionalism of the Dr. I, too, had a ultrasound a few months ago,  but the Dr. stated that the margins appeared irregular and did not provide any presumtive information one way or the other. The result from the biopsy that followed showed both invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ, grade 3, and also triple negative breast cancer. I have already had the breast conserving surgery and will soon begin chemo, followed by radiation.  The reason for the detail is that I had a very similar situation in 2006, same breast, but with negative biopsy results. I, too, was worried while waiting for the results, but it did me no good to worry about something I had no control of.  It is good that you are having the biopsy, I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.  Please keep updated on your results.   All the best ~Chin",
