I don't know if it's a tumor, cyst or lump. After 2months it grew too fast from 2cm into 6cm. It even grew into 9cm in my 2nd biopsy. I wasn't surprised cause I have a2 year-old daughter. I used to carry her. The doctor told me to undergo an ultrasound and it shows birads 5. I was scared. So, I did my 1st core needle biopsy on July 25, 2018 and it's result was BENIGN FIBROFATTY TISSUE WITH ACUTE NON-SPECIFIC INFLAMMATION: SMALL FRAGMENT SUGGESTIVE OF NODULAR ADENOSIS. But, the doctor wasn't convince at all. So, I did again my 2nd core needle biopsy on August 8, 2018 and it's result was BENIGN BREAST TISSUE. In it's Microscopic Description shows strips of fibrofatty tissues mildly infiltrated with mononuclear cells. I was happy with the result. But, the doctor told me to undergo an Ultrasound Guided Biopsy. I said NO cause it's not that easy to be biopsied again for the 3rd time. So, I asked for another option and he said just a plain breast ultrasound. Later on, we'll proceed to an Excision Biopsy which is to totally remove the lump/tumor/cyst. I really don't know the term yet. All I believe that it's Benign and it's not cancerous. The doctor told me about the risks. God already answered my prayers on my two previous biopsies and He even gave me a sign in one of my dreams while sleeping. So, I must be strong with my faith to God. Thank you for reading my story and I hope I can read same stories of mine. I have this question on my mind, I already did 2 core needle biopsy. Is it more accurate than a breast ultrasound and is it enough to prove that my situation is really benign? I hope I can get answers too. Have a nice day!",
