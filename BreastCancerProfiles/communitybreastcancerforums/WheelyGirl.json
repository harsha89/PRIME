I wondered if it was because that tumor saoked up all of those hormones so the hormone levels in my body were not low. Weird",

I did not sleep at all last night I think due to the steroids so this is the first day of work I have missed other than the lumpectomy and port placement days.  I did manage a catnap this morning so am getting ready to do a little work from home.  Some side effects are kicking in today, day 2 post chemo mostly stomach discomfort.  I have been drinking about 4 -5 32 oz cups of Gatorade/Water everyday to stay hydrated and that seems to be working well for me.  Went out a little with my wonderful husband after work yesterday just to get him out of the house (he's retired) did a little shopping and stopped at our favorite American Legion Post so he could have a beer (I had my first diet soda in three days - it was wonderful).  I am a little scared about getting out in public due to the potential for neutropenia but don't want to stick him in the house all of the time either.  I did not have the Neulasta shot yet I guess my blood levels didn't warrant it Wednesday, go to my Oconolgist the 10th for blood work hoping to not need one then either, it seems to cause some great discomfort, plan to take the Claritin before and after just in case. Good luck to you all and hope today is a good day!",

I requested that test before I would agree to 4 cycles of Taxotere/Cytoxin plus 12 months of Herceptin.  The results of the oncotype test took 2 weeks but revealed that my tumor was HER2- but had a high intermediate score of reoccurrence so I agreed to the 4 cycles of Taxotere/Cytoxin.  I am very glad I had my pathology report, results of the pet scan and breast mri along with the oncotype dx test results to assist me in making my decision to have chemo, I feel very confident that it was the right decision.  Before the Oncotype DX test results came back I was leaning toward no chemo.  The test was $4,000 but my insurance company paid most and the only company that does the Oncotype DX test will wave the remaining balance based on income.  It is worth asking your oncologist about if you are having a difficult time making some or all of these decisions.",

I had my initial appointment with my RO today.  Got the CT scan and all marked up to start radiation on March 5th.  Will have 30 total treatments 25 regular with 5 boosts at the end.  I will be in the prone position so my back is all marked up instead of my breast area.  My husband was given strict orders to make sure the marking or the plastic tabs did not come off and if they started to get light or loose to remark so we don't have to do that part over.  I really liked the team that will be doing my treatments they were very nice and explained everything before they did it especially before they touched me since I was laying on my stomach so could not see what was going on.  They answered a lot of questions for me and I will be able to wear my hat as well as a gown.  They will keep me covered except when they can't and only the necessary areas will be uncovered and only when necessary.  I was so nervous about this appointment but actually feel much better after it.  My RO said aquaphor is his lotion of choice but if there is another I prefer that is fine just check with him prior to using.  He also said it would be fine to use my Emli cream if it becomes necessary.  He said I probably would not see any burning until 2 weeks in or so.  Congratulations to all who are finishing and hoping for little to no side effects for those still trucking along.  This site has been a wealth of very good information I am very glad I found it.  ",

For all of those worrying about starting the Tamoxifen, I have a follow up with my MO on Monday and I know he will be wanting to discuss this issue at that time.  I am really unsure about this drug too!  I did read a post on one of these sites from a women who was afraid of the horror stories so she decided to introduce it to her body slowly.  She asked for the script to be for 10 mg tablets and she broke those in half and started at 5 mg for the first week, then increased to 10mg the second week and so on until she got to the 20 mg.  She said she took 10mg in am and 10mg in pm at first and she has had no major side effects so far.  This sounds like a logical approach so I am going try the same approach when the time comes to start the drug.  I may be delayed due to my heart surgery, I think I will find out more about that Monday.  Will let you all know how it works for me.",

I decided to bite the bullet and do the Jenny Craig diet and have lost 27 pounds and 20 1/2 inches since April 28th.

I waited several years this time so my back is really out of line but it is definitely better than when I started. My next appointment is tomorrow so I am just going to talk to my chiropractor and see what she thinks. I hate to quit going since it is making it feel better.",

I got the job!  Yeah, I think...It will be a challenge to straighten it up but I am up for it.  More excited about work than I have been in a long time.  Thank you for the positive energy, it was a very crowded interview room barely had room for the interview committee with all of you in there cheering me on.  I am a horrible interview but apparently did not do to bad today.
