    "Content": "Bananchik wrote: Hi ladies, Had to do a routin checkup 1.5 years after diagnosis which included mamo, ultrasound and MRI. The mamo and ultrasound came clear and the MRI returned with some suspicious masses. Now, because of some secretary problem at the clinic they didn't get my mamo and ultrasound results and placed me in the BIRADS 0 cathegory (unspecified), and now I'm waiting for news which should be next week at best. I'm pulling my hairs off waiting here with those suspicious masses, terrified I might have a relapse, did any of you used one of those online services for reading scan tests? They all seem so shady... Or maybe I was looking in the wrong places. Could you suggest one? Also if those masses were complitely benign (BIRADS 2), would the docotor set a BIRADS 0 anyway, because of the lack of previous tests? Thank you so much Log in to post a reply",
