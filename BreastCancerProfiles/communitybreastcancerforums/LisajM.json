Had clinical trial for 16 weeks THLapatinib, lumpectomy following, then 8 weeks of AC.  I am having Rad simulation tomorrow and starting rad on Monday.  I am moving forward so fast because it has just seemed like it has taken forever and am anxious to get it all over with.  I also have a vaca scheduled for end of August I would like to make. The RadOnc seemed to feel this was acceptable but my Oncologist was somewhat concerned that I am starting so soon after AC.  Anyone else going into radiation or have started radiation this quick?  It also makes me nervoucs reading about all these breakdowns on Rad machines, I am cutting it to the wire for vacation.  Hoping for the best",
