Last year, at recheck, I learned I had not been genetically tested (for some reason I thought I had been and was negative) had to wait 8 months for an appointment (they were awesome though!) A month later my results were positive for Brca2 and Chek2, both risk factors. A friend of mine has had bc twice, under age 40, and she also has chek2. Since I have a huge history in family as well, they offered me this panel of like 26 screenings or so, not just brca. Strangely, the tech at the breast care center doing mammogram had never heard of she said. I am getting a mastectomy as well, though pretty nervous. Meeting w my second surgeon today, had to wait months for appointment w first doctors.",

I wish I had gone that route the first time as the radiation has caused issues in reconstruction....despite that, I downsized from dd's (my choice) and am so glad I did! Good luck!",
