      "Content": "tdisibio wrote: Hi everyone, My grandmother (really a mother who raised me) was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Unfortunately when she went to the doctor and received her diagnosis she was alone and didn't ask any questions. I live in Dallas which is about 3 hours from where she lives. To her the only options that were presented at the time of diagnosis were lumpectomy and mastectomy and she has chosen to do the mastectomy. We have never dealt with breast cancer in our family and I am kind of clueless as to options for her. She is 76-years-old and isn't in the best of health. She is cognitively fine but her motor skills are on the decline and she currently lives with COPD which almost killed her at the beginning of March when she was found unconscious due to respiratory distress. I am concerned about her going into surgery and the stress the recovery will put on her. Granted I know nothing about the mastectomy procedure and how invasive it is or how hard on the body it is. Next week she will come to Dallas to meet with her surgeon and I am hoping we get more information. I don't know the stage or size of tumor? I am wanting to learn as much as I possibly can about treatment options and questions to ask with the doctor before we just jump into surgery.  Any help out there would be greatly appreciated and any resources give I would love as well. Thank you so much Log in to post a reply",

Wednesday we go to the surgeon for a consultation where I will make sure we get ll of the information before moving forward with any decisions. So I guess my next question is what are the things I need to know. I actually have lupus so I know how important it is to be your own advocate in the health system. So I guess it's important to know the stage, tumor size, and what else should I mKe sure I know? Thank you for all of the help! I feel so ignorant to this process.",

On a positive note my grandmother is feeling well and is in positive spirits. She has been through a lot this past month. I hope we can some positive news. I am thinking it will all be ok. She is such a special lady and 33 years ago she gave up her life to raise me and I was difficult at times so now it is my turn to take care of her and make sure she gets the best possible treatment. She is a wonderful, strong, stubborn and amazing woman who I know will come out on top of this.  Thanks again to everyone for the support and help",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2014 07:08PM tdisibio wrote: Well we had our appointment and our next step is evaluation with cardiology and pulmonary doc to determine if she can even receive general anesthesia to have surgery. Doc wants to determine that and then we will re-discuss options in a week or so. She was not impressed with her medical history. My grandmother has COPD and her lungs are pretty diminished. It sounds like she is hoping we can go in and remove breast but she is doubtful about getting lymphnodes to test. And if we can't do anesthesia we will just have to do local anesthesia and just get the tumor. And then do the hormone therapy. I think my grandmother has come to the conclusion already, though she hasn't admitted this to me yet, that she would rather just risk the surgery and if she doesn't make it then she will pass in her sleep and be unaware anyway. I want my grandmother to have whatever she wants. I really don't think she would make it through surgery. She just coded at the beginning of March and is still very weak. But I guess we will know more in a few weeks. THank you again to everyone. Tamara",
