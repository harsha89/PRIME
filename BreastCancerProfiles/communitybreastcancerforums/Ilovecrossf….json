I only had 3 sentinel nodes removed but was one of the lucky 6% to develop lymphedema which was pretty quick after surgery. My surgeon has encouraged me to get back to doing what I did before BC with caution. My first lift was my 20Ib grandson and all went well! Still undergoing radiation which can increase the lymphedema which I have managed to keep it under control. I started back on a underwater treadmill and doing pool exercises trying to strengthen my arm. I have just in the past 3 weeks started back to CrossFit (Surgery was end of Nov) which I believe exercise is the best thing we can do! I am taking it slow which after gaining 40Ibs due to hormone suppressant and lack of being able to kill it in the box and at 55 years old my metabolism has slowed immensely. I am seeing a surgeon in Pittsburgh, Pa to get a consult for a surgical procedure for lymphedema patients who have a score of 0-1 which is me! So I am hoping that I am a candidate to remap the lymph flow! I refuse to let BC/lymphedema to define me. I will be doing the Open in 2017! Prayers to all my CF community who is struggling with any type of cancer!",
