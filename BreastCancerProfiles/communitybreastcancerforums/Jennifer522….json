I find them harder on me. I get woozy or feel weird with them. The feeling does not last long. I have a port though, so it may be different if you do not. I am surprised too that the bag storage has not made the news. Or other companies have not stepped up their production enough to cover the storage. With the flu epidemic, I am sure the shortage is getting worse.",

My eyelashes are pretty much gone on the bottom, 3 or so hairs left. But I can see short little ones growing. My eyebrows are thinned in the inner section and only a few hairs hanging on in the outer section. Today I noticed growing hairs in the inner section, looks like hairs a few days after shaving. I am guessing all these \"re-growth\" hairs will fall out again before I truely start to grow some head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows back post chemo",
