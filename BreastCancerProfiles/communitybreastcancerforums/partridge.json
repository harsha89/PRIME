Small 7mm pleural based nodule abutting left lateral pleura. 2. patchy/nodular opacity in right middle lobe approx 8 mm x 5 mm. 3.  These nodular densities are nonspecific in etiology possibly relating to noncalcified granuloma.  Neoplasm is not excluded and clinicial correlation and continued followup imaging at 3- and 6- month intervals is recommended. I had IDC, tubular cancer, stage 1, 0/5 nodes.  No chemo; had radiation therapy and tamoxifen and arimidex x 5 yrs.  I will see pulmonologist in 5 weeks and I'm pretty sure he will suggest I wait 3 mo and redo cat scan.  I think I can handle the wait but DH is panicked.  Should I be?

The abdominal scan was negative for bladder problems, fortunately.  Not so the chest scan..... Please post here when you learn what is recommended for your followup - I hope whatever they find is not bad.",

I can't stand the smell of Goo Gone.  Will plain old rubbing alcohol work?  I don't have it in the house, so haven't tried it.  Any suggestions?
