I have been having some persistent, intense mid-pack pains the past many weeks - mostly in the middle of the night that persist til morning, then ease up during the day. I don't have any numbness but have had some other weird sensations. I'm not an alarmist but last time I had low back pain it was a large cyst on my ovary that resulted in a hysterectomy last year so I try to listen to my body. My onc just returned back to town, and I am slated for a bone scan in the morning. Thanks for any insight!Â ",
