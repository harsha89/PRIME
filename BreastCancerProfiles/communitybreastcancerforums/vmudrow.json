So I went for genetic counseling - my mom was tested for BRCA (negative), but they took all my history (previous biopsies etc) and figured my risk to 40% chance of getting breast cancer at some point.  Well, after talking to surgeon (said I would have to have MRIs every year, which show more, which mean more biopsies) and the side effects of Tamoxifen we decided to have nipple/skin sparing masectomies.  I was so done with the tests, worrying everytime.  Happy to say the surgery went well - I didn't have much in the way of breast to loose - I know have silicone implants - and no Tamoxifen, no biopsies, etc.  So happy it is all over.  Wish the best of luck to all you ladies!!

Hugs,  Valerie",
