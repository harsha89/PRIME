I had seen an ortho doc for a sore foot that I'd had since December.  He took x-rays which were normal and put me in a cast boot for 4 weeks saying I had some tendonitiis.  The ankle just got worse and after 3 weeks in the boot I could not longer bear weight on it without excruciated pain.  Finally the doc ordered an MRI and blood work and discovered a big tumor at the base of the tibia.  He was shocked as his words to me in the beginning were, \"Don't worry, it's not the cancer.  It NEVER spreads below the knee or elbow.\"   My onc said the same thing when I told him my foot hurt and his reaction to the news on Tuesday was equally as shocked. He said this is an extremely rare thing and most docs go their whole careers and never see bc go below the knee.  I never saw doctors and staff move so fast to get things done and get treatment started.  I'll be getting 10 rads on the ankle and then start a new chemo which is yet to be determined after a PET-CT on Monday.  To complicate things more, I also found a lump in my good breast that wasn't there a week ago.  And my spleen has become enlarged and painful like there's no room for it under my ribs.  I'll be relieved to see the results of the scan.  Needless to say, Xeloda didn't work for me.   Please listen to your bodies and remember anything is possible.  I don't mean live in fear, just pay attention and get things checked out.  This disease is full of surprises.   Love and prayers, Lila Dx 2/14/2007, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/6 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
