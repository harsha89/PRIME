Just had MRI guided biopsy on 1/20/2017 so waiting on those results. Per the advice of my sister (a nurse) I took photos of the discharge coming out of my nipple and what stained the inside of my bra. Sometimes i found that it was like bringing a car to the mechanic ... the problem never occurred in the doctor's office. So I took photos on my phone so my PCP and breast surgeon could see. Hugs and prayers to you that all goes well.",
