Some days I feel great (not all day, but part of the day) and other days I feel crappy all day long. One thing that has recently come up is PAIN in my arms. I didn't have it until about 2 weeks ago - and now I can't stand it. I wake up in the morning in tears, because it hurts so bad. It feels like I played football all night. Any suggestions? Does anyone else have this?? Help. I can't stand the pain.",

I had a bmx with immediate DIEP reconstruction. I spent 7 days in the hospital (first 2 in ICU) - and I am home recovering. I had no idea it would be this painful...and the drains are a pain!!! Although on a good note, I just got the 3rd one out today with only one left (I'm hoping will be out Monday!) I appreciate everyone's lists of things to have at the hospital, etc... I used those lists and you were all right! Happy Recovery to all...",

I am not worried about the surgery, I am worried about the recovery. Can anyone give me advice on children? My 10 year old son knows I have BC and knows I will be having surgery. He is going to be at the hospital with my husband (I'm having it done out of town - 4 hours away). I'm just worried how he will take it when he sees me in the hospital. Thanks for this forum. It really helps to know I am not alone in this battle!!",
