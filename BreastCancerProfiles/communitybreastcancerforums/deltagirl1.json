I have asked my doctor about it and she said that it probably would not show anything with my type of cancer and that my insurance probably would not pay for it. So my question is, what is the real difference in the PET/CT and the CT that I get? And do I need to insist that I have one? BTW--  (I've talked to you before on Inspire-I'm new to this board.)---- I will be coming to orientation with my daughter in June and I would love to get up with you then if you will be in town. I believe that it is the first session. Send me a private message if you will be there. Jenni",

My doctor didn't worry too much as long as everything else looked good. The I had progression and my markers went way up. When I started my new treatment(Aromasin) they went down pretty dramatically. Now they have flat lined. My local onc uses one test and my onc at MDA uses another. They seem to follow the same trend. (I have them both in a graph so that I can watch trends) I believe that the trends are what is important to look at in tumor markers because what is high to me, might not be high at all to another person. _____Also, my onc once told me that healing can cause that markers to go up. (----I will explain this as I understand it---) As tumor cells die off they are released back into the blood and the markers can't distinguish dead cells from live cells so the dieing off of cell can cause markers to increase too.",
