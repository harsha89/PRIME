She had a lumpectomy, followed by radiation in 2001.  Nothing unusual for 5 yrs.  Six months ago the same breast became red, swollen and painful.  She told no one!  A week ago her old incision opened up and she woke in a pool of blood from the breast.  At that point, she told my mother-in-law and they saw the dr.  He did biopsies of the interior of the breast (through the draining opening) and the skin of the breast and put her on antibiotics.  She also has been feeling very tired and has bone pain in her hip.  Today they saw the dr again and were told that the biopsies came back negative.  He wants to biopsy the other breast. That is all I know at this time.  My mother-in-law has read that IBC is often mis-diagnosed initially and she feels like she is \"in limbo\"- not really trusting the negative biopsy results. Based on the knowledge and experiences of the persons who frequent this forum, what can advice can I give her?  Thank you in advance for any suggestions.  Log in to post a reply",

Having had several bouts of mastitis while breastfeeding my four babies, I can understand how the confusion over your diagnosis happened.  Thankfully you are the type to self educate and you were determined to get an accurate diagnois.  May that same determination carry you through your treatment and safely back to good health!  So many of my close friends and family (even my beloved cat!) have recently been diagnosed w/ cancer!   I can't shake the feeling of \"I wonder who this monster will attack next?\"  In an effort to help these loved ones, I've done extensive research and  I've learned so much about natural supplements to help fight the cancer (along w/ conventional treatment) and to lessen side effects of radiation and chemo.  My cat was originally given 4-6 months and he is still he acting like a kitten 2 yrs later!  I would encourage you to research complimentary treatments, if you've not already done so. Best wishes to you! ",
