    "Content": "TennesseeGal wrote: Can anyone tell me how long this curly hair will last? After taking Anastrozole for 3 months, I had to stop - my son died suddenly and I could not handle the side effects of the med, plus the emotions of losing my only child. My hair did not fall out, as I did not have Chemo, only lumpectomy and the med, but my hair curled a couple of months after stopping the med. It changed texture and curled. I am wondering how long that will last?? Log in to post a reply",
