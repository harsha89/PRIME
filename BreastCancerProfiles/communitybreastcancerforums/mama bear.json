I am on 4 rounds of DD A/C and am going in to do number three on Thursday. My question is this.... I have had a sore throat since I started, the dr said it was not infected, or any thing to worry about. But seriously it hurts. Has any one had this and did you find any relief. Is this just a SE to deal with for four more weeks....?",

Silly me kept trying it thinking it would get better... it did not. Then it gave me the big D... so I ended up on diflucan for 6 days. I will try the baking soda salt water rinse and see if that helps. Thank you for replying!!!! ",
