They asked me if I had surgeon and I said yes because when my ob scheduled mamm/ultrasound she scheduled surgeon as well even though she felt it was benign. So glad she did because it was only four days between test and biopsy. Because I live in a relatively small town with just a handful of breast surgeons i didn't have to worry about sending records. The imaging center works with these surgeons daily. My BS was able to pull up the results from mammo at his office. I think I do remember telling the mammo nurse who my surgeon was. I think though they work thru a network that they can pull patients test results on a database. You just need to call your BS office and ask them if you need a hard copy tomorrow. Most likely they will be digital. They may tell you bi rad or they may not. They didn't tell me. I saw the score written on a piece of paper on the nurse desk. She told me they just gave her a number and she pointed to it because I asked her what the lesion looked like. She said they didn't tell her just told her a number. I didn't know it was bi rad until night before appointment with BS. But you do have the right to ask for it. I got a high bi rad score. But it turned out benign. So don't freak out if you do get a bi rad score that is higher.",

The mammo nurse did not tell me this: my surgeon did when I had biopsy done. But again I went in there and they knew I had lump. So when they didn't find it, they did ultrasound. Mine is very close to skin. I had no idea that mammogram couldn't find everything and mine was diagnostic. Actually they found two on ultrasound. Neither one was found on mammogram. It makes me want a breast MRI on both breast. Of course still don't know what they are yet so I may get my wish if the results aren't good. Your right, we are clueless.

Then radio felt it was worthy of four of five. What my surgeon was trying to say is that bi rads are not to be taken literal by the patient and then look it up and freak out. He said every radio has the right to score based on what he sees. For example one radio might give a four to something that another radio gives a 2. He said that number is just meant for him to make a decision on biopsy. Now a five is more significant. But, it doesn't mean 100 percent cancer: my mother in law is an ob nurse and has lots of lumps. She has mammo and ultrasound every year and has had several biopsied. Not one time has she been told her score. I asked her why. She said she doesn't want to know. If the radio wants it biopsied then she does it. She said even with her knowledge of bi rads she doesn't go there because she sees so many bi rads and path reports that freak people out for no reason. I read that fat necrosis mimics BC in presentation. That is why they are sometimes given five. But like my doc said yesterday.... As a patient don't concentrate on bi rad but on biopsy.",

That was the number two question I got from the original ob doc to the breast surgeon. I was asked of BC was in my family and if I nursed my kids and for how long. There is a website you can go to, maybe someone can name it for you, that will tell you your risk of getting BC. Mine was really low. But as we age it gets higher. All women 18 and up need to have a proactive approach to their breast. Self checks are very important. The hard part about this is young women get benign masses and get freaked out. That's why some are saying that self checks create uncessary biopsies. I don't agree but it's being put out there. A friend was just diagnosed at 28. But found early and curable at this point. So happy she found it and got it taken care of. Yours gettin smaller is a good sign!",

She said it was round and mobile. All good signs. She said standard procedure required a mammogram, ultrasound, and surgeon appointment. So last Friday I had Mammogram. They then gave me an ultrasound. I saw the mammo nurse and she said \"not characteristic of breast cancer but abnormal tissue\". I never worried until I heard that. Then she mentioned something about a four. I had no idea what that meant until last night. It was my bi rad score! I looked it up, and scared myself to death. So I went to my surgeon today which they scheduled when they scheduled tesr. By the way for anyone reading, schedule a surgeon appointment when you find lump, even before mammo is done because it cuts the waiting! Anyway, doctor came in with sonogram machine and core needle machine. I had never even met him. He told me they found two spots on the ultrasound. So he was going to look for himself. He found the \"big\" one... 1/2 centimeter... The other one smaller then that. That smaller one he had to chase around. Ha! As soon as he put the needle in the big one he said it immediately got smaller. He said that is good sign. With it the holidays my results will not be back until next week. Ugh! Nervous. All the signs of this seems to be good as far as mobile, new, round are supposed to be good signs. But I'm worried why they wanted to do core biopsy. He said they just couldn't tell on ultrasound what it was. Is that normal? One funny thing... When I got home I looked at the pen marks he made on my breast and noticed that wasn't the incision! I started panicking telling my husband they did the wrong thing! They didn't get the biopsy! The incision was on side of breast! My mother in law who is an ob/gyn nurse explained that they go through the side to get the biopsy! Lol! Scared me! Log in to post a reply",

It hurt like the dickens. She put off going to doc for a couple of weeks because of the pain. Thought it was infection. With that said they say that most tutors don't hurt. It's probably just where they are located and the type. Cyst ARE painful! But my question is if they cannot find it, what are they biposying? Mine benign lump was invisible on mammo but not on ultrasound. Plain as day on there but the other one was wiggly and kept moving on him.",

Ok, I hope this makes you laugh as it did me, if you go to my profile and look at the first post I ever made you will see what I'm about to tell you! I had the same reaction! My incision was not at the site of the lump and I had marker at th spots they did it. Well I thought oh no!!! They did the wrong one! I called my ob nurse mother in law and she said \" no sweetie, that's where the needle went in! Also I had two lesions but he told me. I thought there was just one until he told me two was found. There was also a third mark. The third mark was somewhat of a ending point where the probe ended. Ultrasound biopsy are the best because he or she will look at it and know they got it! They compare what the radiologist pinpointed it and then look for it and find it. Meaning they match up the coordinates so to speak. I know this because this one I had kept moving on him. It wasn't matching the coordinates. He had to search for. I did bruise..:.. Big time! When I went in this past Tuesday , he was like \"I bruised you\". He seemed to have felt bad. I told him I bruise easy. Sweet man. My breast still tinges. It will be two weeks this Tuesday.",

Have a friend at 28 dealing with it now but she has family history. Cyst can form and grow rapidly as well as fibrnomas.",
