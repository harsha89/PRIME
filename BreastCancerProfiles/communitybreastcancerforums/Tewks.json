My heart, neuropathy in both hands and feet, severe fatigue being the main concerns. Oh yea, my skin peeling off my hands and feet pretty badly too. ? So now, with the last taxol on November 3, I still have only about 1/16\" of hair visible in my head, sparse eyebrows and even sparser eyelashes. It's been almost 3 months and to me that seems an awfully long time for my hair to grow back. I know, everybody's different, but isn't this a little exaggerated ? I fully expected to give up the scarves by now if not the hot and dreaded wigs, but I still have a shiny bald head. I start targeted Proton radiation next week and do hope it doesnt set this back further. I'm so impatient to look somewhat normal, even if I'm not.

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2018 04:23PM Tewks wrote: I was diagnosed in October of 2016 and took Femara until surgery in June of 2017. I had a single mastectomy and flap reconstruction. At that time my oncologist and surgeon said all cancer had been surgically removed. Trace cells were found in 2 of my six lymph nodes so I followed my oncologist's recommendation, to be on the safe side, and started DD A/C chemo on September 8. I had three biweekly infusions and severe reactions to each, at which time she stopped the chemo. I took a four week break and had one Taxol treatment on November 3, to which I also had a bad reaction. At that point she cancelled further chemo, told me to take a break again and start radiation after Mid January. With no existing tumors anywhere this seems to be a very reasonable treatment path to all doctors I've seen. Exactly why does this make you concerned? I'm at what's considered to be the top east coast cancer center and wouldn't have a clue who'd be any better to see for a second opinion. What exactly is a NCI Designated hospital? I've never heard of that. That I've had every side effect known to oncologists is unusual, yes, but my Dr has also told me that as unusual as I am, I'm still not bad enough to make it into any of her medical journal articles. Other than discolored nails, fatigue and very little hair I do feel quite healthy. I guess if there's bad news I'll find out with the bone scans after radiation. After radiation I'll resume the Femara, probably forever. ",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2018 03:34PM Tewks wrote: I'll try to answer all of you at once. After having a nightmare experience with chemo (and cancelling it), I was very skeptical about radiation. After surgery and reconstruction last June I was told I was cancer free but both chemo and radiation were highly recommended as preventive measures, so I followed the advice and took the plunge...against my better \"gut feeling\" judgement. Chemo did not go well at all, we took a break mid-A/C then cancelled completely after one Taxol. So going into 6 weeks of radiation was not real high on my list of winter activities, especially consodering the possible heart/lung damage down the road. It was only by chance that I learned about Proton therapy from, of all places, a television commercial. And yes, it is very zone-specific and that alleviates my fears about the side effects. I have 27 total treatments, each lasts about 40-45 minutes. I've had only four so far and the radiation itself is painless but what's almost intolerable is lying in one position totally immobilized for such a long time. I'm doubling my Xanax and gabapentin and have added naproxen in hopes that either my shoulder joint is less inflamed or that I'm so zonked out I don't know the difference. No one has said the time might get shorter, maybe I'll get lucky and that'll happen. I am lying in a mold made for my body and haven't yet been told to hold my breath...except perhaps to alleviate my anxiety ðŸ˜‰. My husband keeps telling me I have his permission to quit, no questions asked, should I ever feel the need to bail out. So for me it's one day/one treatment at a time, no longterm commitment and that makes it easier. I'm just curious to hear from anyone else who's done this for breast cancer. I shudder to think what this must be like for the prostate cancer patients, it must be so much more uncomfortable and that's one of the many thoughts that keeps me going. That and the little kids...cannot imagine. So, I doubt this has helped anyone else but thanks for the time and space to whine. This whole ordeal really sucks... ",

I'm now done with 12 put of 27 treatments, most taking up to 40 minutes on the table but I think that's just waiting for an available beam. My skin is turning pink, I have a slight rash and it's starting to itch a little. My RO advised more aquaphor and a prescription cortisone cream if I need it. The techs are super nice about the time, almost apologetic that we don't get in and out instantly. I'm thinking I'm very lucky to live where I do and have access to such great medical facilities Shoulder update: it's not my shoulder joint at all, it's the muscle that cramps. It's happened three times and I'm controlling that with naproxen, Motrin, and Xanax. And I must tell you all that I realized two days ago that im actually meditating my way through the treatments, much like the self-hypnosis of Lamaze. The techs are playing some great stuff on Pandora and I'm really surprised at how easily I can zone out what's happening with treatment and concentrate only on the music, just by training my mind. 40 minutes has never flown by so fast... All I can say is that I hope this all works...I have zero patience for cancer, I don't have time for it, either in my day or my week or my life and there's zero room in my body for it anywhere. So it had better take a hike,and fast, cuz I'm done with it! Please everyone keep in touch, good luck, we can do this!",

It's not the most comfortable hour of my day, that's for sure, but I had one treatment that caused so much shoulder pain that I was crying by the time I was finished. Is traditional radiation similar in that you're basically motionless for 40-60 minutes? I know Proton is supposedly safer and more accurate, especially for those of us with left breast issues, but is this daily physical discomfort really worth it?? Anxious to hear what anyone else has experienced. Thanks",

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2018 08:22AM - edited Mar 5, 2018 08:32AM by Tewks Ariel, I'm in NJ and halfway through proton radiation. I stumbled onto it when I saw the TV ad and got a ringing endorsement from my team at Fox Chase. Ask your doctors for their opinion, they can best guide you. But it seems to me that it's a less invasive and less damaging form of treatment. My tumor was on my left side so my heart and left lung are a concern. I don't know much about traditional radiation so can't compare the treatment processes to each other. I can only say I trust ProCure and feel totally safe there. It's not easy to stay totally still for 45 minutes but I'm learning to meditate during the treatment, and the time flies by. The nurses, technicians and my RO are super nice, warm people with great patience and all have a terrific bedside manner. I had a tougher time starting out but have learned how to cope better mentally. The more I read and hear about proton the happier I am with my choice. In one of my earlier posts I talked about a shoulder issue and it\u2019s turned out that was a cramped muscle. I upped my magnesium supplement and haven\u2019t had a problem with it since. My only problem now is my skin reaction...my new boob looks like it's sunburned and there's an itchy rash. But I have a prescription cream and lots of sympathy, plus they've all assured me it will heal nicely and disappear once treatment is complete. This is turning out to be much easier than I first thought it would be.Good luck with your decision and if there's anything else I can tell you please ask!! ",
