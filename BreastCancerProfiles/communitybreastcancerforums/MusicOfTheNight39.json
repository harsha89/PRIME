I have lost about 15 pounds here recently and have also noticed veins but that has been in both breasts. I can't really feel any lumps besides the normal lumps that I have always had from fibrocystic breasts. I have also had a red rash underneath both breasts, don't know if it is due to dry skin or maybe I need a better fitting bra. I am really starting to worry, is this normal? Please help.
