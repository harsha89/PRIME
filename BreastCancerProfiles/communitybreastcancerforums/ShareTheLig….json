I did get to speak to my surgeon today but as it so happens, I don't feel the weakness in my leg at all today so maybe it was just a weird happenstance. She did say that wasn't normal and that if worsens to call but like I said, I'm fine today. The good news is, lymph nodes came back clear! Bad news is the margins did not so I'll go back in next week. I think I'll start a new thread simply because she said thought it started as IDC, it's now ILC. She explained it all but I didn't process any of it so I'm meeting with her next Tuesday, day before surgery to go over details again as I'm confused by that. Thx for the support! :)",

I had my lumpectomy and SNB on 1/11 and my nodes were clear too although my margins were not so looks like I'll be going back for surgery either this Wed or next. :( In regards to the numb breast, that's what I had too. Looks like I'm just about a week ahead of you in recovery time and now I mainly just feel the numbness near the axilla incision though it seems to be getting better. I know each person heals differently but as for me, it seems like the first 3-4 days post-op were the easiest. Now it seems like the nerves are coming alive so even my vibrations from walking cause weird sensations in my breast with some mild pain. My steri-strips on the axilla just came off today. I feel less pain in my breast when it's compressed so definitely be a good girl in regards to that. Here's hoping the rest of your recovery goes smoothly and that you continue having an optomistic attitude through treatment.",
