I waited until all my testing & surgical consult & plans were made before I told them. Your kids are not young & the \"C\" word does not sit well w/ them because evryone thinks its a \"death sentence\". Once I had definitive info to give them they bonded together & researched stuff together, talked together to get through it. Then they asked me a lot of questions on how I was feeling physically & emotionally. Wait before you tell your kids but talk to other people as you wait for results : your husband, sibling, best friend. It's an emotional time for everyone. Hang in there & LOL.",
