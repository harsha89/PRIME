Exactly one year ago last Monday I had a single, right-sided mastectomy. Like you, I agonized over getting the double done right then & there, but finally succumbed to the weight of the decision and opted to do only what I had to do at the time. It turned out to be the right decision for me for several reasons: 1) I was simply too overwhelmed to do anything but the \"minimum necessary\"; 2) I've had time to heal and adjust; and 3) I've had time to research my options about my \"future\". I found I needed to give myself time to see what I could or could not adjust to, and promised myself one year to decide if I wanted or needed any additional \"alterations\". I'm really glad I did. I've adjusted sooooo much better than I ever thought I could, and have learned to appreciate the beautiful job my surgeon did. Nevertheless, for \"practical\" reasons, I've decided to \"even things up\" and am now scheduled for a bi-lateral DIEP reconstruction on December 8. It's a radically different approach to reconstruction than implants, and something I did not know of at the time I had my mastectomy. I'm so glad I took my time, but I confess I was very tempted to have a bi-lateral mastectomy done \"back when\", but my docs weren't very supportive (\"no medical necessity\" yada yada), and I wasn't up to waging an insurance battle. Perhaps I wouldn't have had to fight, but I simply didn't have the stamina back then to find out. I'm happy with how things have turned out so far. Good luck with your decision and upcoming surgery. RSVP if you have any other questions.",

Perhaps it's just that, after living with the stress for so long the mind and bod are going through a rough patch trying to adjust to the next phase of treatment or \"disease management\". I'm gonna try thinking of it that way and see if that helps smooth the bumpy ride any. I feel like the last guy in the chain climbing Dunn's River Falls. Thanks for hanging on to me! Bonnie, thanks too for your thoughts on a \"front end alignment\" (as my girlfriend calls it). I'm starting to consider having an mx on the \"other\" side and then, maybe, recon.... or not...  but if I do recon then, I'd have a better chance of a matching set wouldn't I? What good would it do to recon just one side, then find out later the other one's gotta go too...  Well, at least I guess I'm making progress if I'm thinking about this rather than chemo, eh? and yes, I'll do much more research yet...  I'm sorry you weren't given better choices, but I hope you're satisfied with the result? Double-flat would probably be fine with me too...  but I've learned that I can only make one decision at a time, so doing the other mx might be the right next step for me...  thanks again for your thoughts, encouragement and \"ear\"! ~Gayle.",

I'm so ready to be done, so what's up with the anxiety? I haven't really suffered too terribly from many SEs...  just the usual stuff...  so I don't think I'm afraid of that one last time, but I'm kinda quivering inside...  I'm not sure I buy the losing \"treatment as safety net\" explanation because I've hated every onc. appointment and treatment experience, even tho I like the onc. himself well enough. I want my hair back NOW and I want to resume normal life NOW*2! Is that too much to want or expect??? Anyone old enough to remember riding an amusement park ride called \"the parachute jump\"? It's kind like that feeling you get knowing you're getting closer, closer, closer to the top knowing that any moment now you'll be freefalling and shouting \"Wheeeeeee! all the way down...  Sorry for the dump, but could use a wee bit of encouragement right now, if you've any to spare...  Feeling a bit weepy and I don't think I should be, da&n it!!! How did you feel AFTER finishing??? Elated? Triumphant? or oddly, somewhat let down? The mental part seems to be as harder or harder than the physical part...  sooo tired and worn down in the head...  body's holding up a bit better, and after rt mx w/o recon, even that's not so good anymore... sigh...  Please tell me that better days are soon ahead!!!  Cheers?

I really am looking forward to saying \"I'm done!\" (with chemo, anyway), and appreciate your words of encouragement. I'm sure I'll feel better once it's really over, and fortunately I already have a wig that I love... even my own sister-in-law couldn't tell it was one, and a stranger in the Ladies' Room at the theater yesterday asked where I'd gotten my hair done...  I told here where I'd \"bought\" it and she was really surprised too! Still, I'll be glad to get my own back...  I think that will go a long way toward restoring my spirits. That, and deciding what, if anything, to do about the frontal anatomy. I'm glad & grateful to have this forum and all of you trailblazers to follow. Cheers!?! Gayle.",
