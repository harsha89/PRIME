I am happy not to have SE as of today (the 1st one was today) but I see now that it might start days 2, 3, 5 ... etc (not round 2! 3!) I surprisingly handled the surgery, after surgery recovery, power port, etc.  really well. It's either because as we say in Russia: on me \"everything heals like on a dog's skin\" (sorry if the translation doesn't sound adequate), and apparently the assumption is that dogs' wounds are being healed fast and easy; or I was just lucky. We'll see. I keep my fingers crossed that I will be able to go thru chemo with minimal SE since I am alone now (well, crap happens), and my job is only part-time so I have to go to work trying not to miss a day. And I am fine. The hope is that I will stay that \"fine\" way thru the end until I am cancer free, with perked boobs and a free tummy tuck! LOL",

So mine is IDC, , 3 sm, Stage IIB, Grade, I think, 2, 2/15 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- The doctor said that I might not even need chemo and as far as radiation goes I might not even need it too. Although I am in a grey area with the radiation. I will be 50 in 2 weeks btw. Jsu wanted to share.",
