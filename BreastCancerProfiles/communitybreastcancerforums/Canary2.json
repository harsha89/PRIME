I had lumpectomy and radiation with my first DCIS (ER-/PR-) 4 years ago on recommendation from my surgeon although I considered mastectomy at the time mostly because radiation limits future options but it just seemed so extreme. I was shocked to get diagnosed with a new DCIS (ER+/PR+) this year and subsequently learned I have CHEK2 genetic mutation that increases my risk for breast cancer. I ended up with a mastectomy anyway and now am sorry I ever had radiation. My MO is recommending strongly for a prophylactic mastectomy on my right now given my risk. If I were to choose to keep my right breast she would want me on Tamoxifen even though it's not known how well it really fares when it goes face to face with a genetic predisposition for disease. It's a no brainer for me, right breast will be gone as soon as I can schedule it. No Tamoxifen and double mastectomy reduces risk to 1%. If your genetic testing is negative then your surgeon's recommendation is right on. If you may have a genetic mutation then you may be better off with double mastectomy not because you don't have to take Tamoxifen (or radiation) but because your risk for any future concern would be low.",
