The WHOLE port thing freaks me out, and I know this is irrational, but I keep thinking I'm going to fall or scrape it or something and rip it loose from the vein/artery it's attached to and bleed to death internally.  I think maybe I worry too much.  HAHAH!

I can also now feel the wire/catheter above the port -- it is right at the service of the skin as well. I have three treatments left, and if it continues to act like this, I'll have to have it taken out as it might just make it's way out all on its own!",
