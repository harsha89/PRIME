Then 12 weekly doses of Taxol, then Herceptin every 3 weeks for 1 year with 6 wks. of radiation. Then probably Tamoxifen after that. My chemo doc referred to it as the \"full court press\". Had bilateral masectomies in Sept. 2005, no radiation or chemo that time around. I am a positive, very strong woman, but the nausea is really doing a number on me. I have taken emend, prochlorperazine, lorazepam, ondansetron (generic for zofran). I know I'm supposed to drink, but can barely get anything down. If I went in for fluids would they help? Will they give them to me if I'm not vomiting? Sorry, I sound like a baby, but I am really still so miserable. Thanks for any suggestions.",
