She had the same thoughts was it fair to have a child who may lose their mother at an early age, as she has an aggressive form, but they wanted another child and they are happy with their decision, you cant put your life on hold, in case of the what ifs. a child could lose their parent because of an auto accident, things in life are not guaranteed.

My markers seem to stay within the same range when I am off for six weeks , but then at times can go crazy. I know I feel a lot better when I am off treatment, so I get to the point at times when I just feel like quitting for a while and seeing what happens, as my onc. always ask me if I want to keep on it and leave it up to me. I know at some point I will say no. I think that if she is willing to keep on top of your progress with blood work and make sure everything is still stable, I might just take the chance and be happy with not having chemo for a while. But I would always want to be monitored to make sure it wasnt progressing. It's a hard choice, because we just want to feel healthy and not feel like crap all the time. We have to do what works for us, and be joyful in the moments when we here good news for a change. So enjoy the moment.",

I guess the tumors either shrunk which stopped the pressure on the nerve, or the spine was not pressing on the nerve.  Have you had radiation, or do you have mets in that area?

The first question I asked him was why I should go through the surgery if I was already Stage four with mets.   He said after discussion with the committee at the Center, they were at the opinion that, they felt it was better to remove the source of the primary cancer, which would keep producing and spreading if radiation didn,t stop it.  But he also said if it had just been one tumor, they might have tried a different approach. But because I had another tiny one, it was better to  remove the tumors. I think each case has to be handled individually. ",

I would ask my doctors opinion, and take it from their.  I know it is a very personal decision , and sometimes we just need a break, even for a few weeks, my Doctor always asks me if I want to continue, before we writes the next prescription, I don't know if she figures I am on the way out anyway, so give me the choice on how long I want to carry on, or if she is just wants to let me make the choices in my care.  It seems we always have to consider the effect on our families, if we have young children , on our husbands,  it is never easy, but sometimes we have to be selfish, and decide on how we what to handle our health, medications and treatments.Even if the Doctor allows you to take a few weeks off, to allow your body to rest, it may be a good option, at least you have a choice.  Best of Luck ",

I didn't have the discharge, but 4 years ago, after badly bruising my breast from a mammo. I had a some dime sized lump just under the skin below the nipple.  The Dr.sent me to the Breast clinic to have it looked at, and the Dr. said it didn't need a biopsy because it was just under the skin.  Three years later, it started moving, got quite dry and the skin cracked.  I also developed a large lump in the milk gland and so when | went and got a biopsy on it, they also did the smaller lump that I had and found it had developed cancer.  The nipple was also inverted during this time.This is not unusal in itself, but could be a clue  that something is going on.  So please go and have it checked to make sure that it is not just an infection.  Best of luck.",

The doctors want her to quit work, she is in a school , but not in regular classroom setting, one on one to one student in a private room.  She has come down with a viral infection, and ended up in hospital, because she hasnt been able to eat. So she is on fluids right now.  Her problem is that she is that she needs another month of work to get enough hours to qualify for benefits.  She has a five year old that is in the school system and is probably going to be carrying more germs, virus and everything going from her classroom.  The question is has anyone worked while doing chemo and been able to advoid contacting every bug that goes around.  She would like to try and get her hours in but not at any costs.  She knows her health comes first, but she also has to live, and one salary at home doesnt cut it anymore.  Anyone have this problem Dx 8/18/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 1/2 nodes, mets, ER+, HER2+ Hormonal Therapy 10/8/2009 Aromasin (exemestane) Radiation Therapy 2/6/2010 3DCRT: Bone Radiation Therapy 6/10/2012 Bone Chemotherapy 9/5/2012 Xeloda (capecitabine) Log in to post a reply",
