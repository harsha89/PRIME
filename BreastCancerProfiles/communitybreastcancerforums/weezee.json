Her radiation will be at a Cleveland Clinic satellite right down the street from her, thank goodness she doesn't have to go 30 miles to downtown Cleve.  I just worry about the lymph nodes now, I'll feel much better when they tell us they weren't affected.....I'm praying.....thanks again to all of you.",

(3-7% ?)  Doctor says 5-7 weeks radiation daily, has anyone found that to be unbearable?  Side effects?  Of course, the lymph nodes will be the main thing we are still worried about.  She wonders that if she has breast cancer, does that make her more likely to have cancer elsewhere in her lifetime?  Thanks, you guys are amazing.

      "Content": "weezee wrote: Hi again all you beautiful souls..  My sister had a lumpectomy o 10-22-09.  The onco \"recommended\" chemo because the cancer was 1.5 cm.  She is stage 1, hormone receptive..I think that's the term.  Anwaaay, sister has decided against chemo, she will do the radiation and horm therapy.  She was just devastated whent the onco said \"chemo\" as the surgeon had never mentioned the need for it, just surgery and then radation.  She was trying to be such a strong soldier and just fell apart at the thought of the chemo. She is soon to be 70 in December, but a very very young 70. She is very active and young at heart....her husband has a number of bad conditions, ie: Parkinson's,  rheumatoid arhritis, 2 strokes, heart attack,....she has had a number of serious surgeries in the past....my point is, she wants to go on with her life, she doesn't want to drag this out. The onco says her benefits at her age would be minimal, with her data, the whole thing.  She spent the rest of the hour and a half appointment back peddling when she saw how upset my sister was at the thought of chemo.....\"you don't have to have it, it was only a recommendation\" She even went so far as to tell her \"I wouldn't have it if I were you\"..............? So, okay, now she is fearful of the hormone therapy.  Can anyone tell me what they've experienced with that?  Doctor said it's a couple different hormones and we'll take it a day at a time, depending on how she tolerates it.....sounds like it might be a problem to some people..? And for five years?? Log in to post a reply",
