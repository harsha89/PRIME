The oncologist at Dana Farber feels it should be very low. This has been too much of a rollercoaster ride and months of waiting...so I am just putting it out of my mind as best I can. I am ready for chemo or not. Not sure what number would be the cut off. The thing that worries me the most is my very dense tissue. This doesn't factor into chemo I believe but it is a constant worry.I loved my breast surgeon but I am not feeling all warm and fuzzy about the oncologist and radiologistÂ . They both said yes \"very busy breasts\" but they don't recommend scans or anything further. Maybe that is good, not sure at this point. Ellen",
