(Taxotere, Adriamyacin, Cytoxin) or TAC.  Your questions and concerns are valid ones, but don't be so terrified.  I actually breezed through chemo with little side effects. Emend is not given too often these days although it's one of the newest of the chemo drugs for anti-nausea.  Most insurance companies will not cover the cost of it since it's the most expensive.  Decadron will do just as well and is covered in almost all cases. We were all terrified the first time in the chair, but I had no problems whatsoever.  Made a lot of nice friends there as well and we passed out jello and munchies to all the others around us.  We always had our own little party, and took an ice chest with lunch and drinks. You can get up and walk around and to and from the bathroom as well.  You just unplug and your pumps are battery operated too.  We even went outside sometimes for an hour or so. Take a blanket if you want to sleep although most centers have those as well. Here are a bunch of great tips and if you start on them right away you can curb some of the problems you'll encounter after chemo starts. Get started brushing your teeth with Biotene Toothpaste as well as using Biotene Mouthwash in place of your regular toothpaste.  It will keep you from getting the mouth sores so many before us have gotten.  If you do get mouth sores, have the onc write you a script for Magic Mouthwash.  I say prevention is worth a pound of cure. Stock up on Senekot.  The first few days after chemo you will usually be constipated.  If you just take one every night before bed you won't have a problem. Stock up on Emodium.  Usually after the constipation is over you will follow with diaharrea.  The Emodium will work wonders for most, but those who can't control it have your onc. give you a script for Lotrimin.  Also yogurt with active cultures is a big help. Just one a day is enough. Be prepared for your hair loss.  Most of us never knew that when the hair would start to thin it would hurt.  That's the time you want to do a final buzz.  Besides it keeps you from shedding like a dog everywhere you go. Most of us don't recommend wigs unless you absolutely have to have one.  They're scratchy, itchy and hot.  Scarves and cool hats are much more comfortable for going out.  Ebay is a good source for scarf lots if you need some. Be prepared for weight gain.  Yes I said weight gain.  The steroids you'll be taking for the anti-neasua will work wonders but not without it's price.  Expect anywhere from 20-50 lbs before chemo is over.  If you're one of the few who doesn't gain that consider yourself one of the lucky few. Expect lots and lots of sleepless nights.  Have the onc. write you a script for Ambien.  Most of you are probably already experiencing lack of sleep even before chemo; it just gets worse. Don't be afraid of all of the medications you'll be taking.  It doesn't last forever and all of them serve their purpose. Be prepared for metallic tasting drinks.  Some say flavored waters work well although one time it will and the next time something else will work better.  Drink at least 64oz of liquids per day if you possibly can.  It will help flush the chemo faster and you don't want to encounter bladder or kidney problems. That includes, jello and any liquids you drink, not just water. Don't be afraid of your port hurting when they insert into it for chemo.  I never had mine sprayed or used a cream and never had it hurt once.  The nurses are experts in doing it.  Some people complain they can see theirs more than other people.  Consider yourself lucky as they say the closer they are to the surface the less problems. Taxotere and Taxol are notorious for causing water retention or nails turning dark.  Never happened to me and some say they put their hands in ice water during chemo to prevent it.  It's your call. I can tell you this.  When I did my chemo I was petrified the first time.  But I only had a bad bout with diaharrea once until I found out the yogurt was my cure.  Other than that I had a little fatique once in a while and that was it.  Can't say that's what will happen to you, but know it's possible if you don't dwell on it all the time. Hope some of this will help you ladies. Good luck, Angel",

Also the headaches are common after Cytoxin.  Have them slow it down next time and you'll avoid the headaches.  I never had any se's from the Neulasta so don't wait for it to happen........lol  Just remember every treatment you do is one less you'll have to look forward to.  Day 3-7 are the common days for crashing.  Just take it easy and try not to overdo if you possibly can.

I'm about 10 weeks post chemo and was told about month 4-5 it will be all over your head.  Very short but nonetheless there.  Well not for me I don't think unless something happens pretty quick here.  I can barely even see any fuzz as yet so it looks like that Christmas marker I set for myself will have to be post-poned until Valentines Day maybe. I was also told in the onc. office the other day that it's a 6month minimum before you should even think about coloring but that 1 year is recommended.  Can you tell that was a man talking...lol  I say when there's enough I'm dying it.
