She said its lobular, so slow growing. MRI on Friday. So hard to think of anything else but all of this! Thank you for the response",

I get them every 6 months as i had suspicious cells. About 3 weeks ago felt a lump, went to Dr, had mammogram and told it was suspicious. Skipped the biopsy as i have implants and Dr felt it was too close to the implant. Had an excisional biopsy where the lump was removed. Dr said it looked benign. Nurse called today (6 days later), said there were cancer cells. Me - does that mean its cancer, nurse - yes. Follow up appt is on Tuesday. So....what does this all mean?? Do i have breast cancer? If so, surely it cant be that bad as my December mamo was clean. Will i need radiation? Chemo? She removed the lump...so am i cancer free? My hhusband is acting like nothing has happened. I want to yell at people-hey- i think i have cancer!! Am i over reacting?? Please help me stay sane here.... Log in to post a reply",
