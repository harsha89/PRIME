I was surprised that in spite of significant improvement in treatment, doctors today still treat breast cancer similarly as they did 30 years ago: surgery, chemo, and radiation. We need a cure for breast cancer instead of just education and awareness. I was surprised that Susan Komen for the Cure Foundation, a leading non-profit for breast cancer, only spends 18% of their funding on research and innovation. Please sign this petition to ask Komen to spend at least 50% of their funding on research and innovation. One out of eight American women develop breast cancer during their life time. About 95% of the people who died of breast cancer started out as having early stage breast cancer, so awareness and early detection does not guarantee survival. What is needed is more research and innovation to find a cure so that breast cancer at any stage can be cured! Below is a petition to ask Komen to spend at least half of their funding on research. https://www.change.org/p/keep-a-breast-foundation-i-ask-that-komen-commit-at-least-50-of-total-donations-to-medical-research-and-innovation-rather-than-to-awareness-and-education-i-request-all-other-breast-cancer-non-profits-do-the-same Rebecca Log in to post a reply",
