      "Content": "adowney76 wrote: 3-4 weeks ago, I rolled over in bed and somehow felt a lump high up in my breast.  I didn't think much of it, as my mother has had cysts drained that were found in her breasts in the past.  However, I was due for an annual with my OB GYN, so I went ahead and made and appointment and planned to address the lump as well.  He sent me for a mamogram, which was performed last tuesday, and they asked me if I could come back that same day for an ultrasound, which I did.  The tech immediately left the room and said I could get dressed, but stay please.  She must have taken the ultrasound directly to the radiologist because 15 minutes later they asked me if I could go for a core biopsy that afternoon.  I couldn't due to work, but went 2 days later (last thursday).  I sweated it all weekend, because it becuase very real to me that this may not be some simple cyst, especially with them rushing me around for tests so quickly.  Sure enough, yesterday they called me and said I had infiltrating ductile carcinoma, Nottingham grade II of III. They set me up for a surgical consult that day! I left that office in a blur yesterday...but somehow I agreed to a bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  The surgeon also told me that even if my nodes were clean, I would likely need chemo because of my age and the size of the tumor....seriously??? If my nodes are clean and both breasts gone, why would i require chemo and not just radiation?  I am so confused about what is to come.  He also highly discouraged lumpectomy or just right breast mastectomy becuase he said my likelihood was very high for recurrence, again because of my age.  I am thoroughly lost as to what to expect from this point on....I was just diagnosed 24 hours ago!!!  Its like a bad dream I can't wake from...and how could I have prevented this?  I don;t think there is a thing I could have done differently..just unlucky i guesss.  I am not married, no kids...very career oriented. This is going to be very hard for me, especially mentally....any words of advice? Im at a loss here. Log in to post a reply",
