(And believe me, I've been where you are, with my gut and brain all tied into knots as I waited for a biopsy--my little kids gathered around me and every possible scenario playing out in my mind. It's a horrible time. Waiting is just the worst!) But for your well-being, it has to be one step at a time. You need a diagnosis from a pathologist looking at tissue from the biopsy under a microscope before you make any decisions. The news there is likely to be good, since women in their 30s develop non-cancer breast changes all the time, while only a very few develop cancer. The surgeon can't tell for sure just what's going on just by looking during the surgery. Even areas that feel very suspicious on breast exam and look bad on mammograms and even during surgery often turn out to be completely benign, not cancer at all. While occasionally surgeons order a \"frozen section,\" a quick read of the tissue while the patient is in surgery, it's much less accurate than the standard procedure, which takes a few days. When you have a firm diagnosis from the pathologist, you can relax (benign!) or decide on more action if necessary. In any case, your family history, any inherited genetic mutation, and other risk factors need to be part of your decision process. I send you every good wish!",

They may very well just be the way your breasts are developing or something else pretty simple. But do check it out with your doctor or other health care provider. I suspect you will be reassured--and you have been worrying about this for way too long! It's not worth it!",
