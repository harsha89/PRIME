Initially they saw calcifications on the mammogram and said just to be safe side let's biopsy it even though they were \"fairly positive\" it was nothing. Needless to say I was shocked when they called me back and said it came back dcis and idc. No palpably lump was ever felt.",

I am not expert but I am also a young (34) woman who was recently diagnosed with DCIS and a small invasion of IDC. If I hadn't of went in for an ingrown hair in the opposite armpit this would of not been found. I thank god everyday for that ingrown hair! I have two little ones at home and was just as terrified as you. I just had my lumpectomy and SNB yesterday. I'm happy to report that I have had little to no pain what so ever. Suprisingly it was very simple and so do able. You will get through this just fine and be one step closer to kicking cancers ass and having the most magical wedding day ever. If you have any questions feel free to ask away or pm me. Lots of positive thoughts and prayers coming your way. Jenny",
