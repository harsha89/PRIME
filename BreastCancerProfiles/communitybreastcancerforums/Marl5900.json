I do not like hydrocodone but may take some if the physical pain makes it too hard to sleep.  Right now I just wake up a lot. Everyone says TX is easy compared to chemo or BMX but for me it is still a pain and yet another daily \"task\" and reminder of cancer.  My oncologist wants to put me on tamoxifen right after.  I know this is another thread but really if anyone here knows something about that drug, let me know? ",

We sometimes communicate by text or email about tests and she always takes the time to explain to me or any member of my family what is going on and what is the plan. Appointment with her are either super short (nothing new) or she takes the time to talk and listen (rarety among doctors) depending on what is going on. She is reassuring but honest and not patronizing but gentle. I have had many doctors during this journey and she is not only the best but also the nicest. Her team (except for one person I try to avoid ;)) is fantastic too and I feel cared for by all of them. Send me a personal message if you want phone number etc.",

No side effects that prevent me from being active (working, traveling, swimming, training my dog etc) but since December 2016 my liver has shown signs of toxicity. I do not feel anything but the levels (bili, AST and ALT) are carefully checked and I am now getting a lower dose. It is indeed a wonderful drug and I wish all women who need it would get access to it. Processing the \"stage IV\" has been a challenge but it is possible to keep anxiety in check and remain active and happy. Good luck to you. ",

Very rarely do I feel really bothering numbness in my hand and feet and only for a short period of time. The more I do, the less I feel it. Swimming and walking has helped. Also, I do not ever stay for post treatment (maybe I did the first one in December 2014?). Side effects have been manageable and mild compared to taxotere, carboplatin or doxcil. Some headaches, some low platelet (a little nose bleed here and there) and some serious fatigue fior a couple days every cycle. The only problem so far in my liver but I keep my finger crossed and each time hope I will still be able to get my treatment. I skip 2 so far because of liver enzymes. I am wondering if any of you heard what other drugs are or might be in the pipeline after kadcyla has stopped working or if there are too many dangerous side effects?",

I thought by now I would be pain free.  But the radiated breast, or rather the TE and the skin around, is sometimes so painful I cannot sleep.  And it is not getting better. It is actually more painful than around Christmas! My PS says it is the radiation' results and that I have to be patient.  So, I have to take pain killers everyday.  The worst is at night.  However, I found that exercising gently (no weight just stretching) my arm/shoulder helps a little.  I do much better if I can go to the gym or the pool. Maybe it's the sports bra and compression?  Sometimes I have to put ice on the swollen side (against my doctor's advice). I do worst if I drive too much or write/type too long. Because people assume (and need to think) I am done with cancer and treatment etc I do not share how much pain I still have.  But I suspect they are many of us.  ",
