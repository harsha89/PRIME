Started chemo Jan 4th and am so happy have the 6 treatments behind me. Still a long road ahead, but it's all one step at a time, right? Just finished the last chemo April 19th and am looking forward to moving along to surgery and rads. Well, maybe 'looking forward' is not the best way to express it, but I just want to put as much of this behind me like everyone else. Please keep updates on rads - it will be good to see how everyone is faring! I will start mid to late June as I am looking at lumpectomy surgery May 14th. Last week was my post chemo MRI and next week I go for an ultrasound. They saw 2 new lumps near my tumor on the left side and said my right side axilla looks questionable. What?! I understand MRI's are not the best diagnostic tool, so I am trying to stay calm. Dxat37 - yes, I too have gained a bit of weight. Not happy about it but given the circumstances have accepted it. Steroids are so helpful, yet cause so many unwanted effects. I'm dealing with crazy eye twitching that I hope will subside soon as well. Buttercup - I too experienced itchy hands and feet but it was after my 4th treatment of TCHP. It was unbearable and nothing helped. At one point it got so bad I had a meltdown just like a 2 year old! Not a proud moment for me. ;) The itching lasted about a week, thankfully subsided and did not return. Hopefully yours does not last long. I can completely sympathize.",
