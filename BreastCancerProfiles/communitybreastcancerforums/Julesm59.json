Really doesn't do anything for the radiation treatment or hormonal therapy. I just started radiation today. 5 mins and done. I am only having 16 treatments. So 1/16 done. Yeah. It really isn't so bad. They want to track your skin progression for deterioration. I would guess the pictures are for that, however, what a mess up on the tech's part. I would think that they would have more then one camera in the whole department. I would tell them that taking on there personal device is not acceptable at all, unless they gave you written verification that the pictures are veritably deleted and only used for your chart. Good luck on your treatments, you got this. Easier than surgery.",

I have had my LX but now I wait for my OncoRX #.....and wait.....they didn't send it out until I had my follow-up appt post op, So my first MO appt got pushed back a week, although the kept the RO appt next week. I try not to obsess, but in my mind that is all I do. My friends ask how I'm doing, I tell them I'm doing OK. But I don't want to tell them everything. They all think everything is OK since my path report (which I did share with them) had clean margins, neg nodes. Whoopeee!!! But I'm still obsessing. I look at the other Stage 1 treatments and outcomes, and I'm sure I am overthinking everything. What about this or that....I have two IDC tumors within 1 cm of each other occupying a space of 4.2 cm with a DCIS thrown in the mix. The graded the larger of the two at Grade 2. I guess that is good. But I guess, I should count Stage 1 as a blessing and the ER+ HER- (which the Nurse Navigator stated is the \"good type\" to have) really??? I just worry because I am the bread winner, husband is retired with only SS income. Oh well, back to the real world and put my happy face on for tomorrow. Thanks for listening to my rant and rambling. Think I need to get it off my chest HAHAHA.... Jules",

After a time (unknown for each person) that fluid will re-absorb into the body. It is normal, but should be looked at by your BS. I believe it is called a seroma. Good luck with your MO and the hormone decision. Jules",

It was questionable, due to location (right next to my nipple), but he sent me anyway. I hadn't had a mammogram for 5 years. My doctor frowned on at me for not getting my mammograms. So two days later, I go for the mammogram. I was having a 3d mammogram, but when the technician did it she wanted to do a diagnostic 2d. Then while I am waiting (I knew something was up) but I thought it was my left side, she came in and said we are going to do an ultrasound, now. So then I trot off to ultrasound, in the same area for the ultrasound. The tech spent alot of time on my right breast. Then said, she needed to go get the doctor. The doctor then came in and move the ultrasound around and got a very serious, concerned tone and stated that it wasn't good news. My right breast has two very suspicious area which are considered BiRad 5 (she explained it) and the left looked like an abscess but BiRad 4. I needed a Needle Core Biopsy. They scheduled me for the next day. Then sent me to the nurse navigator who asked me who I wanted for a surgeon. The results came back as IDC about 1.5cm and 1.6cm in the right WOW, moved very quickly and within a week and a half, I was having a lumpectomy. Surgery went well. Margins were good and sentinel nodes (2) neg. They excised the left mass and indeed it was an abscess. My ocotype came back as 7. Stage 1c Grade 2 with ICD and DCIS between the two masses in my right breast. I am halfway through radiation treatments 16 of them. Takes all of 15 mins, but treatment is more like 2 mins. Skin is doing well. I meet with my MO and started on Anastrozole for at least 5 years. I will be finished with Rads on Dec 18th. So thanks to my abscess (which had no symptoms except for the lump) I found my cancer. So I should be done with active treatment within 2 1/2 months of finding the lump. I consider myself extremely lucky and blessed to have a wonderful center. They have shared everything with me and answered all of my questions. If feel well taken care of and the staff, technicians and reception personnel have all been very wonderful. I have a wonderful DH that is very supportive. However, I haven't told his kids about the diagnosis since they are all drama queens. I also didn't want any information getting to my own biological son who is deployed currently in the Navy. I preferred he only worry about doing his job and not on his Mother. I will tell him when he comes home in June. I only told those at work who needed to know. I took off work for 3 days for surgery but have worked every day before and since. Sorry this was so long, but writing my story was very therapeutic. I am not much of a worrier, and tried to see this cancer as a task to completed. I tend to worry when there is something substantial to worry about. And this was doable. As of December 18th I will be completed, except for taking a pill a day and paying off the co-pays....insurance won't cover. LOL. Thanks for reading. Best of luck you warrior ladies. I don't consider myself a survivor but a warrior. With a task or a job to complete. Makes me more in control.",
