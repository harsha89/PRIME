There is a tiny bit of spiky growth in top of my head now. My MO said my hair would most likely start to grow back during Taxol but how can that be if others lose their hair when they start with it? Anyway, eyelashes and brows have been thinning for a couple of weeks. Ugh. Praying they at least hang on until after my D's HS graduation on the 29th! Best wishes for speedy hair growth to us all!!",
