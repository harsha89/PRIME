My stitches were not dissolving as expected and a some were spitting through the skim. One left a 2 inch whole which keeps opening - my surgeon has stitched it up twice and I think it might be coming undone again. A few days ago another huge area  (about 3 inches) completing opened up. I have also had problems with the binder I had to wear after surgery - my surgeon thinks it may have been the other cause to the scar opening. I went to another surgeon the other day just because my surgeon was not available to see about the new opening and he doesn't believe in restitching abdominal openings. Says it will just come open again and it will eventuall heal on its own. I hope this is the case as I am tired of getting stitched up because the few days after are quite painful. My surgeon says this is minor so don't worry about it but it is just frustrating. Just wanted to share my story to let you know it does happen.",

I was told I have a 25 - 40% chance of reoccurence in the next five years which means I have a 60 - 75% chance of survival in the next five years and I had all the bad signs. I was only 39 when diagnosed, 8cm tumour in breast, 3cm in axilla, had chemo before surgery so not sure how many lymph nodes involved but at least two, triple negative. I have just passed my 2.5 years in remission. asics girl",

I am just feeling incredibly frustrated with the whole ordeal although I still feel it is well worth it.I am back to my ps on Tuesday and then he will decide whether he will stitch it again. Can I ask where you had your surgery i.e. the States or Canada? I am in Ottawa, Canada Good luck with your appointment this week.",

I had my surgery 8 weeks ago and was supposed to be back to work last week but because of the problems I have with my open incision and the pain I get in my abdomen when I am walking too long am still not able to go back to my desk job. Just wondering if anyone else in the situation feels the same about not being able to work after these problems or am I just being a wimp?",

My surgeon who did the mastectomy told me that since I was active, I was unlikley to get LE. I continued to run during chemo and radiation and did some light weights so I am not sure if that helped me. I wouldn't worry about getting it if I were you. I did find my pec muscle gets tight quite often though but it gets better as time goes on. Keep running. I truly believe that staying active keeps me positive and will in turn keep me cancer free.",
