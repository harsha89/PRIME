It sounds like Avon is helping.   Cheryl Marc.Hurlbert@avonfoundation.org [Marc.Hurlbert@avonfoundation.org] Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2012 12:49 PM To: Susan  Cc: Eloise.Caggiano@avon.com Hi Sue,  Thank you for your very thoughtful note. Eloise asked me to respond with some detail about where are funds go. I apologize it has taken me a few days to respond.  We agree with you that there is a paucity of resources and support for women with metastatic breast cancer. That is why we keep our eyes open for opportunities and are eager to hear of programs that provides support to metastatic patients. I will provide links to several programs that might be of interest to you. Let me know if you do not see those 'hot spots' and links.  One program we support is through Johns Hopkins University and it is weekend retreats for metastatic patients and their partners or care givers. We are working in 2013 to see how we can roll this model out to other institutions across the country. We have supported Living Beyond Breast Cancer information on metastatic breast cancer and Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer. We were working with Y-Me to launch new and expanded support for women living with metastatic disease. Sadly, the organization Y-Me had to close its doors this past summer. Finally, we have a few programs under consideration for 2013.  On the research front, we fund several research projects to develop new treatments for metastatic disease, understand how a tumor spreads and why it recurs after initial successful treatment, and projects trying to develop new tests to determine what initial cancers are likely to recur. If you type 'metastatic' in our grants database you can find summaries of some of the dozens of research projects.  With regards to your daughters and potential future granddaughters, we also agree with you. We need to understand better what causes breast cancer and prevent it in this first place or give women tips to reduce their risk. Toward this end we have expanded our messaging beyond \"get a mammogram\" to know your risk and understand what you can do to reduce your risk. The ultimate goal though is to determine the causes and prevent the disease. We fund a \"Virus Research Consortium\" of 16 scientists working collaboratively and aggressively to determine if a virus might cause breast cancer or one of the subtypes of BC (triple negative BC, inflammatory BC, or other). We are also funding several studies to see if the environment might play a role in breast cancer cause.  I would be happy to talk to you more about the work of Avon Foundation. This short note is just a tip of the iceberg of what we are doing.  Sincerely,  Marc  Marc Hurlbert, Ph.D. Executive Director Avon Foundation Breast Cancer Crusade 777 Third Avenue New York, NY 10017 Tel: 212-282-5560e: Happy Holidays - Our Gift To You M",

I started out at stage IV, with mets to several bones, and my TM was 135. Started letrozole on July10 2011. TM on 8/20/11 was 53.8. By March 2012 it was 31.7; that's the lowest mine ever got. It started to go up slowly in September 2012; 39.5.  Had a PET/cat scan end of Sept that showed nothing new. Oct 1st TM was 55; onc said scan trumps TM. On 12/4 TM was 140; had another scan that showed more bone mets. Onc says the mets can be too small to see and that's why I had another scan so soon when my TM's started rising. On 12/31 TM was 240. Letrozole discontinued and started monthly faslodex shots 1/8/13. On 2/12 TM 351 and on 3/12 TM 439. Onc says sometimes it takes faslodex 3 months to start working, Just had blood work today and will find out if it's working on Friday. Do you usually have monthly TM's done? Mine were every 2 months until they started going up. Good luck. I hope the letrozole works for a long time. Cheryl",

As long as you get enough numbing to the area,you'll be fine. After the 2 core needle biopsies,i took 2 Advils before med wore off. That's the only pain med I took.

CA 27/29 WNL,down from 135.  This July ended up in hospital with atrial fib;heart rate was 140-200 for over 4 hrs. I added 2 more meds to my bunch. Will need heart med the rest of my life. I'm sorry for the rant,I am just so sick of being sick. Thanks for listening. ",

They said we don't stock the liquid, only pills. Called oncs nurse back and she said to call around and some pharmacy will have it; they order it all the time. Called local CVS and they said we have 2 strengths; had to call office again to get strength. Nurse said it was 20 mg/5 ml. All the 6 pharmacies I called don't have that strength; none of the pharmacists were aware that it was even made. Called nurse again and told her, she talked to onc and got a script for 100mg/5 ml. 0.5 to 1 ml every 3 hours as needed. That's 10 to 20 mg each dose. Bottle holds 30 ml total. (the size of a plastic med cup they have in hospitals). It come with a syringe that holds from 0.1-1 ml. No refills. All thiese calls took over 2 hours! When my daughter got here with med, found out CVS did not have my insurance info (they said they did), just medicare part D that would not pay any of it, so I paid full price of $24.50 instead of $10 co-pay! I'll be calling insurance on Monday to see if I can be reimbursed. After all that, I took 0.3 ml at first , took some of pain away. At bedtime took 0.4 ml. It helped enough that I could sleep, but I hate that floaty out of it feeling. So I will take it only at night (0.5) and deal with the pain the best I can during the day. Thanks for listening.",

The hospital I go to asks if you have insurance and if not gives you a form to fill out for to apply for help. They also work with you to pay co-pays over time. The big problem in not having insurance is how expensive the tests are. That and the fact that they start charging the minute you register at the ER desk. I went to the ER after having bloody urine, had blood drawn and gave urine spec, was in the waiting room for 4 1/2 hrs,saw doc for 5 minutes (he did nothing) and the bill was almost $1,000! Two days later got call from another ER doc who put me on med for uti. (I was furious at the outrageous cost to sit on a hard plastic chair and watch a small tv that had a blue tinged picture.) That said Massachusetts is a state that you MUST have some kind of health insurance. If you don't when you file your income tax, you are penalized. Those that are low income have medicaid,some have only medicare,some have medicare PPO or HMO.",

I had a PET/cat scan at the end of Sept. That showed improvement, and she said PET/cat trumps tumor marker. She is doing another PET (if insurance approves it) next week to try and see what's going on. I have had a lot of pain in my left butt that she thinks is sciatica; nothing \"lit up\" on PET. This pain is an 8 on 1-10 scale. Having pain in both shoulders and in wrist at the base of my left thumb. Will be seeing rheumatologist on Monday for the wrist. She gave me vicodin for the pain, took one and it helps. Also started on stool softener and senna to prevent constipation. I am trying not to worry at this point; if it's more mets, I'll just have to deal with it. I try to remember \"worry is like a rocking chair; it gives you something to do, but doesn't get you anywhere\". The problem is I live alone and I know tonight when I go to bed, I will start to worry.

Letrozole came out in generic the week I started it; the pharmacy took 3 days to get it because it was new. Mine is from Mylan Pharmaceuticals in Canonsburg PA. My tumor marker (CA 27/29) has gone from 135 to 31.7 and my PET/cat in April showed markedly improved. I would probably take name brands of all my meds (I am on a lot of meds) if they didn't cost so much,but generics work fine for me.   Cheryl",

I take many meds for it; metformin, glyburide and 70/30 insulin. Check my blood sugar 2-3 times a day. I can't imagine not testing. raro if your mother has diabetes, you might have gotten it anyway. Other things that may point toward getting diabetes: gestational diabetes, large babies (my twins weighed over 17 lbs and both my daughters and granddaughter had babies over 10 lbs), obesity. Sometimes diet, exercise just don't prevent it. Speaking of diet, watch your carb intake; carbs turn into sugar in the body. Having to take steroids wreaks havoc with blood sugars, but once you stop them, usually things return to normal.I personally feel that if sugars go way up during steroid treatment, you're probably pre-diabetic. Diabetes is very \"doable\".Just follow docs instructions. Report any extreme thirst and/or hunger, frequent urination, blurred vision, fatigue and irritability, frequent and recurring infections, numbness and tingling in hands and feet. Examine your feet every day to make sure you don't have any skin breakdown. Good luck, Cheryl",
