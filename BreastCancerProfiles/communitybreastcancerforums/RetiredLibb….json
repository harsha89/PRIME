The cats are happily watching their Cat TV - the two birdhouses we have outside our family room windows.  The birds - sparrows, I think - are having a grand time building nests and sitting on top of the birdhouses singing.  I tell my husband that the boy bird is singing, \"Hey baybee, hey baybee - I have a nice house for you!  Hey baybee, I will give you good eggs!\"  One bird in one of the houses goes in and then pokes its head out, looking for all the world like s/he is sitting there with its elbows on a windowsill.  The cats are enthralled!

L ETA:  While I was typing, Bobby Sherman came up!  And YES, I remember Sajid Khan, too!",

My first single was the Theme from Star Trek, backed with Visit to a Sad Planet by Leonard Nimoy. It is in a picture jacket with Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock.
