The chemo that I am on is holding my cancer at bay. I have no side effects and I am able to live a normal life. I want to mix this with holistic treatment, but I have researched this online. The research is very overwhelming. I don't know where to start, who to trust or what to do. I know that I don't want to spend my life sick. The cancer has not spread to any of my inner organs. It is on my skin and lymph nodes. How do I research this? I am going to University of Michigan right now that is ranked 24th in the country. I have considered going to Cancer Center of America, which is not ranked at all, but they do mix chemo treatment with holistic. Please give me you thoughts. Thank you for your time.
