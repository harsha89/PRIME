The fear and the feeling that your world has been turned upside down are very, very normal.  Your world HAS just been turned upside down, but you can do this!  Someone already suggested joining the surgical group for your month, I'd like to also suggest joining the chemo group for your month once you know when that is.  The chemo group for my month has turned into a wonderful support system for me.  They were fabulous during chemo and we have stuck together and become even closer now that we are done.   The chemo group is a great place for learning how to handle side effects and dealing with the emotional ups and downs that go along with chemo. Also, once you find out what type of breast cancer you have (triple negative, HER2+ etc) there are great threads for each group.  They are a wonderful source of support for not only during treatment, but for the years beyond. Wishing you the very best.  I hope you post back here after you know more. Hugs, Kay",

My surgery went smoothly.  As expected the ALND was the harder part of the surgery and I've been having hypersensitivity on the skin on the inside of my upper arm that has been driving me nuts.  Today, it seems to be a little better which delights me.  I have an appointment in 2 days with my BS.  I have lots of questions for her.  I really want to prevent even getting LE if I possibly can.",
