After being mashed, squished, poked and prodded I asked my Dr. And he just nodded But I exercise, eat healthy, and don't smoke This can't be real It must be a joke! All these thoughts went through my head Will I live or will I be dead?  I am still young, only 47 Will I die and go to heaven?  I looked at my Dr. with a tear in my eye I told him to fix me I am not ready to die! He looked at me with compassion and assurance And all I could think is I am glad I have insurance! 4 Months of chemo 6 Weeks of radiation 5 years of Tamoxifen Would be my cure It would clean my body And make me pure I swallowed hard and held my breath I prayed these treatments would save me from death Five years have passed And I am happy to say I am alive and healthy To this day!
