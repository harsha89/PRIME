I was Stage 1 Grade 1.  My nodes were clear, Thank God.  ER+/PR+ I still have a hard time saying \"I was diagnosed\".  It just seems very foreign to me.  Both of my parents died of cancer.  My Mom had Multiple Myleoma and my Dad had lung cancer.  So far the radiation is going well.......the main thing bothering me is the pain from the surgery.  I told my Dr. that my boob feels like a volcano and it's about to erupt right out my nipple!  That's the only way I could explain it.  I have a feeling he has never heard it put that way.   I feel he may have been the nerd in his class because I was telling him I sure would like to have someone drive me to my treatments everyday......I said \"Instead of it being Driving Miss Daisy.....I said it would be Driving Miss Debbie\"!!!!!  He got the total deer in the headlight look......I said haven't you ever watched \"Driving Miss Daisy\"????  Still the deer in the headlight look......so I was like....Nevermind!!!!!  I am finally passed the depression.  I am ready to get this over and get on with my life!  I look forward to becoming an \"Official Sister\"!!!!   Is there an initiation process????? Hee Hee!  Debbie",

I am so glad to read all of your posts because I can soooo relate to all of them.  I have a question.....I have developed a rash where they are aiming the radiation.  All my Doctor has said is put aloe on the area.....but now I have all these little bumps!  Any suggestions?  Also....ya'll aren't going to be this.  I had my last mammogram on Feb 22 and that was the day they told me that they had found \"something\" and I had to go to a surgeon..... TODAY I get a letter from the place where I got my mammogram, the letter is dated April 20th and it said they are pleased to inform me that the mammogram showed NO evidence of CANCER!!!!!!!!  SO why did I have surgery and radiation?????  I'm going to show it to my radiologist tomorrow.  What do ya'll think I should do????? Hugs, Debbie",

I have 2 more weeks of radiation to go.....so how much longer after the radiation does this fatigue hang on????  I wake up in the morning and think....I feel good...this is gonna be a good day.  THEN I get up, take my shower, get ready for work and just want to go back to bed....I'm exhausted.  I am so thankful that I own my own business so I can stay home if I need to!  I do not see how those of you who work get through the day.  I am usually home by 3 and in bed for 2 hours.  My hats are off to all of you! Hope everyone is having a good week! Debbie",

Ducky, my surgeon said the same thing....even before the biopsy.....he said it was malignant!  I was like you in a total fog and I looked at him and said.....but it MIGHT not be!!!!!  He just kinda gave me \"the Look\".  I also live alone and I am kinda glad I was alone durig the depression period.....I could cry and scream and yell and notbody was there to look at me like I'm an idiot.  I am a real people person but lately I have been enjoying my alone time.  I have a lake house in Arkansas and I have been going there every weekend and watching spring come to full bloom.  It has been wonderful.  Sandee I got the \"best case scenario\" and \"If you have to have it this is the best kind to have\"!  All I wanted to yell at them was this is that awful nasty \"C\" word that took both of my parents.  My mom was only 62 when it took her.  My kids do not remember the grandmother who loved them more than life.  I HATE the word.  When I talk about it I just say they took THAT THING out of my body!!!  Last week I had a couple of down days.  For some reason after my radiation treatments I would get nauseous and it would last for about 2 hours.  The Doctor and the Tech's said it was no way it could be the radiation.....I felt like I was losing my mind.....I would get so sick I couldn't lift my head off the pillow......I layed in bed and cried....Ok....I'm tired of this.....I don't want to play this game anymore if I am going to have to have 4 more weeks of this.  Then another Pink Warrior Sister asked me if I had started a new medication.....then I remembered I started the Arimidex the same time I started the radiation.  I looked up the side effects of the Arimidex and nausea is one of them......so it did make me feel better that I wasn't completely losing my mind!!!! Have either of you had any weird side effects from the radiation?????  I want to get in my big jacuzzi bathtub and just soak but from what I hear that is a no no!!!!  It sure would be a wonderful stress reliever! Thanks again for such a warm welcome.  I look forward to more conversations......Oh and Ducky I almost peed my pants reading your posts!!!!!  Yep modesty flies out the door during all this!!!!

My concern is....what if I had gotten this instead of the report that said there was something there.......I wonder how many times this happens.  I know we are only human and mistakes are always made but when it comes to our lives then there is just no excuse for that....... Oh and another thing about the side affects of this radiation......I was checking out my poor boob cuz it's so red and has all these cute baby blue marks on it.....then I noticed.....I look like I had a boob job but could only pay for 1!!!!!  The boob that is getting the radiation is getting HUGE!!!!!  I mean it is very noticible!!!!  Starting to feel like a cow that needs to be milked!!! I saw the Rad. Dr. today and told him about the itching and he said to start off with cortaid or something with 1% cortesone and then if it gets any worse he will write me a prescription.  Hope everyone is having a good evening!
