I hope it lasts until next one. Now I am just wondering if I will have more or different SE after the next one and if I will feel more tired. Also worried if I will ever experiencing any bone marrow problems and will have to be hospitalized for infection somewhere along the whole process. But we will all hope for the best. No hair falling off yet and and I am also going to a Look Good Feel Better class. candy14510: We have similar diagnosis and the same treatment. I am set up for radiation after A/C and taxol. Then herceptin for a year. Good luck! Warm hugs to you all!",

The light headedness could be dehydration and have you been eating enough today. I get lightheaded since chemo if I dont drink and eat regularly. If you have any question at all, you should call the hospital. They told me to call 24/7 if I had any questions (I live in Iceland). If you are worried about the wound site being infected you should watch your temperature. Contact the hospital if you have 100.4°F or higher. Hope this helps. Best to all, Steinunn ",

I have been feeling normal the second and third week after first A/C. I had my 2nd tx this morning and all went smooth. I was a lot more relaxed than the first time and almost felt comfortable!!!! I hope I dont get used to this (lol). It took 4 hours and my mom was with me. Hair loss: on day 15 I noticed some hair on my shoulders so I cut it very short (1-3cm). Then on day 19 (yesterday) it was all over my pillow and I shaved it off (1-3mm). It was not as much shock as I expected (still a little shock) but I was kinda releived it was over with and I dont have to think about it any more. Yes Candy, invite your boss to meet us all! Good luck with your 2nd treatment. Good thoughts to you all! The chemo will end one day, I guess... Steinunn",

I have felt completely normal (physically) since day 5 and had no problem taking care of my three children 14, 11 and 2 year old alone though my husband has been away alot for 2 or 3 days at a time. But he will always get the first 5 days off when I have my treatments, so I am lucky. If it helps someone these are the medication I take to help me get through this:I have Zolpidem (Stilnoct) for sleeping and I sleep very well. Good sleeping and rest I think are the biggest factors that helps the body (bone marrow) to heal (and protein). I take Alprazolam (Tafil) everyday for anxiety. I am a little concerned about taking it everyday and I am going to talk to my doctor about it. When I started chemo my onc. doctor put me on omeprazol for indigestive problem as a prevention, cause I have a history of upset stomach. So no problems there so far. And of course I had the steroids (Dexamethason) and 3 Zofran a day for the first three days.  I got Metoclopramid (Primperan) for nausea that I can take any time but I think I felt kinda wierd, tired and restless. Has any had side effects from Primperan?  Susie: My nurse told me that WBcells go down the first 10 days and then they start to go up again, so she told me to be careful the first 10 days and not be in a crowd of people or go to the swimming pool due to infection risk and of course rest and eat protein. And I do not have a port and they have no problems with my vains so far.  Thanks for sharing and supporting, Steinunn  ",

No nausea and the heaviness in my limbs gone. I guess its due to edema caused by steroids. They told me the steroids go fast out of your body, but I am taking more to day so I´ll see how the evening turns out. I also have this pale yellow/grey skin color.  Still waiting for some terrible sickness, but focusing on still feeling well and almost normal. I am a RNurse but had very little knowledge of BC. Just remember we all react to chemo in different way. Some people are very sick lying in bed all the time with all kinds of complications (rare cases) and some feel no SE at all. And then there is all between and very different days. So lets prepare for the unexpected either way and just see what each day brings. (Easier said than done). Hugs, Steinunn",

Herceptin starts with the Taxol and lasts for a year! That sounded for ever but now I´ll take one step at time. My most concern with chemo is taking care of my active 2 year old boy, that I sometimes find difficult while healthy! He has daycare and I am not working (yes I can rest alot) and his sisters are 11 and 14 and I have wonderful relatives and friends I know will help. I am married but my husband is often away in the afternoon and evenings. Even nights and weekend. I am dreading making dinner while feeling nauseus. Funny, I had cancer and my main concern is making dinner. I love it when I can worry about the little things! Good luck to all!",

I am experiencing a rollercoster of emotions about starting chemo. Sometimes it scares me to death and I just dont want to do it. In between I am ok with it and really believe I will be fine. I take anxiety and sleeping pills and they help alot (I dont like taking drugs at all!). I worry also alot about the nausea but I am starting to believe the anti-nausea drugs will make it tolerable. I have chemo class tomorrow (dont want to go there either) and then 1st treatment on wed. My husband is going with me and he is also scared to death! But we are going to do this and with as much help as is possible. I hope we can support eachother on this forum. We will get through this. Steinunn",

I joined this wonderful support center for people that have been diagnosed with cancer and they offer yoga class and all kinds of activities. Junebug40: Good luck for your first A/C, it was much easier for me than I could have imagined after all the fear I had. I am also obsessing about my hair and just want to get rid of it now. But I dont think I have the guts yet. I have some nice hats but the thought of a wig freaks me out. Lets see what the future brings.. So I am off to yoga class! Thoughts to you all, Steinunn ",
