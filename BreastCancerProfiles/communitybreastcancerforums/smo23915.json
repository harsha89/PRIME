Yes, I went to MD Anderson for a second opinion and the ON- a female very nice told me: my prognosis is excellent, I have a low risk tumor and am in the best prognostic group for having breast cancer.  She said I could try it and just stop if I have SE.  John Hopkings told me try it and if I have \"any\" SE even little just stop it.  I have started taking it and so far the only side effect has been: head aches, insomnia, and dry skin but I told myself I will stick with it for a coupld months and see what happens. When I saw one of the ON here in Michigan and I told him about the insomnia and he looked at me and said, \"just stop it.\"  No discussion he was ok with it.  I have a friend who has a bigger tumor, node involvement (7) and HER 2 positive and they told her no discussion she \"must\" take it. So, in a way I feel good knowing we have a choice and they told me it will also help my bones & I have low bone density.
