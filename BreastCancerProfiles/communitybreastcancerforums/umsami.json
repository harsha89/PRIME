When I had my first abnormal mammo, I remember reading an article about a study in Scandinavia (I think) that showed an increase in breast cancers with hormonal IUDs like Mirena...but....I don't think you had it long enough to be an issue.",

      "Content": "umsami wrote: So last fall, I had a screening which showed something weird on my left breast. I ended up getting a diagnostic 3D mammo and u/s (only on the left breast). The area of concern was actually just a lymph node that was a little bit in an unusual place, but when they compared previous films, it was fine. But with the u/s they found some cysts and fluid under the nipple they wanted to follow. So I went back after 6 months this week, and the cyst had turned complex, and now they want to do a biopsy. The thing is, nobody has ever done an u/s of my right breast in that timeframe. I'm assuming if I have dense breast tissue, then both breasts are dense. Are they not doing an u/s on the right because insurance won't cover it or is it just because of protocol based on the screening? I find it weird because the mammo didn't find the problems we're following in the first place. Should I push for an u/s of my right or wait another 6 months when I'm assuming they'll do it as part of my annual mammo? Log in to post a reply",

In the meantime, you might want to see a gynecologist or your GP regarding your missed period. Are you very thin or an athlete which could affect your cycles? Have you ever gone this long without having a period? Have you done a pregnancy test? If you don't have a gynecologist, Planned Parenthood (in the US) does well women gynecological checks. If you're in college, most student health orgs will do them as well. Hoping everything turns out O.K,",
