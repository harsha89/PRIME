At 20 I noticed shooting pains and a burning sensation on my left side and found a grape sized lump. Doctors did an ultrasound and then a biopsy and said it was a fibroadenoma. Since the pain was so intense the doctors recommended I have it removed, so I did. Recently I felt a similar random shooting and burning pain in the same general area as where the fibroadenoma was removed. I didn't think much about it since I couldn't find a lump like I did before, but I tracked the pain to see if it came and went with my cycles. Last week I went for my yearly physical and mentioned this pain to my PCP, and explained that I have been tracking when the pain comes and it is very much random. During my breast exam she felt something she thought might be a lymph node. I explained that the pain was reminiscent of the fibroadenoma years ago and she said whatever she felt did not feel like a fibroadenoma. She sent me to get a diagnostic ultrasound. I had the ultrasound today, and this could be me editorializing, but the doctor who did my ultrasound seemed almost annoyed that I was there - I am too young and breast pain is not cancer. I explained that I have a family history, past benign breast issues and I was here because my doctor found something she wanted looked at. After a quick look in the area mentioned by my PCP in her note she stated nothing was there and I could relax, wear a bra to bed and drink less caffeine but if I wanted to risk the extra radiation I could have a mammogram today. I felt extremely uncomfortable, so I have decided to talk to my PCP before pursuing. I am wondering, has anyone experienced this kind of pain after a breast surgery? Could my pain be just nerve pain?

I don't remember how long my ultrasound was last time this was done, but every other one I have ever had has seemed much longer? Waiting to hear back from my PCP re: Mammogram",
