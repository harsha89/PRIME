Yesterday was my last day of chemo and cold caps. I lost approx 25% of my hair but hard to tell because it was all over, no concentrated areas. It is much more layered in the back now, broken off I guess. 6 months to wait until I can get the blonde on the roots, but it was so worth it. My avatar was from yesterday, post cold capping and chemo. MO ask which company I used. He has another patient interested too. Feels soooooo good to be done",
