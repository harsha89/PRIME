She was able to feel the lump without me having to show her where, she listened to me and she cared. She heard me. She's not overly concerned but said she definitely needs to have a better look and due to my dense breasts is scheduling an ultrasound. Hope everyone is able to have a blessed and happy Thanksgiving!!",

Too embarrassed to pursue it any further. Started having some weird sensations in breast so went to GP, had a well woman check today and she could feel the lump. It really is there and not just in my imagine. It\u2019s bigger than it used to be but not gigantic. I would think if it was a tumor it would have grown considerably in the last 6 years. So I\u2019m reassured by that and weirdly relieved that she could feel it and it hasn\u2019t been all in my head this whole time. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from the hospital for my mammo appt.

      "Content": "K_Lee wrote: Sooooo, almost 6 years ago I was here because I found what I believed to be a lump on my left breast (I re-read my old posts from back then and seen I had said it was my right. I was feeling it with my right hand so my brain told me right breast, lol!). Anywho, I was convinced, I mean already-had-my-treatment-plan-how-I-was-going-to-tell-my-family-write-my-children-and-husband-goodbye-letters-just-in-case- kind of convinced it was cancer. After fretting and worrying and preparing for a couple months I went to see a BS just knowing he was going to want to do a biopsy on the spot after he felt my \"lump\". My appointment lasted a little over 5 minutes, he did a quick feel of my breast and said, there's nothing there. I have never in my life felt more foolish. In fact as I'm writing this I can feel my face turning red with embarrassment. He was so quick and dismissive that I wanted to fall into a hole. Luckily I had only shared my fears with my husband and didn't have to tell my whole family what a hypochondriac I had turned out to be. I was 34 at the time so he told me in a couple years I should get a baseline mammo done and have a nice day. He didn't even feel like I needed a mammo at that time so one was never ordered/done. He is the expert and came highly recommended so I felt if he doesn't feel anything then there is absolutely no way there is anything there. I went home feeling like a fool and never checked the spot again. I avoided that area like it was an open boil because the thought of feeling around looking for a lump filled me with shame and embarrassment. Fast forward 6 years. About a month ago I started having a sensation in my left breast. Not really a pain or discomfort, just an awareness that I had a boob there. I seen someone on here describe their feeling like a breast full of milk right before let down and I thought YES! That's exactly it. I was thrilled to finally have something to compare it to and why it was a familiar sensation. I have been having this feeling daily but not constantly for a month or so now. I finally worked up the courage to mention it to my GP while I was there for an unrelated appointment. She scheduled me for a well woman exam and said following that she would schedule me for a screening mammo. After talking with her I decided the time had come to see if that lump that's not a lump is still there and yep, it is. And it's bigger. Not hugely larger but a definite increase in size. I honestly have not touched it in the last 6 years so I don't know if it just started growing or if its been super slowly growing this whole time. I still don't have enough confidence that what I am feeling is actually a lump and not just normal breast tissue disguised as a lump to point it out to my doctor. I will say that when I am soapy and I run my hand over the area it feels like a speed bump. I would think if it was the big bad C it would be huge after 6 years and not just somewhat larger. Anyway, that's my story. Appointment Monday with mammogram to follow soon after. I should add that obviously I was thrilled and elated that the BS didn\u2019t feel there was anything to worry about. Under the embarrassment I felt light and free. My concern is 6 years later it, whatever it is, is still there and bigger. What if it is something and I\u2019ve ignored it for 6 years Log in to post a reply",
