My skin was OK till this last week when it started burning; especially where they took the lymph nodes from under my arm...tis sore and very very red.   Am using a combination of Silvadene for the chest area and Xerofoam pads for under the arm.   I am trying to work through this...not sure how it will last though.   More than fatique, it is getting painful.    Take care everyone Emily xxx",

Today was the last session of regular rads for me.. WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! I have 7 more sessions left, out of 35, which will be boosters to the scar.  So tell me, has anyone else experience incredible frustration around the drawings?   The rad onc and the techs drew on me today, with a blue marker.  I really dont get it.   They tell you to steer clear of fragrance, anything remotely chemical, then DRAW on you?????  I spoke up when they put indigo ink in me with a tatt.  Really.    So I went home with blue smeared all over the inside of my camisole.  My chest is raw and red and burning...I dabbed it all off.   I am sure if it is important they can redraw it on Monday...but a whole weekend with all that toxic stuff on me, I dont think so.....  sorry to complain...it is getting close to the end.  All I can think of is eventually NO ONE will look at my chest unless I want them to!! What a thought.... take care....",

I use the Xeroform pads at night, but silverdene during the day.   They looked at my skin t oday and said it would be a day by day decision as to whether to continue or give me a break.  Personally, I want to get this done!   Haven't had any serious side effect, although I feel a tingling and sparks in my arm once and a while...either I'm losing it entirely or my nerve endings are getting touchy...let's hope the latter. Countdown....25 down, 10 to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Was doing very well for a few weeks but last week I started to get sore and red.   Especially under my arm.   Started out using Aloe Vera (pure) and then switched to SilverDene.  Now that there are parts of the area getting red and sore, am using Xerofoam pads just for under the arm.  It is essentially a cloth soaked in medicated petroleum jelly type substance.  Its soothing but messy! Reading all your posts has helped me - thanks! Emily",

I have decided to take it a day at a time, otherwise I dont know how I could manage the drive to work (1.5 hrs) and then to Rads (1.0) each day.   Its another half hour to get home, but that's easy. How does everyone handle putting the meds on during work?   I use the SilverDene in the morning, then the pads after Rads and again at night.  Today I steathily went into ladies room and hid in the handicapped stall (its bigger than the others) and put on the SilverDene. Geez, felt like the Maxwell Smart of Get Smart tv show, but the skin gets dried out and tight without something. oh well.  jan - thanks for the book title...I will do a search on Amazon.  hope you are each having a good day.  Emily xxx",
