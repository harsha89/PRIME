There are so many things like lymph node and vascular involvement and margins that you won't know about for sure until after you get the final pathology after surgery.  You want to make treatment decisions based on the full picture, including your age and other health issues, not just the preliminary results from the biopsy.  My tumor was highly hormone receptor positive, and HER positive.  There was no node involvement or vascular involvement.  I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have also lost a significant amount of weight since diagnosis which lowers the volume of hormone that my body stores.  I decided that for me, my best shot at keeping this from coming back or spreading elsewhere in my body was to start taking Tamoxifen as soon as possible.  I chose not to do chemotherapy and Herceptin since that would have delayed my ability to start taking Tamoxifen, and I have other health issues that put me at increased risk of significant long term damage from the chemotherapy.  If this does come back, I still have Herceptin available in my arsenal.  I know that I made the right decision for me, but I also realize that the decision that I made is not the right one for everyone. If your tumor is not strongly hormone receptor positive, you may not get the same benefit from Tamoxifen, and especially in that case, you might want to consider the chemo and Herceptin.  There are also a variety of chemo agents with varying side effects (and other drugs to counteract those side effects) that can be used with Herceptin, so you and your oncologist may be able to find a combination that you feel confident about. There is a test called the Oncotype DX that uses material from your tumor, and can tell you how much benefit you personally are likely to get from the various treatment combinations, and can help you make those treatment decisions. You need to gather as much information as possible, especially about the specific combination of treatments being proposed for you and their actual benefit, not just their relative benefit, before you make any decisions because I agree with NanA that you need to be sure that you can live with your decision without regrets.",

Have you gotten a second opinion?  A third? Was any other treatment plan discussed? Checked out this calculator? http://www.lifemath.net/cancer/breastcancer/therapy/index.php Breast cancer in older women tends to be slow growing.  Slow growing cancers are less likely to be affected by chemo than more aggressive ones.  It sounds like quality of life is just as important as quantity of life to your Mom.  Check out the chemo threads dealing with her chemo cocktail, and the timeline threads that started at least six or eight months ago to find out what kind of side effects (both short term and long term) your Mom can expect.  She deserves to be fully informed before starting chemo.",

I believe that gist of Fairyfloss' post was about feeling betrayed by her doctor not telling her about some of the possible consequences of chemotherapy, and hoping to keep others from being blindsided by this information after the fact. Warning people about specific issues with natural products and supplements is probably most effectively done on the alternative threads, and warning them about possible hazards with chemotherapy is probably most effectively done on the chemotherapy threads.  Attacking others for having different opinions is probably best done away from these boards, or better yet, not done at all. ",

The only significant hair issues I've seen there are related to the chemo that many of the women had before they started on Tamoxifen.  Ask your pharmacist for a printout of the information that is included with a Tamoxifen prescription.  Your doctor will give you general information about benefits, risks and side effects, but a pharmacist is a much better source for specifics on this drug.  The benefits are much clearer for women who have already been diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer than for someone taking it to prevent an initial diagnosis.  The side effects and risks are the same.  You need to decide if your current risk of breast cancer is great enough to justify taking a medication for 5 years to prevent it.  I wish you confidence in your decison, and that you never get the breast cancer diagnosis that you are trying to avoid. ",

Some diseases like measles confer immunity from future illness, cancer does not.  That doesn't mean it wasn't cured.  If you get pneumonia, are cured, and get it again twenty years later, no one thinks that you have had pneumonia for twenty years, although there may be a suspicion that you are more susceptible to it than the general population.  Stage IV cancer is different.  There is treatment, but no cure.  People with stage IV can achieve remission, sometimes for a long period of time, but they are not cured.  Yet.  That is what we need to work to change in our lifetimes.",

How old were your mother, aunts, grandmother when they were diagnosed?  That should give you a basic idea of timing for yourself.  You definitely want to make your decision at least a few years (preferably 10) before the youngest age at which a close relative was diagnosed.  I am in a very different situation than you are.  I had invasive cancer in one breast, and pre-cancerous changes in the other.  My children are adults, and I was long done with breastfeeding.  I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate implants in March.  I am very happy with the results, but I still get twinges when I move too quickly and stretch too far.  I am also aware that not everyone has the kind of results that I do.  There is a time for everything.   The time to worry about the future is still in the future.  I am one who is hopeful that by the time you (and my daughter and my niece) are old enough to need to worry about developing breast cancer there will be a cure, or even better, something easy and effective (and less drastic than mastectomy) to prevent it.  If not, you can always make the decision to have the surgery when it is right for you.  For now, appreciate the fact that your suspicious lump was benign, enjoy your wedding, and start your new life.   ",

You will want to keep a close watch on your blood glucose levels as you go through the process of diagnosis and treatment.  Everything from stress, to the biopsy itself, to antibiotics and pain relievers, to chemo and the steriods given with chemo, and hormonal treatments that Julie mentioned as well as Tamoxifen can cause those levels to fluctuate, so you should have a plan of action for monitoring and treating those fluctuations in place with the physician who deals with your diabetes as you move through the next months.  It helps that you are starting off with your levels in a stable situation since keeping them close to \"normal\" will help with all of the healing processes. Right now, you need to find a good breast surgeon, and a good oncologist.  Once you find one of them, they will help you build your team.  It may help to deal with a facility that specializes in breast health or cancer treatment.  It will probably take a few weeks to schedule an appointment, and get to the point of biopsy.  The radiologist was probably just trying to ease your mind that the wait to get to that point should not make any difference in the outcome, rather than encouraging you to wait before making the appointment.  The diabetes increases your risk of cardiac issues and neuropathy among many others.  If you find that it is cancer, the diabetes may impact the types of treatment you can receive since your risk of some side effects will be higher than the \"typical\" patient, changing the risk/benefit ratio for you.  Like so much of life, take this one step at a time and keep moving forward.  Hoping for B9 results, Pat",

There are no guarantees in breast cancer treatment, and anyone who tells you that there are is lying to you. Do your research, and then research some more, especially look at the long term and short term side effects of every specific drug or treatment being proposed for you.  Realize that some chemotherapies can actually increase your risk of developing other cancers.  Take into consideration any other conditions that may be pre-existing or that you may be at risk for due to environment or family history that may be triggered by or exacerbated by a particular treatment or it's side effects.  Then honor yourself, make the decision that lets you sleep at night, and don't let anyone bully you into or out of a treatment that you believe is the right course for you.",

I had no trouble healing from the surgery, no trouble with infection, and I had immediate reconstruction with silicone implants, no expanders since the implants are smaller than what I started with, and I had a skin sparing mastectomy.   The drains were the worst part of the experience...they didn't hurt at first, but as time went on they pulled at the stich holding them in place with every breath.   Keep your arms still, and you won't have as much drainage, so they will come out faster, hopefully before they start hurting.   I've lost over 50 lbs in the past year, and I feel great.  My last A1-C was 6.0, but I take metformin, watch my diet, and exercise.  My fasting blood glucose readings still aren't where I want them to be (where a person without diabetes is), but in general, I don't get the huge swings of highs and lows.  I found that when I started the Tamoxifen, my readings went up about 20 points consistently, and that the dose of metformin that I'm on brings them down about 20 points consistently, so I'm hoping that when I go off the Tamoxifen, I'll be able to stop the metformin too.  Let us know how your surgery goes....we'll be praying for you.",

Lymph nodes are removed to help in staging, not as treatment.  Recent studies seem to indicate that it makes no difference in treatment outcome whether they stay or are removed.     Chances are that your mom knows at least a bit more about her situation than she is sharing with you.  Even when our kids are adults, we try to shield them as much as possible.  She also may need time to recover from the surgery itself, and process the situation of the chemo not getting all of the cancer before she is able to share specifics with you.  I needed to know the whole situation and deal with it myself before I was ready to tell my adult kids. I learned that my daughter's imagination of  what was going on was far worse than the reality, so now I try to keep her in the loop as much as possible without going into overwhleming detail, but sometimes we don't know the whole story yet, so we really can't share.  ",

It is overwhelmingly likely that the hip pain is a result of the broken leg.  If the rod isn't exactly the perfect fit it will cause pressure on the rest of the leg, and favoring the one leg puts more of a stress on the other leg and the joints associated with it.  It's not like you have a sedentary job either, so that may be part of the equation. The surgical recommendations to deal with the BRCA status are just that.  You have had that mutation all along, and it has not suddenly become an emergency situation just because you are aware of it now.  Trust your instincts about how to proceed.  They have been accurate in the past.  You will know what to do, it's just a matter of getting your head into the right frame of mind to deal with it.  We all know that you can get through whatever life throws at you.  .   Enjoy your vacation.  Put cancer out of your mind and life as much as possible until you get back.  Once you get back, settle in, and everyone has figured out the normal routine for the coming school year, start dealing with the doctors again.",

Since this is work related, you should be able to enlist the help of your co-workers to practice throwing the ball far enough to get to home plate and the catcher's mitt.  Concentrate on the action, not on who is around you. You'll recognize the catcher, he's the guy wearing lots of padding and a cage over his face.

Maybe some of the supports that are now built into the situation with Amanda having a job rather than 24 hour responsibility for the two kids no money of her own, and both kids in a daycare/school will help.  If they are not enough, isn't it better to find out sooner rather than later? If they can get through the stress of the holiday season intact, they stand a chance long term.  If they can't, would you really want those kids to still be in limbo at this time next year? There will never be a good time to reunite them with parents who have messed up in the past. ",
