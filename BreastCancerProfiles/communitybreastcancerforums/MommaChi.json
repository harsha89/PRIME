You all have been so great to hear from and I really appreciate your post it helps to hear from others who have been through this since I don't know anyone who has. Good luck to all of us and our families. Love, Janet",

My daughter has been great, especially since we just lost my husband and my daughter is devistated to have lost her Dad and now have me diagnosed. Since no other female in my family has ever had breast cancer I am wondering that my 2 half sisters (we have the same mother) are they at a higher risk? One is 4 years older than me and the other is 12 years older than me, I am 49. This is all new to me since I was just diagnosed and see the oncologist for my first time on the 9th.
