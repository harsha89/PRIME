Now, I am waiting for MRI for right breast just to make sure nothing is wrong with right side. Recently, I felt the lump definitiely got bigger to about 3cm. I am very worried now but I need to wait for another week or so for the test and results. Has anyone exprienced the size of lump getting bigger? Does this signal anything? Log in to post a reply",

I read an article that it is much better to get the surgery within one month after biopsy. So, I am really worried becuase it wil take another 2 weeks to get the MRI biopsy result. Is there anyone who waited for surgery more than one month after biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
