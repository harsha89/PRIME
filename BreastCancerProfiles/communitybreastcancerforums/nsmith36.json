They had to do spot compressions where the breast tissue was dense.The Drs called me back many times to \" get a better look\" even in my 20's. I was diagnosed in 2007 with breast cancer. After much Chemo and Raiation I and am happy to report that I am getting ready to celebrate my 5 years of survival.  Please try not to worry for it won't change a thing and it will just make you crazy.    ",

My office had snacks, special hand kniitted blankets etc. Look around cause you don't HAVE to go to that place. The nurses need to make you feel at ease as much as possible. If you don't get a good feeling about it go somewhere else if you can or at least visit some others. .",
