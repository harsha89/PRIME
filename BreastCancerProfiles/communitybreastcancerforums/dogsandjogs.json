I also had a chest x-ray which showed subsegmental \"something\" which apparently means a part of the lung is collapsed for some unknown reason. The diagnosis said COPD. Copies of the various reports from the ER were sent to both my primary doctor and my cardiologist. I am waiting for my insurance to ok a stress/echo, but neither doctor has mention the lung issue and it is possible they haven't even read the report either. The ER doctor didn't bring it up; just said to see my doctor for follow-up. I am wondering - could this be mets to the lung? How do they look on an x-ray? A friend has suggested I see a pulmonary specialist. Have not told my family as I don't want to worry them. I have no shortness of breath - jog/walk for several hours daily so how could I have COPD. It is a complete mystery----the pain is now pretty much gone - just recurs now and then when I'm stressed so this could just be all in my mind. Any suggestions? Thanks!

The fracture healed, the meniscus (cartilage) you just have to deal with --the Baker's Cyst is not dangerous and also goes away in time.  The debris can be taken care of with a \"scope\" if it is painful.
