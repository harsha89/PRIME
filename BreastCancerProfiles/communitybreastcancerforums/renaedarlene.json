Trying to do everything I can to feel empowered prior to going into this chapter.  I would love to hear stories of what others are doing to prepare for the big C-Day.  My greatest fear was my long hair falling out in chunks.  I've taken the advice of others and got my hair cut short.  Just received a list necessities pre-chemo from my cousin who also reads this site that is extremely helpful.  Who would have thought that we should have a new germless toothbrush?? I would have never thought of that.  Anyone that has any other ideas to share, would love to hear them.  Love and Peace, ~Renae~ My latest post is \"It's Only Hair!\" goodnewscolumn.blogspot.com.  Trying to find the silver lining during each chapter.   Renae Wilber Dx 11/7/2011, IDC, Right, 1cm, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
