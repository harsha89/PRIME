    "Content": "Apr 10, 2011 09:14PM - edited Apr 10, 2011 09:16PM by wishImay Totally normal.  Your life has changed.  Big time.  You have many questions and are not yet in a position to get all the answers.  They will come in time.   I just had surgery for DCIS and was hospitalized shortly after for an infection, but have had other surgeries and chronic illnesses.  Any illness and surgery throws your current \"normal\" up the air.  If you have a close friend or confidant, an intimate husband or therapist, see if you can begin to talk about the things you fear, one by one.  Don't go into the whole ocean of fear.  Just allow yourself to take one small step at a time.  But my sense is that in general, a big surgery like the one you've had is gonna knock you for a loop (you're also coming down from the anesthesia and possibly pain meds, which change mood big time) and you need some time and answers to normalize your life, although your life will be different.   On the other hand, this may be tapping into something deeply personal about a loss you've suffered (beyond this one...you do know this was a loss?).  You may need to grieve.  Whatever it is, it is normal.  ",
