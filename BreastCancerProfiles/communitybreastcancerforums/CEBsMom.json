The nurse left me a voice mail but by the time I called her back she was gone for the day.    I also asked for a copy of my labs--my baseline were normal, but on the day of my chemo (before I got the chemo) my BUN and Creat were high and Na and Cl were low.  These labs generally reflect kidney function.  This is BEFORE the chemo.  I've gone back for two CBCs and they've not anymore Chem 20s to check BUN and Creat again.  I'm really confused and really, really scared.",

Told her about my 'buzz cut' that a wore for a few days and then we laughed.  I promptly changed the subject.  Got my second wig in the mail.  Don't think I'm going that route.  Have spent over $200 on them and still don't have anything. Found a couple of cute hats and scarves I can wear to work, so I guess I'm going wigless!  Well, I guess I'm thru whining for the evening... Blessing on all of you--I think about you guys often!!!
