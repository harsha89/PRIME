I finished chemo mid April but am now going to get my bilateral mastectomy in a couple of weeks followed by 6 weeks (tbc) rads beginning mid July. I'm wondering if anyone has had tissue expanders in them WHILE getting rads? I'm almost confirmed to be getting the bilateral with partial recon done at the same time so as to avoid another major surgery and being put under again. I've been to three plastics surgeons and two said that nothing could be done for me and I should come back in a year after all rads completed and they'd see what they can do for me! But then they didn't tell me what was available! In their opinion, I was only suited for the DIEP recon method which uses autologous tissue to transplant, however they also said I didn't have enough fat to make an \"a\" or even maybe a small \"b\" ! Im currently a DD! an \"a\" would not work for me and the risk of the surgery too great in my opinion. (12 hr surgery, 3-5 day in hospital stay, major scar at tummy with potential for infection, as well as rejection of skin transfer plus infection at the breast sites) i want to be smaller but not that small on my frame. This is why I reached a third plastic surgeon to get his opinion. He said my two options were to do the lat flap ( I'd rather not lose the use and mobility of my right arm and back strength), or tissue expanders where he'd insert them in at the time of mastectomies and then fill them weekly until rad are to be measured and tattooed. After all rads are done and I am 4 months minimum out of healing, the implant exchange would take place. Stretching the skin out AFTER rads is too risky. Anyone doing the tissue expander before rads method? or had this done?",

I was wondering if you have had any difficulties with the tissue expanders? Complications? Advice? How many cc's did you get for how many fills before starting rads? Have rads affected the healing at all? Any capsular contraction yet? Btw, what's an infusion room? Are you still on herceptin? Thank you to all of the welcomes ladies!",
