      "Content": "dianee3 wrote: I had a unilateral mastectomy five years ago. They reconstruction process was started, but ended up failing due to radiation. I have chosen not to wear a breast form. I am small breasted and found the mastectomy bra and form heavy and uncomfortable. I am learning to feel comfortable being lopsided, but it is still difficult when people notice. No one has ever said anything, thank goodness. I just wear the bras I wore before surgery. Does anyone else do this? I feel as though I am alone in what I have chosen to do. Thanks for your support!
