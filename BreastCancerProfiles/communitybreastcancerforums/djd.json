Anyway, two people were sitting next to each other on a plane and started talking.  One was on her way to say goodbye to a young relative who was in a coma after a motorcycle accident before they pulled the plug on life support. The second person was on her way to visit a relative who was on his deathbed, in desperate need of some organ (I can't remember which one).  The reason they hadn't found a donor yet was because he had a rare blood type or something like that. They started making calls on the airplane phones and learned that the both of their relatives had the same blood type, etc.,  They frantically called family members and doctors several times during the flight.  By the time the plane landed, all the wheels were in motion to get the organ from the young man who was coming off life support to transplant in the other one who was running out of time. It was an amazing story and they had the transplant receipient on the show, along with both families.  Everyone involved remarked that it was clearly divine intervention from the heavens. Anyway, your story reminded me of that, and I have a sense of peace and hope for you.",

The odds of getting the entire family on one plane are quite slim, especially given the  state of the economy and the effect that gas prices are having on the airlines. I would recommend taking the approach of getting all the family there, one way or the other, on the same day and leaving on the same day.  But don't count on getting everyone traveling on the same airline/flight, etc., I say we keep collecting the $$ and any miles, regardless of airline, and then see what there is to work with, and go from there. I feel really bad that LuAnn has so much on her plate already and is trying to manage this effort.  So, I will help however I can, if I can.",

Like TheresaPW, Diane3Strikes, and way too many other sisters we have stood with as they began the next leg of this journey, you have been such a role model for being at peace with God and accepting God's will.  We will miss you, and we will pray for your family to find a way to cope at this awful time. I'm also praying that your journey to heaven will be glorious. Through tears, Donna ",
