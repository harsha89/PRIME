I agree ... get all the information you can and look at your individual situation realistically to make your decisions.       ",

I do think that being able to see physically that it was working made it easier to put up with the side effects.  And after the first treatment I knew what to expect and could prepare and plan accordingly. I'm concerned about some of the stuff I'm seeing on the board lately because I think some of it is dangerous.  I've read some comments about chemo being a sledgehammer when a flyswatter would do ... but I think the old cliche about not bringing a slingshot to a gun fight is more applicable.  YMMV   My oncologist is one of the ones who gives the chemo drugs in her office facility.  I do want to mention that she did not recommend that I do any more chemo after surgery.  I think if it was all about profit for her ... as some here have suggested ... she would have recommended doing one of the Taxol type drugs also and she did not. Cancer is not some fuzzy little thing to be played around with.  It is capable of much much worse than any chemo side effects in my opinion.   I'm glad I did it.      ",

What I did find was women sharing their own experiences and confirming that they had done it and got through it and that I could do it too.  And sharing their side effects also ... which gave me an idea of what to prepare for.

ETA ... LOL.  A lot can happen while you are writing oh so seriously :)  My clinic will feature cats.  Their tongues will do a much better job of removing any impurities and their purrs have been proven to reduce stress.            ",

ETA:  Answered my own question ... www.burtongoldberg.com/   Seems he has a Doctor of Humanities Hon. - from Capital University of Integrated Medicine.  I think the Hon. part means he didn't study there they just honored him with it.  ",
