Now I will be having a second lymph node surgery next week to take out some Axillary Nodes (level 1 and 2) as they were not able to find the Sentinel Nodes during my Sentinel Node biopsy (took one node anyway, which was clear, but most likely wasn't a Sentinel Node). I tried to find ways around having this surgery, but it looks like I will be going through with it. Anyway, I sleep on my side (alternating several times during the night), and I do put pressure on my shoulders and sometimes my arms. Does anybody know if this is a bad idea in terms of causing or possibly causing LE? And if it isn't good to sleep on my side, are there things I could do to make it a little better? There was one night after my first surgery where I slept on that side and my arm was tingly in the morning (but it went away). I really can't sleep on my back as it bothers my back, and I doubt I would be able to stick to just one side. Thank you!

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2013 10:11PM - edited Aug 24, 2013 10:30PM by Shira Thank you everyone for the informative and helpful replies.  This site is a wealth of information! Reading and thinking a bit more, and going with my gut instinct, I feel like I would not be able to make a decision to have a mastectomy without more of a diagnostic reason to have one, especially since my primary reason for doing it would be to avoid radiation and the estrogen blocking medications, and it sounds like sometimes people still have to have/take those even with a mastectomy.  I am also glad that the lupectomy will give me additional results rather quickly, where researching the option of a mastectomy would slow the node biopsy (and margins diagnosis?) down.  I do feel like I am at a good (great) hospital with a competent doctor, and maybe if I had listened to doctors in the first place (I waited to get my first mammogram until I was 49!), they would have caught this even earlier.   So, I will go ahead with the Lumpectomy, but before I take radiation, medications, etc., I may get a second opinion, and I can meet with a genetic counselor afterwards if I would like to (no bc or ovarian cancer in my family but I am Jewish so it's possible I could test positive). So, thank you and I will keep reading!  Any additional thoughts are welcome! Shira P.S. Bessie, thanks for clarifying!  When I was mentioning the two choices, what I meant was that one choice was that I could have Lumpectomy and no radiation (with or without the estrogen blocking medications), but this is not what the doctor was recommending, just that taking or not taking the medications and/or having radiation is a personal decision.  ",

      "Content": "Shira wrote: Hello.  Everything is moving fast and I am confused, however, lurking on this forum has been helpful! I waited to have my first mammogram until I was 49 (no breast cancer in my familiy and thought I was so smart avoiding the \"uneccesary\" radiation).  This mammogram led to a second, which showed something suspicious, so I then had an ultrasound, needle biopsy, and after the results came back with IDC grade 1, 1.1cm, I also had an MRI, which luckily did not show anything more. So, I met with the surgeon today, and he said that the next step would be a Lumpectomy, with a node biopsy, and then radiation and estrogen (blocking?) medication (I am +, +. -).  I would like to avoid putting anything in me, so I asked about a mastecomy instead, and he said it was a very drastic (my words not his) procedure for something so small, and it seems like my two real choices are Lumpectomy with radiation (and estrogen blocking medicine), or Lumpectomy without Radiation (assuming the Node Biopsy is negative). He is a general surgeon but is part of a team that deals with Breast Cancer.  Also, he did not think I needed an Onco Test or that I will need Chemo. So my questions are this, is it common for a Lumpectomy/radiation to be recommended as the initial course without considering a mastectomy?  If I get a Lumpectomy now, can I change my mind and get a mastectomy later (and would it still be covered)?  Why might Chemo be recommended to some people with similar diagnosis but not to others?  Might radiation help short term survival more than long-term?  Should I have gotten a second opinion?  I cancelled one today and was planning to re-schedule once the node biopsy results come in.

      "Content": "Oct 6, 2013 05:51PM - edited Oct 6, 2013 05:55PM by Shira Ugh, but thanks....! I keep waiting for someone to give a different answer :-( I can't imagine sleeping only on one side forever! During my pregnancies there was one side that was better to sleep on and I was never able to stick to the better side, and it was a conscious choice as it hurt my shoulder to stay on one side all night. I have slept on my back with my knees propped up but only only for a short time period due to back problems (and I think I was taking muscle relaxants and could have slept anywhere!). I hope this question is ok to ask, but what do people do that have had nodes out on both sides (and sleep on their sides)? I'll search for the other thread as well. Thank you. Shira p.s. Musical, that's what I was thinking of as a last resort, lying on the side I have to be careful on while falling asleep and turning over before I fall asleep. But all the time ending on the same side :-(. isn't easy I'm sure.",

The docs didn't tell me anything about stretching it, being careful with my arm, not to let anyone take blood, or anything remotely related to LE.   They did tell me to be careful not to open the stitches, so I was very careful with my arm, didn't lift my arm or anything that could open the stitches. Well, yesterday my arm started feeling tingly, and under my arm is swollen. It was the first day that I really used my arm all day. But, the incision area looks like a big fat catapillar, and reading this forum, I was wondering if this is what cording looks like, or hopefully it's just normal healing ? I am in the middle of switching doctors, and it's the weekend, so not sure what to do! Thanks!",

Luckily I have been fine with just Tylenol. So, I agree with the people who said to try to get the patch ahead of time, and hopefully it will be manageble.  Good luck!",
