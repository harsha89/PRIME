Any opinions are greatly needed here as I am googling and it doesn't sound too positive... Log in to post a reply",

Glad I found this blog, and know I'll be ok.  God bless to all...Will keep you updated... PS..Does being pre-menstrual or having your period during a biopsy make any difference to the findings??",
