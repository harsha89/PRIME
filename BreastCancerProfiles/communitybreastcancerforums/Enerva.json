I am in Canada and they didnt check my nodes at the time of the surgery, i had to wait 17 days for the p- report to find out one of my nodes was positive, then they wanted to take more and i told them off. I took my chance with Rad. I wish they had checked at the time of my bmx, cause i gave them the ok to take what ever was needed at that time. Anyway just so you know it depends on the circumstances i guess. I freaked out on my BS, but it was nothing i could do she said here they do not test right away, they take the sentinel nodes then send to the lab alone with the tumor. :( ",

I now say it in past tense and soon you will too, and even then people will still look at us as if we are going to die. So i just ignore their looks, it us sad but i now hide it very well. I don't share my bc experience unless I know the person can handle it. Hand in there and remember you are a strong person and this is just another life obstacle which some of us must deal with. ;)  1resiliant I am not going to tell you having the TE feels natural because in my case it feels terrible, it does not move and its very hard as two iron rocks stuck to my chest. Its been almost 9 months and i am still not fan of them. I have been told that the implants will feel so narural i will think they are my own, which its hard to beileve duw to the fact that i am still pretty numb. But anything will be better than the TE. Just be strong and know you can do it. If i endure them 9 months you can have yours for a few months ;) The reason    why its took so long for me is due to Rad. :( Anyway I apologize if i am too honest its just my experience everybody is different, it all depends on how many cc you have in the TE. or how many fills etc. ",

Then when the pathology report came back showing positive margins i had no choice but to take Rad. Then i refused Tamox and so far so good. I am now trying to learn about what can i do to reverse the damage done by Rad. I had my exchange surgery and i was told that Rad made mu muscle extremely thin so i wonder what can i do? Anyway i feel that if margin is positive then Rad can be of benefit. But it is you the individual to decide. Good luck ",

I have figured out that I am not stage II IDC as I had thought but I am clearly am IIIa or IIIb grade 3. I didn't really want to talk about it but realized that by not having a clear margin at the time of surgery and one sentinel node involved was probably pushing me up there. My onco finally told me that yes I am stage IIIA and maybe a IIIB. What ever that means as if I am in between. I was DX last year Oct, finished Chemo in Feb 2013. had NS BMX with immediate reconstruction with TE in March 3013. Rad in June, now waiting to have the final surgery in Dec 24 2013. I am like you very scared of recurrence rates been stage III but I am ready to move on I am so tired and frustrated. I Thanks you all for been there for each other cuz it really means a lot.

For me what worked best was eating carbs in the morning before 9 am and Protein at lunch with Vegetables, then fruits and salads at dinners. in about 3 to 4 months i was 15 lbs lighter and back to looking like the old me ;) I read a book that is called not another diet, which talks about eating all you want but at different times of the day to which we are used to. Its all made sense. All it was is to switch carbs to early during the day. It worked for me, it also helped me with a digesting problem chemo gave me. I was baldly bloated and once i switch my meals around it slowly got better. I am not saying this is the best way just sharing what worked for me. ",

I think maybe if I get a ps to agree to do some fat grafting that may help since the reason for us to feel the plastic implants is due to not having any tisue or fat, we only have the skin at least in my case only skin covering the implants. :( Hope others give their opinion too. Regarding the tightness. It's just horrible I had it bad on the rad breast so bad I had a revision surgery to free the implant. Now it is way less but still way tight compared to the non rad breast.

I always wonder if it is going to be always that way. Is anybody here using silicone implants or anyone has saline, are saline implants cold too. I hear someone say something regarding this but I can't remember who or what exactly they said lol. I also wonder if that contributes to the burning nerve feeling I have. Anyway just wondering. I can't help to think about all the little details and like you say things maybe I did that I should have not done. I like you took care of my mother,  she had dementia and was very hard cuz i got sick and she also got very sick I spend weeks at a hospital with her and she past away right after I finish rad. Last year. Yes there were times I didn't care for me I only focus on mom and I could do it all over again losing her affected me way more than having bc. But you are right I bet I also lifted weigh I was not supposed to wile I was supposed to be resting after mx. Who knows why this bc had to happen.  The other day a lady said people who get c, is most times cuz of the way they are or feel inside. She does not know I had bc,  I just kept walking and ignore her comment. When I got to my car I started to cry. People can hurt me so easy now. I honestly never been a bad person,  I always gave and gave and gave to others never expected anything from the world and then this bc came. Out of no where. Now one of my sister has it too. My point is that we must be very strong and just remember we are not alone and we are not responsible for this. It's just something that happens to some and not real reason or person to blame. Specifically not us. ",

I still burn but not as much and if I take it off it goes backbone hurting. Now I am thinking maybe I should have wear this other bra from the beginning I jistvthought I tell you cuz in case you have different bras try different one.  I found that there is not way for me not to wear a bra it seams I need to have some kind of support 24/7 :( so far I only have two of these bras I will try to buy more. I spend so much on bras that do not give me any confort but these one are doing an amazing job. I bought them cuz a lady on another tread mentioned and now it's really giving me some relief 😌 ",

I don't want you to think I only care about me but I have been let down by doctors so I now realize I am the one with the crap body, I am the one who has no life cuz of the reconstruction results. I just want you to keep going and trying to get it right without thinking of others cuz you need you. Lol get it?  Ha ha hope u don't get me wrong now lol ",

He told me to call her. I called her as soon as I got out of the door lol and left a msg telling her all forms were signed and that i am ready just need her to find me a date as soon as possible.  :( there you go that's how it is here in Canada 🍁 .;)  I have to say I am impressed with him he seams to know exactly what needs to be done. He said the implant she used it's no round one and that's why i lost the fullness of the upper poles. He told me he could look for round implants and then will let me know which one he suggests he has no access to sientra or mentor. I still told him I will need to have the style # and volumes in order to search an have an idea since he has no implants to show me . ANY way  am glad cuz i feel he will do his best to make things better. :)  I asked him about the pockets work to prevent the implant from migrating and he took notes. Asked him about fat grafting and he took notes so he said he will do his best to help prevent the rad side from contracting again by using some fat injections. Overall I feel as if I am in better hands. I will let you know as soon as I hear the date and the implants style and volumes which he will use. ",

I have to tell you that my tumor was on the right side and when the surgeon met me to order the MRI and bone scans plus all other scans i asked her what about my left breast? the S said oh no it is no likely to be a problem in the left breast, there is no way we treat breast individually bla bla bla i demanded the mri to be done in both sides I told her i was not going to do chemo and rad and then in a few years it could be on the left too, and voila they call me to do a biopsy cuz they saw something like dense cells on the left then it turned out i had the same LIC on the left side. So i had NS BMX I wish every body demands this test on both breast i feel so betrayed by the Drs. After i was positive in both sides they say maybe it was genetic and that i will then have to consider taking out my ovaries. I told them to do a test and lets confirm it is genetics first. I had the test and i was negative so they just left me alone. I now follow my 6 sense more than any Dr. I let them talk and talk after they are done i tell them ok i need to go home and think about this and i will make a decision. I am not happy with the way we are treated at this Dr. and don't get me wrong they are very nice, its just the lack of consideration for the life we will have after all the treatments. They are not the once who has to deal with what is next for all of us. Pls forgive me if i sound negative i am just telling you my experience so if anybody out there is told that they need to take care of one breast at the time pls have them check both. Thanks and ll keep fingers crossed",

I had to deal with nerves pain but I thought it was normal and it could go away. Well it never ended and I am about to have a revision surgery, now that I found you ladies I have some info to bring with me to my new Ps in regards to my pain. I was blaming the lose implants and the rad but my pain even though it's worse on the rad muscle it's in both breast it's a pain that does not allows me to wear no bra or to sleep. I usually have to change position in bed several times through the night and use many pillows. It's defenetly nerve pain it feels as burning or tingling all around the upper poles,  nipple, and some sharp pain around the scars. thanks for sharing all these links and info. It makes so much sense. ",

Don't get me wrong I gave full authorization for my bs to take all the nodes at the time of my surgery but she didn't. She only took the sentinel nodes then waited 21 days for the pathology report then at that time realized chemo didn't work and that one of my nodes was now positive.  I has biopsy before chemo and it was negative then 6 months of chemo and c went on my nodes so I then ask about other options and did decide on radiation. I was not willing to let them take my nodes and put me under once more.  So I did rad. Well I am still glad about my decision, I now deal with burning and pain in my chest but at least not the arm so I am ok so far. Invest the sentinel nodes but I kept the others. :(  I keep wishing for a way we could somehow help other woman avoid all this nightmare. I agree with you doctors do scare us and it is us who live with our pain after they are done. I also like you wish they come up with better ways to help people withvthe sickness. It does help to know we are not alone but another same time it really bothers us to know there are so many of us and the number increases every day. :(  Sending u all hugs. ",
