What do you think I should have on hand, at home, when I finally get there?  Certain clothes, availability of everyday things.  How did everyone's first shower go?  Please share with me all that you know, good or bad.  I know it would only help me. I'm only have a mast on left breast, will I be able to use my right arm somewhat freely?  I'm hoping it will be of great help to me. Mom and sister in law will be around to help me, but any and all info/suggestions/advice to help me thru this will be so, so appreciated.

I have an appt soon w/my surgeon. I'm going to take that with me along with your info.  It really has grounded me and I think my decision for a 2nd opinion is valid, but I'm going to wait to talk to her.  Hopefully I won't offend her.  That's my concern with the 2nd op.-even though I know it shouldn't be because it's my body. thank you, thank you.

I am 44, my pathology report reads : ductal carcinoma in situ * cribriform type w/nuclear grade 1-2 of 3 * no definite lymphovascular space inv. identified * left breast only * right breast completely clear * no cancer in my family, I'm the first one. I honestly feel this is the truth.  I know this is cancer.  I believe the doctors/med. prof. that have seen my info are giving me the facts. I am scheduled for a unilat on Jan.10. My friends sister works in the medical field.  She wants me to see a doctor that she \"believes in\", in regard to treatments.  Do I need to doubt anything about the cancer I have and the treatment (masectomy) that has been discussed. The whole thing is a bummer to begin with and I'm stressing out trying to get copies and films to go see the 2nd guy and it's not going smooth for me.  Part of me just wants to continue down the path that I believe is supposed to be followed per all the tests so far, and the other part is, what, hoping for other news?  My head is spinning at the fork in the road, which way to go.  Can anyone of you guys help me.....? Any and all info will be so appreciated.
