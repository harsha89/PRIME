MD; Sikoro, Katherine MD; Yezhelyev, Maksym V. MD; Anderson, Erica MD; Carlson, Grant W. MD Abstract Autologous fat grafting has become a common technique for revisional breast surgery. The purpose of this series is to review our experience with fat grafting for the correction of acquired breast deformities. A retrospective review was performed on 107 patients with a history of breast cancer between 1996 and 2010, who had autologous fat grafting at the time of secondary breast reconstruction. The indications were for improvement in contour, shape, and volume of the breast following transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction (n = 55), latissimus dorsi with or without implant (n = 20), implant reconstruction (n = 20), and breast conservation therapy deformity (n = 12). The average volume of injection was 40 mL (range, 5-150 mL), the most common location being upper and medial quadrants. Fat was harvested mainly from the abdomen, thighs, and flanks. Complications occurred in 11% of the patients, and included fat necrosis, erythema, keloid scarring, and pain. Complications were higher when performed with implant reconstructions. Repeat fat injection was performed in 25% (n = 27/107), which increased with the length of follow-up. Patients with a history of radiation therapy had an increased incidence of repeat injections (36% vs. 18%). Patients with >6 months follow-up reported an improvement of about 83%. Autologous fat grafting is a safe and effective tool for secondary breast reconstruction. It is helpful in all types of reconstructions to improve contour, volume, and overall breast shape and symmetry. Repeat injections are often required and this is more common in patients with longer follow-up and in those with a history of radiation therapy. The popularity of this approach in reconstructive breast surgery will likely continue to increase. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. Fat Grafting and Breast Reconstruction with Implant:  Another Option for the Irradiated Breast Cancer Patients. Salgarello M, Visconti G, Barone-Adesi L.

Abstract BACKGROUND: In postmastectomy radiated patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred over the implant one, because the latter is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. However, autologous tissue reconstruction is not always feasible and is sometimes refused by the patient. A challenge also arises in breast-conserving surgery patients, seeking breast augmentation with implant. In this paper, the authors present a further reconstructive option for irradiated breast cancer patients, consisting of fat grafting followed by implant placement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed sixteen cases of irradiated breasts treated with fat grafting and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction/breast augmentation. The evaluation methods were clinical and photography-based assessments. The BREAST-Q was used to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, with a pre-treatment LENT-SOMA score of 1 and 2, underwent two to three fat graftings to achieve a LENT-SOMA score of 0. The placement of the breast implant had been performed in a separate stage at least three months after the last grafting session. The average follow-up was 15 months. The reconstructive outcomes were graded from excellent to good in 93.7 percent of patients. Patient satisfaction was marked high to very high. There were no short-term complications. A Baker grade 1 capsule contracture was found in all patients. CONCLUSION: The authors' experience shows that breast fat grafting followed by implant placement may represent a feasible reconstructive option in high selected patients with irradiated breasts. Fat grafting seems to reduce the radiation-induced complications in implants. Larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed. PMID: 21987041 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher] Lauren Greenfield, MD's blog [a California plastic surgeon] http://www.laurengreenbergmd.com/uncategorized/breast-reconstruction-after-breast-cancer-using-fat-grafts/ As you can see, there are numerous studies which have been performed to substantiate that fat graft transfer [even to a breast where the implant is already in place] can change the integrity of the radiated skin.  It can soften the skin and apparently can also reduce a higher grade capsular contracture which otherwise might require surgical intervention, to a Grade 1 which would require no intervention.  Fat grafting is also a method by which symmetry to the irradiated breast can be made to more closely match the non-irradiated breast. MASSAGING DURING EXPANSION  From an interview by D r. Weiss here on bc.org Maurice Nahabedian Yes. Also, in patients who've had radiation to implants (expanders) I recommend an aggressive massaging protocol to help maintain the soft consistency of the reconstructed breast. Marisa Weiss, M.D. Can you explain what you mean by this massage protocol? Maurice Nahabedian I recommend they use some sort of a moisturizing lotion and massage the breast two to three times a day to retain the moisture and also to help control the amount of scar tissue that forms around the implant/expander.

MD; Sikoro, Katherine MD; Yezhelyev, Maksym V. MD; Anderson, Erica MD; Carlson, Grant W. MD Abstract Autologous fat grafting has become a common technique for revisional breast surgery. The purpose of this series is to review our experience with fat grafting for the correction of acquired breast deformities. A retrospective review was performed on 107 patients with a history of breast cancer between 1996 and 2010, who had autologous fat grafting at the time of secondary breast reconstruction. The indications were for improvement in contour, shape, and volume of the breast following transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction (n = 55), latissimus dorsi with or without implant (n = 20), implant reconstruction (n = 20), and breast conservation therapy deformity (n = 12). The average volume of injection was 40 mL (range, 5-150 mL), the most common location being upper and medial quadrants. Fat was harvested mainly from the abdomen, thighs, and flanks. Complications occurred in 11% of the patients, and included fat necrosis, erythema, keloid scarring, and pain. Complications were higher when performed with implant reconstructions. Repeat fat injection was performed in 25% (n = 27/107), which increased with the length of follow-up. Patients with a history of radiation therapy had an increased incidence of repeat injections (36% vs. 18%). Patients with >6 months follow-up reported an improvement of about 83%. Autologous fat grafting is a safe and effective tool for secondary breast reconstruction. It is helpful in all types of reconstructions to improve contour, volume, and overall breast shape and symmetry. Repeat injections are often required and this is more common in patients with longer follow-up and in those with a history of radiation therapy. The popularity of this approach in reconstructive breast surgery will likely continue to increase. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. Fat Grafting and Breast Reconstruction with Implant:  Another Option for the Irradiated Breast Cancer Patients. Salgarello M, Visconti G, Barone-Adesi L. Source Assistant Professor, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Catholic University of \"Sacro Cuore\" - University Hospital \"A. Gemelli\" - Largo A. Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy; Resident in-training, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Catholic University of \"Sacro Cuore\" - University Hospital \"A. Gemelli\"- Largo A. Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy; Consultant Plastic Surgeon - Breast Unit - Catholic University of \"Sacro Cuore\" - University Hospital \"A. Gemelli\" - Largo Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy. Abstract BACKGROUND: In postmastectomy radiated patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred over the implant one, because the latter is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. However, autologous tissue reconstruction is not always feasible and is sometimes refused by the patient. A challenge also arises in breast-conserving surgery patients, seeking breast augmentation with implant. In this paper, the authors present a further reconstructive option for irradiated breast cancer patients, consisting of fat grafting followed by implant placement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed sixteen cases of irradiated breasts treated with fat grafting and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction/breast augmentation. The evaluation methods were clinical and photography-based assessments. The BREAST-Q was used to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, with a pre-treatment LENT-SOMA score of 1 and 2, underwent two to three fat graftings to achieve a LENT-SOMA score of 0. The placement of the breast implant had been performed in a separate stage at least three months after the last grafting session. The average follow-up was 15 months. The reconstructive outcomes were graded from excellent to good in 93.7 percent of patients. Patient satisfaction was marked high to very high. There were no short-term complications. A Baker grade 1 capsule contracture was found in all patients. CONCLUSION: The authors' experience shows that breast fat grafting followed by implant placement may represent a feasible reconstructive option in high selected patients with irradiated breasts. Fat grafting seems to reduce the radiation-induced complications in implants. Larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed.

Marisa Weiss, M.D. Can you explain what you mean by this massage protocol?

Complications occurred in 11% of the patients, and included fat necrosis, erythema, keloid scarring, and pain. Complications were higher when performed with implant reconstructions. Repeat fat injection was performed in 25% (n = 27/107), which increased with the length of follow-up. Patients with a history of radiation therapy had an increased incidence of repeat injections (36% vs. 18%). Patients with >6 months follow-up reported an improvement of about 83%. Autologous fat grafting is a safe and effective tool for secondary breast reconstruction. It is helpful in all types of reconstructions to improve contour, volume, and overall breast shape and symmetry. Repeat injections are often required and this is more common in patients with longer follow-up and in those with a history of radiation therapy.

Abstract BACKGROUND: In postmastectomy radiated patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred over the implant one, because the latter is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. However, autologous tissue reconstruction is not always feasible and is sometimes refused by the patient. A challenge also arises in breast-conserving surgery patients, seeking breast augmentation with implant. In this paper, the authors present a further reconstructive option for irradiated breast cancer patients, consisting of fat grafting followed by implant placement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed sixteen cases of irradiated breasts treated with fat grafting and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction/breast augmentation. The evaluation methods were clinical and photography-based assessments. The BREAST-Q was used to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, with a pre-treatment LENT-SOMA score of 1 and 2, underwent two to three fat graftings to achieve a LENT-SOMA score of 0. The placement of the breast implant had been performed in a separate stage at least three months after the last grafting session. The average follow-up was 15 months. The reconstructive outcomes were graded from excellent to good in 93.7 percent of patients. Patient satisfaction was marked high to very high. There were no short-term complications. A Baker grade 1 capsule contracture was found in all patients. CONCLUSION: The authors' experience shows that breast fat grafting followed by implant placement may represent a feasible reconstructive option in high selected patients with irradiated breasts. Fat grafting seems to reduce the radiation-induced complications in implants. Larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed.

MD; Sikoro, Katherine MD; Yezhelyev, Maksym V. MD; Anderson, Erica MD; Carlson, Grant W. MD Abstract Autologous fat grafting has become a common technique for revisional breast surgery. The purpose of this series is to review our experience with fat grafting for the correction of acquired breast deformities. A retrospective review was performed on 107 patients with a history of breast cancer between 1996 and 2010, who had autologous fat grafting at the time of secondary breast reconstruction. The indications were for improvement in contour, shape, and volume of the breast following transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction (n = 55), latissimus dorsi with or without implant (n = 20), implant reconstruction (n = 20), and breast conservation therapy deformity (n = 12). The average volume of injection was 40 mL (range, 5-150 mL), the most common location being upper and medial quadrants. Fat was harvested mainly from the abdomen, thighs, and flanks. Complications occurred in 11% of the patients, and included fat necrosis, erythema, keloid scarring, and pain. Complications were higher when performed with implant reconstructions. Repeat fat injection was performed in 25% (n = 27/107), which increased with the length of follow-up. Patients with a history of radiation therapy had an increased incidence of repeat injections (36% vs. 18%). Patients with >6 months follow-up reported an improvement of about 83%. Autologous fat grafting is a safe and effective tool for secondary breast reconstruction. It is helpful in all types of reconstructions to improve contour, volume, and overall breast shape and symmetry. Repeat injections are often required and this is more common in patients with longer follow-up and in those with a history of radiation therapy. The popularity of this approach in reconstructive breast surgery will likely continue to increase. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. Fat Grafting and Breast Reconstruction with Implant:  Another Option for the Irradiated Breast Cancer Patients. Salgarello M, Visconti G, Barone-Adesi L.

Abstract BACKGROUND: In postmastectomy radiated patients, autologous tissue reconstruction is preferred over the implant one, because the latter is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. However, autologous tissue reconstruction is not always feasible and is sometimes refused by the patient. A challenge also arises in breast-conserving surgery patients, seeking breast augmentation with implant. In this paper, the authors present a further reconstructive option for irradiated breast cancer patients, consisting of fat grafting followed by implant placement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed sixteen cases of irradiated breasts treated with fat grafting and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction/breast augmentation. The evaluation methods were clinical and photography-based assessments. The BREAST-Q was used to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, with a pre-treatment LENT-SOMA score of 1 and 2, underwent two to three fat graftings to achieve a LENT-SOMA score of 0. The placement of the breast implant had been performed in a separate stage at least three months after the last grafting session. The average follow-up was 15 months. The reconstructive outcomes were graded from excellent to good in 93.7 percent of patients. Patient satisfaction was marked high to very high. There were no short-term complications. A Baker grade 1 capsule contracture was found in all patients. CONCLUSION: The authors' experience shows that breast fat grafting followed by implant placement may represent a feasible reconstructive option in high selected patients with irradiated breasts. Fat grafting seems to reduce the radiation-induced complications in implants. Larger studies with a longer follow-up are needed. PMID: 21987041 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher] Lauren Greenfield, MD's blog [a California plastic surgeon] http://www.laurengreenbergmd.com/uncategorized/breast-reconstruction-after-breast-cancer-using-fat-grafts/ As you can see, there are numerous studies which have been performed to substantiate that fat graft transfer [even to a breast where the implant is already in place] can change the integrity of the radiated skin.  It can soften the skin and apparently can also reduce a higher grade capsular contracture which otherwise might require surgical intervention, to a Grade 1 which would require no intervention.  Fat grafting is also a method by which symmetry to the irradiated breast can be made to more closely match the non-irradiated breast. MASSAGING DURING EXPANSION  From an interview by D r. Weiss here on bc.org Maurice Nahabedian Yes. Also, in patients who've had radiation to implants (expanders) I recommend an aggressive massaging protocol to help maintain the soft consistency of the reconstructed breast. Marisa Weiss, M.D. Can you explain what you mean by this massage protocol? Maurice Nahabedian I recommend they use some sort of a moisturizing lotion and massage the breast two to three times a day to retain the moisture and also to help control the amount of scar tissue that forms around the implant/expander.

This test can help assess your recurrence risk, and thus help you and your oncologist decide if you should have chemotherapy as well as hormone therapy.\" IYou might want to ask about that test.  Your need for chemotherapy [I read one of your previous posts] is probably necessary more due to the fact that the PR receptors are negative than tumor size.  Grade may come into play, but it appears to be the fact that there is a \"negative\" in the assessment.  But it will be very interesting to see how the two facilities \"reconcile\" your results.  I would never hesitate to ask for an independent opinion, if the discrepancy is not settled to alleviate your concerns. I can certainly appreciate how frustrating this is...waiting for answers.   Praying that you get some clarification and SOON!",

It is true that if you have a mastectomy you would not need radiation - unless you have positive lymph nodes and if the oncologist feels radiation is necessary, they would direct the rads to the axillary/armpit area.  You are asking sensible questions and trust me, it helps so much to be armed with as much information as possible, so that you can pose these questions to your doctor.  Since you are ER positive, ask your doctor about the Oncotype Dx test.  This test will determine your risk of recurrence.  If your results indicate that you fall within a low-risk category of recurrence, chemotherapy might not be necessary and your doctor would determine what other type of treatment would be appropriate.  Of course, this would require surgical removal of the tumor before taking the test.  So many other factors come into play - this test is not the tell-all prognosticator. This is just additional information which you can take to your next appointment with your oncologist.  You can present all of your data, but listen to what he recommends by way of addressing your particular case.  Read about the test here: http://www.oncotypedx.com/PatientCaregiver/IsOncotypeRight.aspx?Sid=8 In order to gain access to the pictures forum, you need to email Timtam and request permission for entrance.  It is a very private and protected website, so that women can feel comfortable and safe in posting their reconstruction photos.

Calculating the cost of bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, hospitalization, radiology, anesthesiology, and came up with a low and very conservative estimate of around $15,000 for hospital expenses, $25,000 for surgeons  [I had a surgical oncologist and a plastic surgeon], $5,000 for the anesthesiologist [which is really just a guess, as on the web I could not find easily any cost factors for this specialty] and radiology and pathology - I bulked together at $2,000 - probably very conservative.  So my very cursory and \"doing it just for fun\" total came to $47,000. This does not take into consideration surgical complications, additional hospitalization for such complications or other ancillary expenses. Perhaps someone else has some more concrete figures for you.  If you have a \"good\" breast guy who is covered by your insurance plan, it would be good to meet with him and find out more about him.  God bless!",

You know, I knew it was upwards of 100K for what we are going through - but I posted the sum which one might be able to find in the lowest socioeconomic city in the US.  I was afraid if I posted what I THOUGHT it would cost, I would be laughed right off the forum!  My calculations did not include the followup costs or cost for exchange to implants.  Unfortunately, the original poster does not appear to be reading these responses, but I hope she does do so, before making any committments to a private pay practitioner.",

My tumor was quite small - less than 1 cm, and I was a candidate for lumpectomy.  However, there is a family history of breast cancer and I just did not want to ever have to go through this again!  I also knew that the healthy breast would have had to be surgically lifted or augmented to obtain symmetry, and so surgery was going to take place on that breast no matter which way I went.  It is a very personal decision and many women just feel very strongly about not taking a healthy breast.  So these are options you can research further and come to the decision which gives you peace of mind.  There is a picture forum [which requires permission to access], so that you can see the cosmetic result after mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  Immediate reconstruction infers for most women that expanders will be placed during surgery to expand the skin and muscle and then will be removed at some point and replaced with permanent implants.  I am glad you are feeling the same sense of relief I did - by joining a forum such as this one!",

Published in 1998: Ann Surg. 1998 April: \"Use of paravertebral block anesthesia in the surgical management of breast cancer: experience in 156 cases\" . E Coveney, C R Weltz, R Greengrass, J D Iglehart, G S Leight, S M Steele, and H K Lyerly  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1191303/ Published in 2006.... Preincisional Paravertebral Block Reduces the Prevalence of Chronic Pain After Breast Surgery http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/3/703 Published 2008: \"ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN FOLLOWING BREAST SURGERY\" Authors: Serene H. Chang, Vivek Mehta, and Richard M. Langford Barts and The London NHS Trust, United Kingdom Received 16 July 2008;  revised 9 December 2008;  accepted 2 January 2009.  Available online 10 February 2009. Summary Background Successful acute pain management after breast surgery remains challenging, and if not achieved, may increase the likelihood of subsequent chronic pain. Aims This article aimed to evaluate the evidence for varied techniques described for peri-operative pain management in breast surgery, and to review the literature on chronic pain after breast surgery and particularly \u2018post-mastectomy pain syndrome'. Method A Pubmed search was performed, with the key words \"mastectomy\" and \"pain\" for articles in the English language in the adult human population (age > 19 years), looking specifically for different analgesic techniques that have been evaluated. Results Thirty-three peer-reviewed publications with pain outcome data were included, ranging from 15 to 289 patients per study (total n = 2104). Twenty three were randomised controlled trials and the rest were prospective or retrospective audits and case series. Inconsistent trial methodology precluded a meta-analysis. Paravertebral local anaesthetic nerve blockade resulted in lower pain scores and fewer side effects than opioid-based regimens. Three risk factors emerged predicting chronic pain post-mastectomy: higher post-operative pain scores, age <65 years and inclusion of major reconstructive surgery. Conclusion Paravertebral block should be considered for use in major breast surgery. Pain control should be optimised/a priority for both acute care and to potentially reduce chronic pain.",

Unfortunately, a condition of neuropathic pain, termed postmastectomy pain syndrome, can appear after mastectomy. Although evidence regarding the epidemiology of postmastectomy pain syndrome is well researched, an effective therapy is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of lipoaspirate graft in the treatment of postmastectomy pain syndrome. Methods: From February of 2006 to August of 2008, a total of 113 patients affected by postmastectomy pain syndrome and severe scar retractions were enrolled for this clinical study. Seventy-two patients were treated with autologous fat grafted in painful scars, and 41 patients did not undergo any further surgical procedure. Pain assessment was performed using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment, with a mean follow-up of 13 months. In addition, antalgic drug intake was recorded in the 34 patients who received a surgical treatment. Results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: A significant decrease in pain according to the visual analogue scale was detected in patients treated with autologous fat graft (3.23-point reduction, p = 0.0005). Twenty-eight of 34 patients stopped their analgesic therapy with a significant follow-up (13 months). Conclusions: Autologous fat grafting is a safe, relatively noninvasive, and rapid surgical procedure. The authors' results suggest its effectiveness for treatment of postmastectomy pain syndrome.",

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is caused by direct nerve injury (eg, severance, compression, ischemia, stretching, retraction) during the breast cancer operation or from subsequent formation of a traumatic neuroma or scar tissue [5,6,14,16-18]. Breast cancer operations can damage the brachial plexus, intercostobrachial, lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal, long thoracic, and medial and lateral pectoral nerves that innervate the breast, chest wall, and ipsilateral extremity (figure 1 and figure 2 and figure 3) [6,16]. In particular, surgical procedures in the upper outer quadrant of the breast and axilla, where major nerves traverse the operative field, are particularly vulnerable to nerve injury [17,19]. In addition, local radiation treatments and neurotoxic systemic therapy (eg, taxanes, platinum agents, vinca alkaloids) can also exacerbate PMPS [6-8,14,20,21].              ",
