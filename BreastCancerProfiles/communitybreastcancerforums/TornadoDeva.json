    "Content": "TornadoDeva wrote: Hello ladies, I am 3 days post-op BMX with tissue expanders. I am not expecting a miracle but would just like to get a general idea of how long the numbness, swelling, and pain, specifically near the armpit, lasts after surgery. I had about 100ccs put in my expanders per my request. My husband is here with me this week but I'm very nervous about taking care of my 6 and 8 year old next week by myself. Any advice would be most appreciated.
