    "Content": "Sciencekid21 wrote: Hey guys! I noticed an immovable lump in my left breast about two months ago. Since then, it has become increasingly painful. I've been poking at it quite a bit, which has lead to some bruising as well. I'm now noticing some thickening of the breast tissue. Compared with the other side, its not as soft or pliable and this asymmetry is really concerning to me. I visited a physician and she said that she wasn't concerned but I do have an ultrasound in two days. I'm 19 years old, with no family history of breast cancer and I don't use hormone-altering drugs such as oral contraceptives but I could be an exception, right? I know fibroadenomas are common in young women but those are typically movable. Should I request a mammography even if the ultrasound comes out clear? Its the middle of exam season for me and I can't seem to think of anything else except for this issue! Thank you to everyone who offers advice! Log in to post a reply",
