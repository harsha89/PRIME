I had 3 biopsies, one in my right breast which is where I found the lump, one in that same side lympnoid because they saw thicking in one and one in the left which is very small. I am having such a hard time because I know that today most likely will be the day my life will change forever. I am sure everyone goes through this but is is the worst anxiety I have ever felt. I also keep focusing on every pain that I have been having and can not stop thinking that it has spread. Have had small amounts of back/neck pain for months and have thought it was stress but now I cant help thinking it is something to do with this. Sorry to go on and on but I just have to get this out. Thanks for listening and I hope everything goes easy and well for who ever is reading this. Log in to post a reply",

Kinda sucks but I am going to fight this with all I have until it's gone. It's just so hard not knowing anything like if its spread although I feel fine. All of this is so hard to wrap my head around. I have appt with surgeon 4/11. Thanks so much for your reply.",

I am going to learn so much from you all as it looks like you have all been through a lot. I will be seeing a surgical oncologist in April. In the mean time I will have an MRI before that appointment. Thank you all for being so kind this is crazy hard to wrap my head around.",
