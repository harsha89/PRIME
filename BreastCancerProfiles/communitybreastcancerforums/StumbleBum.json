I did not get the neulasta shot with my first infusion, and my nadir neutrophil count was a mere 300. I spent the next several days paranoid about minor injuries and germs and it was pretty depressing, truth be told. My temperatures were always below normal and I felt fine (great, even) from day 6 to today. I haven't heard yet if I'm going to get neulasta for this go-round or not. I suppose I'll find out tomorrow, but I hate having to wait for anything, especially unpleasant things. So, I'm wondering... has anybody else *not* gotten the neulasta at first but had it added to subsequent rounds? How does the oncologist determine if you need it or not? I've been googling away at this but have come up with absolutely nothing useful.",
