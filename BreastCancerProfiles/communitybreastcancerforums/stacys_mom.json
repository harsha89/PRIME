      "Content": "Sep 29, 2010 11:35AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 02:50AM by stacys_mom I think these message boards are empowering because they let you express that anger- that we all have- out into the universe where it does no harm.  I would never express this frustration to my friend, but it doesn't mean I don't feel it.  My post does seem a little harsh upon reading it again. Survivor guilt takes on a whole new meaning with this disease.  My friend and I have shared many of those \"insider\" moments and I hope we have many more years to share them but my reality is that she may very well outlive me.  I was diagnosed stage IIIC in my 40's and still have a teenage son at home. I just became a grandma.  I savor every moment with my famliy. I shouldn't feel guilty about being happy about being healthy today.",
