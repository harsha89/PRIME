Becca, your description of Zombidom is right on.  As well as mouth flavors....it is exactly how it is for me, right down to the bread.  I will have to try the juice pops and clementines. I cried myself to sleep last night because I cannot eat or drink and I am starved. The more I don't eat or drink, the more I get depressed. Food has always been such an enjoyment to me.  And after each treatment that I've had, I always say that I'm not going back, but I do.  I feel terrible whining my way through my treatments when I know some others are even worse off.  I've been taking Valtrex to help keep the mouth sores away and it does seem to help, however, my tongue does get a little sore and numb as well. Sjacobs, congratulations on having your last treatment.  I wish you all the best and no SEs and good luck with the RADS.  ",

I hope that everyone finds joy in the Christmas Season and has a Healthy New Year for 2015.",
