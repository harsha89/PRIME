A greater treatment effect from adjuvant chemotherapy has been noted in younger women,7 which may be at least partly explained by an antiestrogenic effect associated with premature menopause induced by chemotherapy.27 We did not collect data on chemotherapy-induced menopause. It remains unclear whether similar benefits could be achieved with ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor instead of chemotherapy.\" They say chemotherapy might put women at postmenopause (meaning significant reduction in estrogen production) therefore better outcome. This might be indirect effect of chemotherapy which make sense. Their last sentence in above paragraph says it all",

I did no reconstruction and very happy about my decision as I seek my comfort and my well being firstbefore how I look. Besides a good prosthetic does a great job.",
