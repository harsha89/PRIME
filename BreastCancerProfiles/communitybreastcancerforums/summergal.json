(ER+/PR+)\"  Is my cancer \"Her2/Neu negative?\"  Both of these characteristics are considered good from a prognostic perspective.  If your cancer is ER+/PR+, this means your cancer cells are feeding off the estrogen in your body, so after your surgery, the Medical Oncologist (MO) might recommend hormone therapy in order to reduce your estrogen levels.  One of the drugs that does this is Tamoxifen.  You will hear a lot of people talk about this drug.  Her2 negative means generally means that your cancer is not very aggressive, or fast-growing.  Another thing to ask is \"what is the size of my tumor?\"  The doctor may not be able to give you a specific answer, as the biopsy only generally determines the size, but it's helpful to know this as it may give you an idea of how long you can wait to have surgery (generally, the larger the tumor, the quicker the surgery).  Another thing to know, and this can be very difficult to swallow, is that you will most likely have surgery.  That is the go-to treatment for most breast cancers.  Some women have very large tumors and they have to be shrunk first with radiation, chemo or a combo, but most women will be told they have to have surgery - either mastectomy (MX) or lumpectomy (LX), which is sometimes called \"partial mastectomy\" by the medical community.  This news was very shocking to me as I simply didn't feel sick!  I couldn't believe that \"just yesterday\" (i.e., before breast cancer, or BBC!) I was fine and after diagnosis, the main thing everyone talked about was surgery.  The important thing to remember is this - if your tumors are small (under 1 cm), your hormone receptors are positive and your Her2 is negative, you have some time to take this all in before you immediately rush to surgery and DON'T let any doctor push you into anything.  You have the right to a second opinion and I highly recommend it.  Even if you love your general surgeon, as I did.  I still was advised to see a Breast Cancer Specialist or Surgical Oncologist (BS or SO).  I'm glad I did.  I realized I had more than one option.  My BS does hundreds of breast cancer surgeries (not just breast surgeries) a year; my general surgeon only did tens of them.  I eventually chose to have bilateral lumpectomies with sentinel node biopsies (SNB) - this is where the surgeon injects a small bit of blue dye or a radioactive isotope into your breast tissue, then watches it travel to the first of your lymph nodes under your arm.  When the dye shows which one is the biggest, first or \"sentinel\" lymph node, the surgeon will cut into your skin and take that node out and have it tested to see if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes.  If it has, you will most likely need chemotherapy. If you choose LX, you will have radiation therapy (RT or RADS) several weeks afterwards.  But...you are nowhere near that now!!  You have just been diagnosed and it is the scariest time.  A BC sister told me the worst time is between diagnosis and when you finally decide on which surgical treatment to have.  That was true for me. It is so scary and unbelievable and it makes you have to face firsthand things you probably have never thought about.  But you are going to be okay.  Reach out to your family and friends.  Post on this board.  DO NOT spend a lot of time on the internet looking for information - this site is a dot-org and it is a rich and wonderful source of information.  Ask questions.  And again, it is okay to seek a second opinion.  If you're wondering how to do this, look online for a cancer center near you.  Give them a call.  You may even be able to register for your appt online.  Above all, keep breathing.  It is going to be hard for you to sleep for the next few weeks or months.  But know this - we are here for you.  You're one of us now.  It's not the club anyone wants to join, but if you have to have breast cancer, we are here and we know what you're going through.  ((((HUGS))))",

Everest - how?  Depending on where you live, are there cancer centers nearby or within a reasonable traveling distance?  Can you give another hospital/center a call tomorrow morning and say you would like to schedule a second opinion?  Sometimes you can even register online for a second opinion appointment (which I did, and was called by an intake facilitator within hours).  Any really good surgeon would fully support you in seeking a second opinion.  I can understand how you are feeling very uncomfortable and yes, angry, with the inconsistencies you are getting from your surgeon's office.  I feel that the breast cancer patient should have every opportunity to make an informed decision and to feel as confident as you can be with the care you are receiving, and to me, that care also includes the degree to which the office staff takes care of the administrative stuff professionally and with as little disruption to you as possible.  After all, you are dealing with your diagnosis and all the emotional and physical ramifications of that.  It seems, from your description, that while you were told you were tentatively scheduled for tomorrow, that your surgeon won't be operating tomorrow.  If so, again, I encourage you to take the gift of extra time to seek a second opinion.  You may end up continuing with the same surgeon you have now, and that's fine, but you may also find you have some breathing room.  Oh, and keep breathing!!!  You will get through this.  ((hugs))",

Tuffenuff - Thank you so much for your kind words!  I'm glad if I've helped.  I never thought I'd know enough about breast cancer to be able to offer suggestions, but I do know that right after diagnosis is a very scary emotional place to be and that it's really important to have someone else \"take you by the hand\" and help you advocate for yourself.  Be good to yourself this weekend and give yourself something special - a spa treatment, a nice meal, a movie - whatever it is that makes you feel pampered.  You deserve it! Katlebbie - Thank you, too!  You have such a lovely, calming way of offering support - I wish you good luck and easy healing tomorrow! Hoping that antbigler, StacieRae and SchoolCounselor are all resting easy after surgery these past few days. What a big day that is now behind you - onto the rest of your life!   And keeping MBLizzy, Katlebbie and Lee1963 in thoughts, prayers and good wishes that you don't have too much worry today as you prepare for surgery coming up - keeping busy helped me and reaching out to let the friends and family around me know when my surgery day was coming up provided such comfort.  (((HUGS))) to all!",

Sometimes the tumors are up against the chest wall and even with a BMX, the BS or RO will recommend radiation therapy to \"get\" the cancerous cells that may still be lurking there.  My BS said that if I had had even one positive node, I would be doing chemo.  And even though I had all three of my nodes were negative, my MO just ordered the oncotype DX test to determine the likelihood of a recurrence and therefore, the possibility that I'd need to do chemo before I even start radiation.  So, I think it's a mixed bag.  Everyone is different, everyone's cancer is different, too and perhaps unfortunately, everyone's doctor is different (i.e., there isn't one solid protocol for every patient who presents with whatever diagnosis).  I, too, prepared myself for the worst.  It's good to consider all the possibilities.  I know you're scared.  In the days before my surgery I was constantly questioning myself and my decisions, and I hate to say it, but I still do question them.  We do the best with the information we have at the time.  Will keep you in prayers that you can have some peaceful moments before Thursday.  ((hugs)).",

You've already been through hell, you don't have to put yourself through high water, too.",

I've heard others on these boards say that I should expect some kind of examination, blood pressure, temp, etc. Is that standard and if this doesn't happen, should I request it? What kinds of questions should I ask? I have seen some people say that their MO prescribed tamoxifen at the outset of their radiation. Others said their MOs want them to wait until they're finished with radiation before taking the tamoxifen. What is the risk? If I find out I don't need chemo at tomorrow's appt, I expect to begin radiation on both breasts in November. Thank you for your suggestions",
