      "Content": "Mar 23, 2010 11:53AM - edited Mar 27, 2010 09:44AM by JanetfromCanada I am so happy that Been-A-Boobs are being discussed. It's great feedback and I am always open to new ideas, so feel free to e-mail me at janet@janacsportswear.ca with any thoughts and suggestions. I am considering making a BAB with only microbeads, there won't be any weight to it at all, so I'm not sure if there really is a market for it. I'm thinking they would be good for immediately after surgery, and for use in leisure/nightwear but any feedback would be great. I was diagnosed the first time in 1995, and the 2nd time in 2009. I am now bi-lateral and a lot of the time I do go braless & Been-a-Boobless, but sometimes I need them to help with my self-esteem. I admire those ladies who go boobless all the time. For those who are interested, the name Been-A-Boob comes from - \"it's going where a Boob has Been\" some people think it is Bean-a-boob and that there are beans in there, I have been asked if the beans will sprout if washed!!!!! To lovemygarden, we make the triangle (heart) shape in size 3 (there is a mistake on the website and doesn't show that size) so if you want to order one or just want more information, just e-mail or call me 1-866-290-0821. The reason we don't make size 3 in a lighter version is because we feel that the sizes 1-3 are fairly light anyway, and breasts do weight something. The smaller ones are similar to the silicone ones in weight, but they are much more comfortable, don't make you sweat and are cheaper.",

I am new to being bi-lateral, and although I do go bra-less sometimes (and boy, is it comfortable) I have trouble with my posture. I tend to hunch over, like I did when I was a teenager and just growing boobs. Your pics are giving me confidence to stand tall and be proud of who I am. THANK YOU LADIES.",
