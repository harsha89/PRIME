Have a serious talk with my son about me not always being around and how he needs to make his own way. That's all I can think of now to do.",

I used to have GOBS of rich full thick hair. Everytime I would brush it the brush seemed to be full of hair, but friends said it didn't look any different. I got tired of worrying about how or when it would all just come out so I shaved my head. If I had to do it all over I would have just cut my hair really short instead. I broke out all over my head and wearing a wig is itchy and almost unbearable at this point and the little fuzz of hiar i have left actually hurts and is pokey. I'm thinking abouting waxing my head now LOL!",

I have already completed my neo adjuvant chemo, so thank you Jesus for seeing me through that. I am also nervous and have had moments where I was just so sure I wasn't going to survive this, certain I had cancer coursing all through my body, but I am fine. I have to be careful not to let my thoughts get away from me. It's really easy to feel sorry for yourself when you have cancer ;) My Onc doc put me on Effexor and it has helped quite a bit with the anxiety although at times I feel I culd use something a little stronger. I'm the biggest of wimps so if I can do it you can too!!",
