      "Content": "Mar 5, 2016 01:25AM - edited Mar 5, 2016 01:26AM by mairew I have #10 today. It does seem to be flying (kind of). So far my nipple is a bit sore. The boob is bigger (swollen ever so slightly) so I will ask the RO about that today. I do hate the Kitchen Aid (gantry). Its like an evil machine has taken over the world. While I am on the table I pray that everyone who lies on the table that day will have a safe and peaceful day, and I also visualize all you wonderful warrior women holding hands in a circle around me protecting me during my treatment. I feel we, as a group, do that with everyone as they have their daily treatments.",

Today I had my last in-treatment meeting with my RO. I was a bit teary-eyed because I love my RO and we were talking about the emotional impact of Rads etc. and my RO told me when she was 14 her mother died of BC. I think I will totally lose it on 'the rack' on my last day, which is Wed. My clinic doesn't have a gong, will get a certificate. Only three more boosts!!! Hope everyone has a peaceful weekend.",

I didn't bother to bring it up. I didn't find the setup and people very friendly. They were nice, but I didn't feel at ease. I suppose its my newbie status. Anyway, the techs asked me a couple of times if I had any questions but didn't really offer any information. If I was not on here with you lovely ladies I would be totally clueless about this. So thank you all. They marked up my area with a big blue marker. Its a huge area that extends under my arm pit around to my back slightly. Shit. Funtimes start Monday evening. In the waiting room I met a woman who was there with her mother (her mother has cervical cancer and is undergoing chemo and radiation). Anyway the woman told me she had BC when she was 21! She had DMX and is now 47.",
