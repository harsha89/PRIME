Yesterday was week 3, post-surgery, and I'm feeling ok. Been walking 12-16K steps a day, 60-90+ min. Lymph nodes were removed so arms feel funny but I'm supposed to wear compression sleeves (often forget or it's too hot in San Antonio). Can't exercise arms until Mar but the end is in site! All the best to everyone!  ",
