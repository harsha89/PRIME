I am guessing that maybe they suspect mastitis or something from when I was breast feeding my son a couple months ago? All my lymph node spots are very tender- hurt.  My left side hurts a lot worse. ",

About three weeks ago I started having pain and tenderness in left breast, left side of lower neck, and pain above elbow.  My left breast is a full size bigger than right (never been that way before).   I called my OB/GYN to tell triage nurse my symptoms and they put me on Kflex antibiotic 4x a day.  I just started one dose yesterday and full days dose today.  I am in such pain under my left underarm, top of left breast and left neck area and just above my elbow left side.  I have become fatigued and nauseous in mornings and evenings.  and I am on good fitness (work out 3-4x wk).  I am not pregnant and no chance due to tubal ligation. Does my symptoms sound like I should demand an office visit?  Or just wait another week to give antibiotic a chance to work?  Should I worry? Thanks for any thoughts  Kami Log in to post a reply",

During ultrasound I tried looking at screen and noticed lots of big black spots.  I am guessing, cysts? Well Tech told me that she needed to show radiologist ultrasound and that it's standard that they show all breast ultrasounds or mammograms and she could be a while.   I waited about 10 min and she told me I could get dressed.  Tech said that the radiologist didn't see anything too concerning, but make sure I keep my follow up appointment.  Report should be available Friday and call to get it from hospital or my Dr. So, now I question if it's nothing, or something but not life threatening.  I just would like the pain to stop and know why I have felt couple lumps.   One thing.  This whole left side pain and lumps seem to have started when I stopped taking Ortho Tri Cyclen for heavy bleeding.  I stopped it 3 weeks in as uneasy getting a migraine every day.",
