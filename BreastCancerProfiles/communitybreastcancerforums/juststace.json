I can feel the mouth sores coming- any advice? so far for SE I have had horrible leg muscle pain and exhaustion. I'm just sooo tired. I'm 39- have 2 boys and school starts tomorrow \u2013 I can't wait because I don't want my boys to just watch me sleep every day I think it freaks them out. i'm really hoping that this only last for the first seven days\u2026 And then I can spend a couple weeks recovering before the next chemo \u2013 it seems like that's a lot of your experiences no? I am triple a receptor positive \u2013 her 2 positive and I'm trying chemo before surgery \u2013 I have six sessions all together every three weeks so five to go. honestly I feel really grateful that there is medicine to heal this but goodness\u2026 It's a hard road to make yourself sick just to be better.  anyways just nice to read about people on the same path and able to share a little bit\u2026 Certainly a little discouraged today just on how very very tired I am.",

I don't have a lot of side effects other than extreme exhaustion. I'm a busy mom I work full-time \u2013 I totally thought I could do this \u2013 I've always worked through sickness before but there is no way\u2026 I just want to be realistic for those of you who are asking about work. I know we will all have different side effects but a heads up on the incredible amount of exhaustion that comes with chemo. my whole body is sooooo sore. Day one and two were awesome I felt like I had so much energy \u2013 and then Day 3 started and everything changed. I will keep you posted as I'm a little bit ahead of you and let you know if it goes away.",

The hard thing is you don't know what days you're going to be tired so you don't really know what to plan for. I have a lot of grace for yourselves about maybe not being able to keep up with your job during this time \u2013 but I will for sure let you know how I keep going as it looks like I'm a little bit ahead of you. I am for sure hoping to work part time but as of so far \u2013 no way! Especially not between days three and seven \u2013 I'm just really hoping that come day seven I start feeling better and get a couple",
