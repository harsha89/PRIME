      "Content": "Jan 13, 2018 04:23PM - edited Jan 13, 2018 04:29PM by Mhuizar42 Just wanted to post an update. Went for a biopsy on 1-8-18 and with the Grace of God and lots of prayers everything came back good. I just want to let anyone that I know when we hear biopsy we tend to go through so much anxiety, not sleeping or eating, crying I know because I went through it all even the day of the appointment before the biopsy when they gave me the gown to change I just broke down in my knees and prayed as I enter the changing room. I am so thankful for God that gave me strength, and serenity , Peggy, and Jane for being there for me , my Husband who took me to my appointment and took care of our 2 year old, for everyone who was praying for me, the nurse, the ultrasound tech, the Dr who did the biopsy they where very prepared made me feel very comfortable felt very blessed with the team that took care of me for my procedure. I just want you you to know to anyone who is going through this tough moment or that already went through it and the results weren't as expected be strong I'll be sending lots of prayers and blessings to you all. Also what helped me go through my day was a book given to me called Jesus is Calling Morning & Evening by Sarah Young and also reading my Bible. May God bless you all always Amen",

Stay strong I know how much energy this process can take out of you. The best thing to do is to not try to worry ahead of time words that my Dr. told me I know it's easier said than done. But sending prayers down your way. ",
