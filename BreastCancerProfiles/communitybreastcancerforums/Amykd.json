Waiting for 6 weeks for test after test sucks too but...there is a silver lining.  After mammo, diagostic mamo, ultrasound, sonocine, breast MRI, 5 mammotome biosies and a wire guided open biopsy....the final result is BENIGN!  Radial scar, mild hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis...very busy breasts but benign all the same.  My BS said I will require continued follow up for a long time because of slight family history, dense  & busy breasts and premenopausal and such.  That is okay. For now I can exhale.  Here's hoping those of you waiting for results (mine was Birads 4) will also get to hear BENIGN.  It does happen!  Thanks for reading and supporting me Amy ",

      "Content": "Amykd wrote: Hi Everyone, Okay...so updated information!  I finally spoke to the breast surgeon and while everything is benign, I have an area that is sclerosing adenosis, hyperplasia (without atypia) and a small radial scar.  I am now scheduled for a wire loc. removal of that radial scar due to the fact that this might be hiding a low grade cancer (what my BS said). Does anyone have further information about radial scars, experience with them and possibly hiding cancer cells?  Also, what is a wire loc removal like?  I am so, so grateful for my benign results but I am now scared that they missed something in the ultrasound core biopsy.  Any information would be helpful...it is a rollercoaster ride and I would like to get off now (sigh).

It was not full general more like a twilight sleep (like when I had my wisdom teeth out).   I certainly can understand your concern about feeling a lump.  I recently had a Sonocine ultrasound (3D ultrasound).  It is very accurate and highly sensitive. That is a test you could request-currently it is a self pay test ($300) because it is new.  It found 5 areas in both my breasts that did not show up on a regular ultrasound or Mammo due to breat density(waiting on surgical results for 1 area-radial scar).  Amy ",
