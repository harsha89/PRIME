Any breast mass with implants should be evaluated for Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. This has primarily been associated with textured implants. Do you have textured now, or ever? Have you noticed any swelling in that breast? The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has a diagnostic and treatment algorithm for BIA-ALCL. Any late onset seroma or mass should be evaluated via ultrasound or MRI. I will try to post the algorithm for you. While still very rare, the number of cases is rising due to clinician awareness and persistence from symptomatic patients. ",
