My sister and best friend was diagnosed last year with stage 2 breast cancer. Her tumor was the size of a golf ball by the time she went to have it checked out. She went through chemo, double mastectomy and now she's into her third week of radiation, which had hoped not to do but the cancer spread to her lymph nodes so there was no choice. Luckily she is insured under her husband's plan and so we'll see how they fare with the medical bills. Now the Susan G Komen race is coming up and I'd really like to participate. But as I was speaking to another friend of mine she said to me I will NEVER support Susan G Komen because they turned their back on my family when my mom had stage 4 breast cancer. My friend's mother had no insurance and treatment was too much for them to afford. They called the SGK organization and the first words out of their mouth was \"does she have insurance\". Once they found out she didn't they said they. Couldn't help her pursue treatment. My friends mother died because of the lack of treatment she wasn't able to afford. So after hearing that I am completely turned off to SGK but I want to do the walk to show my support for my sister and best friend. We had to move in August so I'm not in our home state. A \"team\" was put together back home in support of my sister and they raised over $2,000 and now that I'm across the country I feel I want to show my support even if it's not with them but where I live now. What do you all think? I've been struggling with this but don't want to donate to SGK if they are only lining their corporate pockets!!",
