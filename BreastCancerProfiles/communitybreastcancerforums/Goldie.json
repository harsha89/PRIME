Maybe because it wasn't spontaneous is why they weren't concerned.  They were sure it was a papilloma.  However, it may still be just that and the discharge may not be related to the cancer.  I just don't know enough yet. I'm just so grateful my ob/gyn was the one who listened to me and ordered teh MRI.  I'm praying the MRI picked up on it early and that's why it didn't come up on mammos. Thanks for the prayers,",

But both the technician and surgeon said it could be in response tot he large biopsy I had just had done last week. I pray that's all it is.  So next week I have to go in for a needle biopsy of that node to see if the cancer is in there and then a CT scan.  I told him I just want to have a double mastecomy.  I'm even thinking of having myovaries removed too.  He kept trying to tell me removing the healthy breast doesn't reduce my odds of recurrence that much or change my survival rates. Mammograms never caught my tumor it wasn't until my nipple was bleeding did someone order an MRI and ta, ta, cancer. I'm so terrifed it's in that node and has metastised through my body.   I did have a clear bone scan and chest xray. I can't stand the through of my three little girls watching me die from this. The doctor tells me I'm curable, but all I can keep thinking is that we don't know what got through the node or if I have mets. Can someone give me some hope please!  I feel so hopeless and I know I have to fight.  Love you guys.
