A week after that I started feeling itchy randomly all over my upper body but more so on my breast which was hurting. I called the paramedics yesterday morning as I had pain in my chest with a racing heart. The paramedics put the monitor stickers all over me but last night I noticed a rash. I have an appointment soon to see my gp again but should I go sooner ? Log in to post a reply",
