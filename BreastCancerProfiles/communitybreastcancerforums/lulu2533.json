Being a IIIc, I'm assuming it's going to be a bit on the high side...ugh. I also had lymphoma 13 years ago. Of course nothing like yours, but it's hard to go from getting CT scans every 6 months/to a year to NOTHING. Especially since this BC, to me anyway, seems so much more sinister. I don't know. I trust my docs. I'm just having a hard time wrapping my brain around things at the momment. Julie P.S. you can be negative and vent all you want to me :)",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2015 01:27AM - edited Jul 9, 2015 01:29AM by lulu2533 So, I just had my third A/C treatment yesterday. I actually had a pet scan last Thurs that was ordered by my BS. When I was seeing the PA before my treatment he told me my MO rarely orders any kind of scans. They give me a risk of recurrence assessment and then its just a wait and see after all my treatments which include A/C+T then 6 weeks of rads followed by hormones for X amount of years. I was really surprised by this. After I got my pet scan results, which were neg, I was so relieved. I guess I get why they don't do them. Being a 3c'er I just know that my chances of mets is higher. My question is, not sure if this is the best place to ask this but, is it better to catch mets early or doesn't it really matter? Will it be treated the same no matter how extensive it is? I find it hard to believe but I am still quite new to the whole BC scene. Does anybody else share my experience? Thanks...hope everyone is having a good day. Julie K",
