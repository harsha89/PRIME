Can anyone share their story when margins aren't clear?   I\"m also wondering if I go the bilateral route with recontruction, how much time off work is required.  (non physical office work) Thanks for any advise!

Not having clear margins and now hearing of 2 more areas to look at make the mastectomy a clearer choice for me.  But at the end of the day, I really wish I felt more certain and that everything was more black and white. I'm the breadwinner of the family, and the one with the insurance.  I know my health is the most important thing, but I can't get away from the fact that I need to have a clear timeline and get healthy and back to work.  I thought I had a good handle on everything and now find myself crying over anything every few hours.   How do you know what the right decision is? ",

The surgeon said he'd definitely do another lumpectomy, but between what was done the first time and the area needed for the next, it would leave a deformed breast.   Plus the DCIS didn't show up on the mammogram.   It's great to get feedback - and have this place to come to.  (my poor family is so sick of this subject - but are such great support.  I need to give them a break once in awhile",
