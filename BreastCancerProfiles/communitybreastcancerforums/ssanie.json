Fifteen years ago my mom was first diagnosed with breast cancer, she had a mastectomy done and some chemo and that was it. I was only a kid at the time and I didnt really know much about cancer.  When in 2009 we found out about the recurrence my heart was broken I am the youngest child in the family and I was the only one living with my parents at the time. so I was the one who went to the oncologist with my mom and found out everything. I was scared, I was crying for days and weeks. I used to go to college and just sit in the library and cry. eventually I told my siblings about what was going and so they knew. The problem is that I am starting to loose the strength and the control and everything else. I am 21 and I am already worn out and tired. Ever since we found out my grades started dropping in college I started seeing a consular at school and literally it did no help. I am the closest to my mom, we are more like best friends rather than mother and daughter.I cant leave her and I know she wouldn't want me to leave her either,since she is most comfortable with me.  Its like I am in love with her, and I cant imagine how my life would be without her. things have gotten pretty bad recently, I had to take a break from school and stay with my mom in her native country and we are not able to come back to US just because she has gotten so weak and she cant bare the long trip back to the States. she cant walk without a walker, her lungs are in a pretty bad situation and her liver is already involved. God knows how much I prayed, but I am even loosing my faith in god. Nothing good happens to our family. I feel awful for my mom, she doesn't deserve this, she used to be such a strong woman and now she cant even walk. I have been very moody and depressed recently and even my mom and my siblings have noticed it. I am so tired of my moodiness and my own behavior and this whole cancer thing. All my friends are so busy with their own lives and I cant talk with my sisters because I will just start crying. I hope posting in this website helps. Loves and hugs.... thanks for reading.

As I was reading your comments I had tears in my eyes and I felt like I met my old friends or something... It breaks my heart and it hurts so much when I read comments from the lovely moms, every word you said I could feel... I am sorry if I make you sad with my comments, perhaps your daughters are much much stronger than me. Thanks for all the advices.. I  have been feeling a bit better ever since the day I posted this, and I constantly have you all in my mind. I was supposed to move to NY for school for next semester ( It was the good old dream of mine) but I made some changes to my plans since I had to leave my mom in CA. I will be moving to FL with my mom, I am very positive about it. It will be a new beginning and she will be with her family around. Who cares NY of FL I mean at least I will be with her we can enjoy every moment. please pray that everything would work out as planned. I know I said in my earlier post that Im losing my faith in god, but honestly I think I just say that when I am mad. but I don't really mean it. I love god and I can always feel his presence in my heart. My mom is all I have in this world and I just love her so much that it hurts me to see her in so much pain. To all the moms out there.. I love you all!!!    thanks for your support.",
