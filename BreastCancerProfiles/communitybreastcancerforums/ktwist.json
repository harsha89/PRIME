I had a ultrasound guided core needle biopsy but they missed the cancer because the ultrasound didn't pick up where the cancer was. The MRI showed it clearly....I ended up having a lumpectomy which allowed the surgeon to remove the cancer.",

Also, has anyone experienced pain behind arm on back or on the back side of the arm? I had surgery only a week and a half ago, so maybe this is all normal, but I have an area that is totally numb still and the other parts on the upper arm are ultra sensitive to touch. Also, I get very sharp pains going down my arm and behind my armpit on my back. Anyone else have this? One more thing...how long until you can lift light things again? I can't seem to lift anything without pain...even laundry. Only a tiny bit of swelling. Thanks- Karen Log in to post a reply",
