You should be able to \"test wear\" a garment for an hour or so (keeping it clean etc.) to make sure it fits.  You should be able to return it if it doesn't seem right for you.  Though you can't be sure a garment is right until you wear it for several days or weeks . . .  you can get a pretty good idea if it's immediately too loose, too tight, too painful, turns your fingers blue, etc.   You can also get a sense of the variety of fabric, cut, fit, edges, seams, etc.  There are several ready-made sleeve manufacturers (Juzo, Jobst, Medi are most well-known) and each makes a few different sleevs, gloves, and gauntlets.",

Armcare.  It stays up by fitting around your back and over both shoulders like a shrug.  You can order it from their web site or from Bandages Plus.  Sigvaris and Juzo also both make sleeves that go over your shoulder and stay up by a thin strap across your chest instead of a top band.  I prefer the Armcare.  It has saved whatever sanity I had before LE.   :-) sleeveninja",

I can't find a really good therapist.   I consider myself a newbie.  I worry about an acute change due to injury/ infection etc.  But I also I worry about insidious changes, over time, caused by the very gradual tissue and nerve damage.  It can't be good.

I also notice as trunk gets worse, arm needs higher compression to feel comfortable.  I feel better when I have a few LET-MLD sessions. It's subtle. I wonder if flexi would provide a similar lymphatic \"boost\" -- and if it would be enough to keep truncal LE from progressing further or as fast. Binney - what exactly is node clearing?  Do you mean neck/ axi/ inguinal  strokes? Or something else?  Kicks- is your LE arm and trunk?  And how long have you had your flexi? How does it help you? Anyone ever use or hear of sleeves sleeve & vest from Bio Compression Systems?",

(Really, I wore one 24/7 for almost 2 yrs. until I found a day sleeve.) You can download the measurment forms from all the manufacturer sites.  At first they look really confusing but after you take a good look, they are surprisingly simple -- and all pretty much the same.  Maybe you can get your therapist to take your measurements and fill out the form and just give that to the fitter or to whatever DME company your insurance requires.  Long story, but I've done that.  As for LE in your other arm -- bullshit.  You know you are at risk from having nodes removed and you know the routine precautions.   You know what symtoms to be alert to and you have a therapist who can monitor with you. If ever you suspect something is going on in your other arm you can check it out.  I see NO reason that you are assured to get LE on your other side - let alone on a five year time table.  WTF.  That just sounds ill informed, stupid, and downright sadistic.

(Minor points compared to the burning pain I get with a top band.) KS-  In my opinion the Armcare fabric and Jobst fabric are less different in the very light compression than in the class 2.  In the heavier compression, I much prefer the Armcare fabric. I also think the Armcare is beautifully made.  upcreek - think about if you want both your arms to be covered (nice in winter, less so in summer.)  Judging from the posts above, if you are petite or have especially thin arms, the Wave may run too large. Overall, I think the Armcare would feel like a \"lighter,\" less obtrusive, garment.  ",

They fit similarly but they are quite different and they feel quite different. The Wave: The texture is supposed to provide some kind of massage action and it leaves an imprint in your skin when you take it off.  It must do something because my LE arm feels comfortable despite less compression than I usually need -- but I can't say it has \"slimmed\" or \"toned\" my normal arm one iota.  The Armcare is more like a traditional LE sleeve except the fabric is far, far nicer than any other sleeve I have tried.  It is circular knit but woven a little differently than other sleeves (including a variation at the inner elbow that is just plain genius).  They last a long time too. I'm still on my first two -- they got pilly after about 6 months, but the compression is still fine. (The Wave stretches out after less wear - maybe due to the texture?.)  If you need compression for both arms (Binney!), and the Wave is not enough compression (or not the right kind of compression), I could imagine it would be very simple to cut 2 Armcares in half (at center of back) and sew the 2 long sleeve together (at center of back).   I can't say enough wonderful things about these sleeves.  They saved my sanity (what there is left of it.)  I'm holding back beacuse I'll sound like an ad if I say everything -- and also because everyone is different.    I believe TLSCo.does let you return.       ",

I find there is a little \"gappiness\" just where the wave fabric tapers in to meet the cuff - but nowhere else. It's very slight: I see it, I don't feel it.  I just tried the pinch test and I can just about pinch a teeny bit of fabric exactly where the wave meets the cuff - that's the only place I can pinch anything. I have not had any problems.   But - all of my swelling is from the elbow up.  That's why I wondered of the cuff might be problematic for people with forearm, wrist, or hand issues.  I prefer small because the fit is a little more snug overall, I prefer medium for the length. I can wear either.  In the Armcare I can only wear medium - small is way too small. Hope this helps . . ?",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2011 02:13PM - edited Feb 28, 2011 04:01PM by SleeveNinja LindaLou - awesome post !!!!  I've been wearing the Armcare since April 2010.  I have long arms, my swellling is elbow-axilla (and trunk).  I need to wear compression 24/7 and I feel best with heavy compression.  I was wearing a combo of custom Juzo Healastic CCL 2 & a wrapped Solaris Tribute for daytime prior to getting the Armcare. (I couldn't tolerate a sleeve with a top band (too painful) so I'd been wearing my Tribute (bandaged) day & night for over a year.)  Here's my experience w some of the issues you mention: For whatever reason, donning the Armcare was intuitive for me. I find it much easier to don than regular ready-made sleeves (I was always punching myself in the jaw!) and much, much easier than my a custom.  I usually use a rubber glove on my other hand to adjust the elbow a little after the sleeve is on.  I love the elbow patch.  I got a large burning red lump at my elbow crease from other sleeves and I don't with this sleeve. I thought the fabric was delicate when I first got the sleeve but I find it is very durable. It resists pilling far longer than other sleeves I've tried; it never stretches out; the compression has yet to \"fatigue.\"  (This is particularly idiosyncratic and not something you mentioned: my LE arm is hypersensitive to cold - anything below 65 degrees starts to burn and the colder the temp., the more it burns.  Circular knit sleeves intensify the feeling but the Solidea sleeves improve it.  ???)  I wear the shoulders kind of lowish (lower than the photos on the box.)  I just put them where they feel comfortable and they stay - I never have to adjust the Armcare once it's on.  I find some clothing fabrics want to \"cling\" to the shoulders (a long sleeve cotton knit for example or winter static) so that I adjust the clothing sleeves occasionally.   I also find the short sleeve side a bit snug. As in, by afternoon I notice it -which I'd rather not do- and it can feel mildly annoying in hot weather.   I experiemented with my oldest sleeve.  Using regular scissors, I cut the \"curve\" around the front axilla opening to make it larger and I also cut the bottom of the short sleeve off.  After cutting, the axilla curve is more open (tho. not as pretty) and the end of the sleeve rolls up.  Sometimes I roll it up so I just have the thinnest circle of fabric as an anchor. I can't say the cut garment feels better than the intact garment - but it feels good just to have a change.  I only wear hand compression occasionally.  Sometimes I wear my glove or gauntlet tucked in, sometimes out - either way is fine for me.  BTW, the wrist of the Armcare looks like it might be bulky but it isn't.     Sue is great - I met her at an airport luggage check-in counter of all places.  She was wearing an Armcare and I was wearing a bandaged Tribute and we both did a, \"Lymphedema??!!\" double-take.  We ended up talking nonstop about our LE \"journeys\" for the next 3 hours and I ordered a sleeve from her the next day. I look forward to hearing your test results!  I hope it's as good for you as it is for me.",

Psychic pain is another story.  I was deeply depressed for a good (I mean a bad) 20 months after my LE dx.  I couldn't even talk about it -- I sure couldn't post anything here.  I was dealing with some other difficult life stuff (there's always something) but not with other bc dx or tx.  April is practically last week - give yourself a break, give yourself time to grieve and to heal.  Both take more time than we ever think they \"should\" take.  LE is profoundly life altering.

I find it totally comfortable and effective. I was going to post more about it on the Love Lymphedivas thread.  (I posted a review on their website - my first online review of anything, ever!)   The part that goes over/around the shoulder and around back is not meant to have any compression or therapeutic effect and it doesn't.  But there is no constriction of the upper arm or under the axiila. The fabric is wonderful. And the elbow is a miracle of textile engineering.  It only comes with one compression sleeve /side - but I can imagine a simple alteration to make 2 of them into a 2-sleeved version for those who wear compression on both sides.  And yeah, it kills me how garments are always modeled by perky looking gals with arms like Audery Hepburn's.  ;-)  Ninja",

Kchreve, do you anchor your kinesiotape over your shoulder or on your upper arm?  I tape horizontally across my upper chest (sort of axilla to axilla but not quite under my arms.  I do same across my back if I have a helper.  (Is there a picture thread on kinesiotaping anywhere?)   I've tried 3 ready-made day sleeves that extend over the shoulder - Juzo, Sigvaris,TLSco. All of them avoid any gripping on the upper arm (to hold them up).  None of them provide compression over/around the shoulder (I though they did until I saw them in person) though it might go up a teeny but higher on the back/outside of your arm than it does on a regular sleeve. So much about about LE is so variable hour to hour and person to person. Adds to the frustration. - Ninja  ",

Especially important because we are so different and need those options. It shouldn't have be so difficult (or so costly) to discover the things that work for us. (Preaching to the choir here!) Thank goodness, my first therapist ordered the Solaris Tribute and I have been very happy with it from the start.  I added the outer jacket after a couple months and the increased compression felt and worked even better for me. So I don't need to find a different night sleeve, but there are times when I want a little more compression than Tribute w OJ more conveniently than Tribute w bandages. (Flying would be an example of one of those times.)  I'm thinking Compresleeve might filI the bill. I'll add my \"review\" if/when I ever try it.  Big smile - Ninja ",

Not too tight, evenly graduated from wrist up, decreasing pressure as you go up. ????   Anyone?",
