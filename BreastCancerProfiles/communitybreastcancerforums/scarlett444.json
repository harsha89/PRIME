What has me concerned is the one which was positive was a regional node found in the removed breast tissue.  None of the sentinel nodes were positive. I had neoadjuvent chemo AC/T to shrink the tumor off the chest wall.  Decided on masectomy vice lumpectomy.  Thank goodness, as positive node would not have been discovered unless whole breast removed. My question is, what should I do now?  The regional node was ECE and also LVI was noted. Thanks for any input. Scarlett  Log in to post a reply",
