They did more than usual because of my history.  15 of them!!!!!!  I look like a pin cushion so not a happy girl.  I am going to the surgeon on Friday to discuss my options.  My personal decision this time is to go for the mastectomy right away cuz I cannot do 3 surgeries in 6 months again.  I hate the waiting game.  They did not do radiation last time so don't know about this time but I am ER+ so taking tamoxifan.",
