When I was a little girl, I had naturally curly hair, so I guess I've got it back, except silver instead of blonde.  I'm not used to seeing myself with silver hair yet, but this odd feeling shall pass just like all the other odd feelings that are associated with this awful disease!  The plus side of losing my hair was that I didn't have to shave my legs or underarms for months!! -Theresa",

LOL  That's pretty bad. Meece - are you looking for something else or just enjoying life?  My income is really the \"roof over our heads\" income, so I can't walk out, even though I'd love to do it.  We haven't had much luck with the lottery either. :-) The other thing that bothers me is my lack of concentration/memory since BC.  It wasn't all that great before BC, but now it's really in the toilet.  I don't know if it's a side effect of tamoxifen or just chemo in general.  I've been done with chemo since May, which is when I started tamoxifen.",
