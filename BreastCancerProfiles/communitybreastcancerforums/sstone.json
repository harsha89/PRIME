This past August 2010, I received a letter stating that there was something irregular with my mammogram. I immediately phoned to reschedule another mammogram and I was told that it may have just been a improper picture or machine issue. After them doing another mammogram, they did see something and had me stay for an Ultra Sound, this too showed a dense mass but radiologist did not feel it needed any further attention, ie: biopsy. Instead I was instructed to return for a follow up in 6 months. Today, Feb. 18, 2011 I returned for the follow up mammogram and they had also scheduled me for another Ultra Sound. Technician took the mammogram films in to Radiologist to read and then returned and said, \"all looks good and no ultra sound is needed\". Sorry for making this sound so long, but am scratching my head how a dense mass could be present in both Mammogram & Ultra Sound and 6 months later, mammogram is normal. Is this a normal situation?

I will definitely request copies of my previous records and get additional eye's to review and compare. It is my understanding that changes in a persons breast is not abnormal, but want to put my mind at ease. I was also informed that a younger person can have dense mass appear in mammography...maybe I have \"Young Breasts\". Trying to keep this situation on the lighter side, but not ignoring the fact that 6 months ago there was something to watch and now there is nothing to be concerned about. God Bless you all........",
