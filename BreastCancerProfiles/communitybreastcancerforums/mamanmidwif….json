(and very timely i might add - able to get back to work for the afternoon) as usual after the scans i get into a very \"let go and let God\" type of place. it a place where i have no control over the results so why worry (i know i am strange). when i work with med students or midwifery students who want to run a lot of tests i always ask \"what are you going to do with the results?\" i want them to think it through. so that is where i am now, if i have progression, Reggie, Stable, or Please NED what am i going to do before seeing the onc next thurs? nothing.... I know i'm strange, but that's me.

I can SCUBA dive on trips with my instructor because he helps me with my equipement so i don't get hurt (and under the water weight doesn't matter lol). i guess every little bit helps, but i jogged today and now i want to sleep for the rest of the day. and i feel guilty about that i feel like shit everyday, but i have so many trips i want to do, that somehow i keep going, but it hurts. but truly that's the only way i could get through my daysplanning little trips, and allowing myself to relax on the trips. while on the SCUBA trip between the dives we'd go to a beach club where everyone else would have a snack, and i would find a beach chair and sleep.... you amaze me i couldn't do 3 yo at all (told my 21 yo and 18 yo that I DO NOT need to be a grandmother before I die thank you very much) i feel bad enough about my 10 yo she's definitely not getting the mother that i was to the older 2. we all do the best we can. here to listen",

I am doing well got 2 fills (175cc each time) and had a discussion with PS  about where we were trying to go since @ the operation he had 300cc in and really i donm't have much to match it up too. well he agreed and now I am having my exchange/ lift on other side 3/9/11. I feel really good and he was encouraging me to go to PT so i will start next week, and hopefully that will help after the exchange. I need to get back to SCUBA diving (want to do a trip in june). and a whole lot of  other things on my Bucket list. Keep up the good work ladies",
