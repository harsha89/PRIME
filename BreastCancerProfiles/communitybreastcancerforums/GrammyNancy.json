I am on herceptin and I've been told that it can slow hair growth and I think it has.  I will finish herceptin the end of July and I'll see if it really takes off. Girls, enjoy rubbing that peach fuzz, it seemed to change overnight for me.  Congratulations on finishing chemo!!!!! Nancy ",

(Chorus) And He will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.

You need not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day; though thousands fall about you, near you it shall not come. (Chorus) And He will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand. For to His angels He's given a command to guard you in all of your ways' upon their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone. (Finale) And He will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.",

The Love/Avon Army of Women is here! http://mailing.armyofwomen.org/rd/9z1z3ied7vmbh74oe3k5l0kd95n802lo42vj6ufsj3o The Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation and the Avon Foundation are incredibly proud to be kicking off this year's Breast Cancer Awareness Month with the launch of a movement that will change the face of breast cancer research forever: the Love/Avon Army of Women! This morning, we launched the Army of Women and its ambitious goals on The Today Show! It was an amazing experience to be on The Today Show Plaza surrounded by breast cancer survivors and advocates wearing Love/Avon Army of Women T-shirts and pendants. The energy and enthusiasm these women showed for this new initiative reverberated throughout midtown Manhattan ... and beyond. Within minutes, women were on our website joining the Army, the media were calling, and scientists were emailing us to learn more about how they can be part of this incredible partnership. As Dr. Susan Love, President of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation, told viewers this morning, for years she has been frustrated that very little research has focused on finding the cause of breast cancer and how to prevent it. It was clear to her that what was needed to move us beyond a cure was an initiative that would get scientists to study human tissue and real women by making it easy for them to find women who were willing to participate in their research. The Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation found the perfect partner for this big project in the Avon Foundation, a pioneer in funding breast cancer research in women. Now after a year of planning, this vision - an Army of Women - has become a reality! Our goal is to recruit one million healthy women of all ages and ethnicities, including breast cancer survivors and women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer, to take part in the breast cancer research that will move us beyond a cure ... and help us eradicate breast cancer once and for all. This is YOUR chance to be part of the research that will end breast cancer. Sign up for your sister, mother, daughter, granddaughter, best friend, and the woman you met last week. Breast cancer has been around for decades, but it does not have to be our future. We can be the generation that stops breast cancer once and for all by figuring out what causes this disease and how to prevent it! SIGN UP TODAY! http://mailing.armyofwomen.org/rd/9z1zhtjajmu5hqkcqg4bafgjci3k9nsiiahdijftgdo JOIN THE MOVEMENT TO GO BEYOND A CURE! Our goal to recruit one million women starts with one ... YOU.

If you go to the Going through Chemo thread you will find several threads for people going through chemo right now or who have gone through it. I've found this board to be very helpful, informative and compassinate. I'm halfway done and it is doable. Hang in there....you are in my prayers.",

Have some funny light movies and books. Popsycles are good to have on hand. Bendable straws are good so you can keep sipping your water while in the prone position. Be sure to have a themometer so you can keep on top of your temperature. Have crackers and light healthy snacks on hand to eat when you just don't feel like eating (it's good to eat something every couple of hours). I completed chemo in June of last year and want each of you to know that it is doable.  My prayers and thoughts are with everyone as you start your treatment. Hugs, Nancy",
