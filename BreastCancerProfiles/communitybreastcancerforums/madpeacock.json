The heating pad I folded in half and tucked it under my arm. That way the chest and arm both felt warm and relaxed and I really believe my swelling and weird tingly feelings have subsided a bit. ",

My lump incision and SNB incision are very close to each other and the PA said there was no room for drainage.  I teach water aerobics - a very physical class - and I am out of that for a few weeks, at least. My arm feels tingly and numb though my range of motion is good. My incisions are sensitive today after all the bandages came off yesterday. I have been power walking since 3 days after surgery - I'm type A when it comes to exercise - but wonder if I overdid with arm motion, etc.  I only had 4 nodes removed, so I'm hoping lymphedema will not be an issue. ",

I was home by 10:30 a.m. and have been hanging out and had a nap. The anesthesiologist gave me a patch behind my ear to ward off nausea because I almost always barf after anesthesia, and so far - it works! Wonder if one could use these for chemo nausea instead of yet another pill?? The worst part - and is really only annoying - is the chest binder they put me in to keep everything compressed. Doesn't fit me quite right so it keeps slipping down from the incision areas. I'm pretty thin through the middle, so maybe it is made to rest on fuller figures. Regardless, tug, tug, pull, pull.   Hope you all rest well tonight and heal quickly! ",

Concerning bone mets - is there any tendency for a metastasis to go to an OLD fracture site? I had a stress fracture in my left femur about seven years ago from running (had plantar fascitis at the time and was unconciously turning my foot out to avoid the painful spot, thus torquing the femur...and...crack).  I'm a little over one year out from stage IC IDC. Was HER2+ on biopsy, but onc retested it TWICE because it didn't \"fit the rest of my picture\" and it came back negative both times. We even discussed at my most recent appointment that maybe the biopsy got the one bit that was HER2+. Mentally, I packed up all the worry and stowed it away in long term storage. I'm not a worrier/anxious at all, so once treatment was over, I was done and ready to get back to life.  Recently, however, the left femur has started to hurt. I remember the bone pain when it was broken - not an easy thing to forget - and this is bone pain. SO different from muscle pain/strain. Not nearly as bad as then, but pain. I am active - I run, cycle, and teach an aerobics class - but nothing to excess. Maybe it is my 50 yo body telling me that I'm not as young as I used to be, but now I have to wonder if something else is going on.  So, long question short, would an old fracture have a higher risk of mets, being a so-called \"weak\" spot?  Again, thank you for your thoughts. ",

My RO retired, so I had to see someone new at my six month follow up, but she was very good! Had to see our ENT today, as they THOUGHT our daughter had a ruptured eardrum after an infection. Turns out she didn't. I saw him 10+ years ago for supposed lymphoma - turned out negative. He did sinus surgery on my DH and has followed our daughter for chronic sinus infections, but he is the BEST.  Wish he handled any of my other problems!",

My MIL lives with us and she is extremely fatalistic - always anticipates the worst that could happen in any situation. I had a good MO checkup recently and my husband told her and her comment was \"Are you telling me the truth? She's not hiding something from me?\" Sheesh. When our daughter was very small (and my MIL still lived by herself) she would call and if we weren't home she would leave a message and say, \"Well, I hope you're not at the hospital with the baby.\" Uh, no.  Just out living our lives.  Hi Valerie! Sounds like you do have a lot going on. I went through genetic testing also since there is no history of BC in my family on either side. However, my father's side are Ashkenazi Jews, so they were worried about the connection coming from that. Thankfully I was BRCA negative. I would have had the same recommendation of BMX and hysterectomy. Sounds like your MO is a lot like mine - wants to make sure all the bases are covered before just slapping a generic treatment course on you. Mine also retested my HER2 - which was positive on biopsy - because she didn't think it \"fit\" the rest of my picture and it came back negative TWICE - so my treatment course was altered significantly.  Thank God too for good docs! ",
