I had some skin issues and some fatigue but not too bad.The skin issues was a burned area on my clavicle and some pretty bad itching on my chest. Hydrocortisone cream worked well for the itching, and silvadene was amazing for the open burn. It cleared it up in just a few days. I have a good disability policy through work which let me stay home for the 10 months of treatment and not have to work through it. Once Rads was over I felt a little tired for a few weeks. I went back to work exactly 1 month after my treatment ended. I'm sure you'll do fine as well. I started my tamoxifen at the very end of rads, so we would know what SE's were from rads or tamoxifen. I've been on Tam for almost 4 months now and no SEs!!!!! Good luck to you! ",

Since then it has continued to get really red, almost a burgundy color and just started peeling this evening after my shower. Also something I haven't seen on these boards  yet. I have an itchy raised red rash on my right upper back.(the same side I'm getting treated on) The area is about a 3x4 inch square. I was totally surprised to see this. I didn't think the radiation went all the way through and out the back. I thought the rad beams went just through your breast and just far enough into your chest to get your lymph nodes. If it does go all the way through is my lung getting damaged??? Thoughts anyone...... Wendy",

Good thing the cancer attacked my bigger breast.

I think you'll find it much easier. Good luck!",

I could literally feel an ache in every muscle in my arms and legs. Mine started about 2 weeks after finishing chemo. I was pretty sore for about 2-3 weeks and then it got better a little every day, just like a true workout, until it was gone completely. Hope yours gets better really soon.  Wendy(too)",

I was told that my appt would last 90 minutes including the RO appt. I got there and apparently someone double booked the rad tech. She was clearly not happy about having that happen and felt the need to mention it several times like it was my fault. Because of that she did not take the time to explain anything that she was doing. I just laid there as she worked on and around me and all of a sudden after just 15 minutes I was done. The time I was there including RO appt was less than 35 mins. I sure hope, in all her hurry and frustration that she got the field and markings right!!! I'm not real sure how comfortable I am about going there now. Anyway, I guess I'll go to my first treatment and see how it goes....  Hope everyone is doing well this weekend. Hugs to everyone.",

She said to put an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on it which helps a lot. The rash hasn't gone away but it helps with the itch. My RO said she can give me a script for a stronger hydrocortisone cream if needed but so far the 1% cream has done the trick. Well have a good week ladies!    Wendy",

The first time it was down 4 days so they set up a rad plan for me on their other machine and then worked on Saturday so I could at least get 3 tx in that week. The next time it broke they were able to do me on the other machine because I already had a plan set up.  Now I'm on my last week  5 boosts that should have started yesterday. I got there just as the machine broke again. But because my boost plan is new and only set up for 1 machine  I'm behind again. I had plans to go to see my sister this weekend and stay for 9 days, I may have to put that on hold.......damn! These machines are so specialized and complicated with many moving parts it's no wonder they break down.  I'm hoping I can have 2 tx on Friday 1 early am and 1 late pm so I can still go see my sis.
