I am really scared of what the outcome may be - this weekend has been the worst ever, trying to be positive and think it will all be ok - then thinking but what if...........I came across this site yesterday....I feel that if it is bad news you guys will be here for me, at least I hope so. I am in England and don't know if there is anything as wonderful as your support group. I am very scared very anxious, is this normal. many thanks Tigerlili001",
