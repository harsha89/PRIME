Had the wire localization prior to the procedure.  My wire localization consisted of 4 sets of wires placed in a rectangle shape outlining where they were going to cut.  Placing the wires was not painful, although it did take a long time as the dr had to get a new picture every time he moved each of the wires up or down.  During the actual biopsy the Dr removed a golf ball size mass.  Results won't be in until Friday.  Hoping for good news.  Yesterday I came with flu like symptoms, chills, fever, sore throat, etc.  Anyone think it is related to the procedure or just coincidental that the fever, chills, etc arrived 4 days after biopsy.",
