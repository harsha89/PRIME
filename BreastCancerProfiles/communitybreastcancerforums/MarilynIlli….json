I am 68 and had a mastectomy ( right side) without recon August 1st. Tape sensitive: for me the tegaderm tape applied after my biopsy hurt when it was removed, so I asked for something for sensitive skin for my i.v. Bra: I bought a cami with a zip front and pockets for drains. I was not given a surgical bra at the hospital so I wore the cami home. Yorkie: I don't have a dog, but my cat is a comfort. He seems to know I can't sit on the floor and brush him as I used to. Sleep: I sleep on the hide-a-bed in the living room. I piled up pillows on my right side so I can't turn right in my sleep. I'm positioned so that I can turn left (good side) to get out of bed. Bend over: I read a tip to practice squats. I practiced squats all the month of July so I wouldn't have to bend forward. Occasionally I have trouble with vertigo. Supplies: the nurse gave us paper tape to take home. We bought a box of surgical dressing to cover the drain site. Arm exercises: the nurse said to start exercises after the drain is removed. Will your sister be with you when you are discharged from the hospital? The nurse went over a lot of instructions about the drains, etc. with me and gave me handouts to take home. But it was overwhelming and I needed my husband's help to sort it all out at home.

I had my post-op with my surgeon yesterday. My drain has to stay in another week. My husband and I messed up by not pressing the bulb flat to improve suction. Oops! I have developed a blister on my incision that needs more neosporin to heal. My pathology results are in. I'm happy to share that my 3 sentinel nodes are clear! And the Pleomorphic LCIS is confined to the area already identified through the MRI biopsy. Best of all, nothing invasive was found in the rest of my breast! Yes, I agree the after effects of anesthesia are challenging. I was given fentanyl for the pec block. Not bad, I just felt a little sleepy. Then I was given an IV dose of dilaudid after the surgery. Wow! That felt awfully good. I didn't like the norco. It made it hard to urinate. I have tramadol at home but am trying to use it only once a day. If I take it at night, it gives me nightmares! Lsunshine, sorry you are worried about your surgery. I know, I was really anxious. I think it's great you enjoy boating and boxing. If I may suggest-- try to fill the waiting with as many activities and family time as possible. Maybe spend some time weight lifting so your muscles will be in top shape. I did a lot of stretches, especially with my arms overhead, to get ready. Good luck. Candyapple, glad to hear you have 2 drains removed and clear lymph nodes. After 10 days most of my discomfort is in my armpit and pec area. Sleeping on my back is not as hard as I thought it would be. I've taken some walks, had 2 visits from family and friends. This Wednesday my husband drove me to my hair stylist for a shampoo and blow dry!What a treat! Best Wishes!",

I had my annual mammogram of my good breast and the radiologist said it looks normal. I don't need to see my surgeon for a year. She said the occasional stinging in my underarm is normal. The incision is healing well. I only wear my prosthesis when I go out. My knitted knocker is more comfortable. Thanks again, friends, for all the online help and support. You are the best! Hope all are well.",

I have had 2 MRI guided biopsies in April and May this spring. Like you, a focal nonmass enhancement was detected through an MRI. (My mammograms have been clear for 25 years. I'm 68.)The nurse called me with the results and I asked for a copy of the pathology report. I discussed the pathology report with my gyn who encouraged me to get the biopsy. The radiologist who performed the biopsies was excellent. He explained everything and took the time afterwards to show me my images on the screen. He told me what day to call the doctor's office for the results. Also the nurses held my hand when the biopsy samples were being taken. Very comforting. Ginger67 makes a good point. Waiting is the hardest part. I have been seeing a counselor too. It helps to talk about it. Take care",

I had a one night hospital stay and one drain. My doctor said she was pretty confident the sentinel nodes would come back clear so she only removed two. The surgery and hospital experience went very well for me. This was my first time having general anesthesia and I was anxious! Although I did experience a sore throat, I had no trouble with nausea. The doctors and nurses were so professional, compassionate and caring that I felt safe and not too nervous! I also had a pec block. I experienced very little pain. In fact the most pain came when a phlebotomist came into my room at 2:45 a.m. To draw blood from my hand. Ouch! She couldn't draw from my left arm because I still had an i.v. My discomfort is minimal at home. I find myself hunching up my shoulders and am trying to relax them. My husband is helping with the drain emptying procedure. In summary, it was easier than I had feared! I bought a seat belt soft cover to make the drive home smoother and 2 small heart shaped pillows to use in the hospital. Very helpful Best wishes, everyone!",

Mine felt like there was a clenched fist in my armpit some days. I didn't get my drain removed until day 18. At that visit the nurse gave me a pamphlet with exercises to start right away. I asked for a prescription for physical therapy and started the following week. The physical therapist is giving me arm massages to help stretching. I read a suggestion to spend some time squeezing a small rubber ball once a day. Today starts my week 4 since surgery. My arm feels better but my range of motion is not back and I cannot reach anything on a high shelf without a tugging feeling. Good luck to you",

Thanks, MommyErin, For the words of support, I am scheduled for tomorrow. I agree with many who have commented that waiting is most difficult. I cried all day the day before my first MRI biopsy, but felt more in control once there was a plan in place. For me, getting a 2nd opinion was liberating. I felt like I was taking an active part in this journey. So far I feel pretty calm about my surgery. I've had a lot of time to think, read, talk to friends and acquaintances, etc. Thank you for all the helpful comments and threads on this website. What a helpful, encouraging community of people from all over facing breast cancer. A friend recommended a guided imagery cd called:Meditations to Promote Successful Surgery. Have you heard of it? I ordered it and have already listened to it a couple of times. I don't know if I will be allowed to listen to it in the operating room, if not, I'll listen to itbefore and after surgery. Take care, everyone, Marilyn",

I reread your posts and it looks like most are scheduled for the last 2 weeks in August. If I missed anyone, good luck and best wishes. I bought a cami to wear home from the hospital. I am wearing it overnight too. I like the pockets for drains. Right now I'm noticing a chafing on my skin above my armpit. Ouch! So I unsnapped the bra strap where it seems to be irritating my skin. I'm still taking one tramadol a day for pain. The discomfort is all in my arm, not the incision area. My surgeon cleared me to use Aleve now which works better for me than Tylenol. I'm not stir crazy yet, but am looking forward to drinking a nice draft beer again! There is an Irish Pub in our neighbood within walking distance that I will visit after I kick the pain pills!

Continued wishes for healing for those who have had surgery and I wish calm and courage to those who are scheduled for next week! My surgeon removed my drain today! It didn't hurt at all. She asked me to take a big breath and before I could even let the breath fully out, the drain was out! She also did some more work cleaning up a blister on my incision. That did not hurt either. I can totally relate to those of you who are anxious about general anesthesia and surgery. I was too. Especially after a bad experience with conscious sedation during a previous biopsy. For me, asking lots of questions helped me calm down. I also bought a guided imagery relaxation cd and listened to it in the pre-op room and also in my hospital room. I found my doctors and nurses so compassionate and caring that it really helped me stay focused. Also my pre-op room was so busy with the sentinel node injection, pec block injection, and good conversations from the nurses, and support from my DH, that time flew and it was time for surgery before I knew it. For me, I appreciated being awake when entering the operating room. I looked around a little, saw my surgeon and anesthesiologist and felt safe. Good luck, everyone, let us know how you are after next week! Hugs",

It freaks me out to look at it! I've been going to PT twice a week and doing the exercises at home. I found a YouTube video from a nurse in London that gives a routine to stimulate the lymph system and prevent lymphedema. Cyclegal, I've gotten 2nd opinions twice. The first time I called my gynecologist's office and the nurse practioner recommended three hospitals in my area that are breast care centers. The second time when the pathologist diagnosed Pleomorphic LCIS, I went for a 2nd opinion because I wanted another pathologist to look at the slides. KatjaNL, I've read that mastectomy surgery takes between 1 to 3 hours without reconstruction. I asked at my pre-op appointment and found out my surgeon had booked the OR for 2 hours.
