Maybe visiting the breast surgeon will be better for your mental health though.  MRI's can show a lot of false positives, which would be nerve-wracking.  Maybe you should call the surgeon's office to see what to expect -- is this a consultation or a biopsy?  If it's a biopsy, will it be excisional (where they put your under anasthesia and remove the whole lump) or core needle (where they use a needle to suck up a sample of the tissue)? As a lot of women here will tell you, 80% of breast lumps are benign.  I just had a big scare with a fibroadenoma.  Two doctors had told me it felt just like a cyst, so I dragged my feet to the breast center for a mammogram.  Then suddenly we were talking about a solid mass of \"abnormal size for benign growth\" and \"borders irregular upon magnification.\"  It had grown more than I realized because it had grown downward into my breast where I could not feel it.  Still turned out to be benign and I feel the amount I have learned about health and breast health was perhaps worth all the scares.  You are absolutely doing the right thing by checking it out and since it's growing, it needs to be removed anyway.  In the meantime, I hope that you are able to stay busy and keep distracted.  Don't feel bad about asking your doctor for anxiety meds if you need them :)",

My best lesson from all this waiting is not to research.  The ensuing sleepless nights and days of worrying are not worth it.  Knowing every single possibility is not empowering; it is terrifying.  Call your doctor for sleeping pills or anti anxiety medications, stay busy, tell a few close friends and try to have some fun.  If your diagnosis is bad, you will have plenty of time to discover everything about it.  Stick around these forums for support instead - the ladies here really are helpful!",

I am scared just because of how large the tumor is.  From everything I've read, it would probably be a Stage III cancer, which is terrifying for someone my age.  It is so hard not to let my thoughts race ahead to the worst.  I got through today okay, but now that it's night time, I can feel the panic setting in.  There are so many what-if's!  It helps to read all the posts here.  It sounds like everyone who's been in this position has been equally terrified. After reading some other posts here, I can see that I've been lucky in how quickly I've been able to schedule all these tests.  I was able to get in for a mammogram and ultrasound in less than a week.  After the mammogram, instead of having to wait for a formal report, they let me speak directly with a radiologist to hear her preliminary thoughts.  Since I was visibly upset, the radiologist then helped me schedule the biopsy appointment just 3 days after the mammogram.  Within an hour of my appointment, a nurse from the office called to outline *exactly* what the biopsy would be like and she patiently answered all of my very detailed questions.  The doctor who is performing the biopsy even agreed to call me with the results even though they will arrive on the 4th of July, when the office is closed.  These are clearly caring people and part of a dedicated breast center at my local hospital, so if the worst comes, I think I will get good care.  It is still scary, but it's soothing to remind myself of these things.

Cysts can cause pain as they fill up and other types of benign lumps can press on your nerves if they're in a bad place, which can cause pain.  My fibroadenoma hurt with my menstrual cycle, which is one reason I plan to have it removed.  Your doctor can probably biopsy all of the lumps at once, probably with a need core procedure that uses a large needle to suck up small tissue samples from each lump.  You will get a numbing injection beforehand, which is the only part of the procedure that hurts.   I think I have learned a valuable lesson this summer about ignoring breast lumps.  I had mine for a year and half before I got it checked out.  There were some extenuating circumstances, but at least half of it was laziness and disbelief that anything could be wrong with me.  It turned out that I could only feel a small portion of the large lump that had grown in my breast, and I did not know that the deeper part had more irregular borders.  It still turned out to be benign (a fibroadenoma), but I will not be doing my own watch-and-wait on lumps anymore.   ",

I would have regretted driving myself to my biopsy.  The seatbelt in my car tended to rub painfully against my biopsy spot, and controlling it while also steering the car would've been challenging.   If your biopsy incision will be on the outside of your breasts, you might also have to contend with your arms brushing against it as you steer.  Plus, it's just nice to have someone waiting for you to coddle you when you finish :)",
