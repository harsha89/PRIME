I missed a week or more of 2 meds for depression and anxiety and it all came crashing in on me at once. I called and just got my prescriptions from the pharmacy. I can't believe I let that happen. I was so comsumed by this chemo that I didn't keep track. I still feel horrible with side effects and it's been 6 days. \"This too shall pass.\" I called the oncs nurse this morning because I am at wit's end. She explained the reasons for some of my main concerns, so I'm trying to get through the day. Any words of comfort are welcome. Thanks.",

Currently I'm a little scared of getting my hair cut short on Tuesday. Actually more worried about my reaction and also when I lose all of it. I hope I wear my bald head with pride. I don't feel ready for all of this, but who is, right? Log in to post a reply",

I take meds daily and due to insurance changes, decided to save some money and order the 90 day supply from Express Scripts. With all of the commotion of my first chemo (7/10) I ran out of 2 different medicines. Everything came crashing down on me right along with my side effects. I called my doctor and got the meds I needed, but I have to keep reminding myself that it will take awhile before the meds work. My husband seems so frustrated. He took off of work today to be with me. I hate making him worry, but it scared me, too. I know he just wants me to get back to work, but I'm not ready.",
