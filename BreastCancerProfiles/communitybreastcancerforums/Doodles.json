Just got back from my check up, and my fibroadenoma has grown since the first time I had it looked at, so now they recommend removal. Reading everyone's responses has made me a bit less nervous about it. I have quite small breasts so I really hope it's not going to leave a dent, and the fibroadenoma is located high up my breast, so I hope the scar won't be too visible.",
