    "Content": "ShyBlonde wrote: I was just diagnosed with a breast cyst. I want to remove it since it has been causing me pain and seems to be growing. The doctor did not give the option of drainage, so I am wondering if this is strange for being diagnosed with a cyst or not? The mass is hard and firm and was highly difficult to receive a biopsy sample from. Bent a needle, another just bounced off of it and they finally got a sample with a shorter needle. The doctor said the fine needle is not as accurate as a core sample, which is what they tried (and failed) to do at first. They also said it was more of a solid appearance on the ultrasound, and they believed it to be a fibroadenoma based on the second ultrasound. What can I expect for the procedure to have a cyst removed? How long will the recovery period be? Will it leave my breast deformed since the cyst is so large? Log in to post a reply",
