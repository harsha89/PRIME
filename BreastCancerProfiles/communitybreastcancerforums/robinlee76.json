I'm telling you girls if you can not find the surgical camisole look into the fanny pack.  All my doctors have thought it was such a great idea when I do in.  It fit all 4 of the drains at the beginning just fine and it is not uncomfortable.  Another plus was i only cost $8.  You only need it for a couple of weeks so I could not see spending the money on the surgical camisoles. Another good thing came today.  I got my reconstruction surgery scheduled. YAY!!  It is scheduled for April 19th.  Since it is a 10 hour surgery I will be the first one in at 7.",
