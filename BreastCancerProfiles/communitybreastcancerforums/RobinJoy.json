My lump was fairly large and growing. My surgeon said a core biopsy could miss some cancer (there could be just a few cells surrounded by scar tissue)and the only way to know for sure if it was or wasn't was to take it out. I don't regret having it removed.  I was lucky it turned out to be b9.  I hope yours is too. good luck with whatever you choose to do.",

But it's good to get it checked out thoroughly.  It's not something you'd want to gamble with.  Make sure that your doctor orders a sonogram. Mammograms for younger people aren't quite as effective. MRI's are good. But many health plans may not cover it and they yield a lot of false positives.  Good luck and try not to worry. I know easier said than done.",

Trying to stay busy and not think about it too much.  It's going to be pretty hectic afterwards. The next day we're taking my youngest to the train station so he can go on his camping trip and that night there's a bureau of land management meeting about what they intend to do with the old gold mine that sits above Randsburg about a mile and a half from us. It's full of arsenic, cadmium and mercury. I've been going to all of the meetings. But I might sit this one out and rely hearsay.  Have you scheduled your biopsy yet? ",

So my breast surgeon asked to have my blood pressure under control before I had surgery. The meds made my bp normal during my doctor visits and low otherwise. Well, during my surgery my BP was way too low and they had some trouble waking me.  The point I'm trying to make is make sure your blood pressure doesn't get too low with the meds. And I would like to echo what the other ladies have said. Please consider changing surgeons. It doesn't sound like a good idea to remove your lymph nodes when they may not have any cancer cells.",

Getting the whole lump removed will give them a more complete pathology so you will know exactly what it is.  I know this is very scarey. But it's doable. Better to have it out now and they may not have to do any other surgeries. Sorry to hear about your pup, too. Good luck and know that you're in my prayers!",

Mine grew quickly, had a blood supply and looked very much like it could have been cancerous. When the pathology report came back, it was b9.  My breast surgeon said that if he had to diagnose based on appearances, he would have said it was cancerous. I don't regret having it removed. It's good that your GP is taking it seriously. I think MRI's are a very good idea for someone as young as you. Genetic counseling sounds like another good idea. You're on the right track. Good luck and try not to worry too much. Easier said than done. I know. It sounds like you have a good team on your side and that's the most important thing.",

Anecdotally, it seems much higher as I've searched through the internet.  This has led me to even more questions.  How many of you diagnosed with BC were told you had dense breasts? Was your bi-rads rating 1, 2 or 3? At what stage were you when you were diagnosed?  What type of tumor was it? And finally, did you have to fight to get an MRI or biopsy or were your doctors supportive?  Log in to post a reply",
