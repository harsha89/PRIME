    "Content": "Maureen75 wrote: I had a 3D mammogram 8 days ago and was informed today that compared to my baseline from 2012, there is a dense area and nodule they want to look at further. Scheduled in 5 days for more images and ultrasound. I didn't get the report yet and didn't know what birads meant until reading here, so I didn't ask. I then talked to my gynecologist office and the nurse said (to calm me down) that the report didn't say it was suspicious of malignancy and try not to forget it could be nothing. Help me interpret that? I can't talk to anyone again until Monday now! Log in to post a reply",
