Try to visit Dr Furhmans website and feed your wife with lots  of greens. I myself eat kale onions, lots of mushroom, berries and seeds. God bless you and I will pray for you. Stay positive",

Dont worry I read last time a pregnant survivor underwent chemo and was able to keep the baby. And the baby was born healthy and no side effects at all. If I remember it right when she posted her post her daughter is already ten. Also she refused to abort the baby and she said she was glad with her decision. Keep the faith",

I will definitely give you the name as soon as I get home .Since I have my first cycle I never felt anything at all. No nausea, headache, stomachburn and I sleep weel. The only complain I have is constipation and I used dulcolax which I will not do it again. It throws me off very bad. I will drink prune juice everyday and thatwill take good care of it. I also eat bittermelon to help for my RBC and I did not inject the neupogen that they told me to help out my WBC. I dont want no bone pain so far so good and I am working. I said to myself if the second cycle will be like this then I can say bring it on. I knew this site is very helpful compared to this american society helpline. You dont get much from those people. Also I eat moslty soup and a little bit of rice. I eat everyday squash, brocolli and some  asian green leaves.",

I just reciv my AC 9/9 and I dont feel any side effects. I wonder when  those side  effcts will kick in. Its just scary waiting for an unknown. When you guys lost your hair? I have a very long hair and I hate to see this go so I cut it and I  will donate it. but I dont know when I will start shaving though.I sleep well last night and I dont feel the nausea. I drink alot to flush it out. I put fresh lemon in my water fron our backyard. well any advice from those whod been there will be appreciated.",
