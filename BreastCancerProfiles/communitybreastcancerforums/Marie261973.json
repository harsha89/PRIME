      "Content": "Marie261973 wrote: hi everyone I am new here and have been a little confused.In November I had my first mammogram because I was approaching my 41st birthday. They saw a solid mass in my left breast and I had to go for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.They saw the same thing.I went to see a doctor at the breast center and she said she would like to do a core biopsy. I had that done and then waited for the results.When I met with the nurse practitioner  she told me it was benign.I was so excited .She checked me with an ultrasound and said....wait a minute.Apparently there was a spot near the clip that didn't look touched?she also said she was concerned about the vagueness of the pathology report.All it said was benign breast tissue.She told me that I was def. going to need to come back in3 months.Just the other day she called me and said that the surgeon wants to either do an excision  Biopsy or another core biopsy.I am leaning towards the excisional. Has anyone had a similar experience to this?thanks:) Log in to post a reply",

The pathologist had just written \"benign breast tissue\" on the report from the last core and the surgeon said \"she knows that is not healthy tissue.\"So to put this all to rest I have opted for an excisional biopsy. Hopefully I will be in that 80 percent that are benign. ",

I was nervous before the surgery but the hospital was great! My surgeon first wanted to see me in six months but then said we could actually wait for one year. :)thank you for the moral support!",

But as I read your post I remembered she also mentioned that they saw some hardening of the breast tissue and that was not mentioned by the pathologist.We will see what happens.My follow up appt. is 3/28 and we are supposed to discuss all this then. I hate the waiting and appreciate your support.",

No other dressing was needed. My surgeon told me that to her naked eye it looks like a Fibroadenoma but we will need to look at it under the microscope to confirm that.So I will eagerly be waiting for a benign result. I am 98percent relieved :)",
