You should probably get a second opinion on everything. Also, there are a lot of treatments out there for cancer, whatever stage. If it is bad, and we're not sure it is, you do have options. As everyone is saying, the waiting is the absolute worst part of this journey you are now on. Once you start talking to doctors and other survivors, things will get better. And there are always exceptions. My friend's mom was told 26 years ago she wouldn't last the year b/c of bc. She's still around today.   Good luck. ",

She had mastectomy to left breast plus radiation and chemo. She is going to be 53 in January 2009.   Every 3 months, her onc tests her blood for high cancer markers. Everything was clear except this time around. The markers were off the charts. She had a bone scan and they found questionable \"spots\" at the base of her skull and on her hip. She is having other tests as well.  The doc thinks it is a reoccurence but said if true, it is likely quite early. What can be done? Can she get chemo again?  Thanks Dx 4/18/2006, DCIS, Stage 0, 0/4 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",
