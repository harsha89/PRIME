I go for my simulation on Tuesday the 24th, and then rads start Nov 30th, the monday after Thanksgiving. I'll be getting 25 treatments plus 6 boosters. Radiologist also said that I'll be on my back with my arms over my head. He tested my mobility this morning since I feel a little tight after my second lumpectomy and node removal a few weeks ago and he said I'm good to go. Told me to keep exercising and stretching as much as possible every day. The nurse that went over everything with me also said no try not using aquaphor only because it's so messy. This office swears by Medline Remedy Nutrashield. Anyone use that? Thoughts? :) I'll be picking up some later today if I can.",

I guess I get it over with quicker, right?? biscuits, I'll be working full time throughout this. I worked full time through AC +Taxol/Carbo so I'm hoping that I can hold up with radiation too. I know many others have too! Other than tomorrow all of my appointments are between 7am and 8am so I have enough time for the 30 min drive to the office.",

I went to the bathroom and grabbed a face cloth and put a cold compress on it for a few mins, which seemed to help.

The sim is definitely the longest one and after that they're much shorter. 2mnykds, did you figure out the difference in American/Canadian protocol? I believe the difference might be in the number of boosts? My RO told me that there was a study (either Canada or Europe I don't remember!) where they did 8 boosts instead of the American normal of 5 and they found it helped. So instead of 5 I'm getting 6, to bump up closer to the study. Who knows.",

I meet with both my Oncologist and surgeon next week to discuss next steps and timeline. I've already met with the RO a few months ago just as a meet and greet so will need to touch base with him again soon too. aj, ditto for me too in regards to being really active. I cut down my races to 1 or 2 half marathons a year but was doing crossfit 5x a week before all this crud. I've only been able to head to the gym lately like once every two or three weeks or so. I get tired and exhausted just from the warmup! I do go to the theme parks a lot though with friends (I live in Orlando) and I make sure to walk as much as possible. A few weeks ago I hit 8 or 9 miles in one half day and felt really good so I was happy. Stupid stupid chemo/cancer. Ugh. You're amazing!",

By the 5th week I had to just give up and I cut it short and threw the wig on. I would still recommend cold caps to anyone that asks though. I honestly have no idea why it didn't work for me. Maybe the caps weren't cold enough one week, or it was the addition of the carboplatin, who knows. Ive had friends on the regimen and they still have a ton of hair!

I finished last Tuesday and it's amazing how my skin is already looking soooooo much better. I did have boosts so the full area hasn't had rads on about two weeks but woah. I just look like I have a nice tan in that area. My skin is definitely rubbing off, if that's how you'd describe it. Not peeling but just coming off if I rub etc. I'm tempted to exfoliate the area but don't want to irritate it. But I'm so happy to be wearin bras again! :)  Here's me ringing the bell!",

My whole breast area is honestly almost back to complete normal. My cleavage area has already gone back to normal color and matches the non radiated side. Under my boob and by my armpit is a little tan but it honestly just looks like a normal beach vacation tan. The boosted area is definitely a little darker but not red anymore at all. The skin is really dry in the boosted area still but I just slather on the lotion and I'm good to go. I did use an exfoliating brush to lightly scrub over the entire radiated area. The flaking and dry skin was driving me crazy. I'm sure that's not recommended but I didnt see any adverse effects, etc. Glad to see everyone is holding up well!",

Hopefully the race is before I start rads (still don't have a definite date yet) and I've just been planning on walking most of it and jogging in parts. I've just felt so run down on AC + T that whenever I did try to run I couldn't make it 800m without needing to stop. I've been walking though so hopefully that helps, and my friends said they'll walk with me too.",

And it didn't go away, got slightly bigger, and I can now visibly see it in the mirror. Went for a mammo and US today and I was in pretty good spirits but obviously still worried. The doctor came in and is 'very concerned' about the mass, which was described as superficial and about 3cm wide. Also he said he saw something in a lymph node he wants to check out. I already have an appt next week with a general surgeon for the biopsy/next steps. I made the mammo and the biopsy appt on the same day after leaving my obgyn. But now I'm just freaking out.

Hopefully that will be the only surgery, and then followed by radiation. Dr is also going to biopsy the lymph nodes during the surgery to rule out anything else.",

I've had sentinel and axillary nodes removed (18 total) about a month ago and my MO has been stressing that I can't lift anything over 10# EVER AGAIN due to the lymphedema risk. I pretty much had to hold back my laughter as the insane idea. I'm 35 and you don't want me to lift anything over 10# for the rest of my life? That might be more of a death sentence than cancer. My surgeon as well as radiologist both think that's insane and told me that I NEED to continue to work out and continue doing what I used to do but just to ease back into it. Even when I told them that I CrossFit, they both didn't seem phased in any way. Told them I do olympic lifting and they didn't seem phased again. Went to a physical therapist last week just to get stretches and massage ideas to try to prevent lympedema I also brought up the CrossFit stuff. She got really quiet and pretty much said that I might have to look into other forms of exercise if I ever start to get swelling...have I ever tried yoga??? *sigh* Next week she's going to measure me for a compression sleeve and I will GLADLY wear that to the gym every day, as long as I can keep on going. Cancer has already taken so much from my damn life this past year there's no way I'm going to let it take away one of the things that I absolutely love and am passionate about. There are professional CrossFitters with lymphedema due to past surgeries (mostly in their legs from what I've found out) and they know how to control/manage the symptoms without any issue. I know not to be stupid and jump back into throwing 140# over my head tomorrow. But is there anyone else out there that still does high intensity exercise without any issue? There are women that NEVER get lymphedema so why should I kill another part of my life if there's only a chance I'd get it?
