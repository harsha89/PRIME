      "Content": "Aug 31, 2015 03:30PM - edited Aug 31, 2015 03:32PM by evie510514 Hello, I am a 64 yr. old female who lives in S. Louisiana. I too am Stage 4 with Mets. on the spine, thorax & pelvic. I was diagnosed in 2011 & I am currently taking Faslodex injections along with Xgeva injections once a month. For those that don't know, the Faslodex is to stop the production of estrogen & the Xgeva is to strengthen the bones. (I was surprized to learn that a women's body continues to produce estrogen even after menopause.) I had been taking Tamoxifen prior to that & my last scan showed it was no longer working so my doctor stopped it & put me on Faslodex. My husband does everything for me from cooking to washing clothes. (Yes, I am blessed.) Just taking a shower is quite a chore for me. It is like every joint in my body hurts constantly. At first I thought it was just my Rheumatoid Arthritis flaring up but it doesn't go away like it used to & that's why I think it is from the Faslodex. Nothing I take for pain seems to help much either. If I'm not sitting on the recliner watching TV, then I'm more then likely, coloring. I have taken up pencil coloring just to keep myself occupied but now have lymphedema in my right hand & arm so I'm trying not to overwork it. Since April of 2015 I have colored 7 adult coloring books & am working on another one right now. It's addictive but also a good pass time for me that keeps my mind busy. I also read novels but have started ordering the ones with large print since I don't \"see\" the way I used to. Sewing for my granddaughter is also something I love to do but I don't get out much to buy sewing supplies. I'm glad I found this site to post on. I feel like I just spoke to a good friend. ",
