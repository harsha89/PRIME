(some of the 13 siblings managed to survive).  LOL!  I have no sisters.  My dad's only sister has many fibrocystic bumps, ect , but so do I.  I guess no matter what I will be happier getting a mammogram done because I have so many lumps honestly I can't tell when to see a Dr or not.  Of course if anything strange happenned I would (as I have for the nipple bleeding).    My dad's mother died of lung cancer around age 65-67.  They all would only go to the doctor if something was wrong, if My grandmother had a lump I don't know if she would even know to go check to begin with at the time.  It was the late 80's and she never learned to drive.     I am probably in an HMO..its tricare and yes you have to have a referral by your PCM (PCP) to be seen anywhere other than on the base.  I will call them tomarrow and ask to schedue an appointment or put a T-con in with her.  If she is willing to work with me I am sure she would have no problem with ordering the ultrasound as well?  Considering the circumstances I mean?  Well I will ask them.  I hate to go in there.   Well take care and thanks everyone",
