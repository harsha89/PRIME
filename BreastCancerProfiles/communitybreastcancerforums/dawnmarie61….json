When I looked the \"rash\" up on Internet, I ruled out shingles and thought it might be IBS. I made appt next day with dermatologist who once seeing my \"rash\" stated I had shingles. I was shocked, as I wasn't sure I'd ever had chicken pox and I am 55. Dr scraped to verify shingles (2 week process, which came back positive) My breast itched and hurt like nobodies business. My breast was twice the size of my left, and so very heavy (reminded me of when I had daughter and milk was in) I don't remember my nipple being overly itchy, but it just didn't seem right. My symptoms lasted about 2 weeks and 2 months later I have just a few spots where I know the rash was. My issue is this.....I just had my annual mammogram a week ago and got a phone call yesterday that they see something in my right breast. I will have another mammogram with ultrasound in 2 weeks. I had lumps in left breast about 10 years ago. My question is....would shingles leave a \"scaring\" which could show up on mammogram? until I have the follow-up mammogram and ultrasound so wondering...... Many thanks to anyone who could let me know anythingðŸ˜†",
