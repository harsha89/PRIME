After they did the 2nd mammo, they said there was an area of asymmetric tissue on the right breast that they didn't think was anything major, but sent me for an ultrasound to be safe. The wait was horrible. I was so worried, couldn't sleep. Finally I went in to see my Dr. who went over the mammogram report with me. Turns out it stated this asymmetric tissue had been evident on mammograms since 2005 (the year I turned 40 and the year I started having mammograms). So, it's been there for a long time, and for some reason the radiologist this time around was being cautious and wanted to check further. I finally had the u/s done and it came back clear, thank God. I go back for another u/s in May and then if that is also clear, I will go back to regular mammograms in October. I know how hard it is to wait, and I pray that the u/s will clear you of any problems and will show normal dense breast tissue. The waiting is truly the hardest part, and the worrying is incredible. Please know people are thinking of you as you go through this, and I will pray that you will get a good outcome soon.",

Thanks so much for all your warm responses. My question tonight is about an on-and-off ache/pain I've been having in my right underarm and chest area, not really in the breast but kind of at the top of it. It feels like it *could* be muscular, as when I drop my chin to my chest I can feel a tug and pain in the same area. Sometimes, like right now, it is aching quite a bit and even seems to run down my arm to my pinkie. Other times it goes away completely. Could this be lymph nodes? I have felt under my arms and nothing appears to be swollen and there are no lumps that I can tell. I don't believe there is anything different under my arm, that I can see or feel anyway, just the achy pain that comes and goes. I should tell you it  has been this way off and on for about 3 or 4 weeks, but I attributed it to starting on my elliptical machine again after a long spell not using it. I don't use it a lot as I usually walk to work, but I know there were a couple of times when I was pushing/pulling quite vigorously on it. But if it were muscular, shouldn't it be getting better? Could my constant worry/poking/prodding be keeping the ache coming back? Would a cyst cause pain in that area? I am stressing out so much about all of this. Sorry to seem like such a worry wart, but this has been the longest week of my life, and I know from reading all your stories that it might get longer if I get sent for further testing.  Has anyone else felt this kind of ache or pain. I also read it could be a symptom of peri-menopause of all things. Yikes. Log in to post a reply",
