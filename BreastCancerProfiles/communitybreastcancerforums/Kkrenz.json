My sister had bc, stage 2 when she was 30 and is doing well today. My mother was diagnosed at 51, stage 2. She is also doing well. We are all BRCA negative. I was told by the genetic oncologist at Mayo that we likely have a mutation that has not been discovered yet. It was very wise of your sister to get the MRI. I wish I would have known to do this. I thought I was covered with my mammogram....not so. My mammos have always been clear, and continue to be clear. Perhaps if I had an MRI, they could have caught it early. Best wishes and stay warm.

Celebrate life - I used to take Milk Thistle, and then read that it could have effects similar to estrogen, so I stopped.  The information from Dr. Google is confusing sometimes.  My MO once told me to not take any supplements as there are no studies to show if they may or may not interfere with the drugs that I am currently taking....but I feel that I should be taking something to help my liver.   ",
