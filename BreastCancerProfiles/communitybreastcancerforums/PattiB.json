I haven't had any drinks since the weekend before the 1st chemo.  The first week I wouldn't waste the calories since nothing seems to taste right anyway.  Same with Chocolate and candy and junk food - they are my main vices!!  Edy's grape flavored fruit popsicle have become my new friend, I limit to 1/night because I can tend to binge, I might sneak a 2nd if I'm not satified with one. ",

I have not had the desire for sex in a while either.  For me that has been a weight issue not a hair loss/lumpectomy/cancer issue (but this probably doesn't help). ",

Yesterday, I decided I just could not deal with the wig all day at work, so I went in wearing one of my Planet Buffs.  The kids kind of hung back, (could have been my imagination, but don't think so).  A few asked if I was bald.  The principal and I decided we would keep it simple, didn't want to use medicine as a reason, since most kids do need to take medicine and didn't want them to be afraid of that.  We decided to say my hair was really thin from treatments and this was a covering.  Funny how several parents that wouldn't really mention knowing anything about my \"cancer\" felt they were able to ask \"how I was feeling\", like it was ok because I was making it obvious.  Another parent, who had chemo several years back for a different type of cancer was proud of me for being able to come to work this way since she felt she couldn't have (she didn't lose all her hair, it was just a lot thinner) during this conversation both of us were tearing up.  Another parent (a Dr. or intern) told me how she is thinking of going into oncology and looking for a fellowship in that field, we had a nice conversation about her son's reaction to her mother's hair loss from cancer.  Again, I was just was really tired of trying the itch my head with a wig on.  Also, just didn't feel like myself, when I would get compliments (wearing wig), it was hard for it to feel they were genuine because of how I feel wearing the wig (which I can't really explain).  So I'm thinking my wig will be a room decoration for the duration of being bald. Kellerka - We are on the same schedule and treatment and I'm so sorry you are having so many SE's from the treatment.  We will be 3/4 done on Wednesday, that is my focus.

But I appreciate your story about the parent/kindergarten class at school.  Working in elementary school office, and as you know I gave up on the wigs a while ago.  The students do say some interesting things, especially when they 1st see you, then they are just fine.  When they ask (and some will) I tell them I'm having treatments that affect my hair.  Do I have hair? I tell them I do have some but not much.  We do have 2 or 3 students that have in the past few years lost a parent or guardian to a different type of cancer, we also have a few that have moms going through BC treatments recently or now, too.  Some from this group have asked and I do tell them but more delicately (can't really fluff over it for them), one did ask (after he ask if I had no hair) if I had cancer and I did tell him \"that I had cancer and the treatments are to stop it from coming back\".  He just said Oh and left it at that.  Our guidance couselor said to keep any answers simple and only answer what I'm asked.  Went to Race for a Cure Breast Cancer Run/Walk Sunday in Philly at the Art Museum where Rocky was filmed.  Did the 5K walk with DH, DD, a friend and her DD.  THey have it every Mother's Day.  So many participants, what a great event!!!!  Was beat or sore when I got home so I napped/or was a couch potato the rest of the day. Laurie - Congrats Laurie on being done!!! I will be having a CAT scan on Monday because I will be moving on to the radiation phase of my treatment and they will need to review that along with my past films, etc. to set up my radiation plan. Dawnmom and Pikle - Thanks for the Yahoo's!!! Diane - Tomorrow this time we will have finished chemo treatments - Yeah!!!!!  I have a new cell phone so call if you want, my appointment is 9:40 with Onc and probably won't start chemo until 10:30-11:00 and my battery should be fine.

So glad I am done chemo and Mom of Boys I am definitely following your advise of taking it easy for the next three week as the chemo is still in the system and causing possible SE's.  My Onc and NP said after the 3 weeks should be out of the system and hair may start growing during rads, 1st peach fuzz, then who knows. Next on my agenda a CAT scan on Monday with Onc Radiologist, then radiation 5 days/week for 6 weeks to start 5/25 or 6/1.  Then appt. with Chemo Onc on 6/24 about Tomoxifin to start 1 week after Rads.  Then follow-up in 6 weeks to check on Tamox SE's.  Woo, even though Chemo over this seems never ending.

Beth P - I too have many aches and pains, hip, feet, aches in the chest/breast area from radiation.  BS says it could possible be arthritis related.  Had a bone scan in March, that came back negative for cancer.  Did find out that when I fell on the steps last August I did fracture 2 ribs.  So that explains the pain in my right back rib cage.  I also have slight pain in my from rib cage under my breast area.  Definitely bring all these things up to onc and PC doc at appts in mid July with each of them.  I also have what I'm thinking is Tennis elbow.  This started in the winter when I was doing some indoor training for dragonboating.  The Tonic water definitely works for the leg cramps, it is the quinine and my NP had recommended a 1/2 glass every night before bed.  The Chemo/Tamoxifen induced menopause has given me many hot flashes that are probably the reason I wake up so much during the night.  I am doing a trial for BC survivors that have Hot Flashes and Univ of PA where my BC docs are.  The Dr. heading the trial is a FP and also does accupunture.  The trial is to see if accupunture helps with hot flashes.  Four scenarios: Real accupunture, fake accupuncture, gabapentin (a drug also called neurontin), or placebo gabapentin.  I was randomly chosen for the gabapentin or placebo drug trial.  Just started taking the Drug/placebo on Wednesday, starting on 1/day gradually increasing by next week to 3/day.  I did want the accupuncture, but maybe I am on the real drug and it may work for my flashes. Have a great 4th and/or weekend.  So great to \"catch up\" on all the news.",

(in the city sometimes a 1-1 1/2 hour drive depending on traffic), the admin. assist of my Dr. tells me that my onc. (who is pregnant and probably delivering sometime next week) is sick, was in but went home, my NP is home with her sick son.  She tells me I can reschedule, so I get teary and tell her \"I feel something\" and was counting on this appt.  I get another Dr.'s NP, who checks me out and sends me to radiology for an ultrasound, I have to get a mammo prior (needed to warrant an ultrasound).  Radiologist tells me she sees no difference, plus most recurrances don't happen the 1st year, but this is inconclusive I need to see someone who (knows my breasts).  I reschedule to see my onc., the office calls one day later and says I better see my BS instead, but welcome to also keep rescheduled appt. with onc. (I say why waste both our times and cancel with onc.  Hallelujia - just got home today from BS appt.  what I'm feeling is changes due to the radiation. (changes can occur for a couple years in some patients).  Also additional breast tenderness is actually breast bone tenderness, again from radiation or possibly arthritis and is normal but a nuisance.  So, being my emotional self, I felt very much like an idiot, paranoid patient and as usual got upset with myself.  My BS is wonderful and assured me she likes seeing patients with false alarms and that is why she is there.  Oh, and prior to my appt. my onc came out to the waiting room to check in on me and apologize for not being there on my regular appt day.  She is beaming and ready to be a mom.  So I had great new today and hopefully no more \"flashbacks\". ",

Beth P - How are the leg cramps?  Hope the Tonic water has helped.  We have something called Bitter Lemon by Schwepps, it has quinine in it too.  I think it tastes much better. Tanesha - congrats and glad you and the baby are doing well. I now have been having a problem with my blood pressure and have been told to monitor it regularly.  I am prehypertensive and stage 1 most times I take it.  If it doesn't go down by Oct. my PC Dr. will most likely put me on Blood pressure meds.  I have been told by both PC and Onc to LOOSE WEIGHT.  Next appt. with be in a week and 1/2 with a rheumetologist to discuss my aches and pains.  My daughter will be going back to college in 2 weeks :( .  We have been shopping for her apt. a lot lately so between gym, shopping, cleaning, and dinner.  Not much time for the computer.

Anyway life has been a bowl of lemons lately, just got word my job has been changed from full day to 1/2 day as of next school year.  This means I will have to pay significantly more towards health insurance - basically I will be working for health benefit with bearly any extra cash in my pay.  My husband is a self employed carpenter and affordable health insurance sucks.  Any ideas on how to make lemonade?  Sorry I'm just venting, school district is making cuts to us little guys and not everyone has been told yet, so I can't vent anywhere else yet as we are all on Spring break and not every school employee affected has had the \"meeting yet\".

We will have to PM and exchange cell phone numbers and info so we can be sure to to meet up. Michelle - sorry you had trouble with your port and that you are going through this again, but glad the chemo is not as draining this time around.  You can join the team I am on there is no charge but they do want team members to try to fundraise for the Cancer Support Community organization.  To continue the program they must recoup their costs.  If you are interested and want to do it next year you must attend 3 or 4/of 8-10 indoor training sessions near City Line Ave. Then in May we have 2/month river trainings on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month until the race in October.  Have fun in NC ",

Didle20 - we are definitely on the same schedule, I am doing every 3rd Wednesday, my 2nd is also on 4/1, and taking Thurs and Friday off from work as well.  I also feel the same about the wig, but working at the elementary school, I definitely need to have hair on my head.  I did go on-line and looked at the buffs and will probably order some.  They seem to be no fuss and have several options for how you can wear them. BUFF ? - How do they run as far as size.  My head measures 53cm, which could be a junior or regular.  I'm worried the regular may be a little big for my head.  My plan is to try to find a store that carries them to try out before ordering a bunch.  I think REI carries them so planning on going tomorrow to check and see if they do have them in the store to try.",
