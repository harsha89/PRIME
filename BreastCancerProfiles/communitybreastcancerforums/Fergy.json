When I was going through my testing process I was looking for people with B9 experiences.  There were a few that were going through the testing process at the same time I was and most of them got the cancer diagnosis.  I actually felt guilty when mine was B9, it seemed selfish of me in some way.  Not that anyone made me feel that way, it was all in my heart.  I will be hoping for a B9 result for you as well.  Sometimes the constant surveillance seems like a big disruption in our lives but it just means that if we ever do get cancer it will most likely be caught early. I read the post of women with DCIS that receive diagnosis, opt for BMX, get reconstruction, no chemo, no radiation and get on with their life and I think \"Yep, that is why I go for my checkup regularly and do SBE\".  If I have to get breast cancer I want it caught as early as possible. Good Luck and keep posting.  I have come a long way from being hysterical and worried to death 3 years ago to \"yeah, whatever\" today.  Also reading about so many survivors helps ease the fear too.  BC is no longer a death sentence for most people.  My cousins wife was diagnosed 6 months after my scare and she died 2 years after her diagnosis.  She had a very aggressive cancer, which is rare, and she had complications after her mastectomy that delayed her chemo treatments.  And still I don't get concerned because I know she was a rare case.  ",

I was told that sclerosing adenosis presents like cancer and cannot be diagnosed without biopsy.  So unfortunately, you will have to have the biopsy in order for them to know which it is. I am going for my annual physical next month and I have a new, very small, lump so I am going to ask for a diagnostic mammo and ultra sound.  If I get a BIRADS 4 again it will be tempting to just say it is probably sclerosing adenosis again but I don't think I would want to gamble and take the chance that it might be cancer. Most hospitals will let you pay in payments, interest free.  I am self employed and pay for my own insurance so I have a high deductible.  My hospital let me pay over a 12 month period.  I later found out if I had the biopsy done at a different facility and paid cash without involving the insurance it would have cost me less out of pocket.  Hope this helps.",

Stangely, having the thermography done gave me a sense of comfort since I am so skeptical of mammorgram results.  I think doctors rely too much on them and they give a lot of false negatives and false positives as well. My cousins wife in the UK had her mammogram in June 2009, nothing showed up.  December 2009 she found a lump and was diagnosed with breast cancer, fought for 2 years and died December 2011.  When they went back to look at the June mammogram after her diagnosis they saw nothing.  So it makes me wonder why are we ONLY doing mammograms every year?",

Interestingly, the technician that did my imaging is a breast cancer survivor as well.  She said that is what caused her to change careers and start doing the thermographic imaging.  She had a normal mammogram and an abnormal thermal imaging so she pushed for ultrasound and MRI and that is how her cancer was detected.  She had lumpectomy and chemo and gets her mammogram and thermal imagining done annually and stressed that the more data we have the better we can advocate for ourselves. I guess the thermal imaging will always be contraversial but as I said in an earlier post it gave me some comfort knowing that my symptoms could be due to excess estrogen in my breasts, mammogram, US and MRI cannot measure estrogen levels in the breast only thermography can.   Come July I will be there for my annual mammogram and will discuss with my doctor the excess estrogen in my breast since I am not on HRT and am post menopausal.   ",

I have had 'busy breasts' for years, had a total of 5 biopsies over the years with the last one being a stereotactic biopsy in 2009 due to calcifications on mammogram.  I was diagnosed with sclerosing adenosis, a benign condition that increases your chances for some cancers.   I have been on an annual mammogram schedule for 2 years.  About 6 months ago I started having a pulling sensation in my right breast, along with increasing sharp pains like electrical shocks.  I have had the sharp pains before but never this annoying pulling sensation.  I have very lumpy, ropey breasts so it is difficult for me to find new lumps or ropes.  Consequently I am not very good about doing breast exams. I have my annual check up in June, will ask for a breast exam and get my script for the mammogram.  It was suggested by a member on this board that I get the Thermal Imaging done so I did.  It did not show any unusual vascular activity and I was given a TH-2 (low) risk rating.  My Hormonal Grade was 3 which is high and the report says \"Some cancer does not produce suffiecient heat to be seen on thermography, recommend follow up thermography in 1 year\"   The Hormonal grade said that it describes the level of estrogen activity in my breasts which may be associated with breast pain, breast lumps and/or increased risk.  Which I found to be odd because last year I had hormonal testing done and was told that my ovaries are no longer producing estrogen and my estrogen level was so low it was negligable.  So how do I have high estrogen levels in my breast? momoschki, I was just the opposite of you, I was relieved when I received the results but now I am unsure again.  Like you I never intended to use the thermography as a replacement for mammogram and fully intended to get my clinical exam and mammogram done this summer.  However, now that I have read this post I think I will ask for an ultrasound too.   I feel that there is something wrong but cannot detect if it is gutt feeling or fear.  In 2009 I really felt for sure that the biopsy was going to come back postitive and thought well if they missed something then it will show up again.  But I have not had any microcalcificaton since then so I am leaning toward less of instinct and more of fear.   Thanks for sharing this.  I had posted that I did Thermography on another site but didn't get any feedback.  My post was pretty much ignored.  I am guessing that most women don't approve of it.",

At any rate, I am going to my PCP tomorrow for my annual physical and will get my annual mammogram and ultra sound next week.  I will discuss the estrogen dominance issue with him as well.  By the way it was my right breast that I had a biopsy done on 3 years ago for microcalcifications and was diagnosed with sclerosing adenosis.  It is also the breast that I have found a new pea size lump in that has not grown since I discovered it about 2 months ago. Please share with me what your report says and how it aligns with the mammogram and/or ultra sounds you have had.",

The reason I am writing is because I received conflicting information from the medical personal when I was going through testing etc. and was pretty sure that I had some type of cancer because of my BIRADS 4C results with pleomorphic microcalcification clusters and the reaction that my doctor had to it.  They got a really good sample of my calcifications and my new surgeon said he believed they got most of them. I am confident that my follow up mammogram will show no changes and no need for another biopsy.  I feel that I wasted too much time preparing myself for a negative outcome and then felt guilty when I got a benign result and another lady on the discussion board received a cancer diagnosis.  My suggestion is to stay positive and don't prepare for a negative result until you actually have results.  As hard as it is to do, don't let your mind wander to dark places while waiting for test results.  Most of the time the results are B9.  I hope this helps.",

My last mammogram was a BIRADS 4C rating, did they tell you what yours is?  I got my report from the radiologist and read it myself.  If you have a biopsy it is recommened that you get a copy of your pathology report too.  I had one surgeon tell me everything was negative.  I didn't feel comfortable with her and got a second opinion only to find out that I have a pre-cancerous condition.  That doesn't mean that I will get cancer it just puts me in a higher risk category but it is different from \"negative, negative, negative\" like the first surgeon told me. There are a lot of women on this website that have been diagnosed and who frequently monitor these boards.  I am sure one will jump on soon and give you more detailed information.  They are very knowlegable and I personally found this discussion board a great source of information and comfort while going through my diagnosis.  Most of the women that were posting at the same time I was got benign results so I think the 80% benign fact is pretty acurate.  What I learned from this discussion board is don't panic and don't get too convinced of the outcome until you actually get a pathology report after a biopsy.  I wanted to be prepared for a cancer diagnosis and I know now that you don't need to be.  If you have a biopsy done and you get a cancer diagnosis you have time to digest everything and do your research before making a decision on treatment.  Radiologist recently started using digital mammography versus analog mammography so they are able to see more calcifications than they used to.  All studies show that there are more biopsies being performed due to calcification detection today than ever before because of the digital mammography.  Just take one test and one step at a time and try not to panic.

Fergy There are two situations that I was referring to in my previous post.  One was a woman that knew in her gut that something was wrong and got a B9 result.  She was correct and later she was diagnosed with IDC.  The second one has had so many biopsies that her breast are scared and out of shape now.  She wishes they would just find an early stage of cancer so they can take care of it and she won't have to keep going through the agony of biopsy and wait like she has for several years.  Hopefully this elaboration makes my previous comment not seem so \"ridiculous\".",

Now I think to myself, plane crashes happen with greater frequency than BC diagnosis do but I think nothing about getting on a plane and flying half way around the world for vacation.  So I need to have the same attitude with mammograms, ultra sound and biopsies.  From now on I assume that they will be B9 or follow up in one year and live my life.  Like I said before, if I do get a diagnosis of BC then I know where to go for advice from experienced survivors....www.breastcancer.org!",

I had a stereotactic biopsy that came back B9.  Because I have \"busy breasts\" the BS still wanted to do an excisional biopsy but I decided to take the wait and watch approach.  That was 3 years ago.  I have had clear mammograms ever since.  Recently I found a small lump in the same breast that I am watching until my annual mammogram in July.  I wish I had done the excisional when it was suggested and will if it is suggested this time.",
