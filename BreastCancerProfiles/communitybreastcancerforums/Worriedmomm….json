I'm 32, diagnosed at 31, and my oncologist feels very strongly about the oncotype test.  My score came back Iow, and she said no chemo.  I think knowing your score will be helpful in making your decisions. However, I'm still having a difficult time accepting the fact that this even happened to me. ",
