Additionally CT is really good at examining organs (like liver, lungs, etc) but not so much on soft tissues, bones and tendons/ligaments. MRI is used for those. Today, MRI is even used more often to check for spread of cancer than CT and a diagnosis of a primary cancer can be done with MRI in certain situations. PET scans are routinely used to check for spread in addition to MRI (PET shows you where to look/focus and MRI gives you a detailed view). So the CT may not have shown anything for the radiologist to comment on hence nothing in the report. Getting your mom to agree to PET and/or MRI would be good. Does she see a primary care doc? He should be able to order those for her and hopefully convince her to go for them. If nothing else it may tell you just how advanced things are so you can adequately prepare for the coming months/years. It may give her some peace with the breast symptoms too.",

I chose bilateral mastectomy with immediate natural tissue reconstruction (no implants). Very happy I did it and would do it again.

I had DIEP recon and would do it again in a heartbeat. For most ladies, the reality is far less painful than what they imagined. Pain is managed quite well with local anesthetic and pain meds. To put it in perspective for you, I was released from the hospital 3 days after surgery. I had a shower complete with washing my hair and styling it before leaving the hospital. We stopped for lunch at a Mexican restaurant and then we walked 2 blocks to the apartment we were staying in. I was exhausted by the time I got settled in my recliner but who wouldn't be? I was pain free that whole time and just moved cautiously and slower than normal. Took 2 pain pills on schedule at the apartment and had a nice nap. I did take it easy for the next 4-6 weeks. You're not completely debilitated during the recovery, but you are limited. Here's a link to one of the top centers in the country that does this type of surgery. Know that most ladies travel to have the surgery done and you can have the reconstruction done during the same surgery as the mastectomy. Thoroughly investigate any PS you're considering for recon including reviewing their before and after photos and make sure they are microsurgeons before making the consult appointment (most PSs are not microsurgeons and therefore cannot perform this surgery). www.breastcenter.com ",

First question (and you may not know 100% until pathology comes in) is do you have extensive DCIS (meaning many ducts or even just 1 duct with a lot of cancer cells in them) or do uou have invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Big difference as DCIS means it is limited to the area inside the duct and has not gone beyond the wall of the duct. IDS means it has gone beyond the duct. Its possible to have some areas of DCIS and others of IDS. Second question is what size is the DCIS/IDC. This is part of the staging as well as whether or not it has gone beyond the ducts. ER/PR and HER2 testing is also important because it dictates what therapies come after the surgery. Chemo and/or radiation can come before or after surgery or both before and after. It depends on the factors from questions 1&2. Third question, have you investigated the different types of immediate and/or delayed reconstruction that are available and options each offers for adjuvant treatment (chemo/radiation). Implants are not the only option-natural tissue reconstruction is also available which allows your breasts to stay as natural as possible as well as many other advantages. And since the tissue that is used for the reconstruction is not breast tissue it does not have any increased risk for recurrence compared to implants. Check out the Website for the center for breast restoration surgery in new orleans. It is very educational on all the different types of reconstruction available and you can see before and after pics of their work for the different types of reconstruction. Wimen travel from all over the US and the world to this group for their work-including me. (Note: no matter who you decide to use for reconstruction, make sure you've seen before and after pics of their work first and that you'd be happy with similar results for the rest of your life.) How long you're under depends on whether you're doing 1 or both breasts, immediate or delayed recon, and type of recon. Its just like going to sleep when you're really exhausted at the end of a long day. You're asleep before you can count to 10. For me at least, its a really good restful sleep. When you wake up it will seem like you just closed your eyes a few minutes before. You will not have any sense of the amount of time that has passed. Congrats to your Mom on 10 years! I'm just a couple years older than you with no immediate family history but I had other factors. We caught mine early but still opted for BMX with immediate recon for peace of mind-what a nice peace it is. I hope you have as good an outcome as i've had so far. Good luckand keep us posted!",

Neuroendocrine tumors aren't all that common in general and a breast surgeon/Breast specialist likely would not have seen this before. And just to be clear, neuroendicrine tumors can appear anywhere in the body-yours just happens to be in your breast. Going with the thought process that a neuroendocrine tumor can be treated like breast cancer is probably not a good idea. You need to find a doc that has seen/treated neuroendocrine tumors before.",

I'd say it's about 50/50 for those of us that choose to take both breasts vs just the one. Symmetry, if you're going to have to have surgery in the other breast for symmetry why not just go with BMX, desire to have a matching set, testing positive for any of the genetic mutations for breast cancer, desire to avoid having mammos and the accompanying stress every 6 months with hypervigilance from now on, having other things going on in the other breast (dense tissue, lumps, calcifications, microcalcifications), and greater peace of mind are the most commonly cited reasons for BMX when cancer was diagnosed in only one breast.

We are all different and some of us may need pain meds longer than others and/or longer than we'd like. For whatever reason, pain tends to intensify at night. That's likely what you're dealing with after your last dose of Advil/Tylenol 3 wear off. Give it time and do what you need to do to relieve the pain. On the skin irritation feelings, try Vagisil cream on it. Avoid any unhealed incision lines though. There's nothing in it that treats a yeast infection, so don't worry. It's skin moisturizers/soothers and benzocaine that's in it. It will relieve the pain within seconds. Brand name or walmart brand called vagicaine are the ones I use. The target brand didn't rub in well at all. Hopefully this helps!",

So we're checking to see what they can do to verify they didn't mix the samples or reports up by accident. I obviously was diagnosed with bc in jan. But I also was at increased risk due to rads to the chest for childhood cancer treatment (BS said kids who have rads to the chest have 80% chance of developing BC). I had skin & nipple sparing BMX with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction (natural tissue recon) in Feb. started Tamoxifen in march but ended up with blood clots in leg and both lungs and had to discontinue it. Planning hysterectomy (all the female organs) during my stage 2 recon procedure. Insurance didn't want to approve the uterus and cervix removal but the dr made a good enough argument between the radiation exposure and the Tamoxifen use + the heavy periods and the finally approved it. My sister plans to do the oopherectomy in the next 5 years (they say they recommend it around ages 40-45 and she just turned 40). Mom says she'll have it done as soon as she can after confirmation that the results are really hers come back. They say BRIP1 is still a pretty rare mutation too. Also if you inherit the BRIP1 mutation from both parents it results in having a blood disorder called fanconi's anemia. It is true that ovarian cancer is a silent killer-by the time you show symptoms and see the doc it's usually too late for them to anything to cure it. In my world that means the ovaries have to go.

Additionally there are several different panels a doc can choose from: just BRCA, just genes associated with breast cancer in general, ovarian panel, standard 16 gene panel, expanded 39 gene panels and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) panels where they find gene mutations but aren't sure if there is any cancer significance to them. Personally I cringe every time I see someone post they were tested for BRCA and it was negative. Well what about the other 7 breast cancer related genes? You don't know what you don't know and we rely on our docs who are sometimes navigating blindly with genetic testing but will never admit to it.

I opted for BMX with immediate natural tissue reconstruction (called DIEP flap). It allowed me to avoid chemo and rads when nodes came back negative.

I find that keeping those thoughts front and center help keep the darker thoughts at bay.

If you're going with no recon or implants the likelihood of combining the 2 is high. If you're going with natural tissue reconstruction then they would likely put the oophorectomy off until stage 2 (typically 3 months later) due to volume loss issues. I had BMX with immediate natural tissue recon and then had all the baby making parts removed in stage 2. Stage 2 is a much easier surgery too. If oophorectomy is done laparoscopically or lap-vag the recovery is much easier than open abdomen.",

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2018 11:00AM - edited Feb 9, 2018 11:02AM by Lula73 Here's the rundown of how travelining to NOLA for the surgery works. You also have a phone consult with their patient liaison Liz, Vickie will verify your benefits, and you will send photos of yourself via their secure email system. Vickie will tell you how much you need to pay to cover your out of pocket portion if any. When she gives you that number, and you pay it, that's it. They do not balance bill you if insurance doesn't pay what they thought they would. The center can also help you with lodging in an area hotel, you can rent an Airbnb or stayalfred or see if Hope Lodge has availability. You need about 9-10 days in NOLA for stage 1: Day 1 is travel day in Day 2 is pre-op Day 3 is Surgery Day 4 & 5 are in Hospital Day 6 is discharge Day 9 is post-op visit Day 10 is travel day home You need about 8 days for stage 2: Day 1 is travel day in Day 2 is pre-op Day 3 is Surgery Day 4 is discharge Day 7 is post-op visit Day 8 is travel day home You can always fly in the night before pre-op vs the day before and fly out evening of post-op visit to reduce the number of days. Unless you have major complications you will not need to travel back to NOLA until the next procedure is scheduled. Minor issues are handled via phone & email if pics are needed. I don't know if you have schollage kids at home or not but if you do... You can leave the kids with a trusted friend or family member or bring them with. The center has a Murphy bed in your room if your DH wants to stay with you if it's just you two. If you bring the kids, DH and the kids can visit you during the day as they would do if you were at a local hospital and head back to the hotel or Airbnb afterward for the night. The patient to nurse ratio at the hospital there is 1:1, in a pinch 2:1, so its nothing like other hospitals where 1 nurse has 10+ patients. You will be well taken care of and promptly when DH isn't there. Once discharged, you'll stay at the hotel or Airbnb until post-op visit. Stage 2 is far less complicated and much easier and faster to recover from. A trusted friend or family member can definitely travel with you for that one if needed. My dad watched my kids for stage 1 and DH went with me. DH stayed home with kids for stage 2 while my mom accompanied me. We had intended to take the kids both times but they had things going on at school that they were very excited about and did not want to miss during stage 1 and our 12 year old had started a new school (traditional school where he had been in a more montessori style School) and was still transitioning when stage 2 happened and we felt he'd be better off staying the course at school. In short, it's definitely doable and almost all of us that have gone to NOLA traveled for it. (I'm in NC.)",

AliceKo- The doc likely recommended anti-depressants for 2 reasons: 1) anytime our bodies go through stress of any sort, our serotonin, norepinephrine &/or dopamine levels tend to drop and we in turn feel pain more intensely. Taking an anti-depressant increases the activity levels of those naturally occurring brain chemicals and we feel the pain less intensely or not at all. 2) Along those same lines, serotonin, dopamine & norepinephrine are our brain's \"feel good\" chemicals. Increasing the activity levels of these chemicals in our brain makes us feel better in general including chronic pain relief for many. Its not always about classic depression. It actually comes down to different systems in our body's reacting what the body is going through and how we can reverse the process to some extent.",

I agree you\u2019re young and have a lot of years left which may lean you more one way than the other. Some people look at longterm potentials and take action toward that now. Others look at short term, do the quickest option that handles the problem for today and figure they\u2019ll tackle it again in the future if need be with more in depth treatment. There is no right or wrong answer. But there IS a right answer for YOU. An answer that leaves you with a feeling of peace. Do your own research on the options. Look at before/after photos including lumpectomy/rads and mx with implant and mx with natural tissue recon. Then once you figure out which option leaves you with a feeling of peace, stick to it (everyone second guesses themselves right before hand). You made it through chemo...no matter which decision you make, you got this!",

      "Content": "Aug 7, 2018 08:15AM - edited Aug 7, 2018 08:18AM by Lula73 I chose bilateral mx with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. Like you, I already had a fibroadenoma removed and had micro calcifications in the other breast. Being able to avoid rads by doing mx was a big plus (not everyone can do that so check with your doc). I was able to do skin/nipple sparing mx. I went into surgery with breasts and came out with breasts and a flat tummy. I no longer have sensation in my nipples but they do react to touch and cold. I have feeling in the vast majority of my breast skin so I can feel when my husband touches me. I can feel pressure too. My scars are minimal and can't be seen unless I point out where to look (I'm 10 months out from last surgery). My breasts are warm and soft. They move with me and will age with me. They look and feel natural. They feel like me because they are a living part of me. I have no regrets whatsoever on choosing bmx with DIEP recon and would do it again in a heartbeat. It can be difficult to find a PS that not only does this recon but also does it well. I traveled to New Orleans to the center for Restorative Breast Surgery (one of the top centers worldwide for this type of surgery) for it and it was 100% worth it. Women have traveled there from all over the world to have their recon done/corrected there. Here's a link to the center's Website and to a 2 part video series called 'I wish I'd Known' that is great for anyone considering mx and recon no matter where you're having it done and what kind of recon you're having done. I hope this helps!Feel free to ask any questions! www.breastcenter.com https://www.breastcenter.com/2018/05/01/i-wish-id-known-dr-ordonye-speaks-to-ypo-about-modern-breast-cancer-care/ '",

I bought a bidet seat for my commode from bidetsplus that included a water heater and a dryer. So glad I ordered it just in case I needed it as I did end up needing it. One of those extended grabber things like the guys picking up litter on the side of the road use is really helpful too especially when you accidentally flip the remote off the bedcovers onto the floor and you just got comfortable in the bed and are totally exhausted after that trip to the potty.😀",

As far as feeling like a hypochondriac-you're not. You're just being more vigilant about your health and body. After all, when the cancer started growing and for sometime after until a lump was felt or scan revealed it all of us were just going about our lives not even thinking BC could be growing in our breasts and for most hyst going to the doc when we're sick and/or routine yearly physical and leaving with antibiotics or a clean bill of health. What's to worry about? Evidently a lot. So no, you're not ahypochondriac, just vigilant.  Vampeyes-glad you're going to your regular doc for a follow up today.

I ask because all too often the regular PS will say someone is not a candidate so they get your business. A regular PS is not equipped to evaluate for DIEP candidacy. In addition to DIEP there is also SGAP, stacked flap and TDAP flap. The website for the docs at NOLA has some great information on DIEP and the other flaps. They also routinely do them successfully on women of all shapes and sizes including thin women. I've read through the LD board and did some research on it as well. It does sound like its a nice option if you want an implant and need the LD muscle to hold it in place, but you do so at the expense of weakening your back. All of the decisions around BC are tradeoffs. One of the best things to do is research on your own to make your decision and don't take a doctor's word as truth on something they are not an expert in. Good luck! www.breastcenter.com ",

      "Content": "Sep 9, 2017 12:11PM - edited Sep 9, 2017 12:46PM by Lula73 Experiencing similar here. DH just put it out there that by not even trying to make something happen and just expecting it to come roaring back that I was being selfish. At first I was very offended and upset and felt like he was being selfish. Look what I'm dealing with! But then, look what he is dealing with - terrified of losing his partner in life, watching everything The woman he'd give his life for is going through, the new responsibilities he's had to take on that I used to do, feeling completely helpless, worried that if he holds me too hard he'll unintentionally hurt me, feeling quite alone. He's been through a lot too. He explained he'd been very patient and understanding for months on end (this is 100% accurate- he has taken absolutely wonderful care of me -I'm super independent and picky so that's no easy feat - and has done everything he can to make things easier. I truly couldn't ask for better.) And it is true that in practically every other aspect of my life I was pretty well recovered. Except for this one (well and sleeping on my stomach if I'm being 100% honest). We discussed how drained I often am when I come home from work and he had a very good question- if work is worth the effort, is our relationship not? Point well made. I realized I was looking at things somewhat wrong-my job could let me go tomorrow and they wouldn't think twice. I could find a new one to replace it. But my family, my DH, that is a different story and he does deserve some of that effort and energy.He had also taken the time to do some research on this topic. His research basically was spot on. In a nutshell: Non-sexual intimacy needs to be maintained - this is more than the peck good bye in the morning leaving for work and the hello peck when you come home. This is snuggling in bed, holding one another, lingering hugs, lingering kisses, etc. if you haven't already read it together with your husband, the book The 5 Love Languages can be very helpful with this. If you've already read it, a recap might be helpful as stressors can make us not as cognizant. Recognize that it will take me much longer to even start to feel the sexual spark, patience on both sides is required during sexual intimate interludes. Building the feelings up throughout the day can help (naughty notes, texts, short conversations) - basically helping get into the right frame of mind. Watch a sexually stimulating movie to help get in the mood. Unlike men, women are not typically visual creatures so porn doesn't usually work for us. However, movies or pics that are more romance oriented and that make you feel/tug on your varied emotions can be very helpful in getting you going. And you don't necessarily have to watch it with your DH. Read sexually stimulating literature. For most women, their imagination is their best friend when it comes to getting in the mood. It can also be a great way to escape the complexities that make up our lives at that time and allow us to temporarily be the woman we want to be. There are a lot of hang ups about sex and what's appropriate and what is not. The reality is that everything in the bedroom that happens behind closed doors between 2 adults consenting to the acts that bring both partners sexual pleasure is acceptable. That can be hard to wrap our heads around especially for women who are taught from a young age that we need to be \"good girls\" and good girls don't do this and good girls don't do that... Be more open minded to different forms of stimulation. What used to work may not work anymore. Explore new ways of stimulation. Make sure the bedroom is a no judgment zone-if you've always done missionary and one of you would like to try reverse cowgirl or oral stimulation they should feel comfortable bringing it up and the partner should be willing to give it a try. Trying new things can be extremely arousing all on its own. What's the worst that could happen? Toys have come a long way.Just a small vibrating bullet can completely change things in the bedroom. A simple blindfold/sleep mask can help pull your mind from the stressors of the present and transport it to the intimate sensual world. A feather wand (looks like a miniature feather duster) can present a whole new world of sensations (especially when you take away vision and can just focus on sensations) that can be sexually stimulating when used on practically every body part (not just the \"naughty zones\") For women it's pretty much all about sensation. Toys can be a great tool to assist with stimulation. Explore sex therapy options in your area. This is far different from marriage counseling and is a growing trend in many areas across the US. Your primary care Dr can often help with some names. Take a trip with just each other (no kids) where you focus on yourselves and pleasuring each other. Not sex 24/7. But intimacy and romance 24/7 with some sex thrown in. No worries of being interrupted/walked in on. No worries of soccer practice, school schedules, etc. No work interruptions. No drama - just you and DH. You'd be amazed how therapeutic a trip or two like this a year can be. If either of you have a hard time winding down from the stressors of everyday life then you probably need to take a trip that's longer than just a weekend. A week once a year can make a huge difference in your sex life as well as your everyday married life. Ifyou're like me and my DH and you worry about money the whole time you're on vacation, go to an all inclusive resort where your wallet isn't being pulled out every time you turn around. I hope this helps! It's helped us a great deal.",

But I am wondering if I should get the whole lot removed and ask for a Hysterectomy. None of my hormones and periods have ever worked properly and I suffer a lot of side effects from hormonal imbalance and PCOS symptoms. I am also infertile anyway too. So do I ask for the whole hog to be removed? Benefits? Down sides? From what I read prior to my full on hysterectomy, the uterus can still bleed monthly or randomly even though no ovaries. I opted to have everything go. No more periods, no risk of ovarian uterine or cervical cancer. Your PCOS symptoms should resolve too 2. Mastectomy. So I realise I have a choice regarding implants and tissue used from elsewhere in my body right? Which would you choose and why? Benefits and down sides for both? I chose natural tissue recon. Went in with breasts, came out with breasts. There seem to be fewer complications with natural tissue recon too. Benefits: breasts are soft & warm and move with you like the originals did. They will age with you too. No issues doing exercise either (plenty of threads on here talking about issues with implants and exercise). Plus you get either a tummy tuck or butt lift in the process ! (Referring to the 2 most popular forms of the surgery DIEP or SGAP). Downside: longer recovery time than implants, however I will say that going every week for fills on implants & dealing with TEs isn\u2019t a walk in the park either and should be taken into account when considering implants. Tips: make sure you see plenty of before & after photos of the surgeon\u2019s work and that you are happy with the results he\u2019s given others. If not, find another surgeon. Also make sure they go back in and revise/lipo hips and into tops of thighs and maybe abdomen too during stage2 to make your shape more natural again. Fat harvested then can be used to fill in the upper poles of your breasts. Caution: latissimus dorsi recon is considered natural tissue but often is used to create a pocket for an implant. With a BMX it is absolutely not recommended to do this type of recon. There\u2019s a whole thread about it on BCO. 3. I have been told that I will enter into permanentmenopause once my ovaries are removed. Excuse my ignorance, will that still happen if I had a hysterectomy? There are several different types of hysterectomies and they don\u2019t all include ovary removal. Yours would. 4. What are the plus sides to menopause? Will my acne clear? I am trying to search for the positives in what is going to be rather an ordeal for someone my age, let alone anyone...I just mean I am starting menopause far too young. Acne may clear, no periods, cramps, tampons or pads, no worries about pregnancy, and no worries about wearing white pants! On the downside are mood swings, vaginal atrophy (ask your dr about a new medication called intrarosa if that happens), loss of libido (potentially), less intense orgasm (if uterus removed) and hot flashes. Natural remedies for hot flashes often contain estrogen or estrogen like compounds so make sure to heck with your doc before taking any. 5. He said I won't be on Tamoxifen but something else instead, I can't remember which. I'll ask on Tuesday. Who else is on something different to Tamoxifen? I\u2019m supposed to start letrozole (femara) first of the year. The class of drug is called aromatase inhibitor (AI for short). It basically stops your adrenal glands from producing estrogen/allowing fat to convert dhea/testosterone to estrogen. If your cancer is hormone positive, an AI in combination with menopause should basically starve any remaining cancer cells. ",

Because you're not dealing with implants you don't risk contracture or the like. A great resource to research this option is www.breastcenter.com. Many women travel to these docs to have their surgery done by them. There are other qualified microsurgeons who also do these procedures but compare their before and after pics to the ones on the breastcenter.com's site before selecting one. Good luck",

Reconstruction-wise, DIEP or SGAP flaps leave you with natural looking and feeling breasts that are soft and warm. They move with you and will age with you. Buying bras (if you even need one after) is not a hassle because the breasts move like natural ones. And you never have to replace them or worry about rupture. I had nipple/skin sparing BMX w/immediate DIEP flap recon last year in NOLA. We traveled there for it from NC. I would do it again in a heartbeat. I looked pretty darn good before all this, but I look even better today. Not many women who have had BC much less those who had mx can say that. The important things with choosing a flap surgeon are to see their before & after photos and make sure you would be happy to have those results for yourself (not just happy considering the diagnosis), how many of these procedures have they done, how many stage 1 flap surgeries they do per week (needs to be 1 or more per week), what is their flap failure rate (national average is 10%, NOLA's average is <1%), and what is their infection rate post-op (NOLA's is <2%), what all do they do in stage 2/how and what do they address on the lower 1/2 of the body in stage 2 (if they don't address anything or they only address scars or they say they can do anything you want them to but you'll pay out of pocket because insurance doesn't cover it, mark them off the list and keep looking). I hope this helped. Feel free to ask any questions Here's a link to NOLA's website where you can see before & after photos of their work: www.breastcenter.com ",

Both can be disfiguring, however skin/nipple sparing mx with recon is typically the least disfiguring and in many cases you can't tell anything was done and skin quality is good as it hasn\u2019t been compromised by rads",

Most implant recon uses expanders unless you can find someone who will do immediate pre-pectoral implant recon with alloderm. With natural tissue recon you don't need expanders unless you are having delayed recon and they can't do skin sparing mx. I was able to do skin & nipple sparing mx and they did immediate natural tissue recon using tissue from my tummy. I went in with warm soft breasts and came back out with warm soft breasts that looked very similar (although a bit larger) to when i went in. After revisions I'm back to my original size and they look and feel like the breasts I had before kids. Very happy with results. Here\u2019s a link to the group who did mine (yes I traveled there). They explain each procedure and have before & after photos so you can see their results. www.breastcenter.com",

The information shared about the drug/device is cleared by FDA and speakers are required to attend yearly meetings to review what is ok to say and what isn\u2019t. Travel to these meeting is also covered. The speaker can also share real world ways of incorporating this new treatment/device into their already overwhelmed practice. Before anyone gets into a tizzy about cost of travel and where the meeting is held-it\u2019s typically a city with a big enough hotel to handle all the speakers for the company from across the nation and they spend 8-12 hours a day looking at 4 hotel conference room walls. So even if the meeting is in NYC or Vegas, they could just as easily be in a small out of the way town for all they actually get to see/do on the trip. 4) Meals/\u201cOther payments\u201d - meals cover lunches at the doctor\u2019s office ($10 or less per meal usually) for the rep or medical liaison to discuss new data, new indications, changes to formulary, patient assistance, etc. Meals at a speaker program also fall under this category. And things like anatomical models used for patient education on various disease states are also included. The days of drug companies paying for docs and their wives to vacation in Barbados or some other exotic location to increase their prescription writing for a particular drug are long over. We\u2019re talking over a decade of being over. You ever wonder where all the drug company pens, pads, coffee mugs went? They went the way of the trips. Violating the restrictions carries hefty fines for the drug company and costs many people\u2019s jobs. With that being said, pharma needs to be in front of these drs getting them the information. There isn\u2019t enough tone in the day for a dr to do his daily duties, spend time with his family, handle office issues and spend hours researching the latest and greatest on disease state, medications, SEs, and formulary status. I personally don\u2019t trust a dr that doesn\u2019t see pharma reps. How do I know if he\u2019s even doing his own research to stay up to date? Continuing medical education is supposed to do that but sadly it doesn\u2019t as the dr gets to pick and choose what he wants to study and what he doesn\u2019t. If my medical concern falls under what he doesn\u2019t study, I\u2019m out of luck. I agree this guy should\u2019ve disclosed his relationships. In the real world, no one really looks at them, but they should be there none the less. It\u2019s a sign of honesty and respect. Excitement over study results is usually excitement over progress. 2 months longer survival? For the person who is given those extra 2 months its everything. I\u2019d have been excited just by that. But when we look at the bigger picture and the track were on to making bigger breakthroughs it\u2019s even more exciting. Why are meds so expensive? First you have R&D costs. For every med that makes it to market, there were 10 that didn\u2019t. So the R&D isn\u2019t just limited to the cost for that 1 drug but the cost for 11. Then you have patent timeline. The company has to recoup the monies that went into R&D plus make a profit so they can reinvest in R&D for new meds down the road before the patent expires. Then you have to factor in how many people will need this medication and for how long. The smaller the number of people and the shorter the time they take it the higher the retail cost will be. It\u2019s simple economics. Other countries cap prices that pharma can charge. That puts much of the onus on the US which raises our prices even more. The reality is that if those other countries didn\u2019t cap the price we would be paying less in the US. Capping prices in the US would result in less R&D. It\u2019s a catch 22 situation with no real solution. It\u2019s not like The government pays for clinical trials of new medications (but they sure do put lots of roadblocks in the way). It's all on the pharma companies to do the R&D and jump thru government hoops",

BRIP1 has higher than average rates of ovarian cancer almost all companies agree but the breast cancer side is where some disagree. Some show higher rates (but not as high as BRCA) and others do not.

If they show up in the future, we will deal with them then. I had max dose full mantle rads + rads to abdomen/pelvis. 10 years after rads - 1 spot of melanoma, treatment = excision. 11 years after rads - thyroid cancer that was found by chance due to enlarged thyroid that I insisted be removed, treatment = thyroidectomy. 30 years after rads = BC, treatment = BMX w/immediate DIEP flap recon and anti-hormonal therapy So yes, you may develop another cancer down the road from the rads, but if you don\u2019t do the rads you\u2019ll never make it to that point to see if you develop anything else.",

In actuality, this is not the case. PR+ is actually a very good thing as it means there are PR receptors on the cancer cells. Why is that good? Because the progesterone interaction at the receptor actually works to break down cells with DNA errors in them which is what cancer cells are. Here's a great visual on how that works:   By increasing the amount of PR in the body it ups the amount of cancer cell interruption/breakdownthe body can do and slows its ability to grow/replicate. The biggest side effect of this is as a therapy is significant weight gain as increasing PR makes you VERY hungry ALL the time - 24/7 feeling like you're starving. And from what I've read, bio-identical PR is the way to go vs synthetic PR. If your BC is PR-, this process does not happen as there are no receptors to make it happen.Hope this helps!",

I have not been diagnosed with mets, however there are 2 spots on my liver we are now \"watching\". They were picked up on a chest CT for Bilateral PE diagnosis. MO ordered PET scan and both lit up. Ordered liver biopsy, but radiologist was only told 1 lesion so he found one right away with ultrasound and biopsied it. After biopsy he says to my DH that it's likely an hemangioma but it was strange that it didn't bleed. MO calls with biopsy results, says nothing to worry about its hemangioma. MO calls back after 5pm about 2 weeks later and says radiologist not satisfied with biopsy results. Orders MRI. MRI report states the spot that was biopsied appears to be a fatty spot (not an hemangioma which would explain why it didn't bleed) and the 2nd spot appear to be hemangioma but should be watched. I asked for another biopsy or just go in and take a look/excise it. MO told me we can't just go in and remove every suspicious mass. I asked why not? It has served me very well in the past and caught another cancer early vs allowing it to grow for another year or so waiting on those wait & see & re-biopsy/image every year. MO's response was to schedule another MRI in Dec. I am scheduled for a laparoscopic assisted hysterectomy in a couple weeks along with my stage 2 recon. Hoping maybe they can just visualize these 2 liver spots and maybe get some pics if possible (don't even know if this can be done/if GYN is willing to do that, but it doesn't hurt to ask while he's in there and all...) This is not my 1st rodeo with the big C - it's my 4th. The last 3 cancers were all in the field of radiation therapy I received to treat the first one (neck to hips). And obviously the liver is in the field of rads too.Any thoughts would also be appreciated.",

Those same changes may be responsible for the CT order. Additionally, sometimes things happen with other patients in the MO's office which will often trigger a round of followup testing for others that they hadn't planned to do. I was seeing my MO for a checkup and I was getting married in about 8 months. I had been cancer free from Hodgkin's lymphoma for almost 10 years when all of a sudden we needed a CT. I asked why and my MO told me he'd very recently had another young lady with the same type of cancer inquire if it would be a good idea to one last round of scans before she tied the knot for various personal reasons - he said no, all looked good from last scans, blood work was good and no symptoms. She got married 2 weeks later and fell ill on her honeymoon-cancer was back! And she was in a pickle Insurance-wise since her dad's Insurance no longer applied since she was now married and her new husband hadn't had time to add her to his insurance yet since they left for the trip right after the wedding (this was obviously pre-Obamacare and the requirement to cover pre-existing at reasonable rate and can't exclude the patient and/or condition). So I played along, had my CT and it was all clear. I miss that MO-he was really good. He's working hospice now in his \"retirement\". Sending positive wishes your way for an all clear for you😊",

Choosing between lumpectomy + rads or mastectomy is a very personal decision. Sometimes you can avoid rads altogether with mastectomy, sometimes not (depends on node involvement). If you choose lumpectomy + rads or unilateral mastectomy you will have screenings every 6 months moving forward as part of a hypervigilance process. Many women go ahead do mastectomy in part so they just don\u2019t have to deal with the stress that comes with the hypervigilance. Before choosing mastectomy, be sure to look at photos of the various reconstruction types and what flat looks like and decide if you\u2019ll have reconstruction and what kind of reconstruction: implants or natural tissue. Both types of recon have their pros and cons. Both can be done at the same time as mastectomy if you find the right surgeon. It\u2019s not an easy decision, but it\u2019s one that only you can make and whatever the decisions it needs to leave you with a feeling of peace.",

None of us are fans of any of this, however there is a lot of support here to help you make the decisions you need to make. Mastectomy is often recommended for triple neg, that\u2019s why your cop said something. women who choose double mastectomy (bmx) often do so for symmetry, reduction of risk in the opposite breast, and/or not having to deal with intensive monitoring of the opposite breast. I agree with the other posters above, if you have recon, try to do it at the time of mx. Fewer surgeries, better cosmetic outcomes, and better emotionally to come out of surgery with breasts vs not (if you\u2019re planning recon.) with skin or nipple sparing mx you really shouldn\u2019t be able to tell you\u2019ve had anything done unless you look close when all is said and done. You have the options of implants, natural tissue, or hybrid (combined the two) recon. Implants are self explanatory. Natural tissue recon takes tissue from your tummy or upper buttocks/hips to create new breast mounds (you get a tummy tuck or a butt lift with these options.) I chose bilateral mx with immediate natural tissue recon (DIEP) and you can\u2019t tell I had anything done, they feel like my originals did before I had kids and they have a natural shape. I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat. If you think you\u2019d like this type of recon don\u2019t let your local docs push you into a surgery before you\u2019ve investigated your options. You don\u2019t have months to decide, but a few weeks is typically on. I think the average time between diagnosis and surgery is usually about 4-8 weeks. Here\u2019s a link to one of the best centers for this type of surgery (you won\u2019t believe the before & after pics): www.breastcenter.com Chemo is not fun but it gives you very good odds of beating this. There are several regimens that can help make chemo more tolerable/help with side effects of chemo and cold caps that can help you keep your hair. In the meantime, 1 foot in front of the other and keep moving forward. This is the toughest part...waiting on information, waiting for your next appointment, making decisions, etc. It does get better. Warm thoughts and well wishes coming your way🍀",

GYN added 1/2 dose of Zoloft to try and help with hot flashes post oophorectomy. That turned out to be too much. Thoughts became more negative and I was contemplating decisions that would have s negative impact on my life (quitting my job that I live, sell everything and move, etc) these were things I very rarely if ever contemplate and I just felt very down and heavy and tired - oh so tired. I stopped the Zoloft and was just on my regular antidepressant and all those thoughts went away, I\u2019m positive again and I feel lighter and the fatigue went away. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is be vigilant of how you\u2019re feeling and your thoughts. Compare them to before and whether you\u2019d usually think That way before. Ask someone you interact with often to be vigilant with you and to let you know immediately if you seem short tempered, down, negative more than usual etc. yes these things can sneak up on you as in the example given above, however if you the patient plus another 1 or 2 are vigilant, you\u2019re much more likely to catch it early and start on a compatible antidepressant.

I had IDC 1.2cm, ER/PR+, HER2-, stage 1, no node involvement, oncotype score of 6. BMX meant no rads, natural tissue reconstruction meant I went into BMX surgery with the old breasts and came back out with new ones made of my own soft, warm tissue (no implants). Had oophorectomy after severe side effects with tamoxifen and genetic testing results. So now I'm on an AI for 10 years. Do I worry about recurrence or Mets? Yes. I'm always observant for any changes in my body and seek medical advice for them promptly even if I think it's unrelated because cancer can be a sneaky thing and not always present in a common manner. Do I let it get in the way of living my life? No, life\u2019s too short for that no matter how long you live. I believe this is where Beatmom & Moth are coming from. They are not saying worry more/you should be worried and they\u2019re not trying to bring anyone down. Rather, they are saying Be positive, be confident in your treatment path, but still be watchful and aware of any changes in your overall health and seek prompt medical advice for those changes because the reality is there is still risk present.",

It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [1,2]. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1]. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation [1,3,4]. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D [1]. Many cells have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D. ",

I do wonder if sometimes they don't offer it because they assume you don't want to pay the extra (especially if a patient complains about their regular copay amount and/or cost of medications). If you complain and say you can't afford those, then perhaps they assume you can't pay the $50 for 3D. I work with docs everyday that make these types of assumptions when selecting what medication they will or won't consider prescribing for a patient. My response to them is people will decide what they are willing to pay for if they see value in it. After all, every patient that complains about medication or office copay costs doesn't walk out of the office and hop in a stripped down 1973 Volkswagen Beetle. Or even a stripped down late model economy car. Some do, but many walk out and hop into a late model mid-upper proved car with plenty of optional bells and whistles-the same patients that complain about cost. We could break it down to something more simple too-not every patient walks out and only buys store brand products at the grocery store. If cost was their only motivation they would. But no. Many buy brand name Products because they see a value in them. With all that being said, these types of assumptions are just wrong to make. As a patient who knows these assumptions are being made, complaints about cost are non-existent for me and discussion about cost only happens when it's followed up by a deep discussion on the alternatives and the pros/cons of the alternative vs what the dr wants to prescribe so I can be an active participant in making the decision on which medication/procedure to take and whether or not I see value. Outside of cost/affordability assumptions in the part of the dr and/or staff, some offices may not have upgraded to the 3D machine yet.",

I'm a 43 years young wife to my husband, mom to 1 very active 12 year old son, 1 married son and a beautiful 17 month old granddaughter. I opted for natural tissue reconstruction (DIEP flap) vs implants. All covered by insurance. Insurance is required to cover mastectomy, reconstruction and surgery to other breast so that they match. A lot comes down to your preference and what your dr is willing to do. And different docs are willing to do different things based on their treatment philosophies. I tend to prefer the more aggressive approach docs. They would be the ones to say double mastectomy ok if thats what you want. On genetic testing, due to the diagnosis of bc ER+/PR+ my insurance covered genetic testing even though family history was 'negligible' in more recent generations. Found 1 genetic variant (called BRIP1) out of the ones tested that has a defined increased risk for ovarian cancer and is suspected to have a role in bc when brca1&2 are negative. That means an oopherectomy (ovary removal) is recommended. And the ovaries are what makes 80% of the hormones that are feeding my bc. The testing can give you the next step answers and help you and your family better understand who else needs to be tested or at least vigilant. Keep in mind as well that in older generations, they just didn't talk about things like cancer or breasts or ovaries. So a lot of family history gets covered up. When My mom talked to my great aunt about my diagnosis was when it was uncovered about the great and great great grandmothers. But her brother (my grandfather) had absolutely no knowledge of this -in that generation you would maybe tell a female relative but never have a discussion about female parts with your male relatives. Genetic testing doesn't lie, forget or cover anything up. Give your insurance a call and see what they have to say on testing coverage based solely on your bc diagnosis. I also think the key to coverage is to have testing done before the double mastectomy-if the breasts are gone, no longer as strong a reasonfor testing. Feel free to PM me if you have questions about the natural tissue reconstruction vs implants. Good luck and keep us posted!",

When you're gluten free and go to the store and see \"heart healthy whole grains!\" advertised all over the place, all I see is out & out poison - at least for my body. And today's good for you foods are usually tomorrow's horrible for you foods. Case in point: margarine, low fat/no fat foods, artificial sweeteners, eggs, red meat, etc. It might be easier just to go with whole foods (shopping on the perimeter of the grocery store), go organic if you want, and avoid estrogenic foods. As someone else mentioned, eating foods/taking supplements that help boost immunity and/or act as anti-oxidants may interfere with your treatment protocol as anything that makes a regular cell stronger will make a cancer cell stronger too. I would wait til treatment is complete before adding those foods/supplements into your diet in great quantities. Hope this helos",

Curcumin supplements are mentioned by many of us to help with the pain. If you're not currently taking it, you may want to give it a whirl. I recently had to miss 2 doses of all my pills and by the 2nd morning I could barely get my hands open and other joints/muscle were hurting all over. That told me all I needed to know about how much the curcumin was helping. I took it as soon as I could make it to the kitchen and within about an hour or so most of the pain was gone. I do have a little stiffness in my left hand in the mornings even with the curcumin but after flexing it a couple times it goes away. I use the Solgar brand as it has higher bioavailability than most and works faster.  Here's a link to the rundown on why having a hysterectomy or oophorectomy doesn't mean we can stop taking AIs or tamoxifen. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/78/topics/726592?page=318#post_5169844  On the topic of changing up the dosing, read the synopsis on the dosing studies that i posted on the Femara page earlier this year first so that you can make a fully informed decision. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/78/topics/726592?page=319#post_5171063 ",

However, you know the old saying, \u201cActions speak louder than words\u201d? If there\u2019s no increased risk, why do the docs order increased surveillance every 6 month mammos sometimes alternating with U/S or MRI of the remaining breast after uni-mx vs keeping with the standard once a year? Why does insurance pay for it if there\u2019s no increased risk? 97% risk reduction vs stress and anxiety every 6months when it\u2019s time for yet another mammo. In addition, symmetry in how the breasts/your chest looks and feels is another reason. For some it just puts their mind at ease. Avoiding rads is another excellent reason.

Why? The fat from the flap \"takes\" better than fat from grafting. Fat from grafting is susceptible to being reabsorbed. Additionally some of the flap tissue may become necrotic and that small section require removal if it can't be broken up in stage 2 which would result in loss of volume. So better success rate and patient satisfaction when all is said & done this way. 3 months minimum between the 2 stages. 2) the fat they use to make your new breast mounds has a memory. It will gain and lose volume at the same rate as it did in the old location. So if you've put on some weight and do the flap surgery then lose weight your breasts will lose accordingly. If going with DIEP and your tummy is where you normally gain/lose first, then your new breast mounds will gain/lose first. On the flip side, if you tended to gain/lose first in any area other than your tummy then your breasts would experience minimal impact. You need to plan for this if you're planning to lose/gain weight moving forward. A B or C cup after surgery could become an A or B cup after weight loss and be perfect for you. Where if you went with A or B cup to start you could end up pretty well flat or an A cup after weight loss. When you meet with your flap surgeon be very upfront about what you want as your end result. Make sure you tell them if you're still losing weight/planning to lose weight after the surgery so they can plan accordingly. On surgeon selection-finding one that listens is really important. Finding one that takes your future plans concerning your body into account from the start is really important. And making sure you've looked at their before/after pics and researched them thoroughly and would be very happy to look like those pics after and are satisfied with the research results are all very important. The group that I know does all this is The Center for Breast Restoration Surgery in New Orleans. If you don't live there it's no problem. Women from all over the world (literally) travel to them for their flap recon. They even correct botched recons from other docs. Their results are amazing, they listen, they plan ahead based on your plans, they have the lowest flap failure rate (1% vs 10% national average) and a super low infection rate (2%). They even help with travel discounts through various partnerships. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about them - I'm headed back there for my stage 2 in Nov. Here's a link to their site. They have lots of before and after pics on their site too that include women of all shapes and sizes. www.breastcenter.com  ",

Why risk going under anesthesia more than once if you don't have to. He saved my life that day. IDC showed up on MRI in the other breast that didn't show on mammograms.

Now, the trick to purchasing one is to get one with a dryer-otherwise how will you reach behind to dry yourself off? I went with Bidets Plus for my purchase as they had several seats that had a satisfaction guarantee or your money back. I spoke at length with their representative about why i needed one and my anticipated range of motion issues. I went with the Blooming bidet seat with remote as it was reported to have good angle for women's parts (as well as rears), it has instant warm water, and it had the most effective dryer. The remote option meant i didnt have to worry about range of motion at all when using it. And itwas not difficult to install. Hope this helps!",

Basically what you\u2019ve got going on is the scans seem to show something going on in those areas but pathology does not necessarily match it. The oncotype score is a test done on the actual cancer tissue removed during biopsy/lumpectomy/mastectomy and there is an algorithm they use to determine the score. It has nothing to do with lymph node involvement. Lymph node involvement would change the staging of the cancer. Both help determine treatment though. So let\u2019s look at the PET scan. PETs show \u201chot spots\u201d or areas where there is a lot of glucose uptake. Some parts of our bodies naturally have higher glucose uptake like our brains. Others do not have as much, so when they light up as a hot spot on the PET, cancer is likely as cancer cells typically use a lot of glucose. However, we should also look at whether you were given pre-scan I structions on diet and activity and if you followed them to a T. If not, you\u2019ll need to bring that up to your MO as it can cause false positives. Likewise, inflamed tissues can also cause hot spots as they are also using a lot of glucose. Your MO hit the nail right on the head with stating they don\u2019t normally see IMLNs unless many Axillary nodes and even supraclavicle nodes were positive. But unfortunately there are always exceptions to the rule, hence her stating \u201cnormally\u201d. I\u2019d see what you could find online regarding low oncotype score, positive IMLN nodes without positive Axillary and supraclavicle nodes and see what comes up. Hopefully your care team is doing the same. As of right now the choices are do nothing, keep the same course as before, or pull out the big guns and do chemo + rads. Here\u2019s a link to another thread on BCO with similar situation from 2009. According to it, the IMLNs can be removed. Perhaps the danger is in trying to just do a biopsy vs an excision (kind of like with liver nodules). I hate you\u2019re in limbo with this.

If you go with mamts know that you have the option of under the muscle or over the muscle. Under usually means tissue expanders followed by implant exchange months later. On top can usually be do e at time of mx. Same with natural tissue recon - it can be done at time of mx. Also check to see if skin/nipple sparing mx are viable options for you.

Anyway, here's what I know about treating headaches after suffering for years in and off: 1) do not use an NSAID pain reliever unless it's a migraine and a Triptan is not available. This is because they can cause a rebound effect where you get relief now but then the headache rebounds when the medication wears off which causes long term headache issues. NSAID pain relievers are Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve. That means Tylenol or acetaminophen is what you should use for headache. 2 extra strength Tylenol should do the trick. 2) if the Tylenol does not work within 30-45 minutes, try taking a sudafed. Sometimes sinus issues can be present and not show any other obvious symptoms. (If you are hypertensive or have any heart issues, talk to your dr before taking sudafed and get his/her ok). 3) if all this fails to relieve the pain and it's not a migraine, the dr should be willing to do a CT scan or MRI at the least. You will need to recount everything you've done so they'd can rule out rebound and the like. Good luck to you",

I had calcifications in left breast which truggered an order for an mri which showed ~1cm IDC in the right breast. Could've chosen lumpectomy on left and mastectomy on right to avoid rads but opted to go ahead and remove both breasts. I did a ton of research on reconstruction options and chose immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. No regrets whatsoever. Like you, I'd never had a mastectomy before and had no idea what to expect. I have been very pleasantly surprised. With DIEP flap reconstruction my breasts feel just like my originals did before I had kids. They feel like part of me to the point that unless I consciously think about it I don't notice any difference from before mastectomy on a day to day basis. The skin has retained its feeling in about 85% of my breast. There is no feeling in the nipples but they still respond to touch/cold. The breasts are warm and soft, they move with-me, they'll age with me, and they feel to My DH like the originals too. Since I had the mastectomy and the reconstruction during the same surgery I was never without breasts. Since I was able to do skin and nipple sparing mastectomy it's hard to see where I had anything done. Lumpectomy will automatically come with radiation followed by anti-hormone therapy for the ER+. Mastectomy may mean you get to skip radiation. Anti-hormone therapy will still be given. Depending on your final staging you may or may not require chemo. Statistically, lumpectomy with rads and mastectomy have same survival rate. However, mastectomy has a lower recurrence rate. Mastectomy with recon often allows for better symmetry when a large portion of your breast needs to be removed. Opting to remove both breasts vs just 1 reduces risk of developing BC in the other breast and allows for better symmetry. Have you had genetic testing done yet? If you haven't, please ask your dr to do it before you make your decision. If it comes back positive then mastectomy would be the recommendation and will save you a Surgery vs not waiting for the results. I'm going to post a link at the end of this reply to the center where I had my mastectomy and reconstruction done (yes i traveled to go there) as well as a link to a video series called, 'I wish I'd known' that is an excellent resource for anyone contemplating mastectomy and/or reconstruction no matter where they're going for their surgery and no matter what type of reconstruction. Feel free to ask any question, I'm happy to answer them. Don't let anyone rush you or pressure you to make a decision quickly. BC is a relatively urgent matter but it's not an emergency. Most women go 6-10 weeks between diagnosis and surgery. There is no rush. Take the time to ask questions, research, ask more questions, think and then choose the options that leave you with a feeling of peace. www.breastcenter.com https://www.breastcenter.com/2018/05/01/i-wish-id-known-dr-ordonye-speaks-to-ypo-about-modern-breast-cancer-care/ ",

There are many of us on the boards whose cancer couldn\u2019t be seen on mammo or ultrasound...only on mri or upon pathology after mastectomy of a supposedly \u201chealthy\u201d breast. Most breast cancers are slow growing. Waiting 6-8-12 weeks is not unusual. Additionally they need time to get all the pathology back from the needle biopsy so they can know just what they\u2019re dealing with as that will help dictate what treatment paths are appropriate. There are many different types of breast cancer. Unfortunately no one will ever know if 6 months ago it would\u2019ve shown up. If it\u2019s a slow growing one, it was likely there when she had her previous mammogram and maybe even the one before that, but just not visible, in fact with such dense breasts, I\u2019m surprised she wasn\u2019t doing alternating MRIs with the mammos. If anything, that\u2019s what should spark the anger. You can\u2019t chsnge the past, but you can learn from it. Having an mri now is a good idea as it will let you know if anything else is going on in either breast. Moving forward if your mom opts for lumpectomy, alternating mri and mammos every 6 months is something I\u2019d demand. Sending warm wishes and positive thoughts your way for you and your mom. Keep us posted on the progress. There is a lot of support to be found in these boards. As you\u2019re already starting to see, you/your mom will need to be your best advocate. ",

It may be just the way I read it, but just in case it was a miscommunication on the dr's part, I wanted to clarify that the 'tummy recon' (aka DIEP) does not require an implant. The fat from your tummy is used to create the breast mound instead. For some ladies, this is the big reason why they choose DIEP. If indeed it was a miscommunication, that piece of information may be a game changer for you. Or not. The other option you were given, Lat flap, almost always requires implant. Breast implant illness is a very real thing and you can't blame anyone for not wanting them. The Lyme disease just complicates things even more. A lot of information is thrown at us at once making miscommunication / misunderstanding a common occurrence. At the end of the day, the best we can do is to make an educated informed decision on what we feel is right for us individually. You asked about prosthesis and bra recommendations. Many medical supply stores can point you in the right direction. Often, there will be a store dedicated to breast prosthesis and pocketed bras to hold them. I\u2019ll also suggest anaono pocketed bras. So soft, no exposed seams, and comfy even right after surgery. You can buy them online or at Soma stores. My favorite is the full coverage pocketed bra from their make merry collection. The bras are also great during rads. I hope this helps & I wish you all the best! www.anaono.com",

Too many women are repeat customers roughly 7 years later with a recurrence in the same or other breast. I know this isn't evidence from a clinical study, but I think we need to start asking more questions about these studies that show no significant difference between the two options- how many years later are we looking at (5 years is not enough as I want to live a long life into my 80s or 90s not just to age 48), what is quality of life like with increased vigilance mammos and MRIs, et",

That is also very important. If you\u2019re not happy with what you see in those pics for yourself, keep looking for the right surgeon. No pics? Keep looking. And note that if a PS says they do/recommend/get the best results from a certain type of procedure it\u2019s usually because they are not trained in how to do it/haven\u2019t done enough of that type of procedure to feel comfortable offering it. Additionally, they often will say you\u2019re not a candidate for certain procedures (like over the pec implants or a natural tissue reconstruction) simply because they don\u2019t do those procedures and they want your business. So always ask if they do/have the training to do that particular type of procedure before accepting their word as gospel when it comes to your candidacy for that particular surgery. Another thing I keep seeing on the boards is everyone wanting the quickest option without a lot of downtime. As a full time mom & wife & Mimi who aspires to be Superwoman, and who works in a high stress full time career that is extremely sensitive to being present, I get it, I really do. On the flip side, quick does not always equal best for you, personally. Quick with poor results/results you\u2019re not happy with/results that are not comfortable is not typically quick at all when we look at the long term issues that ensue. You have to do what\u2019s best for you and only you as an individual - not necessarily what\u2019s best for the family because it\u2019s quick. When the kids are grown and out of the nest you are left with you. Whether recovery is 2 weeks or 8 weeks, 1 surgery or 2 or even 3 is just a blip on the screen for the kids. A few weeks if daddy (or another caregiver) feeding them cake for breakfast, pizza for lunch and fish sticks for dinner and dressing them in totally mismatched clothes isn\u2019t going to hurt them. It may even be fun for them. I know my kids have a blast with their dad making spaghetti pizza, not having to do their hair just so, etc when i am out of town for work or in the bed recovering from surgery. It\u2019s great bonding for them. Examples on quick not always being best: Ex: you chose the quickest option but because the results are not great you no longer get in a bathing suit to play with your kids at the Beach/pool. Or your recon path left you with pain/discomfort that keeps you from doing the things you do like to do with your family. The quickest option isn\u2019t always quick in the end either. Ex: 1) lumpectomy is quickest surgery option....but at the least, weeks of daily rads appointments, and more frequent mammo/mri appointments following. 2) mx w/ TEs/under muscle implants...but have to go for weekly fill appointments, and later exchange surgery. You have to look at the whole picture. I\u2019m not advocating for no recon or a particular type of recon. I\u2019m just advocating for more than choosing an option because it\u2019s the quickest. You matter just as much as those you\u2019re taking care of. You would research thoroughly and choose the best option for them, why not for you? Don't you think they would want the best for you too?",

Those 2 anti-coagulants are proven to be just as effective as the Lovenox and warfarin/Coumadin with less risk of internal bleed. Plus no needle. I work in diabetes care and needles are no stranger to me but those lovenox needles are definitely tougher than those used for diabetics that are the same needle size.
