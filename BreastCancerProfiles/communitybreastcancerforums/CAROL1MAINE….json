I have my TM tomorrow if they go up, even a little, then I'll need to change?  From what I have read some ONC are more accresive? Thanks I never know the right questions to askthe ONC so she'll tell me more. She just says i,ve had this cancer  ILC  a lnog time before we found it and it should take a long time to go back up?

The PT lady showed me some water exercises. some slow sidestrokes seem to really help, just having the spine stretch seems to help so much. highly recommend. Best to you",

I was you 16 months ago, newbie and scared, Stage IV bone Mets entire skeleton system. but it gets soooo much better, It's hard to believe now, I didn't believe the ONC when he told me 16 months ago \" it will soon be back to life as normal\"  but you know what he was RIGHT. Well ok not quite normal but darn near. I took Leah's advice LIVE. What a great summer I had, swimming in the ocean eating out at all seafood shacks and now joined the local spa plan to swim twice a week. It;s like the red hat society we can do what ever strikes our fancy! it's kind of fun.Big cyberhug write us soon Carol",
