Now I have 3 days left to wait and worry. I have been a nervous wreck.  I can't focus, my stomach is a mess and I've lost about 5 lbs in the last 2 weeks. My menstrual cycle is out of whack and I've had 2 periods this month.  I think I have checked my breast so often I now have a pain in the area although I can't feel the \"lumpy\" spot anymore. I guess I am asking for prayers and advice.  Are these side effects normal anxiety?  Now I am more worried something is wrong.   OLD POST 36 years old, A couple of days prior to my period, I happen to feel an thicker lump in my breast, went to urgent care doctor who I knew since my regular doctor was out and she agreed and sent me to get mammogram and ultrasound.
