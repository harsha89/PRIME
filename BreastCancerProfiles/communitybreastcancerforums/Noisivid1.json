It is in the lymph nodes, but we won't have results for another the days. We live in Fort Collins, CO but will be in AZ in February and I want too seek out the best professional care for my wife. Before seeing this post I was thinking about scheduling an appointment with the Mayo Clinic. I don't know how to proceed. Do I schedule with the doctor, in this case your recommendation of Dr. Walker or do I select the institution, (Mayo Clinic)? Where does Dr. Walker do her surgeries? I want to do what is best for my wife and appreciate your feedback. Thanks, Jeff F.",

We will be traveling to Arizona tomorrow for a long planned stay and will get the news Monday or Tuesday as to type of cancer and stage. Does anyone have any knowledge of Dr. Barbara A.
