I had the biopsy done by a different medical facility that the mambo and u/s. they did both tests over. --- I was ok with that. --the results of the first set of test was a BIRAD of 4. mass 1.2x1.2x.07 this time they discussed whether I needed the biopsy--- dr thought everything looked normal. said he wasn't as concerned as he thought he would be--- looked at the area with 2 different size u/s wands. and then said he thought it was fine but he couldn't be 100%. sure. ......so he did the biopsy --- this all felt so weird to me. --- - they were able to \"recreate\". ( their words). the mass seen last week but didn't seem to match up the direction they thought to take to what the recommendation was last week. --- is this normal?
