Today I found out I needed to search for any information regarding Breast MRIs and possible clinical statistics to assist with my backup info for the denial as I received another \"Dear John\" letter.  I went to the New England Journal of Medicine and I think I found some items that may help.  If anyone out there is having the same issue with insurance and have any website or printed info that may help with the appeal (third one) I would greatly appreciate it.  I am supposed to schedule my 6 month check up so I called the insurance to make sure it would be covered.  Here was their answer:  If the doctor does pre-certify the mammogram or any other test, all that is doing is saying you are going to have the test. It does not mean it will be paid for, even if it is pre-certified. Tests such as a breast MRI may be covered for one situation but not for another. For instance, a certain test may not be covered as a diagnositc test but would be covered for \"staging\" cancer.  It depends on studies that have been done to see which tests are actually effective for which application. Thanks for listening, and I can only pray that there will be some type of miracle documentation to change the minds at BCBSIL. ",
