Yesterday I didn't do much moving around and it went down considerably, but it still looks like I've had a breast augmentation of at least one size up. It is pretty uncomfortable and is still hard to sleep if I'm not totally exhausted. Thanks for your help! Renee'",

Had my post op appointment this past Monday and the surgeon was a little suprised about the amount of bruising and swelling, but didn't think it was something to be concerned about. I wasn't given any instruction at the hospital to treat for swelling, so didn't think much about it til now. I can email or call my surgeon (we are covered by Kaiser). But, will be going to my radiation and chemo consultations tomorrow so can always ask them then. I'm thinking I need to go shopping for looser shirts and sweaters to wear this winter so I'm not stuck in sweatshirts for 3 months. :) Thanks for your input. Renee'",

One nail is splitting where the highest stripe is. So I think I will have to start wearing polish. I'm curious about anyone else's experience with nails this way. What happens when the stripes grow out?",

One thing I haven't found is what people take with them to treatments. I have no clue as to what I should take. I don't like to sit idle. I'm thinking books, magazines, crocheting, music. Should I bring any personal items such a blanket or pillow? Suggestions greatly appreciated! TIA Renee'Â ",
