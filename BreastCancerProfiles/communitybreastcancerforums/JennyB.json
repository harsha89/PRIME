My white blood cell count is off the charts, thanks to Neulasta, but my red blood cells are dwindling (I'm told this is normal). We talked about my incessant bleeding, which is normal--apparently my ovaries making a last stand against chemo. :) And we talked about ways we'll manage the severe bone pain in the next round. So I will be taking ClaritinD + prophelactic pain meds (switching between ibuprophen and vicodin) in anticipation of it this time, and if that doesn't work, I am supposed to go into the ER for narcotics.

I thought about that, too, and I ended up deciding to get a short wig, even though my hair has been long all my life. I'm afraid of the heat/sweat factor with the wig, and summers out here in the desert are brutally hot. So short hair to short wig to short hair again...then in a couple of years grow it out until it's normal. That's the goal, anyway. I think all of us approach the hair thing a little differently. I think I'm less attached to my hair than most. I did think about cold caps for a day or two but my husband talked me out of it.  For me, the hair thing is something of an adventure.While many people want to look the same, I want to take this opportunity to look different and think out of the box. Short & dark instead of long & blonde, for once in my life. My hairdresser said it's almost impossible to dye blonde hair black, so I figure this might be my only opportunity! I'm more afraid, I think, of losing my eyebrows/eyelashes than my hair. Harder to hide those. :(",

But to those of you who just had your first chemo, sounds like everyone is doing great! And I agree--stay hydrated! So important!  Claritin--after my first horrid reaction to Neulasta (severe back pain, felt like I was in labor), my nurse is having me start taking 1 Claritin a day starting the day before the Neulasta shot and continuing for a week. I really, really, really, really hope it works! Baseball--my 9-year-old son plays on a travel team, so we spend most summers traveling to different tournaments. It's going to be a little challenging this year with the hair/chemo situation! I'm just going to take it from weekend to weekend and he knows and understands if I have to stay home once in a while. HAIR UPDATE: I'm on day 16 after TC #1 today. My head feels completely different. My hair feels funny. I have a short haircut but no buzz...but my friends/husband say they can't tell it's falling out when they look at me. I'm having to sit on my hands not to tug it out. I know if I start, though, I'll probably be 1/2 bald by the end of the day. Ultimately, I can't believe this is happening so slowly. I keep thinking every night I'm going to wake up the next morning with 1/2 my head of hair on my pillow. But that hasn't happened! So today might be my last day with the hair God gave me...I just don't know! I'll update again tomorrow. For now, my wigs are still sitting on their stand, unused. Have a great day, everyone!

I'd say days 4-6 were the hardest, and that surprised me because I thought I'd passed the hard part already! The fatigue did linger for longer than the other SEs, and I think that was because I was very anemic (not only the chemo killing off those red blood cells, but from my ovaries making their \"last stand\"). But that also started to get better after around day 9. Welcome Alice & Irishtess! Hair update: Not much to say. I am still pulling out 20-30 strands when I tug!

Afterward, I took him to an allergist and they tested him to see if he was allergic to a certain drug in the meds. It was a long (and probably expensive) process, but it turned out he wasn't allergic--we still don't know what caused the reaction. It was very scary. Anyway, the point is, I am about 99% sure what your doctor told you was very wrong! I do think you should be tested for an allergy to that ingredient of Benadryl. Either way, I do hope there's a substitute they can give you during chemo if you have a reaction. Hugs and good luck. Jennifer",

My haircut looks a little bit like Kate Gosselin's (without that puffy thing in the back!), but it's thinner and flatter now than when I first got it cut a week ago. I have a function to attend tomorrow and I almost backed out because my hair decline has taken a sharp upward turn today. I don't know whether to go natural (will bald spot suddenly appear in the middle of the day? Will a gust of wind blow my hair into people's faces? eek!) or wear a hat or try one of my wigs... My guess: My hair will be gone by the end of the weekend. I could probably tug about 60-80% of it out right this second if I wanted to, but I just want it to last one more day for this thing I have to go to tomorrow... argh. Marilyn, thanks so much for checking in with us! It's great to hear from those of you who've gone through this before us. Jen, good point about menopause. I'm so sorry about your reaction & infection! Also, I had the red face/chest thing. I actually had a red rash break out over my chest that didn't disappear until 1.5 weeks after the infusion.",

My hair loss update: I think day 12 was the day I noticed a few strands coming out when I pulled. Every day, it was a bit more. Day 17: This is it. I had a function today and I survived it, but my friends sitting on either side of me kept brushing off hair. Hair kept falling into my eyes. I tried like crazy just not to touch it at all. Tonight, I'm pulling big chunks out. It's freaking my family out, making me crazy, and I have obvious bald spots. I'm actually handling this with a little more panic than I thought I would. My husband is going to give me buzz after the kids are in bed. The wig lady recommended a 1/4 inch cut--she said a buzz might cut my scalp if there are any sores, etc. But at this point it looks awful and it's driving me crazy and I need to do *something*. I'm so scared and sad about how frightening I'm going to be looking for the next several months. The threads about hair never growing back after Taxotere aren't helping at all. I guess I was more attached to my hair than I thought.  :(",

Re: Neulasta pain--I've read it only happens to about 30-40% of people and most of it is mild. Mine was pretty severe (OTC pain meds didn't take the edge off) so I'm one of the lucky ones, I guess. But I'm doing Claritin and Aleve/Tylenol/Ibuprophen/Vicodin this time, so we'll see if it helps. Sacphotomom, I saved my hair in a box! I just couldn't throw it away... Sad. Glad you're not having any reaction to Neulasta. Countryfrau, I'm on day #3 after my 2nd infusion, and I'm feeling about how you're describing. The stomach cramps this time are just nasty. Ugh. I just feel all-around yuck. Good luck with your wig! Fotopet, I'm blah too. Getting winded just going up the stairs. Are you anemic? I am a little anemic (hemoglobin was 10.4), and I think it might be making this a little worse. As for Neulasta pain, I get my shots on Thursday and the first time, the strange muscle pain started on Saturday, getting worse (and deepening into my bones) by Monday. Monday night was the worst, got some relief from pain meds on Tuesday, and then it was over. Very strange. Tricia, I'm sure hoping the Claritin helps me this time! One thing it is doing is keeping me up all night...I need to start taking it earlier in the day! Alice, I'm so sorry you've been so sick. Throwing up is just the worst. They really need to change your meds if this is happening! Victoria, Wow, it seems so many people have such reactions to the Taxotere. That's some nasty stuff!

It went pretty well & took about 4 hours total--the benadryl knocked me out and I slept most of the time, which was actually nice, because I haven't been sleeping well at all.

I haven't felt a hint of nausea or other side effects (except some pretty strange/awful tastes in my mouth, oh, and my chest and face flushed bright red through the first hour of taxotere)--I actually feel pretty good, but I'm ready to sleep again!  I'm a little nervous about the Neulasta shot tomorrow--I hope it isn't too painful.   Leah, thanks for the pointers! Those are great! And congrats on finishing, too.  I did bring my own pillow and a light throw blanket, and even though they gave me a blanket and pillow there, I was cold (I'm always cold) and my own stuff helped me feel comfortable enough to sleep. But I'm glad I'm through it. I was so anxious that something severe would happen, but I'm okay--just really, really, really tired. Hugs! We're going to get through this!",

I could hardly move yesterday--the muscle/joint/bone pain was so brutal. I couldn't comb my hair because my scalp hurt so bad--and I felt that way from top to bottom. I had no idea the Neulasta SEs were so strong. Today is a little better, but I'm getting these out-of-control headaches...argh. The nausea/constipation have been ever-present but definitely manageable with the meds. And thank goodness for Ativan!  Even with all the discomfort, I've been able to sleep, which is a godsend--I really haven't slept well at all since I was diagnosed. I keep hoping every day will get better. If not for this debilitating headache I have, I'd probably feel like I was definitely on the upswing.",

It's hard to accept, isn't it? I can't believe you were diagnosed just before your wedding...wow. :( Sacphotomom, I'll keep an eye out for something to send your mother to calm her about chemo. My mom lives 2000 miles away and she's itching to come to be with me, but I keep telling her to wait until the kids are out of school for the summer, because I'm going to need her most then! But, out of everyone (except maybe our spouses), I think our moms can be hit hardest by all we're going through. We are still their babies! Hair--I've always had long, blonde hair. I'm getting it cut short (pixie) on Thursday and will probably shave it when it starts to come out. I'm getting pretty nervous about the whole hair thing. But I figure it's probably my only chance in life to have black, short hair, so I'm going to buy a black wig and try to have some fun with it.... marmalade_skies, it's so great that your friend is going to shave her head with you! What a great friend! And sounds like you have a fantastic boyfriend as well... To answer your questions, I bought colace beforehand (it was their first recommended over the counter drug to use), and I'm glad I did. I've used it almost every day! For me, the Neulasta pain has been brutal, and their recommendations weren't doing anything for it. I actually was in so much pain last night that I called in, and they said to start taking my Vicodin from surgery. And as for sugar--I've been eating it. Not in huge amounts, but...well, I had a doughnut this morning....",

Hair Update day 19: I still have a bunch of little blonde strands left, but my scalp is showing even more today. Today was the first day I went out and wore my wig. Talk about self-conscious! I felt like everyone was staring at me and that they knew I was wearing a wig. Not a good feeling. I figure I'll get used to it...eventually. For now, I'd just rather stay in. Sigh!

I've done well with the nausea meds too--yay for no severe nausea! I've heard that about ice chips in your mouth during the infusion--I think I might try that next time, though I did drink cold water throughout and I haven't had any mouth problems (besides a mildly dry & fuzzy mouth) since. I've been drinking tons of water too, all day long, but my nurse still felt I was dehydrated yesterday (enough to go in for IV hydration). Watch out for those night sweats--they can deplete your stores fast, I think. I've been running a low-grade fever and that probably doesn't help, either.  Dana, that's great that you haven't had any bad SEs so far. Fingers crossed you get nothing more.",

I don't want to scare anyone, but it's on the biography forum here on the site: community.breastcancer.org/for...  This is so tough, isn't it? Ugh. :( Please keep me posted on how you're doing. DancerMel, I'm just ahead of you--my first TC was on April 28. Isn't it the strangest feeling? It feels like it's no longer YOUR hair, like you're wearing a hair piece or something. The consistency and feel are completely different... So strange! Swolfram, thanks for checking in with us. I'm glad your hair is growing back. Hair update for me: Last night (day 17) I started combing my fingers through my hair. In about 10 minutes, I was 95% bald. I have blonde hair, some really light natural platinum blonde mixed in with darker blonde, dishwater blonde, light brown, and a few grays. The grays and the darker blonds &  browns fell out, leaving the platinum blondes. They're so light they look fake! I look like I have white/blonde hair, like when I was three years old. I wonder if that's happened to anyone else--one color being more persistent than the rest! But I look like a very old, very sick woman, if you ask me. I don't really know what to do with the stragglers at this point. My husband is refusing to cut them for me...I think he finds them fascinating. This is the weirdest thing I've ever been through, hands down!  ",

I hope everyone is feeling good today. javahog, I've heard of many people bringing home the Neupogen shots and administering them themselves. As far as I can gather, Neulasta is one shot and Neupogen is more than one shot. I'd definitely ask about this! The drive sounds like a killer. sacphotomom, your hair situation sounds like mine a few days ago. Hang in there! The steroids I'm taking are Decadron/Dexamethasone. I take 16 mg the day before chemo and 16 mg the day after chemo. The day of chemo, they give it to me as part of the infusion. It makes me hyper and twitchy, and super hungry. Also, it's hard to sleep when I'm on them. Welcome, Mommyto4GreatKiddos. I have three great kiddos who've been taking this cancer thing in stride. My kids really keep me going.... Drim and CTherese, glad you're both feeling well. CTherese, I felt the same way about things not moving through my system. Definitely keep on that...take the laxatives, drink lots, and keep your portions very, very small... njbhwgirl, so sorry you ended up in the hospital. How scary! ((big hugs)) Day, I wish I could go completely bald. The Sinead look! The weird thing preventing that is all these strands remaining. My scalp is too sensitive to shave them off, so they just remain, making me look really terrible without a hat or wig! DAY 20 update: After the big loss of hair, the remaining strands are coming out a little at a time. Just three or four strands every time I tug a little. I keep wondering if they'll stay or I'll go completely bald. Tomorrow I go in for TC #2, and I'm nervous this time, knowing how I'll be feeling for the next week or so (i.e. not great!).   ",

Leanna, thanks for the links! GolferGirl, I was oddly nervous for #2, too, but it went fine. Hoping the same for you! njbhwgirl, I'm sorry about your mom, I hope she's okay! That's cool about the wig lady coming to your house--what a great service. I'm having the weight gain and the odd cravings, too. Weird! Sacphotomom, I really want to see that woman and give her a piece of my mind. I can't even BELIEVE she said that. That is beyond rude. Like what we're going through isn't difficult to begin with. I have some not-so-pleasant names I want to call her, but I'll stop there... I think I need to talk myself back into a good mood like you have! I'm having a weird feeling at my lumpectomy site--I wonder if all these strange feelings are normal... Leanna and Tuck, I was drinking a lot of Propel too, but got nauseous once, and now I'm thinking I'm ruined for Propel forever! But it did sustain me for a few weeks there. Better than water, for sure! Nanaof2, I had that same \"fear\" when I touched my hair. I'm sure you'll find the buzz a relief. Patricia, you voiced exactly how I feel most of the time since diagnosis--like I've been transported into some bizarre alternate reality.

Sometimes I feel like yanking off my wig too (especially when I start to sweat) but I haven't had the guts yet! So the latest on me, TC #2 follow-up appointment today--they didn't even draw my blood today--onc wants me to keep all the blood I can (I'm anemic and have had a never-ending period for the past 4 weeks). The bad news is she thinks I might be accumulating fluid in my lungs as a reaction to Taxotere, so I need to get a CT scan next week--if it comes back that my lungs look bad, that's a pretty serious long-term side effect, I  guess, and she's going to take me off chemo altogether. And I need to see an opthamologist for the crazy eye twitching I'm having. The fun never ends, does it?  It'll be my first CT scan ever. What should I expect? Any tips?",

It's been such a rough year for my kids so far. I'm so worried about them. I had TX #3 today and I'm feeling okay. But my RBC/hemoglobin is down even more (hemoglobin, 9.4; RBC 3.3). Sigh. They are now threatening me with a transfusion if I can't get my RBC up. And I had an abscess in my tooth on Thursday, so I'm on antibiotics and need to get a root canal next week. Yuck. I had a CT, and my lungs showed a bit of pneumonitis in my left lung, but not enough for them to stop chemo. So that's good...I guess. At least there's no sign of cancer anywhere in that area... Leanna9, I had a very similar bleeding experience between TX#1 and deep into TX#2. I had a regular period starting about a week after TX#1, then it just...didn't go away. I spotted for about 3 weeks. My once said that if it continued beyond that, he'd do an exam (he's a gynocological onc), but the day after that, it stopped! Strange. Anyway, I've missed you guys.

Each tx has been a bit different. The first two came along with a very wet cough--after the third the cough was dryer and seemingly more random. After the 3rd tx, the onc sent me in for a chest ct to see if my lungs were reacting to the taxotere. The ct showed \"possible pneumonitis\" but nothing serious. Anyway, off to the pulmonologist I went. He did a bunch of  tests and came to the conclusion that my breathing is compromised somehow (I couldn't exactly figure out what he's talking about). Anyway, he believes the cause could be one of two things: (1) Reaction to cytoxan or taxotere (2) Acid reflux going to my lungs (reflux caused, of course, by the chemo) So I'm on prilosec 2x a day plus a high dose of inhaled steroid (advair 250/50) and back to the pulmonologist next week. So, with all these drugs, the coughinng and wheezing seem to me to be improved,  but I alternately feel like a child's corset has been strapped around my ribcage and is squeezing me, and and elephant's foot is pressing down on my chest. Not a great feeling! I'm done with chemo and at this point just impatient to start feeling better. Oh, and my blood pressure at the pulmonologist? 79/59.

She said if we did chemo BEFORE surgery on my type of tumor, it would only shrink it about 10% of the time. (2) Chances are, given the negative lymph node status, that the surgery has already taken care of getting rid of the cancer. Why subject yourself to the toxicity of chemo when it's so much overkill and will upset your immune system and healthy cells when you have no cancer cells to fight off anyway? (3) You have to weigh the benefits of chemo with the risks of chemo, which aren't small. So say, the Oncotype shows a 5% benefit for chemo...you have to weigh that against the 5% chance of chemo leaving you with a long-term health issue. Those were the cons...but in my case there were also some pros, including a prior breast surgery that might have caused the cancer to get into my bloodstream, so I did, in the end, opt to do chemo. Hope that helps. :) Jen",
