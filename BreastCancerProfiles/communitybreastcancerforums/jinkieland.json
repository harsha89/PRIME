    "Content": "jinkieland wrote: I was recently diagnosed with IDC stage 2 (last week) after the core needle biopsy on the left breast and left axillary. Unfortunately the IDC also detected on the axillary area. I am waiting for my appointment to see the Medical Oncologist early next week. I have also schedule to see the Surgeon Oncologist late next week for second opinon at UT Southwestern in Dallas. Should I wait after getting more test results after the Surgeon Oncologist before I go for 2nd opinion for treatment options? I am very nervous and scared now and I have not told anyone yet including my husband. My husband will get very panic easily and he will feel helpless if I am not around to take care of my two daughters age 8 and 10. I am thinking to wait until i see the oncologist to find out more details on the cancer stage and treatment plan then will let him know. My left breast is so hard and the mass is so huge like a tennis ball. Sometimes I can feel warmness when I touch, like some infection is going on inside. I can also start feeling the pain from the middle and right part of my chest area. At first i thought i have strained myself but the pain has been there for few weeks and not going away. Last week i had a flu and the pain is almost intolerable whenever i coughed or sneezed. The pain is still there now and it feels sore when i press hard on it. I can't bend down to pick up anything or carry heavy thing as the pressure will make the area very hurt. I have to move and walk very slowly to avoid the pain. Does anyone has this experience before? I am worried that the cancer has spread to my lung or chestbone area.. waiting is a long game and there probably more tests have to done on me before i can find out. Log in to post a reply",
