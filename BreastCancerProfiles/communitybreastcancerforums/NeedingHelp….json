The 15th seems like a lifetime away. Is a core needle biopsy very painful? And is it true that birth control causes cancer? Im thinking of stopping it ASAP",

She said this on her report: No Masses or nodules seen. She has alot of dense fibrous tissue in both breasts esspecially in the ouq and tail of spense. Suggest the problem is hormonal and advised her to stop Birth Control and re-assess in 3 months. Now i am convinced its cancer because ive read alot on here of how lumps didnt show up then its cancer. I asked her if she could send me for a biopsy, she said no because they cant see any lump. The lump is very easily felt. Its almost on the surface and very hard. She said its just fibrous tissue. So now what? Is this bad sign? Im so scared what do i do now",

      "Content": "NeedingHelp wrote: I am a 25 year old female, have been on birth control for 7 years. Ive always had breast tenderness since ive been on the BC, But then when i switched to a new one, i started gettting lumps. It came and went as the months went by, but then i had to cut the birth control pill down because it was too strong (Doctors orders) I have dysautonomia so i am highly sensitive to medication etc etc and get dangerous side effects immediately from some meds. Ok so to cut the story short, one big lump remained. Its been here for more than 6 months. I have had 3 Gynecologists examine the breast, one internist and 2 doctors. All said its not cancer, its Fibroadenoma. I also have 4 small lumps in my other breast. My Symptoms are pain that doesnt go away, it radiates to my armpit. It almost feels like i stretched my muscles in that area. If i palpate the lump its very painful several hours later. I am freaking out. The doctor did a fine needle aspiration, im waiting for the results. Also, im scheduled for an ultrasound on the 15th. Whats my chances? I dont smoke. My grandmother on my fathers side had breast cancer (Survived 20+ years now) no one else has breast cancer. Im freaking out very badly. Im in so much pain. How likely is this to be  cancer??? I have a massive anxiety disorder and im not coping at all. Which is the best best diagnostic tests for me to go for? I dont want to miss cancer Also, if i dont have cancer, could i go and remove my breasts (Like Angelina Jolie) Will it reduce my risks substantially or not? I have to mention that i cannot go under general anaestesia unless its life or death because im hyper sensitive to medications and can die of a reaction.  Log in to post a reply",

Sorry my anxiety gets a bit excessive sometimes and i need to relax myself and reassess. Its not my fault my anxiety is like this. I was damaged by antidepressants and haven't been the same since. I cant take medication, therapy is very expensive and not affordable at the moment, i don't even have health insurance. Its very difficult for me. I'm also going through an abusive relationship at this stage and everything has taken its toll on me. I just want to cry :'(  Sorry i didn't mean to upset anyone, I'm just so terrified at the thought of cancer. I really appreciate everyone's advise",

I went to a surgeon who said i have a fibroadenoma and did an FNA. I am still waiting for the results, i was supposed to receive it a few weeks ago but he went on vacation and no one wanted to give me the results. So now i am seeing him on the 9th of May. I am very worried its cancer. the lump is very hard and painful, i also have this spot under my armpit that gets painful from time to time, it feels like an ingrown hair but it isnt. I am also now feeling lumps in my other breast and really do not have the strenght for this. The constant fear, the constant doctors visits for the multiple lumps i am having. The one lump is very large and hard, this is the one he did the FNA. The rest he never felt, i will let him feel them on the 9th. I guess i am just looking for someone to talk to who had similar experiences than me. I just read of a girl my age in my town who had a large lump in her breast, the doctor said its just breast tissue thickening, and 4 years later it grew much larger and she found out it was indeed cancer and had spread. She is my age. I am scared really i am very scared.  Log in to post a reply",
