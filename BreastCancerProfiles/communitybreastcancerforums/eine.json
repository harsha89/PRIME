Had rads, delayed recon for three years, had TEs put in March 2011, expansion painful and put on antibiotics twice, exchange surgery Sept. 2011, developed another infection, tried antibiotics but implants had to be removed Oct. 28th. My PS blames the radiation but also thinks we can try again once i \"Heal\".  Haha. Not sure what that means.  I am very depressed and wondered if anyone has had success with fat grafting.  So scared to try implants again, although the surgery would be just one this time since the expansion already did the stretch job. I also am devastated when seeing my chest....scars are daunting. ",

My breasts are now in worse shape than before the attempt and I have been very depressed about it. My ps thinks we can try again after I \"heal for a long time\", whatever that means! I have a mammogram in two weeks and am concerned about the additional scar tissue since the recon surgery. My breasts are very dense and I am always worrying about recurrence. I am getting a second (and third and fourth) opinion for future options, and would love to hear how you are doing.",
