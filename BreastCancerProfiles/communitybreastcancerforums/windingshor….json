My daughter is having a CTA for a residual effect from a serious brain injury on Friday and may have an important, even life-saving, procedure that I want to accompany her for.  I am still getting up twice overnight to test her blood sugar and should probably stop that soon. My mother has been in the hospital but I am letting go of my responsibilities for her as of today: I talked with my brother. I will go to a meeting with her social worker but she will have to have arrangements for home that do not involve me. Your comments about size, and about avoiding Google, and how to use this site, are all valuable. I bought the Mayo Clinic book today for a general overview and have learned a lot. Another book coming from Amazon. This is how I deal with things. Once I have the facts specific to my own situation, I will be able to use this site and other references in a better way. In a way, I am spared the anxiety about cancer or not. I think it is pretty clear I have cancer. So I am just waiting for more info really. Thanks again for the hopeful comments, and the realism as well. Honestly, if I can have 5 more years I will be happy. My girls will be almost 30 then. Off to take a Benadryl for sleep! Will consider a half Xanax tomorrow, moving up! Good luck to others as they wait.        ",

With such high ER responsiveness, one would expect a lower Oncotype so perhaps the ki67 really is high, but that doesn't make sense does it? My MD's all told me that ki67 is unreliable, but the Oncotype includes it (and other proliferation signs) so that conflicts with their trust in Oncotype. Still, perhaps it could be redone-? Grade 1, mitosis 1 would not suggest chemo of course: some women with these numbers don''t even take hormonal treatments. I hope you can resolve questions about the ki67. The TailorX trial should have results this year about intermediate Oncotype scoresm, which are so problematic for decision-making. I felt that 18 or under I would not do chemo, 23 or over I would for sure, and in between I would just go crazy deciding :) That is where you are!

These two are really good with breastfeeding issues, and most oncologists aren't, at least in my experience. I wonder if you could contact Dr. Love or Dr.Cooksey for advice. Even a lactation consultant would be a huge help. Both with how the baby can stop nursing in the least traumatic way, and how you can speed up the drying of your milk. Does your 11 month old take a bottle at all?  Have they told you that you need to be on Herceptin and chemo? These cannot be given to your baby via breast milk. It would seem that you need to stop nursing as soon as possible. Can you do the chemo and Herceptin as neo-adjuvant therapy before the second surgery? I don't even know if it would be neo-adjuvant or adjuvant since the tumor was taken out. So sorry this is happening to you. Her2+++ really responds to the Herceptin and chemo, I have read and heard. Others can confirm with personal experience perhaps.  ",

Genomic Health will repeat with the surgical specimen and my health insurance will cover it. I havae requested a second test with my surgical specimen. My oncologist is reluctant to order it but is checking with pathology to see if it is worthwhile in their opinion. My grade 3, LVI and 20% ki67 are persuasive. My 95% ER score may have lowered my Oncotype score somewhat but it is still hard to see how it could be only 8. For anyone new, the Oncotype involves 16 genes plus 5 reference genes and measures distant recurrence risk. Genes include those related to proliferation, invasion, estrogen, progesterone, HER2. I am 64 so maybe that is one reason all my docs are so resistant to reviewing this. I did find out today that my second opinion doc is rechecking the HER2 by FISH since that was positive on biopsy and CISh was negative on surgical specimen.  ",

This relatively recent way to examine nodes means that many women only have 1-3 nodes taken. If they are clean, the assumption is that the cancer did not get to any lymph nodes, since the cancer would have had to travel through the sentinel nodes first and would usually have left some trace.  (I have read it is possible theoretically for a few cells to have made it through the sentinels without leaving a trace, but we try not to think about that.) If you have other nodes besides the sentinel nodes that are suspicious, then the surgeon will remove them.  I don't know how the surgeons know whether to keep going and take, say, 24 nodes. Maybe someone can tell us.  Are the nodes looked at by pathology on site, to determine when to stop taking nodes and when to keep going? Or once one node is positive, do they just remove all nodes they find?",

For now, it can help to stay off of google except this site :)   Lots of things online are old actually. I watched a lot of Netflix. And ask your primary care doctor for medication to help with sleep or keep you calm, if needed.

Two oncologists, both at major cancer centers, are choosing to ignore the positive FISH done on the biopsy yet are relying on the Oncotype from that same sample. Their idea about the FISH from the biopsy material is that there might be some DCIS in the core biopsy sample which would throw it off in the direction of positivity for HER2. But if it had DCIS in it, why would they rely on the Oncotype which presumably would also have some DCIS in it. Today I ran around like crazy and convinced one oncologist at one of the major cancer centers to redo the ONcotype with the surgical sample. He has to justify it to Genomic Health. I have talked with Genomic Health myself three times. I also got the surgeon at the smaller hospital where I was first diagnosed, and biopsied, to talk to pathology about that FISH and whether they really think it is valid, if it contains a lot of DCIS etc. Then I made an appointment with a THIRD oncologist to discuss. This third one is at a cancer center that is not affiliated with the other two. My daughter is telling me that I am promiscuous and cheating on my oncologists. She laughed and laughed when I said \"Yeah, my slides have been sent all over town.\" I just want someone to listen, understand my logical and valid questions, and then explain clearly. To top things off I tried anastrazole today and got really sick. It was probably the lactose. Am switching to Femara but it was discouraging. If AI's make me feel like this I'll take my chances without. I'm a positive person but it's tough to be positive when you feel like this on a med!  ",

Keep a file and when you get contradictory opinions keep a chart :) You need to know size, grade, maybe ki67 (proliferative rate, not always done), estrogen and progesterone sensitivity (very key), and HER 2 status. Surgery and biopsy may actually have different results: I was positive for HER 2 after biopsy but negative from the surgical specimens. ER/PR+ can mean chemo is less likely and that you can benefit from hormonal treatment such as Tamoxifen or, for those who are menopausal naturally or artificially, an aromatase inhibitor. I had a mastectomy while the genetic tests were still pending. The genetic tests didn't matter to me.  I later had the other breast taken off. Both times I had a paravertebral block which eliminated pain for awhile afterwards- no pain meds, no nausea, no being out of it. I didn't do reconstruction. These are major surgeries but I could not have radiation. Really, the whole experience wasn't that bad. Get as much pathology info yourself as you can.

The pathologist was surprised, because my ki67 and grades were high and my cells were poorly differentiated, some ductal and some lobular, and LVI.

I actually had my Oncotype done a second time and made sure it was the right tissue block. I had grade 3 (one lab said grade 2), uncertain HER2 (finally resolved as negative), KI67% at 20, and Lymphovascular invasion, focal. But my Oncotype score was 8. Go figure. It is possible, someone told me, that the healing biopsy site might increase the Ki67% because healing cells are proliferating. I have no idea if this is true.  For me, the other thing was that my biopsy results were HER2+ but post surgical results were equivocal then negative. I was told that biopsy result may have had a lot of DCIS in it, which tends to be HER2+. So this stuff is complicated. I went with the Onctoype score and had no chemo. None of us will ever be certain. KI67% is only one of several proliferation measures in the test. I would have thought, with LVI, that my invasiveness score would have bumped it up, but maybe 95% ER and 80% PR bumped it way up. Thirty percent of grade 3's have low Oncotype scores. Nothing is as it seems!!!!   ",

Make sure that no one gives you pain meds while the block is active- they are not necessary. The first time, some communication glitch must have happened because they gave me pain meds after surgery, including a pump, and I threw up all night, felt out of it, and generally suffered. The second time, if I could have worn a big sign,  I would have. I made darn sure everyone knew- no pain meds.  I woke up feeling pretty normal and really didn't even need a hospital stay. No pain for 2-3 days that time and recovery was overall more easy. That said, both times, I did need pain relief in the first two weeks. The pain was different both times, but at times intense, especially with the first one. I do think Tylenol could be enough. One thought: I did NOT keep pain meds in my system or take them early in the pain, as everyone suggested. Instead I allowed myself 1/2-1 pill later in the day when I felt I couldn't stand it. My daughter was having a brain procedure and I had to monitor her blood sugars in the hospital, so I had to strike a balance between being functional in terms of pain and not being out of it. Get that paravertebral block!!   ",

Anyway, my post-surgery results were HER2-.   Yet another MD retested mine, at my request, and counted 60 cells, at least twice the usual, and got a negative HER2,  and I was satisfied with that. Genomic Health said you could also have a highish ki67 and still have a low Oncotype score. Ki67 is only one of 5 (as I remember, could be wrong) proliferation markers used in the test. Nibaum I hope the chemo goes well for you, and the Herceptin and hormonals. It's only my opinion but I was really glad to get to the end of the thread to see that you were, in fact, doing chemo :) I had started to cut my hair, bought scarves, bought baking soda and was gearing up for chemo when I got the news I was HER2- after surgery.

For HER 2 negative, hormone positive tumors, decisions can get murky, especially with intermediate Oncotype scores. In my experience, pathology results differ from lab to lab, physician opinions differ, and studies online contradict each other.

The surgeon yesterday had not seen my HER2+ (FISH) even though it was on record the day before. She was quite casual about my approx. 1 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, saying I would just have a little lumpectomy and radiation and that would be it. (I am not using that center or MD anyway.) When I saw the FISH that she had not yet seen, my heart sank. So the HER2 will mean chemo and Herceptin, possibly before surgery. I wonder if the surgeon at Dana Farber that I see next Wed. will want to consult with an oncologist before I meet with the oncologist on 3/4. I guess I'll call them on Monday to ask. I am most nervous about it spreading outside the breast right now! I think what is hard for many of us is wondering about that big unknown. In terms of breast problems, I would still love a double mastectomy but am understanding the outcome can be the same for lumpectomy for some- just not sure if that's best for me.

I had a grade 3 (one hospital said grade 2), highish ki67%, contradictory HER2 results (finally resolved as negative with a higher number of cells counted), mixed ductal and lobular.....and LVI, which was \"focal\" and specifically seen in lymph vessels. But my Oncotype was 8. My doctor had it retested! I had 4 different oncologists in 4 different hospitals in those first months. The two main ones were so chirpy about my prognosis that I barely trusted them. The third one said \"I don't blame you for being troubled,\" and did the retest of HER2 and Oncotype and offered me chemo or whatever else I wanted. I said no to chemo with that Oncotype because I figured it wouldn't work anyway. So, back to LVI. Google claims that LVI is equivalent to one positive lymph node. None of my doctors has said that about focal, but there is very little info on focal versus extensive. My doctors did make that distinction.and were reassuring, as was my surgeon (The Oncotype recommendation for one lymph node wouldn't have been different anyway. ) My understanding however is that it isn't so much about where the cells are but more about the type of cancer cells we have, which, as my favorite oncologist said, LVI proves \"want to go somewhere.\" (My surgeon said the location of cells was not relevant and made motions to show me that they wouldn't be better able to crawl out just because they were located nearer the armpit!) I believe everyone had cancer cells circulating so I resolved not to worry about the image of escaping cancer cells. But I do worry about having cancer cells that were able to move and settle somewhere. Which means they have the capacity to spread. Also, think about it: they found LVI present but how many people have LVI that is not detected (and do fine)? There is really no reliable way to test the consequences of LVI because there is no way to be certain it isn't present- unless the pathologist is able to look at every single vessel, including those outside the surgery area. Am I wrong? Anyway everyone tells me my prognosis is good, and so far, it seems to be. If your tumor responds to estrogen and progesterone, all the better. Genomic Health, the maker of the Oncotype test, says that 30% of grade 3's have low Oncotypes. This cancer business is so much more complicated than people think :) ",

As a newbie, since February, I have generally held back and either asked questions or read others' posts, because there are women on here who have a lot of knowledge and experience. Many are kind enough to be on here still, years after diagnosis and initial treatment. If all members posted articles that we found of interest, this site would get pretty dense pretty quickly. That said, there have been some links carefully selected by members that have been enormously helpful. Getting to know the landscape of breast cancer, so to speak, was enormously helpful before diagnosis, but getting into too much detail before pathology results would have just worked me up and even wasted my time: for instance, reading about HER 2 when I turned out to be negative. I watched a lot of movies!",

Your body normally makes 7mg steroid in the morning, naturally. Any pill over that will suppress your immune system if taken for more than a week, we have been told.

Are you having an Oncotype test done? That will be important in determining treatment as well. That takes about two weeks. I never even saw my surgeon after either of my mastectomies. I just went to a nurse to have drains taken out, that's it. Maybe you could cancel the surgeon visit and reschedule the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. Unless they will do things by phone after meeting you in person, which is a possibility. They may need to see you in an appointment to start your case but perhaps then they will be able to do things from a distance. Why are you on the fence about hormonals? Just curious.",

You are 100% Er and Pr positive. That is really really good. Maybe you could have surgery and do tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor before, during, after. Maybe that could hold you. I would want the tumor out asap or at least would want something like a hormonal med to keep it from growing while you deliberate on chemo. Are you having an Oncotype done? That takes about two weeks and can be done on biopsy or surgery and these days really guides treatment. But I don't know how that applies to larger tumors. I do know the Oncotype determines no chemo for some node-positive people.  ps here is a chart showing that smaller tumor size does not mean low Oncotype for 40% http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professi... here is info on the Oncotype for positive node(s) http://ww5.komen.org/Breast-Cancer-News/Oncotype-D...",

That is great that the board is meeting. I don't know how large your wife's tumor is or how responsive to estrogen and progesterone. In recent years not everyone with a positive node has chemo so there must be a reason they are going with neoadjuvant in this case. Size of tumor and desire for lumpectomy? Others know more about this. There is a test called an Oncotype test that often determines treatment but it is usually done after surgery. It is done for HER2- and ER+ PR+ tumors. A low score means no chemo, a high score means chemo, and medium scores are murky. I was told that 30% of grade 3's have low Oncotype scores and don't need (or won't benefit from) chemo. If your wife wants a lumpectomy the plan you described is probably the best way to go. It will certainly be reassuring if it shrinks the tumor. Then surgery, radiation, and most likely hormonal treatment such as Tamoxifen over the longer term. Sounds like she is in good hands. So sorry you are dealing with this. But things can work out, as many on here will tell you. This period really is the worst.",

I had a positive HER2 from the biopsy specimens because there was some DCIS mixed in, and DCIS is often (or always?) positive for HER2 and the tumor itself might not be. I went to a third opinion because I ended up with two equivocal IHC's, one positive and one negative FISH so I needed a tie breaker. As for throwing \"everything you can\" at cancer, the new philosophy that results from Oncotype and other advances is that that attitude can result in overtreatment. Low Oncotype, slow moving cancers may have low cell division rates and chemo does not work that well if cells aren't dividing quickly. Intermediate scores are still a problem: noone knows yet whether chemo is called for or not, and there is a trial, the TailorX, that may answer some of those questions this year. I started out with grade 3, high ki67 (proliferation), lymphovascular invasion and HER2+. I had my teeth cleaned three times because different MD's would tell me to get ready for chemo. I bought scarves and started cutting my hair. I ended up NOT doing chemo because my Oncotype is 8. Go figure. I had a retest (rare, but MD's thought it was called for) and it was 8 again. The point isn't just that I don''t need it. The point, apparently, is that if I took it, it wouldn't be that effective and in fact, Genomic Health's charts show increased mortality with chemo regardless of effect on cancer, for me. It is hard for me now NOT to do chemo because I want to do \"everything I can\" but I finally truly grasped the idea that it would not do much good at all, based on the biology of my tumor- regardless of grade, LVI etc. In fact, even if it had been node-positive, noone would have recommended chemo for me. Of course you are worried and this is supposed to be a helpful message, that it ain't over till you have all info, but it may also add to uncertainties so I apologize if the effect of my post is not as positive for you as I intend...

I have been told that without hormonal treatment risk doubles, but don't know how that works with a score as low as yours! Low scores are often are a result partly of high estrogen sensitivity but you must have other factors. But in any case the Oncotype score is based on the assumption you will be doing Tamoxifen (at the time of the creation of the test this was standard I think). I don't think aromatase inhibitors are that bad. I have written elsewhere that it helped me to start with 1/4 to ramp up, to consider early side effects as temporary while my body adapted, and to work 45 minutes each day to help joints. Many of us don't have bad side effects at all. But with your low score, who knows. In any case, those numbers are important!!  ",

My surgeon wanted to do just one because of some existing health problems (autoimmune). I am recovering just fine. The screening mammogram done in late Feb. of my left breast (as opposed to the diagnostic mammogram done on the right) showed no cancer, but I am nervous because the left breast has not felt right since more than a month before my diagnosis: the nipple burns and there is pain extending from there into the breast. I meet with my oncologist on 3/25 and will have hormonal treatment, Herceptin and probably chemo. I need to resolve the issue of the timing of my second mastectomy. I could ask for someone at my cancer center to help me feel sure that the left side is cancer-free, by additional imaging, breast exam, whatever is available. Then I might feel comfortable waiting, but I know that the surgery would have to be a month after chemo. Or, I could ask for the second mastectomy soon, like the end of the month, and get it over with, if my surgeon will go along with that, since I am healing fine from the first. Is it unwise to delay chemo and other treatments with this second surgery? Should I wait until after treatments? I absolutely hate having one breast, but that is partly because the nipple is so sensitive for some reason. it bothers me more than any pain from the incision on the right. I am impatient to get it taken off, but also want to do chemo and other treatments asap. Any advice? Thank you!    ",
