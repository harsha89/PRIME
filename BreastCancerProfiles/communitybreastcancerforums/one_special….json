Spent a morning in emerg and they did some tests and gave me a shot of DEMEROL with gravol...pain went away but i still get it at home. They gave me a RX for demerol so trying to use it at home when i need it. They say the first shot is the worse so hopefully my second one wont be will keep u posted and wish you all the best to a speedy recovery..One Special Angel",
