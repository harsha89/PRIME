I was dwelling on all the bad things that can happen, skin breakdown etc, but now I am focusing on that wonderful laser beam killing all my residual cancer stem cells and they will not DARE to come back! But I know that our regular skin WILL come back. Slowly. The skin stem cells from the good areas come in from the sides to heal the wound. From the clean areas that did NOT have cancer. I am scared too, but I get it-and we can DO this!!!! I will be getting my eighth dose on Tuesday when you start and will be thinking about you. Bayoubabe I am sorry for your tears on the table. Are you done now I hope?? Thank you everyone for the discussion. We also had some success stories on a post I started when freaking out in the middle of the night, \"did anyone come through rads with skin okay?\" I got some comforting feedback that really helped me. I will bump it up for you Celine. Hugs to all",

It never has gotten any worse, so although it lights up with the contrast agent they don't think it is cancer (fingers crossed).  I wonder if you had broken or cracked a rib at some point and didnt know it? Fairly easy to do, even coughing too hard can crack them sometimes, if we have low bone density. weird. Hang in there and try to process things one at a time. That is how we attack them. If chemo will come first just focus on what you will need to do to get through that for now. You don't have to process everything at once.

I slept ok with the tissue expanders too, oddly enough, drains and all, and now after my revision surgery, same thing. Sleep heals.

One step at a time. My oncologist says this is the real \"chemo brain\"- all the info and the rapid changes that our brains go through to process all this new knowledge about treatment etc. She thinks this plays a bigger role than any physiological changes that happen. I think that is true because chemo brain also happened to my best friend, who went to all my appointments with me. So please know you are not alone. Hang in there!",

Used crystal deoderant (allergic to Toms). My skin held up great until my last two appointments and then a spot under arm and one under my rebuit breast got very sore and peeled. They gave me melpilex to shield the peeled areas from bumping on my clothing (I was working full time so no free-boobing for me! LOL). It really helped. SInce that week post-rads the skin has healed rapidly, peeling a bit each day and now completely peeled and seems normal and pliable. yay! I had feared that it would be all withered up and contracted. Nowhere near as bad as I had feared. Mostly I have been tired and still am, but slowly that is getting better too. Hang in there girls!! I wish you the easiest road possible. It will be over before you know it.",

For some it is worse than for others. The nerves do grow back slowly, about a quarter inch per month (sorry for being such a science nerd- it is what I do). And the pain from the cut ends slowly subsides through a process called \"axonal dieback\". I am not sure if this is comforting in any way, but it is what it is. Good that it is temporary. My sharp searing pain from the mastectomy nerves took about two months to get over- just in time for the exchange surgery. The TE was pressing on them everytime I leaned forward, so I had this great way of picking things up off the floor by lowering straight down, bending knees until my fingers could touch the ground. Glad to be done with THAT! Hang in there!!!! It will get better.",

Slv, the question about the scar not healing- it is interesting. I am a cell biologist and am very fascinated by the whole healing process. One one hand, no- the skin that is getting zapped cannot directly heal itself. BUT it is calling in recruits to help fix it from the marrow and the surrounding non-irradiated skin each day after our rads- so these new stem cells should be getting to the scar area and remodeling it. I have been watching mine closely and it looks different, not so prominent. I sure hope yours does ok in the end as well. Tangles I also had the exchange surgery before rads. My big fear was that the skin would get so bad that the implant owuld need to be taken out, after all that work on my PS's part.

The first recommendation was surgery, heal for a few weeks, then ACT chemo. Very standard and conventional. Luckily I have a friend who is a breast cancer oncologist in another state, she looked at my test results and said that since the tumor is her2+++, I needed the herceptin immediately. My oncolgist agreed and I could actually feel the tumor shrinking week by week on the chemo that included herceptin- liquid gold! By the time I had the mastectomy and 24 lymph nodes removed I had no evidence of disease- complete response. So my advice to new people with this diagnosis (girls and guys- we have many more men with breast cancer these days due to the dioxins in plastic water bottles, and other factors) is, if you are her2+++ please ask good questions, weigh your options, and dont be a \"I wish I had asked\".",

I am at risk for heart damage due to the herceptin and a family history of heart disease, but they are able to get my heart out of the field with this. Thanks to taking turmeric capsules I no longer have asthma so can take huge deep breaths and hold them without coughing- yay!! Beachbound I work full time too and have to wear nice clothing to work so I scheduled my appointments at the end of the day. Is there any way you can do that????? The rooms are usually busiest early, at least in our center, so you might be able to easily switch. I really like going straight home affter I get done, and lubing up there. I bought some cheap dresses at Ross that have top ruffles for the few days when I do have to go to a meeting after my afternoon appointment. I can put on my emu oil and not wear a bra thanks to the ruffles. and since they were only $12 if they get greasy it's all good. The strategy is working well for me so far! Good luck to all!!!!!",

I am just half way through rads today so I cant say much but exercise does seem to help so far and as an added plus it releases the proteins called chemokines and growth factors that help the skin grow (and new skin stem cells to migrate in to the damage). That is what is keeping me on my feet anyway. I agree it would be easy to slump!!! I am just trying to go to bed earlier. Everything that I \"really need to get done\" can wait a few weeks (well except dishes, uck). Curly Sue I had 24 axillary nodes out and, at the risk of jinxing myself, can say that I dont have edema.....yet. It can happen at any time of course.

I study regnerative medicine in our lab, so I do know that the skin stem cells will migrate into the wounded area and start doing their best to repair damage.

That sucks but it just is. I had people's jobs to think about. So using the caps I was able to hide my cancer from almost everyone, and go to work almost every day since my diagnosis last october, except for a few right after surgery or chemo infusion where I would work from home. And I still looked like \"me\"- lost lashes and brows but drew them back on, and I still had/have my long hair. Your point is well taken- when I do discuss this with other women in the infusion room (because I have herceptin infusion for a full year) or the radiation waiting room, so many of them say they WISH they had known about the cold caps. The doctors will not tell you because using them is inconvenient for the \"push-em-through\" mentality at the infusion center. There is a great thread \"cold cap users past and present\" on this wonderful board, for anyone who is facing chemo and interested.",

You cant miss a dose of these pills, whatever she is taking, that is important to know. If hers isnt working well you can ask for a different one. There is a decent assortment of different meds. I usually had two achey exhausted weeks, then one good one, getting energy back, then they would hit me again after week three. Roller coaster- for sure.

I am so glad she started the herceptin right away. i did the same and it shrank my tumor to nothing (TCH regimen), they could only find a dead nest of cells in the tissue removed at surgery, and all my lymph nodes were clean. I sure wish her the same level of success!!! We will be rooting for you both.",

I think this one small animal-based expenditure is well justified. Emus are super huge, one of them can likely give us a lot of those tiny bottles of oil. I thank them. A wonderful woman Pmd me and said she was using miaderm lotion only and her skin did well, and the ladies in her waiting room who were using aquafor or other petroleum products had fried skin. It makes sense that petroleum products would intensify the rads (i am thinking of lotion vs oil when suntanning...). I know we wash it off before rads but maybe some stays under the surface? i am very interested in this. I have aquafor, for later on, but am inclined to not ever use it now. Just the emu oil after rads and miaderm or calendula lotion at other times.",

All about the TaTas for the past eight months since diagnosis. \"boobstraps\" might be a good invention though, for when we cant wear bras..... It is indeed important to keep it all in perspective. I was just at the grocery store and ahead of me was a poor woman whose face had been horribly burned.

And tried to get out of it. But, even after our mastectomy and chemo there could be sneaky cells hiding out in our skin or any tissue that is left, and radiation kills them off, along with our \"Good\" skin cells unfortunately, But the normal cells migrate back in to fix the damage from the clean areas of skin that did not have any cancer cells, and did not get zapped. Clinical trials have shown that adding radiation increases our chance of being done with this forever. So now I am all for it, after I saw those studies. I am looking at that big zapper as my friend. Anything to fight this beast!!!! Good luck to you, and to everyone.",

Speaking of metals - I had on some \"mineral\" makeup the other day that I wasnt even thinking about- I blended it under my chin and little metallic particles had gotten down my neck- i was promptly sent in to scrub my neck and collarbone before the rads. oops!!!!

I approached rads with the attitude that I want to nuke every stinking cancer cell in the area, and that big machine is helping me do it. Sadly the good cells in the way have to be killed too, but as a cell biologist I know that healthy skin stem cells are migrating over to repair the radiated field each day. hence all the protein to help replenish them, and also help keep up our imune systems.
