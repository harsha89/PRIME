I had a breast that became very swollen, hard and tender in March. I was put in the hospital and given IV antibiotics for 4 days. That seemed to help but then by about 3 months it was bothering me again. The Breast Surgeon believed the infection was caused by a milk duct so I had the 12 0'clock and 1 o'clock ducts removed and a biopsy done which was negative. The surgeon said removing the duts should take care of everything. Well guess what? I have swelling again and much tenderness that runs to under my arm. There is a lump but I am not sure if it is scar tissue or not. The surgeon has ordered a US again. I asked her what she thought was causing this but her reply was she didn't know. This is very frustrating and I worry about IBC. Does anyone have any suggestions? Log in to post a reply",

He then told me that my mammo looked the same as last year so he thought it might be scar tissue but wasn't sure so he wants me to follow up with my surgeon on Friday. He didn't think it was an infection. So it's wait and see again! My husband said he is going with me and demand an answer for the pain.",
