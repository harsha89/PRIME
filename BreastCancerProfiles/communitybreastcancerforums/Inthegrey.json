I just to add, I was told not to drink antioxidants beverages during chemo, including green tea, as that can reduce the effectiveness of chemo. No vitamin water for me, but I love coconut water with pineapple. I have #7 this Friday on my 3 week cycle. I have had less energy after #6, so maybe the cumulative effect is kicking in more. I have also had diarrhea the past week which is unusual for me during treatment. I\u2019ve been taking pepto bismol tablets to keep it under control, but called the nurse yesterday. They are going to run a test for C dif to be safe. Have others have diarrhea all the time and if so what did your doctor say...or did you just take Imodium or Pepto to control it. Just wondering. Keep well everyone   ",

      "Content": "Mar 2, 2019 11:08AM - edited Mar 2, 2019 11:17AM by Inthegrey hi - I started acupuncture towards the end of my chemo and had more energy days after rounds 7 and 8 than in the beginning! Maybe I also knew I was almost done. It was still fatigue, but certainly not as bad as I had during the rest of treatment. The fatigue builds, but I had to credit acupuncture for reversing it. I bounced back after my last treatment pretty quickly to get ready for surgery, BMX. I had her address fatigue, digestion/acid reflux, nausea, and anxiety. I think it helped all around. I still do it weekly for Tamoxifen side effects, mostly hot flashes, energy levels, and winter sinuses. I can definitely feel a difference. After 9 consecutive weeks, I thought I might be able to \u201cmaintain\" the benefits with every other week, but I found my hot flashes increasing, so back to weekly. I like that it is not taking another drug and it is worth the extra expense to me. I go to the Integrative Medicine Center at Sloan-Kettering. I wanted to be sure they had cancer experience. The needles are very, very thin and just feel like a pin prick going in, but then you do not feel them. Once in, you just relax/nap for 30 min to an hour. I love it! MSK also has a group rate $65, to be more affordable, so 4-5 of us are in tables in the room. Private sessions are $105. I saw an acupuncturist in upstate NY that was only $35/session when I started. nyc is pricier! Where do you live? Let me know if you have any other questions. There is nothing to lose by trying it. Takes a few sessions for the full benefit. Here is some reading: https://www.mskcc.org/announcements/acupuncture-helps-ease-side-effects-and-symptoms-some",

I always felt horrible the first 24 hours after treatment. I would be in bed all day and feel unsteady, it was hard to make the short walk to the bathroom. Sometimes I'd get a bad headache too and I think it was from the steroids wearing off. An uneasy stomach, queeziness and sometimes nausea were not uncommon for several days.I had a prescription for Zofran for nausea, but found it gave me a headache too. I had to pick my side effect at times, nausea or intense headache I'm sorry the the nurse is so uncaring. Even though they give you anti nausea drugs in the IV, many of us get a prescription just in case as well. I'd ask for something. Other tips for nausea: Ginger tea or gum, Queezy Drops available on Amazon, SeaBand pressure point wrist bands (Amazon), eat anything that sounds appealing. Be sure you are drinking lots of water and fluids to flush your system out. A lot means 3x what you normally drink. I would have at least 4 -5 liters a day but I drank a lot before chemo. Be sure to include electrolytes, I had Gatorades and coconut waters.Dehydration can cause headaches too. I would think by late Saturday night your head should feel better, that is when my subsided. Everyone reacts differently and each treatment can be slightly different. For me it got better by #4, but it still sucked. I hop my long winded post helps.

My first opinion at Weill Cornell was also TC and I went with MSK because they recommended CMF which gets the same results as TC but much less side effects. CMF is a first generation chemo developed in the 70\u2019s and is what the Oncotype type was based on. They have success with it and still use it. TC is newer and seems to be used more often and I\u2019m not sure why. \u201cInstitutional preference\u201d is what the breast oncologist said at Weill Cornell. Ask the question at your appointment. I have had very little hair loss, just increased shedding. Most likely they will not do the cold cap with CMF since usually hair loss is not noticed and very minimal. I suggested it to Daisy since her situation seems to be an exception. I think it is rare. Wait and see how you react, everyone is different. Tip- wash your hair much less, 1-2x week and no blow dryer. This helps. Best of luck and let us know how it goes.  ",

I cannot image taking that trip right after treatment - I am always sleeping the day after chemo. Have you thought that the sweating is related to under hydration? It seems to happen to me and I am never sure if I am having a hot flash or not, but then I drink water and it gets better. I too have had diarrhea a bit more as treatment goes on. I just had #6 of 8 a week ago. In the beginning of treatment, I was constipated 2-3 days afterwards, but now a week later I'm the opposite this round and my thirst increased a lot. I tend to drink too much water and my sodium levels were getting low the doctor said. I downloaded a water tracking app and drink 200-250 oz a day! I drank a lot before chemo too due to allergy medications and sinus issues that would dry me up. I now just pay attention to the color of my urine to tell if I'm under hydrated and have added electrolyte mixes to my water which has helped the sodium levels. My fatigue is a bit more now with #6, but I also overdid it the past Sunday helping my parents pack the attic of 40 years of stuff - they moved to a new house last month and I am staying with them for chemo this summer. I cannot complain about it since overall I am doing well here. Nocyart - I hope you are continueing to do well after the shot:)",

Yes, fatigue is your new normal while going through this. I found acupuncture helped me with the queasiness, constipation and energy.

You don\u2019t need to be a MSK patient to go, but I\u2019m guessing you may be one since they are one of the few institutions offering CMF. After an initial private appt, you can go to the group sessions that are $65 to save money, not bad for nyc. Eat whatever tastes good and keep hydrated 😊   ",

You can find there posts from a year ago on this thread. If course it is hard to say how doable it will be for you while working. Plus you are 15 years older now too. I cannot imagine working during CMF and I was very tired wk1, better wk2 and boy, I was glad to have wk3 to feel almost normal for a bit before the next cycle. I did not need Neulasta either. That can be tough for some people. Be sure to take Claritin a few days before to help with the bone pain that can come with it You can tell your oncologist you'd like to do every 3 weeks - it is your choice, not theirs remember. You can try every two weeks and change to every 3 weeks if needed to get more rest in between. Personally, I'd rather stretch out the treatment longer and feel better than do it every two weeks to be done sooner and feel miserable. Talk to your doctor about your concerns.",

I find your posts of side effects helpful too in addition to 19501952. I just completed 3/8 and have the same side effects as you, but no joint/ creaky knee issues so far. My appetite is less this round as some foods just turn my stomach thinking about them - baked chicken and eggs are two of them now! Ugh. I also started infusing water, with melons to go down easier. I dint have a problem before. Ginger tea is also good. I only wash my hair 2 days a week with cool water and sleep with a satin pillow case and just have increased shedding. Not too bad. I see you did Diep flap as well and will read your posts later on as I decide about reconstruction.

That other website that was referenced in the other forum was not good to me for information. CMF is a first generation chemo I believe and was used when the OncoType test was developed in the 70\u2019s. Sloan-Kettering here in nyc still uses it a lot if appropriate to a person\u2019s diagnosis - that is where about 4-5 of us on this site are being treated. It was explained to me that CMF is an \u201cinstitutional preference\u201d by my original oncologist who was not at MSK. I wonder if your oncologist spent time at MSK since he/she is recommending it. I feel good that such a stellar, highly recognized center as Sloan still uses it very often. Please do not be concerned about literature online that you said you have read. It is not just for \u201colder\u201d people. I am only 52. It is more tolerable as far as side effects and just as effective as the onco test was based on it after all. Did the previous posts in this forum help you with advise? It looks likes you replied to a few posts, but they all stacked at the end of this thread so I cannot tell who you were replying too. I was very anxious too at my first treatment and found that it was not bad at all overall, especially compared to what others endure with stronger treatments. I\u2019m glad to hear radiation was relatively easy for you! For many it seems to be more difficult. I hope I do not have to have it as I am opting for a BMX once chemo is done.

I\u2019ve also read it is very effective for triple negative. I\u2019m sure you will be fine. I hope you are taking your first pill at your oncologist \u2018s office if you are worried. Please read through the older comments and you will find a lot of tips for handling any side effects. Most of our experiences are similar, but to varying degrees. I found acupuncture to really help as well. Wishing you well on Monday",

I had #2 of 8 treatments last Thursday. I am happy I had less side effects this time- no intense headache or dizziness that was from the nausea pill. I skipped the pill this round. I am so tired today, Wed., 6 days afterwards which is frustrating to me. I was more active but still low key on Monday and Tuesday... maybe I\u2019ll over did it? How much more fatigued should I expect with each round? I have a long summer to go yet",

I take Nexium for it and have eliminated the main high acid/trigger foods: caffeine, tomatoes, chocolate, mint and citrus. Also my anxiety got higher at times due to hormones I think Kate - when did the main fatigue set in? I have my 3rd of 8 treatments this Thursday.",

I too find fatigue comes on suddenly weeks 1-2, especially after an activity around the house -laundry, cleaning, etc. Week 3 so far, I feel like my normal self. I read the report from New England Journel of Medicine and based on my Onco score of 21 and age (51), I feel I need to stick through this. My score/age are just over the cut off in the Table 3 chart. I liked how they broke scores down further for those age 50 and under - great detail for anyone in the grey area to help make an informed decision. The news didn\u2019t report on that much. 3/8 tomorrow.",

Keep in mind, it does grow back after treatment and you are taking care of your health first and foremost. Do you have fine, thin hair to begin with? I think insurance will cover a wig if you think you may need/want one. Could you do the cold cap at treatment to help prevent this? Hopefully someoneelse here may have had a similar experience. Btw, I cut my hair quite short and layered before starting CMF so it is wash and go, with no blow dry or styling products. People just think I did it for the hot summer weather. Please see the post in this thread from 2002Chickadee on June 8th, she had more hair loss at first and then it tapered off once she cut back washing it. Keep us posted if you learn more.",

This wk2 post infusion, I\u2019ve bounced back better than after the first two treatments. I\u2019ve not had the diarrhea, but slight constipation at times. Nothing that some prunes can\u2019t fix. I take a probiotic daily fyi. I was a bit nausea after #3 that I didn\u2019t have before too. I hope you feel better soon and remember to get some protein with the rice.

For dry mouth, I had Biotine gel and dry mouth tablets that stick to the inside of your cheek. The tablets worked the best and I was able to sleep with one stuck to my cheek. They are in the toothpaste aisle with other dental items. I kept on eye on the shade of my urine to know if I was hydrated enough. I drank up to 250 oz a day!",

My immune system had time to recover in between and I didn\u2019t need the Neulasta shot to raise my WBC count. People usually don\u2019t get neuropathy with CMF either. How often are your treatments? If they say every 2 weeks, request every 3 weeks if you want more recovery time. Every 3 weeks is very common and standard. With every 2 weeks neulasta is definitely needed You should do much better on this. You can still get the side effects of jittery stomach, acid reflux and fatigue. I was in bed all day the day after treatment each time. I was a dizzy, but my the second day it was better. Chemo was optional for me and I\u2019m glad I did CMF. I hope it goes well and I\u2019ll keep you in my thoughts. 🙏🙏 ",
