I'm terrified and have so many conflicting opinions. I believe I am stage 11b. I had a mastectomy and have no sign of cancer in my body at this time. I'm reading that Avastin is ususally indicated for active tumors or known mets. Please tell me how you felt about joining the trial. I will be on TC for 6 cycles and then H and A for a year.",
