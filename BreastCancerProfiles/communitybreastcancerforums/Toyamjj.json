But what if its cancer from somewhere else thats spread to the breast instead of vice versa. Any one out there to help ease my my scary fears... Thanks!

I too had an Onco score of 22 and did not have chemo, I just completed 20 rounds of radiation and my breast is several shades darker and spotted. I started a monthly lupron shot in March and will continue indefinitely. I start anastrozole on may 1st, nervous yet hopeful regarding the side effects. I will add that while I was elated to not get chemo I was a little nervous about my doc saying she didn't recommend it for me. Honestly with the exception of the breast discoloration I fee like I breezed through breast cancer... not sure if thats a good feeling though? I hope I did all I could, completed treatment just this past Wednesday so maybe I'm feeling this way because I just completed treatment? ",

Currently no node activity however during surgery they will remove one or more nodes for testing. From what they see so far they are recommending what they called \"The standard of care\" which is lumpectomy followed by 6 weeks of radiation as long as my genotype test comes back low. Anyway lol back to my children, I originally thought it would be a good idea to wait till after the surgery so I knew for sure what the treatment would be but now I'm feeling like I'm betraying my children by not telling them yet, they wouldn't even know I was going into surgery. Im starting to feel that they are owed that right. On one hand it seems reassuring for them that if they have a question I can answer it because i'lll have all the facts, where as if I tell them now ill just be giving them the best case scenario which is what I described earlier.

My lump was hard and deep down I knew it didn't feel right so I wasn't too happy to have to wait a couple weeks for a mammogram but I did and I told myself to just keep busy and try not to worry. Then a couple days later as I was undressing and the sunlight was hitting my mirror just right I noticed a dimple near where I felt the hard lump and my heart sank. I remember seeing an article on Facebook about how a women seeing the dimple in her breast just may have saved her life as it could be a sign of breast cancer. I immediately started calling other breast imaging facilities that were in my network, I found one that could get me in within the next couple days. Turned out it was cancer, I am very grateful I found it early before it had spread. We are our own best advocates and yes waiting is the hardest part, I will tell you that at the time of biopsy my dr told me that because of the borders and the way it appeared on the ultra sound she that it was cancer and most likley stage 2. I cried during the biopsy while one of the nurses held my hand and stroked my hair. I foolishly want alone for my biopsy because I didnt want to worry my husband in case it was nothing. Bring someone with you even if this does turn out to be a false alarm, because in my case my dr knew right then and there and that was a hard pill to swallow alone. Wishing you the best and hope it turns out to be nothing!!!",
