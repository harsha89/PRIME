So far, the oncologist. I've not had any further imaging so far but the tumor appears to be shrinking as measured by touch. The plan is to finish the chemo and then have a lumpectomy and radiation. If for some reason the tumor doesn't shrink enough or something else pops up I will have a mastectomy. I am okay with either surgery as long as I know my team is doing everything we can to fight the cancer. .My question is will it be obvious what surgery is needed ahead of time? I guess my worry is I'll go to the hospital for the lumpectomy and the surgeon will find something that requires the other surgery. If this is the case do they inform the patient ahead of time or usually go ahead and do whatever they need to do? Do they attempt the lumpectomy and then schedule a follow-up mastectomy to finish the job? These are questions I need to discus with my surgeon, but I won't see him again until February when we look at scheduling the surgery. I am probably overthinking things, but I just like hearing other patients' experiences. Like I said, I am okay with a mastectomy, would like time to be prepared. I just have this fear of waking up to a missing breast when I wasn't expecting that to happen. I am probably rambling. I hope this makes a little sense! Thanks!
