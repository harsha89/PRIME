I had a bra (ubderwire on for about an hour before the symptoms started last night) correlation? well i will convey all this to the person i see this morning. i will be checking this thread for info as i wait as well. thanks again! Keep up the fight. I am her for you just as much as you are here for me. thank you!",

NOPE, no go. so i have to wait for the films to be made then pick them up then drive downtown and then two or three more days till she has had her \"experts\" review it all with her. so dumb! Time is wasting.  I read a great article that shows that the color MRI is pretty accurate and that only 5% of tumors that show red end up NOT being maliognant and about 10% of the yeloow end up being B9. mine is alot of yellow and some red. the blood vessels going to it make it a pretty certain thing in my book. the other breast has none of all that going on except i see some veins starting to form at the bottom of the left breast.   sooo it will be another week before i get the biopsy to confirm what all my research shows. I have a malignant growth. soo frustrating. i am in inbetween land. i want to post a few very telling pics from the MRI but i cant figure out how to put them in my post. Please tell me that pagets or ductal C is slow growing and a week wont make a bit of difference. MY research of Pet/CT shows me that eating nothing but meat and egg starves the tumors as they love sugar.  LE Super big SIGH.",

      "Content": "NinaE wrote: This is an update of \"IBC? Stressed out BIG TIME\" poted Wed or Thursday in this thread. See that post to catch up. thanks! ok so right now i am in a wait to see if the antibiotics made the sudden right breast and nipple pain get better but i wa also pursuing ruling out IBC as my right nipple had inverted a bout 2 years ago and had some suspicious areas of enhancement on my MRI. the pain and tenderness started wed morning. had the MRI etc on thursday. only affected right breast. things were improving but had allergic reaction to the keflex and had to start on Z pack. today i noticed increasing more specific areas of pain on the right breast. the nipple and the bottom right quadrant. a couple hours ago i suddenly felt like both my breasts are engorging like when i was breast feeding and hurt like HECK!! Just before that i noticed my left nipple now hurting. now i have a low grade 99 degree fever (didnt have any fever up til now, just the pain and tenderness of rt breast). now both my breasts are super hot but not red. there is some pulsating like quivers in the same area of pain on the bottom right quadrant. (weird). i looked at my breasts in the mirror and now both nipples are super light color instead of super dark brown.and areolas look smooth instead of bumpy. there is a little red blister right on the top in the \"smiley\" part of the nipple that was not there yesturday...what the heck?!? i call my gyn and she says i need to be seen by the breast surgeon first thing in the morning again.  i talked to her about my concerns (i hadnt actually gotten to speak to her before it was her NP who referred me to the Breast surgeon cause of my inverted and open nipple- looks like its smiling at you). She says it is highly unusual to deveop this infection so many years after breastfeeding - my son is 9. so now she is concerned too. but she says get the infection under control and find out why and then get going on ruling out C. I am gonna insist on action tomorrow. hopefully they can get me in at the IU Simon cancer Center (research cancer center) tomorrow. my gyn said she would have her office call on my behalf if necessary and if not she will get me with the other breast surgeon since i dont like the first one i saw who didnt even want to let me get an MRI since i had the inverted nipple thing going on and dismissed 2 yrs ago. i am itching like crazy to on my upper back. my breasts feel like burning hot and engorging. I have a gland swollen above my collar bone the size of a baby carrot. advice? similar thing happen? anything would help right now cause I am just flabbergasted at the changes happening and now my gyn has me feeling validated and worried again. i am going to be positive and feel well equipped to get the best care but right now the \"do i or dont i\" question is getting the best of me. my symtpoms are just so weird and non typical but then again this IBC doesnt manifest the same in everyone. thanks for reading...

THis area of ehnancement id directly posterior to the nipple and areolar complex. and extending approx 2.6 cm posteriorly from the 12 mm area of nonmass-like enhancement within the nipple and areolar complex regiaon, there is a faint nonmass-like enhancement without stippling or nodularity involving fibroglandular breast tissue. this demonstrates benign, persistant enhancement kinetics. there is similar areas of fibroglandular enhancement seein withing the upper outer quadrant of the right breast and within the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. no suspicious left mass or non-mass like enhancement or architactural distortion. benign aooearing axillary lymph nodes. No suspicious internal mammary lymph nodes. no suspicious chest wall enhancements. impression 1. 12 mm area of nonmass0like enhancement within the R breast retroareolar region w/o evidence of suspicious right breast skin thickening and/or enhancements. reccomend right diagnostic mammogram and right breast 2nd look ultrasound *** They did that right after the MRI*** 2. Faint fibroglandular enhancement bilaterally, which demonstrates benign enhancement kinetics, most consistant with fibrocystic breast tissue. however, given the more central enhancement seen posterior to the 12 mm nonmass-like enhancement within the right breast, recommend short term followup breast MRI in 4 to 6 months for reeval  *YEAH RIGHT!!!  4 to 6 months.. long enough for cancer to grow!! BRIAD category 0 from the mammogram after (jsut bits and pieces not the whole report): scattered fibroglandular densities bilaterally. benighn appearing calcifications bilaterally. assymetrical increase in densities withing the right retroaerolar region. no discrete mass seen in this region. focal physical examination (he means he looked at it lol) demonstrated a prominent cleft within the right nipple. from the ultrasound of the nipple and areola that both the tech and radiologist were perplexed by: demonstrated normal fibroglandular tissue and benign ductal ectasia. scanning at 6:00 did elicit focal tenderness (it hurt like HELL).  question of increased echogenicity within the fat lobules, which may represent changes secondary to inflammation. encouraged patient to contine self breast examination and continue antibiotics. recommend return in one week for mammographic and ultrasonic reevaluation of right retroareolar region. discussed the possibility of undergoing biopsy if she should not respond to antibiotic therapy. and or if she feels a new or discrete lump. discussed the fact that the differential diagnosis, besides infection, included inflammatory breast carcinoma. Impression- generalized increased density withing the right retroareolar region... etc etc when coupled with patients presentation, findings are most consistant with an acute inflammatory process, such as infection witout abcess formation. recommend shor term follow up right breast  mammogram and ultrasound. sooo since i am not responding well to the antibiotics and my gyno says it is very concerning that i even have an infection for no reason (son is 9 years old). told me to get thee to surgeon tomorrow... i looked at the mri films and mammos. i think there will be enough for the specialist to get a biopy etc at todays visit at 12:00. what does all this say to you since i have been on atibiotics 5 days and yesturday both breasts started hurting for 2 hours  last night and was super hot and itchy and today my right breast is fuller. the main thing is i am getting seen by research breast surgeon who believes in early detection. i should be in good hands!  initial and persistant washout delayed kinetcs... this isnt good is it?",
