You can also call organizations like Susan G. Komen, the American Cancer Society or Y-ME (1-800-221-2141 OR, for Spanish-speaking: 1-800-986-9505) and see if they can give you some good resources.

If malignant and removed immediately, it is not necessarily fatal unless it returns, so the effort is to get as much involved tissue, as well as large margins as possible. The unfortunate thing about malignant phyllodes, as you seem to already know, is that it doesn't respond to chemo and the value of radiation is questionable. But, again, it is extremely likely that if you do have a phyllodes, it will be benign or borderline. A friend of mine had a phyllodes (borderline) 4 years ago when I had my IDC. Hers was removed via a lumpectomy and she's been absolutely fine ever since. She did recommend a message board though, one that is similar to ours here, but specifically for women who have phyllodes tumors.

Eight tiny nurses giggling with glee Leading the pack was an oncologist so sweet With a mission of cancer that they would beat To help with side effects from chemo we blame Was his arsenal of drugs that he shouted by name \"Now Xanax!, now Ativan!, now Zofran! and Compazine! Let's offer comfort with bob bons and magazines On Vicodin!, on Darvocet!, on Tylenol! And morphine! Let's make them loopy and make a big scene!\" To the top of Mt. Courage, to the top of Mt. Hope Now dash away, dash away so we can help cope With tumors and lesions and lumps it is clear We must make their cancer finally disappear! So up to the clinic-top, they flew and flew With a sleigh full of drugs and the doctor too Then with a jingling I heard from their purse Was the prancing and pawing of each little nurse As I drew in my head and was turning around In through the vent the doctor came with a bound His eyes how they twinkled - his dimples so merry His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry He was dressed all in white with an ugly plaid tie He preached to the patients, \"Do not ask why\" Have courage, choose hope and just think positive Live, love and laugh and your life will be lucrative Never forget that you are heroes in my book Conquering cancer without a second look With a wink of his eye and a twist of his head He soon let me know I had nothing to dread A bundle of drugs he had flung on his back He looked like a drug dealer opening his pack He spoke not a word but went straight to work Making me feel sick, so I called him a jerk A human pin cushion, I had become So multiple pokes, again I succumb But then I remembered, my life he was saving So I realized I better start really behaving \"What comes around goes around\" I always say And a bad attitude might haunt me one day I thanked him for fighting with me side by side With two against one, cancer cannot hide Then laying his finger aside of his nose And giving a nod, up the vent he rose He sprang to his sleigh, gave the nurses a sign To travel the world fighting cancer like mine The sleigh was our hope and he was the driver Bringing strength and good cheer to every survivor I heard him exclaim as he flew out of sight Happy Holidays to all and to all a good night! ~Marin \"Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim.\" ~Nora Ephron Log in to post a reply",

So I'm guessing that even if you hadn't taken HRT, you'd be somewhat scared that the mammogram might find cancer anyway. Nevertheless, you are right in your concern over the HRT putting you at a higher risk for bc. Having said that, though, there are more women who have had years of HRT who haven't developed bc than there are women who have. AND there are tons of women with bc who have never taken HRT. We're kind of fond around here of saying that its all a crap shoot, which isn't entirely true but often seems so in the face of the randomness with which bc chooses its targets. As for biopsies spreading cancer, my understanding is that this happens in only a highly miniscule subset of the population and, truly, consider the alternative. I would hardly think it sensible to have your entire breast cut off on the suspicion that it might have a spot of cancer. Perhaps an excisional biopsy would be a smarter alternative. In any event, you haven't even had a mammogram yet and chances are extremely high that when you do, it will be completely benign. So take a deep breath.....and take it one day at a time. That's all any of us have anyway, righT? ~Marin",

The lump is the reality and it's not normal to have it, so you need to know what it is....and the only way to know for sure is through biopsy, getting a piece of the tissue and having it examined by a pathologist. As for having it totally removed, many doctors do recommend an excisional biopsy, while others go for a 2-step approach involving either fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy and then the removal via lumpectomy. If you're uncomfortable having the lumpectomy, perhaps you can consult another breast specialist who will go for a core needle biopsy. Whatever you decide, please get a piece of it and have it examined. I don't mean to be overly dramatic, but it really could save your life. ~Marin",

It was eight years ago today, April 5th, that I had the core biopsy that diagnosed my IDC and DCIS. My entire world turned upside down and, once I had righted myself, I found this wonderful community of women, some of whom I have even become friends with \"in real life\" and others who I communicate with daily or weekly on facebook or other sites. I had no one in my life when I was dx'd (had just gotten divorced and my daughter was in college and I didn't want to disrupt her studies), so the support that I got here really saved my life. Today, my hair has grown back and is almost waist-length, my body has returned to nearly normal after 5 years on Aromasin and several reconstructive surgeries, but my life is far better than I could ever have imagined it to be. Cancer taught me to care for myself and to accept and be more gentle with others. It also made clear to me how much a gift life really is and I truly hope to never forget that. So here's to you all! YouÂ WILL make it through. There IS light at the end of the tunnel, light that signals, hopefully,Â a bright and healthy future. But even if the journey stays a bit bumpy, you get to know, in the deepest sense, that you are strong and a fierce & fabulous warrior. So keep on truckin' y'all. You absolutely can do this! Feel free to PM me, at any time, if you have questions, comments, or just want to vent. It is my privilege to pay back what the women here so freely gave to me when I needed it. ~Marin/FitChik \"Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim.\" ~Nora Ephron Log in to post a reply",

It is my opnion, and I think that many women on this board will agree, that diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer is best carried out by specialists and, whenever possible, a breast specialist. The fact that your mother's doctor didn't have her get off of her birth control medication immediately upon diagnosis is pretty astounding. Again, it's lucky that she has you! As for waiting a month before re-excision, I would guess that it's not extremely crucial. Most breast cancers take quite a while to grow and then to spread. However, since she has positive lymph nodes, it is a bit more urgent that she get to chemo as soon as possible. My suggestion, then, is to try to find a team of experts who will coordinate the various parts of her treatment plan. The best place to find such a team would be a major breast health center, perhaps at a university hospital or major medical center, if you have one within a reasonable distance? Good luck to your mother and to you. It sounds like she'll get great care with you as her daughter! ~Marin",

If you have a distinct, palpable mass, I should think that the doctor will also want to get to the bottom of it and find out what it is. I'm wondering if you had a digital or regular mammogram (the digital would have shown the views on a computer screen) because for young women and those with dense breasts, digital mammos are sometimes the only ones that can show anything. If you had digital, maybe your doctor should order an MRI in the hopes of seeing the lump. Finally, a biopsy would be the definitive test to determine whether or not it's malignant. At your age and even in general, most masses (80%) are found to be benign and this will most likely be your result.

It does sound like your doctor is very proactive in checking out the concerns, but it really could be just about anything from benign cysts to an infection to multiple other possibilities. Cancer is always a concern and if you do have something malignant going on, you sure want to catch it in the very beginning. But if I were you, I wouldn't place alot of importance on your doctor's use of the word 'spread.'Â  It sounds like s/he was referring to the fact that nothing was in one tight spot or unifocal, not implying that you have metastatic cancer throughout your chest. It's easy to jump to that conclusion when you're scared though...I know. Hang in there, kiddo. Chances are extremely likely that it's nothing or is a treatable, benign condition.

I have known, however, doctors to recommend surgery and radiation for fairly large tumors and never mention chemo as an option. This is what happened to me when I went to the initial doctor to whom I was referred. At the time, I knew very little about the ins & outs of bc, but I knew that I felt uneasy about the way that the doctor so breezily laid out the plan and expected me not to question it and simply go along. Fortunately, I got a second opinion and have been very pleased with my treatment plan, even though it included chemo. So I guess what I'm saying is that, if I were you, I'd get a second opinion and see if another physician agrees with foregoing chemo when you've had a positive node. ~Marin",

After that's established, you'll want to know the details of the procedure...when, where, how and what to expect in terms of recovery. I should think it very important to ask where the tissue will be sent and how long it will be before you know the results. If it were me, knowing what I do now (after having cancer), I'd want to know more details about what will be known if the masses are malignant, specifically, will you know what type, grade, hormone responsiveness and Her2/neu expression of the cancer. But that's only if the lumps aren't benign. Chances are very high that they will be (benign) because about 80% of all breast lumps are non-malignant. Finally, you might want to discuss with a breast specialist (maybe not necessarily the surgeon) the possibility of genetic testing to determine the liklihood of your developing breast cancer. Some people want to know this....and some don't. Good luck, Robyn. My own experience with lumpectomy was very smooth and easy. I wish the same for you. ~Marin",

Those who replied are correct in that you can certainly build your pectoral muscles through presses, but the muscles are actually above the area of the breasts which, as you know, are largely fatty tissue. Men have a great deal more testosterone than we do and, so, they build much larger muscle, sometimes resulting in a look that simulates a small, hard and toned breast. I think that it would be unrealistic for you to aim to achieve that same look, but you can certainly become very well toned throughout the whole area and, in doing so, look very attractive. I understand your fear about exercising your chest immediately after treatment, but once you're out for awhile, those fears should subside and you can work out as hard as you want. Good luck. I know that you're gonna love that new feeling of lightness combined with healthy strength. And goodness knows, you deserve to! ~Marin",

If you've had surgery already, the cancer should be gone and the chemo will just ensure that any random cells get zapped. If you've not had your surgery yet and are having neoadjuvant chemo to shrink the tumor, then the chemo will, hopefully, do that AND zap the extra cells. Then, you might even have rads for a little \"overkill.\" So even if the chemo doesn't shrink your tumor (mine didn't shrink it very much), the cancer will be addrssed in every other way possible too in order to get it completely gone! As for alternatives, it depends upon whether you're willing to take extra risks and hope that other, less-proven means will eradicate the malignancy. For myself and many of the women here, I was willing to do whatever it took to beat down this monster. Good luck, hon. It's very doable and, yes, this too shall pass.... ~Marin",

I'm nearly 2 years out and so far, so good, but who knows what the future brings. I also had to have nodal sites radiated, so mammosite wouldn't have been appropriate for me anyway. However, I do think that if I were in your situation, I'd consider doing the mammosite. We don't know about 15 years down the line with many of our newer treatments (like the aromatase inhibitors), but we take them anyway. And since the localized treatment seems to have the same result against the cancer, it just makes sense to decrease the odds of getting heart damage with whole-area rads. JMHO anyway.... As for the AIs, I've been on Aromasin for 2 years and my bones are still holding up well. I exercise every day and take calcium and vitamin D, so that probably helps. In any event, the biphosphanates (Boniva, Actonel, etc.) can be used to prevent bone loss and many women here report them to be effective. Hopefully, you'll get more responses on this. ~Marin",

As I look back, I see thatÂ I simply went into warrior mode and did what I needed to, putting one step in front of the other. It does sound logical for you to have the tumor removed and then move onto chemo, followed by rads. Some women have chemo before surgery (I did), but the intent of the treatments are the same. You want the tumor out, the chemo to kill any extra cancer cells that might have entered your system, and then the radiation to compound that effort and eradicate any cancer that could be left. It's the full guns approach and the best, in my opinion. So hang in there, Jax. Think of ways that you can pamper yourself and nurture your spirit. Go ahead and buy a wig or some pretty scarves (if you're sure that your chemo will cause hair loss which, btw, tends to happen about 2 weeks after your first tx, if you get Adriamycin). Schedule some massages, line up a housecleaner orÂ plan easy, freezeable meals. Do positive things to get you through as easilyÂ and as care-free as possible.

So make sure that you speak with whomever has decision-making power and can write the orders for a strong anesthetic. Then you should do absolutely fine. ~Marin",

The doctors will advise you regarding the best medical course of treatment and the one most likely to give you a physically healthier outcome. There are always alternatives, however, and you have every right to at least consider them. Having said that, though, it is my experience (and it seems to be that of many others here) that the sooner you arrive at your plan and begin putting it into effect, the sooner you'll find peace with it. Those pictures may have scared you, but most of the final outcomes that I've seen are amazing and even very attractive. If you haven't already, email/PM TimTam (a member here) and ask for a login to our own recon site. You might be more pleased with some of what you see there. Also consider a GAP (tissue taken from the gluteal area) if your PS performs these. I'd also recommend that you read what you can on the recon board here, especially posts by BethNY. She has a ton a knowledge and experience with bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction and can be very supportive and reassuring. It gets easier and far less confusing....soon...I promise! ~Marin",

Its commendable that you are being so proactive and making sure that you find out what these lumps are asap. But you DO have time despiteÂ what it sounded like your doctor said about getting a diagnosis quickly. I know that this is a terrifying time and with the whole history of your mom passing from bc when she was your age just makes it all the more scarier. But please consider this: most breast lumps, about 80% in fact, are found to be benign. That's right....NOT malignant and not cancer. Many, many women who have histories similar to yours, come on this board and after going through mammos/MRIs/ultrasounds and then biopsies, find that their conditions are benign. Now that's not to say that you shouldn't be concerned or that your fears aren't warranted. Any breast lump is just plain terrifying. But there's a very good chance that it won't be cancer. Having said all that, though, if it actually does turn out to be cancer, please know that there are thousands of us here on this board who have had aggressive, advanced cases of bc and are still around and even thriving. Breast cancer, even the most aggressive kind, is just not the death sentence that it was years ago, even 20 years ago. So hang in there, kiddo. Take your Xanax, care for your babies (or get someone to help do that to ease the burden), get your films, andÂ go through the tests.

My original tissue specimen from the biopsy was only IHC'd and showed a negative Her2. After chemo I had a lumpectomy and the tumor, at that time, suggested a slight overexpression of the Her-2/neu protein. So my docs sent it out to be FISH'd and it came back negative for Her-2. Since we all still had a slight doubt, I was given the choice regarding whether or not to have Herceptin. Since I was concerned about potential cardiac damage and there wasn't a clear need for it, I turned it down. I hope that you get a result from the second FISH that will set your mind at ease. The most important thing is that you attack your cancer with as much as it takes to get it gone. If that means chemo, that will require more time and effort, but it is absolutely doable and totally worth it! ~Marin",

There are different types and different grades and it's also important to know if your tumor was estrogen-postive or not and if it over-expressed the Her2/neu gene. All of these are how it is determined whether chemo will be beneficial to you. And, finally, the size of the tumor is very important and, usually, if it is 2cm or more, chemo is advised. Now your pregnancy adds yet another worry for you, of course, and I'm so very sorry that this had to happen to you at a time that should be only full of joy! But there are other young women on these boards who went through the same thing as you're going through and if you post under the \"Young Women\" section farther down on the boards, I'll bet you'll hear some of their stories. All I can say, at this point, is that your doctors should select a chemo regimen that can be effective but not at all harmful to your baby. There are such chemos. On the other hand, you should definitely ask your doctor straight out whether you can hold off chemo for 5 months. If your cancer isn't particularly aggressive, s/he may say it would be okay. Hang in there, girl, and take your time asking questions and getting answers that you understand. Maybe see if your breast center or hospital has a social worker or counselor who can help you through some of this. And keep asking us questions too....that's what many of us are here for! ~Marin",

Many women borrow a buzzer/razor and either do it them selves or have a friend or relative do it (some even make a party of it, believe it or not ). What I did was order a wig at a local shop and the woman there did the buzz the day it started to really come out. This would happen around 2 weeks after your first chemo, if you're getting AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxan). My \"wig lady\" didn't charge for doing the buzz, but she sure charged for the wigs! Also, our local breast center at the hospital collects used wigs and passes them on, so I'm thinking that a resource in your community might do that too and could refer you to a hairdresser willing to do the buzz for free. You might also try calling the American Cancer Society and ask if they know of such a service locally. As for dealing with your feelings of disappointment over not being able to bear more children, you might benefit from some of the discussions here on the \"Young Women...\" board.

Certainly, there's a possibility that the lumps you're feeling could be bc, butÂ the fact thatÂ your mother had a recurrence doesn't mean that you will too. We all fear recurrence but, typically, if it occurs, it is still early-stage (that's why we are so vigilant) and highly treatable. If you had a diagnosis, I'd encourage you to visit the 2nd-time-around board, but you don't and there's no sense in terrifying yourself. If the lump(s) is malignant, you'll put one foot in front of the other and get rid of it. If it isn't, you'll give a giant exhale and get on with your life.

And, of course, it's good that you found this lump so that you can have it examined right away and get answers. Having said that, I'll also add that you should keep in mind that most lumps, including breast lumps, are benign. In fact, about 80% of them are, despite often looking pretty suspicious. So try to remember that fact as you pursue an answer. I'd suggest that you start out with your regular doctor and see what s/he recommends. If s/he tries to dismiss the lump as \"nothing\" and tells you that you can't have breast cancer at your age, you should probably then seek out a breast specialist who will then examine the lump and, most likely, order some testing, probably an ultrasound. This will provide a good way of seeing what type of lump it is. TheÂ doctor might also order an MRI or, possibly, a needle biopsy. Don't be afraid of these tests, but if you're at all anxious or concerned about possible pain, definitely ask for pain medication and/or something to relax you. It's not at all uncommon to do so. As for feeling weird having the doctor touching your breast, that's completely understandable and normal and I should hope that the doctor will be sensitive to your age and your feelings. If you go to a specialist, you might try to find a female doctor since that could be more comfortable for you. In any event, the best way to stay calm is to try and distract yourself (kind of zone out, you know?) and remind yourself that it will be over very, very soon. Most of all....breathe. That's right, I'd recommend that you make every effort to just put one foot in front of the other and just get through it. Before long, chances are, it will all be behind you and you can get on with your life. You've got a long, wonderful life ahead of you and staying healthy is key. You've made a good beginning, so keep up the good job. And please keep us posted on what your doc says.

There are so many things that the lump can be, so a surgical consult with the intent of biosying the lump or removing it entirely and then biopsying is a logical course of action. Even if it's totally benign, it's not a normal thing to have in your breast and it probably should be removed. As we are fond of saying around here, the only good lump is one that's in a jar. So hang in there, Cathylin. I'm certain that it will all turn out fine. And if not, an early catch like that will give you the best result. ~Marin",

I was diagnosed with early stage, stage 1B-2A, IDC and that was 2.5 years ago. I can just say that once you have a treatment plan, you don't feel that some wild, evil creature has invaded your life and is throwing you madly about. When I first heard those words \"You have cancer\" I had no way to fit that into my image of myself as being in control of my life, but the treatments make you feel that since you're doing everything possible to eradicate the beast, you're again your own person, at least to the extent that that is ever possible. After a time, you can find peace with just about anything that happens, at least that's been my experience. If my cancer recurs or advances, I think that I'll just explore my treatment options, make a decision and move forward with it. I've finally come to realize that we all really only have the present....no one knows anything at all, really, about her/his future. Laura....There are such a variety of symptoms that indicate breast problems and if you're concerned about anything, if anything just seems or feels 'not right' it's probably a good idea to set your mind at ease by seeing a doctor. You should be doing monthly breast exams and having an annual breast exam by a doctor or other clinician. If you find a lump, it's very important to have it checked. Chances are HUGE that it is completely benign since 80% of all lumps are. The same goes for skin changes, nipple discharge and lumps under your arm or along your collarbone. I hope that helps...? ~Marin",

The thought that you could possibly have such a dreaded disease is absolutely terrifying and that's how you feel...scared shitless. It's normal. And you're correct that if your tests haven't shown any abnormalities, the chances are huge that the little lump is completely benign, in which case the surgeon can remove it (or leave it alone, depending on what it actually is) and you'll go on about your business. But yes, it's hard waiting to know and fear is a common emotion while you do. If you can take time off from work or immerse yourself in a busy project there, do it. Anything to distract yourself until you have your answers. And if you can possibly call the surgeon's office and ask them to consider taking you earlier if they get a cancellation, do that too. Most importantly, breathe....this waiting won't last forever and your odds of having cancer are so very low. Hang in there! ~Marin",

      "Content": "FitChik wrote: Dear Marin, Bridget Mooney was diagnosed with breast cancer at only 21 with no family history of the disease. Testing for a specific genetic mutation commonly associated with breast cancer can lead to early detection and treatment - saving countless lives. Take action now and help other women just like Bridget! Did you know that there is a genetic test that can help people find out if their family history of breast cancer may be due to a genetic mutation? Unfortunately, if you are tested - and your results are positive - there are very few federal protections preventing insurance companies from denying you coverage due to your genetic condition. This has led many to forgo testing, denying them important information that could help them manage their health and the health of their families. Â  But there is something we can do to change this! The Senate is debating a bill called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which would make it illegal to discriminate based on genetic information. Â  Click here to urge your Senator to support fair access to preventative treatments! Preventing these protections could cost lives - lives of real people like Bridget Mooney. Bridget Mooney graduated in 2005 with a degree in International Relations from Boston University. But just one week after her graduation, Bridget was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was only 21 and had no family history of the disease. For nearly six months, Bridget was told by several doctors not to worry about the lump in her left breast, and was not sent for a mammogram. Bridget was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. Her doctors were not optimistic about her chances of survival, but she had a good response to chemotherapy and has now been cancer-free for over a year. Bridget is still in treatment - she goes every three weeks for chemotherapy, and will have to for the rest of her life. Bridget's fight against cancer is inspirational, but sadly because of the potential discrimination from insurers or employers, she is reluctant to take more pro-active measures to learn more about her cancer that might help her family: \"Breast cancer in someone my age suggests a genetic mutation, but I did not get a genetic test. I am afraid of being discriminated against by a future employer or when I try to get health insurance if I test positive for a genetic mutation. There are currently not enough rules and safeguards to protect patient information. I already cannot get life insurance because I am a breast cancer survivor,\" said Bridget. \"My mom has not had cancer. I want my mom to know about her own breast cancer risk, but I don't want to get a genetic test because I worry that my mom and my cousins may face discrimination. By not getting the test, my family doesn't have important genetic information which would empower them. I hope one day my family members will feel free to take any steps possible to avoid developing breast cancer themselves.\" Send a message today to your Senators telling them we need protections for people like Bridget Mooney. Â  The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act last year. If this bill passes the Senate, we will have a great opportunity to promote personalized medicine and the use of genetic information in healthcare. This will lead to better research and development for new targeted drugs and treatments, which will save lives. Don't delay! Join Bridget in the fight to protect the futures of other young women by urging your Senators to pass GINA. Thank you for joining us on this important issue. Together we can end breast cancer forever. Sincerely, Diane Balma Susan G.

      "Content": "Mar 3, 2008 11:18AM - edited Mar 3, 2008 11:21AM by FitChik Hi Karen...I know how scared you are because I felt exactly the same way when first diagnosed (in 4/05). After you've seen the array of doctors and have your whole treatment plan set up and especially after you actually begin treatment, the whole thing gets perspective and you really will feel quite in control again. You just gotta believe me on that. In the meantime, you're smart to build in a few supports \"in case\" like the intermittent FMLA. As for chemo, the majority of us who have early stage bc, regardless of the estrogen/progesterone status, usually (though not always) get Adriamycin and Cytoxan, often for 4 cycles, followed by one of the taxanes (Taxol or Taxotere) for another 4 cycles. Usually the cycles are 2 weeks apart (known as \"dose dense\"). Also, for those who are Her2+, like you, they get either Herceptin along with the latter part of their treatments or begin it afterwards and, typically, receive one treatment monthly for at least 12 months (correct me if I'm wrong about this, Her2 girls..?). I can only speak, then,Â from my own experience about working and time off, but I only needed to take off the actual days of the infusions, 8 days in all, and then the day of the lumpectomy. I also took a day here & there for things like getting set-up for radiation treatments, etc. Other than that, although I too took intermittent FMLA \"in case,\" I didn't use anything for sick days and, so, was fully paid throughout treatment. So, depending upon how your body reacts to the chemo and rads, you can either keep working the whole time, take a block of time off, or just take whatever time you need when you need it. My advice? Try not to worry about what might be in terms of side effects, outside of making necessary \"in case\" plans, as you've done. It will be a waste of your energy and you'll need all of that to stay focused and at peace with your one & only mission....to heal and become whole & healthy again which YOU WILL! Keep posting and asking for support here, Karen. I would never have made it through without these awesome women! ~Marin",

You are clearly aware that you need to be extra vigilant due to your family history, but that doesn't mean that this lump of yours is definitely and undoubtedly cancer. In fact, it most certainly can be something benign. If you do read more on this board, you'll see it repeated that MOST lumps (about 80%) are found to be non-cancerous. And yours could be one of those. So until you know the results and have a definitive diagnosis, try not to project too much into the future. It may actually be just fine. Having said that, I agree with Trisha that you should share you fears with your mother. I have a 25 year old daughter and would be very hurt if she didn't tell me what was going on with her. An important part of being a mother is being strong and comforting when your child hurts. Please let her be that for you. She can handle it, I'm sure. Keep us posted, butterfly.

Breast cancer doesn't usually present with pain, especially in the absence of any other abnormality, but since you have the \"discharge\" that's certainly not normal and needs to be addressed. If you live close to a university hospital or any major medical facility, I'd suggest that you get an appointment with a breast specialist, someone who has seen all of the weird things that can happen to our breasts and can be quicker with a diagnosis and treatment than a PCP or any non-specialty doctor might be. So I'd say do try to get this looked at earlier, but try not to worry. It sounds like an infection, but you need to address it right away no matter what it is. ~Marin",

My PS told me that if there are problems with the way that the implants settle, etc., we will have the option of going back in for an adjustment. It is my understanding though that I'll need to wait to see if the problem is only temporary. As for the dent, she tells me that if it is still marked, I can have Restalyne injections in the area to fill it in or even my own fat (which I have very little of!). If worse comes to worse and the implants totally fail (after more than one attempt, at least), I'll have the option of a GAP where they use your gluteal tissue to fill the divot. In that case, the implant on the healthy side remains and the GAP side is made to match the other. Time will tell....for both of us presumably. Try to hang in there and see how it goes. We're so extraordinarily lucky to actually have been able to keep our original breasts, right, even if they do need a bit of work to get them looking healthy again! ~Marin",

I had what I thought was a \"strange\" reaction to the prospect of having my port removed, but when I came on here, I learned that it was far from odd. First, some background...I started chemo in early May of '05 and finished on the last day of August '05. My onc assumed that I'd want the port removed asap because so many women do and I had been particular about it's placement and \"cosmetic look.\" Anyway, the thought of having it removed terrified me and I asked to keep it. Though the doctors thought my request weird (or so it seemed to me), the nurses who flushed it toldÂ me that some people keep their ports for years, even though they had finished chemo and had had no recurrences. So I kept it in, all the while nursing my superstition that if I have it removed, my cancer would come back. Yes, it was definitely superstition and not at all based on fact, but I simply allowed myself to exoperience the reassurance and comfort of keeping it. Then, as summer of '06 approached, I started thinking about getting it out and after my onc NP said to me \"hey, if it comes back, you'll just get another port,\" it seemed quite easy and I made the appointment and had it out. The funny part was that my tissue had grown so strongly around it, it was almost as if my body had cooperated with my emotions. It took a bit of tugging to get it out (I didn't feel pain at all, just tugging), but my body (and mind) finally let it go! Take-away lesson? Have it removed when YOU feel comfortable about it, whether that's the hour after your last infusion or 2 years later! ~Marin",

Of course, since the tissue was benign, only a description of that tissue was documented. I'm wondering, though, whether your initial samples can be forwarded to the new path lab so that you don't need another biopsy. Surely, they didn't throw them out! ~Marin",

I have a friend who had such a mass and the doctors kept leaving it alone, saying that it didn't look like anything. It did grow larger and, eventually, she went to a surgeon who took it out. At that point, the path found it to be a phyllodes tumor, which is a rare form of breast cancer. It was borderline for malignancy and she needed no further treatment and is fine today, but that might not be the case if they had left the mass in there. I'm not trying to scare you, but I am trying to encourage you to see this through. You can always have some sort of reconstruction in the future if you're unhappy with the cosmetic outcome of the excision. This could mean implants or just having fat or collagen filler injected into the area. Hang in thereÂ and keep us posted. ~Marin",

I guess it depends on the area from which the tissue is removed and maybe even the skill of the physician. If the area is red and/or swollen, you might have some infection, so be sure to mention it tomorrow. ~Marin",

As for how others respond to your diagnosis, you may find, as time goes on, that some of the responses are downright amusing. In fact, we've had several long threads going on around here with women posting about all of the weird things people say. And don't worry yet about getting through your treatments. Just be assured that they are all completely doable and some of them aren't too bad at all. For side effects, oncologists have amazing drugs at their disposal, so things like nausea that used to plague so many on chemo isn't nearly as likely. Low blood counts can be elevated, etc. And many of us here (including me) worked full-time throughout chemo. In fact, I even continued teaching my fitness classes in the evenings as well! It all depends on howÂ you respond to the treatments. The most important thing is to never let it out of your mind that you are fighting for your very own life and, right now, it is all about YOU and no one else. Be gentle with yourself and kep coming here for support....we're pretty good at it! ~Marin",

When you're done with chemo, they simply take it out. So please don't worry about getting a port.

Also, the hormone-sensitivities (ER/PR) and Her2/neu status is important in determining your treatment. Finally, the lymph node involvement should be determined to factor in, so you'll need to wait for that. Since I'm guessing that you meant the tumor was 8mm (not cc), I'll say that that's relatively small. The standard of treatment for a smallish IDC tumor might be what's being recommended for you- lumpectomy, radiation and if it is estrogen-sensitive, tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor if you're postmenopausal. Maybe you should try to get more details from your doctor (write down her/his responses or tape them or bring along someone to listen...or all 3) and come back here for better answers. The most important thing to know at this moment is that your cancer doesn't sound at all life-threatening and can be effectively treated and theÂ treatments are very doable.

The nerves do take quite a long time to re-establish and make new pathways and some of us feel it more than others. Having said that though, I'm guessing that you are simply having expected post-surgical issues. The area where the tumor(s) were removed is still traumatized and probably inflamed & swollen...hence, the sensation of fullness. Some women even hear a swishing sound right after surgery as the fluid gathers in the vacant area and tries to settle. I'd say that you should try to relax, Daisy, and check with your surgeon or surgical nurse to verify that what you're feeling is normal. ~Marin",

Your diagnoses sounds alot like mine and many others here. I had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) too. They estimated my tumor to be 2.5 cm, but after surgery it was found to be 1.8 cm, which is about 1 inch...just like yours. Of course, I did have chemo first and that might have shrunk it a bit. Whatever. A month after surgery, I did radiation therapy and went every weekday morning for those treatments (they took like 10 minutes each) for 6 weeks. It sounds like alot, but it quickly became routine. Anyway, it's been 1 1/2 years since I finished all of that and I'm taking Aromasin (to prevent recurrence) and doing just fine. I have a full-time job at a medical center and a part-time job teaching fitness. I also have a daughter who is now 23 years old and still the center of my life, so I understand how you feel about your boys. You're going to be fine, Sue. Just take it a step at a time and be as gentle with yourself as possible. Keep coming here too and join our discussions, ask questions, even help others. We'll get through this together, okay? ~Marin PS.....Your picture is awesome....you look gorgeous!",

I had a lumpectomy, no nodes removed though, chemo and radiation, so I can't provide much info about the stuff I didn't have. But, as you can see, there are plenty who can!

It does sound like you have some sort of infection, but the pros you're seeing aren't finding out what it is soon enough and you certainly don't want it to get much worse. So get an appointment as soon as possible and, if I were you, I'd start with a breast specialist since that's where your main problems are. Do you have a large university hospital near you that has a breast center? ~Marin",

The most difficult part for me was the wire localization beforehand and if I ever have another lumpectomy, I'll be sure to ask for an anesthetic for that procedure. When it came to the actual lumpectomy, it wasÂ a piece of cake. They gave me twilight drugs (versed, fentanyl and something else I can't recall), but I chattered to my surgeon the whole way through. It was so uneventful that I even wore my jeans the entire time (). Recovery was uneventful too and I had no pain or unusual swelling. The surgery was on a Thursday andÂ I went back to work on Monday. I could have gone back on Friday! I hope that your lumpectomy goes as smoothly! ~Marin",

Chances are, of course, that they are benign, as conjectured. I have a friend, though, who had what was thought to be a cyst for a number of years and, when she changed doctors, a biopsy was suggested. It turned out to be a phyllodes tumor (a rare type of BC). She had it removed nad is fine today, but that type of tumor can become very aggressive and it was good that she didn't wait longer. I tell you this not to scare you, but to illustrate that unless the actual tissue is evaluated, you never really know what you're dealing with. So I'd say just have it out and get that behind you. ~Marin",

The only thing that I can see trouble with is the glue as well as the fact that you don't remove them for several months. Many of us experience scalp issues during chemo (like a kind of cradle cap rash or just extreme dryness) and it'sÂ absolutely crucial that you do everything to avoid any infection while you're in such a vulnerable state. So if you really want to try the extensions/\"hair system\" I'd advise you to run it by your onc and see what s/he thinks. Before you lose you hair, it seems like the most terrifying thing about the whole bc journey. Afterwards....well, I won't say that you'll be blase or indifferent about it, but once you start on a course of action that addresses it safely and in a way that allows you to be emotionally comfortable, the issue loses its power and you move forward. I needed to wear a wig...as in ALWAYS...and no one ever saw my bald head (do my cats count though ?). Other women become so comfortable that they're okay with scarves or caps and then others just go topless altogether. It's so individual, ya know? Anyway, if your onc says its okay, just make sure that you're still able to keep your scalp very clean. And if it looks amazing, be sure to post pics! ~Marin",

I can tell you that my first opinion recommended a lumpectomy and rads and didn't mention chemo. I went to another major university hospital and they strongly recommended chemo. My tumor was IDC, ER+, PR+, Her2/neu- and assumed to be 2.5cm (grade 2). Knowing that my first shot had to be my best and my most aggressive, I opted for chemo. I had 4 AC and 4 Taxols, dose dense. That was 2 years ago, in the summer of 2005. I was extremely lucky and had only the typical side effects with nothing that made me really miserable or very sick....a little fatigue, mouth sores, flushes, a few fevers, a few aches and some neuropathy in my toes. Of course I lost my hair, something I thought I couldn't possibly tolerate, but once it started to happen, I had it buzzed and never looked back. Today, I am thrilled that I did the chemo. I still have a bit of neuropathy, but I can live with it. I'm at peace knowing that I did everything I could to beat this monster, so even if it comes back, I won't beat myself up and wonder 'what if?' But everyone needs to make her own decision on the issue and do what her own gut tells her is best. Only you know the answer. The good news is that, so far, I'm NED (no evidence of disease) and my life is more terrific than ever. And the strong, smart, incredible women on this board helped me through it all. So stick around, no matter what you decide. The journey is so much easier when you're not alone! ~Marin",

I'm sorry that she had to give her life to this awful disease, but you don't have to. You can fight it by getting the best, most aggressive treatments possible and then be around to see your grandchildren NOT have to suffer with it too because by then (I certainly hope!), we will have a cure.
