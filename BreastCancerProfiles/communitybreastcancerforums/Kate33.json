Almost all of us have had the nipples turn dark temporarily or have black scabs form. This does not mean the nipple has died! I would not let them remove it unless they are absolutely certain it is not viable. What typically happens is the nipple turns dark, then a scab forms, and several weeks later the scab falls off (hopefully) revealing a healthy pink nipple beneath. (It reminds me of a baby's umbilical cord). The best thing you can do is protect it as much as possible, wash gently, etc. Wishing you the best of luck.",

You will probably have a million questions and I swear there is a thread on here about each and every one of them.  There are a lot of sites out there but I found this one to be the best in giving you lots of information and wonderful support.   I had a double mastectomy (they abbreviate it to BMX on here) in March so I can definitely relate to what you are going through.  Debbi is right, though, they can do amazing things with reconstruction now- nipple sparing mastectomies (which is what I had), they can put in implants or use your own tissue as one and they can even laser all the scars away when you are done with everything.  I'm not going to lie to you and say it will feel like your own breast but they can go a long way towards making you feel whole again.  They also have some chemo available that doesn't cause you to lose your hair. My advice to you is to try to educate yourself as much as possible on your kind of cancer. Find out exactly what your options are regarding treatment, surgery, etc.  Keep a notebook and write down questions as you think of them and then take the notebook to your doctor appointments. (And if your doctor isn't willing to answer each and every question find a new one.)  And take someone with you to every appointment and have them take notes.  (You will usually only remember about half of what is said.) The more you can prepare for what is ahead the less scary it becomes.  If you have any questions about anything I guarantee there is a woman on here who has gone through it and will gladly help you through it, too.  Good luck!   Kate ",

Since my surgeon did not advise me of this possibility, and wasn't trained in the procedure, I searched out and found one who did.  It meant driving 4 hours round trip for every visit but it was worth it.  I had this done in March 2010 and am very happy with the results. So the only purpose of my post is to let other women know that, for preventative mastectomies and even some where cancer has already been diagnosed, this is a viable option.  If you are considering a mastectomy because you have found out that you carry the gene I would recommend that you consult with a qualified surgeon to find out if you are a good candidate or not as some women are not.   During the procedure your breast tissue is removed while preserving the skin and nipple.  When done by an experienced surgeon this type of mastectomy is just as safe as traditional ones.  The breast tissue is then replaced with either an implant or some of your own tissue. Many women have said the most traumatic thing physically about a mastectomy is the loss of their nipples.  Although plastic surgeons can do amazing things to create a \"new\" nipple it will never look as natural as your own.  If you'd like to learn more about this procedure there is a video on the show \"The Doctors\" as well as many threads on this site.  Feel free to PM me, too.  I would be happy to answer any questions that I can. Kate  Here is a link to another thread of here if someone would like to read posts by other women who have had NSM done.  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44/topic/745796?page=31#idx_91                   Kate33 \"Yes, they're fake.

Please don't let them remove the nipple until they are absolutely sure there is necrosis. Usually the nipple will continue to get darker, it will form a scab and after several weeks the scab will fall off revealing a nice healthy pink nipple underneath. There are mixed opinions out there about putting ointment on the nipples. Some believe if it doesn't appear infected, but is just dark in color, to just keep them dry and protected. If there is a scab don't pick at it. Do you have TE's? If you do and had a lot of saline added during the MX it can put a lot of pressure on the fragile blood supply to the nipples. Some suggest having some of the saline drained to ease up on the pressure until the nipples have healed more. You may be ready to transition out of the surgical bra, too, as they also put a lot of pressure on the nipples. Ask your PS if you can wear a sports bra instead or if the surgical bra is necessary for the hematoma. Wishing you the best of luck with everything.",

Since my surgeon did not advise me of this possibility, and wasn't trained in the procedure, I searched out and found one who did.  It meant driving 4 hours round trip for every visit but it was worth it.  I had this done in March 2010 and am very happy with the results. So the only purpose of my post is to let other women know that, for preventative mastectomies and even some where cancer has already been diagnosed, this is a viable option.  If you are considering a mastectomy because you have found out that you carry the gene I would recommend that you consult with a qualified surgeon to find out if you are a good candidate or not as some women are not.   During the procedure your breast tissue is removed while preserving the skin and nipple.  When done by an experienced surgeon this type of mastectomy is just as safe as traditional ones.  The breast tissue is then replaced with either an implant or some of your own tissue. Many women have said the most traumatic thing physically about a mastectomy is the loss of their nipples.  Although plastic surgeons can do amazing things to create a \"new\" nipple it will never look as natural as your own.  If you'd like to learn more about this procedure there is a video on the show \"The Doctors\" as well as many threads on this site.  Feel free to PM me, too.  I would be happy to answer any questions that I can.

I opted for implants as I was too thin to use my own tissue.  There are pros and cons for both.  With implants, depending on how old the women is, she will usually have to replace them at least once in her lifetime resulting in an additional surgery.  With procedures using your own tissue the recuperation is much harder and you usually end up with some pretty large scars.   It is really a personal decision.   If you have your NSM performed by an experienced surgeon the rate of recurrence is EXACTLY the same as traditional MX which is less than 1%.   During the NSM the surgeon will scrape the cells within the nipple and biopsy them during surgery.  If any cancer cells are detected they would need to remove the nipple at that time.   Again, anyone considering this please consult with someone who actually does this kind of surgery.  If I had listened to my original surgeon, who was not trained in the procedure, I would be looking down at two fake nipples right now. Here is some additional information: For women who have already been DX with BC.  Your cancer cannot be located too close to the nipple.  As surgeons perfect this procedure, though, the parameters for \"too close\" will certainly change.  I would still consult with a BS. Women who are large breasted are not typically considered good candidates.  It becomes very difficult to maintain blood supply to the nipple when it has too far to travel. Again, though, see if the BS thinks you are a viable candidate or not.  As far as repositioning the breasts I believe the PS can make some adjustments but probably nothing too major.  This wasn't a factor for me, since I was so small breasted, so I'm really not qualified to answer this one.  For those of you who are small like I was, though, they can increase your size by quite a bit and still keep the nipples in the right place.  Several women on here are going from an A cup to a C with no problems. After NSM, you will typically lose all sensation in your nipples.  Some women do get feeling back.  Most do not, but this is very common in women who have had breast augmentation as well. With NSM you really need to find an experienced BS AND a PS.  This is a team effort.  Your BS will perform the MX but your PS will be doing the reconstruction and they, also, have to be skilled so as not to disturb the blood supply to the nipple while they are doing the reconstruction.   If you are opting for implants typically the PS will place tissue expanders beneath the breast skin and pectoral muscles.  Usually this is done the same time as your NSM.  Some surgeons, like mine, prefer to do it a week later to decrease the chances of infection.  Then every few weeks they will add saline to the expander through a port beneath your skin.  These are called \"fills\".  They are painless and are done at the PS's office.  Once you have been expanded to your desired size the PS will have you wait anywhere from 6 weeks to 3 months while the skin adjusts.  After the waiting period you would have an additional surgery to remove the expanders and place the implants.  This is called your \"exchange surgery\".  The tissue expansion process can be uncomfortable for some but not unbearable.  The most difficult part is the tissue expanders (TE's) are quite hard so your breast becomes hard as well.  But this is just temporary until your exchange.  For those women wanting to go this route make sure you discuss what you want your end result to be.  This will determine what type and size of TE the PS will chose for you.  For those who are considering using their own tissue, again I did not have this done so am not really able to give you much information there.  But there are other threads on this site that talk about it and you can get information from your PS as well. If you want to read some posts from women who have had this done there is a thread called \"Nipple Sparing Mastectomy with immediate reconstruction\".  There are some wonderful women are there that would be happy to share their experiences with you.  There is also a link on that thread that will take you to another called \"Where are the Skin Sparing Nipple Sparing Procedures Done?\"  It is a fairly new thread so not all cities are listed, of course.  One of the greatest challenges of NSM is finding a qualified surgeon.  Depending on where you live you may need to travel to another city or even another state.  (Mine was 2 hours away.)  But if you think about the fact that this is something you are going to have to live with for the rest of your life what is a few months of inconvenience? When considering any breast surgery please explore all your options.  If you are considering a MX for preventative reasons you have time to educate yourself.  I just wanted to make everyone aware that you can't count on your surgeon to do that for you. For me, having this option made me feel more \"whole\" afterwards.  But that being said, I would never imply that women who didn't have NSM are any less so.  PS's can do amazing things these days to create a new nipple if it become necessary to remove yours.  But I have a problem with surgeons just lopping off nipples because they are uneducated or they're lazy and it's easier to do so.  It's barbaric and unnecessary in a lot of cases, especially for preventative MX's.  If you, or anyone else, has any more questions feel free to PM me.  Kate ",

So step away from the computer and go spend the day with your wonderful children.  Tuesday will be here soon enough.  Wishing you all good news but if it isn't so just know there are many women on here who will help you with information and support throughout it all.   (((hugs))))",

Now if they find you have invasive cancer, they remove the breast tissue, test the nipple and then afterwards you will receive chemo.  The purpose of chemo is to kill any stray cancer cells remaining.  If you're worried about stray cells in the nipple the chemo would kill those as well. So having invasive BC does not prevent you from having NSM.  If anyone would like to talk to someone who had it done please check the other thread and PM anyone you see who had the same type of cancer you did.  They would be happy to tell you about their experience. ",

I'm not sure what specifically you want me to answer for you.  Our cancers are different in that DCIS is not invasive and IDC is so there are different treatments advised for both.  But I did have a bilateral (double) mastectomy.  I can tell you that the right breast surgeon and plastic surgeon can do amazing things with reconstruction.  They do skin sparing mastectomies and, sometime with the right candidate, even nipple sparing.  They can give you implants or even use your own tissue.  Some surgeons are able to do the incisions below the fold of the breast so as to be less obvious.  And for those women not able to have nipple sparing they can create very lifelike new ones again using your own tissue.  Your reconstruction will typically only take about 4 months.  I know that seems like a long time but most of that time you will be able to continue life pretty much as normal.   Now the thing that could be different with your treatment is the possibility of chemo or radiation and that is something you need to discuss with your breast surgeon or oncologist.  If you have any questions feel free to PM (personal message) me anytime.  Just click on my screen name and it will take you to another page where you can send me a message.  Or just put your question here.  I'm happy to help in any way that I can. Sending you (((hugs))).",

One thing my doctor did say, for those fibro sufferers, is that she feels it is wrong that we are being treated by rheumatologists as it is not a disease of the joints.  She believes it is a neurological disorder and should be treated as such.  The Mayo Clinic agrees- Why does it hurt? Current thinking centers around a theory called central sensitization. This theory states that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased sensitivity in the brain to pain signals. Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals.",

Has anyone ever given people close in their life the clothes pin test?  Have them clip a clothes pin to the end of their finger and see how long they can stand to have it on there.  When they finally can't take it, and they remove it, tell them how it would feel if they could never remove the clothes pin and they had them all over their body.  When I had my DH do it I think he finally (almost) got it. Thanks, again, for the understanding and the hug.  I needed it today. ",

Why is it when a doctor can't figure out what the heck is wrong with you they want to label you as depressed?  This ticks me off!  I think it is pure laziness on their part.  After being tested for MS and fibro it was suggested I get my thyroid checked.  Just had it done 6 months ago but figured, what the heck?  Anyway, 6 months ago TSH was 2.710 and now it is 4.190 and I have about 18-20 symptoms of hypothyroidism but doctor says 4.190 is still within the normal range.  (Normal for who?)  He won't even consider treating me to see if symptoms improve.  Then implies perhaps I'm depressed.  I wanted to put a depression right in the middle of his head.    I agree that depression can mimic a lot of auto-immune diseases but swollen face, swollen tongue, low body temperature and even loss of eyebrows?  How the h*** is that depression?!?  ok....done with my rant now... ",

Suz- I think when trying to decide what treatment to go with it has to be about the cancer not the chronic pain.  You need to decide which way (lumpectomy or MX) is best for you to get rid of your cancer and give yourself peace of mind.  However, reconstruction is another story.  I do have pain with my implants which my PS said can happen in women with fibro.  (Of course, she didn't tell me until after I got my implants.)  But there are other options if you do want reconstruction or you can choose no reconstruction at all like barbe did.   And, BTW, I think those who don't have chronic pain do think we are \"princesses\" and are very delicate.  If they only knew how strong we really are to put up with this pain day after day.",

Lisa1962 is right.  Most lumps are benign.  Also there are different types of breast cancer which I never realized.  Most women think a diagnosis of breast cancer automatically means mastectomy, chemo, radiation, losing your hair, etc.  But there are some types that can be treated with just lumpectomy.  A lot don't require chemo.  And some chemos today don't make you lose your hair.  So take a deep breath.  The odds are on your side that this isn't cancer and if it is there is a greater chance it's the non invasive kind.  But whatever happens we are all here for you! ",

If you don't get on meds right away the pain can last quite awhile.  Hers lasted about 2 months but not sure if that is the norm or not.  Unfortunately, it can come back again.  She's had it come back about 3 times.  There is a vaccine the CDC recommends every one over 50 get to prevent shingles.  If you already have it they still recommend it and they say it can help prevent a recurrence.  I know they don't recommend the vaccine if you're going through chemo or rads but not sure if it's still not advised afterwards.  If you do have a recurrence get on an anti-viral medication as soon as possible.  (They say within 72 hours.)  It shortens the duration and lessens the intensity of the outbreak.  It's a good idea to always have a refill on hand and take it with you when you travel.  (My Mom learned this the hard way and now always takes it with her just in case.)  Hot flashes and shingles!  You poor thing!  I'm a crazy woman with just the hot flashes! :-0",

Naltrexone isn't a new drug; it's been around for more than 30 years and is used to treat opioid addiction. Stanford's Jarred Younger, PhD, and Sean Mackey, MD, PhD, tested a low dose of naltrexone as a fibromyalgia treatment in 10 women who had had fibromyalgia for about 10 years, on average. First, the women spent two weeks recording the severity of their fibromyalgia symptoms every day using a handheld computer. And they took lab tests to gauge their fibromyalgia pain and sensitivity to heat and cold. After that, the women took a placebo pill every day for two weeks, but they didn't know it was a placebo pill. At the end of the placebo period, the women took a naltrexone pill once a day for eight weeks. Finally, they spent the last two weeks of the study not taking naltrexone or the placebo. All along, the women continued to rate their fibromyalgia symptoms every day, and they repeated their lab tests every two weeks. While taking the placebo, the women reported a 2.3% drop in the severity of their fibromyalgia symptoms, compared to their symptom ratings at the start of the study. When they switched from the placebo to naltrexone, they reported an additional 30% drop in their fibromyalgia symptom severity. The women also showed greater tolerance for pain and for hot (but not cold) temperatures while taking naltrexone. Most of the women -- six out of 10 -- responded to naltrexone. Side effects were mild and brief. Two women reported having more vivid dreams during the study, and one woman reported transient nausea and insomnia during the first few nights of taking the pills, note Younger and Mackey. The study, which appears online in Pain Medicine, was a small, preliminary project to see if low-dose naltrexone showed promise. It did, so Younger and Mackey are already working on a new study that will test low-dose naltrexone in 30 fibromyalgia patients for 16 weeks.",
