I'm so happy for those who have finished!  I have 1 more regular & 6 boosts.  I am mentally done.  It's been really good to have this site to go to.  Following all of your journeys has really helped me with mine.  Good luck to you all!",

I still walk the dog everyday, and I'm determined to go to Zumba 3 times a week (though I only made it twice last week, just too tired.)  But between working full time, and zipping over to the hospital everyday for Tx, and squeezing in a little exercise, I'm beat.  I refuse to give up the exercise!!!!!!  I honestly think that is what is making all of this possible.  I'm spending my weekends resting and relaxing, not easy to do for me, but it's all I can do.",
