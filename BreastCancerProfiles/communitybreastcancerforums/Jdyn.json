I have since had my first mammogram and sonogram which was said to be BRADS 4 & necessitated a core needle biopsy. I had the biopsy yesterday and am trying not to let the fear of waiting wear me down, but it's hard! I'm terrified. In any event,I just took the sports bra I've been wearing for compression since yesterday off for the first time, and I notice I still feel the little pea in all of its glory NEXT to the biopsy bandage and bruising. Do they go in at an angle and this is typical, or could they have biopsied the wrong area? She used the ultrasound machine to guide her. Any knowledge would be ever so greatly appreciated!

I was so alarmed when I felt the lump next to the bandage rather than under it, but from these few responses on here it seems to be pretty typical that they go in from the side. She was about to put a titanium clip in when I told her that I had to have a titanium plate removed from my foot last year. It is still inconclusive if my reaction is due to the titanium, which I know is rare, or if something else caused my body to be unhappy. My foot is still discolored and shows edema on the MRI, so she decided to err on the side of caution and not put the clip in. She did not do a mammogram after the biopsy, and I don\u2019t think she was going to even if she had put the clip in. There was no mention of that. I am having the worst time waiting for these results! But I guess everybody in thissituation probably feels the same way:/",
