On the basis of 2 clear MRIs and the opinion of 3 breast consultants I chose the latter. I had a biopsy following the detection of a small mass on 31st Dec. Last Monday, they told me I have a 7mm mucinous cancer and that the prognosis is very good. I had assumed that would mean a mastectomy and was prepared for it but, the consultant felt that a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy followed by rads would be equally effective. In the 5 minutes after diagnosis, I made a gut-reaction/grabbing at straws sort of decision to go for the less invasive treatment. My BC nurse said she'd phone on the Thursday. She didn't. By Friday I had serious doubts about the rads and their SEs so, called and left a message saying I'd like to consider the mastectomy instead. They said she would call back but it might not be until Monday. Nothing..... I called yesterday afternoon & got the answerphone... then one of her colleagues called back to say she wasn't in work but had asked them to tell me she'd ring this morning. There are just 5minutes of this morning left. I'm concerned that it will probably take a while to get that scheduled... and that delay could mean my tiny cancer grows and spreads (despite them telling me how slow-growing that type is) I'm climbing the walls... full of questions and indecision.... So, good luck with your decision and subsequent treatment mom2Â I hope you get what your body tells you that you want. Thanks everyone else for sharing your experience...it helps. Be well.",
