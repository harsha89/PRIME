It actually sounds like I have a very similar treatment as Michelle did last year. I will be taking 6 treatments of TCH. The H part (Herceptin) I am taking for a year. I will also have radiation after chemo and then the tamox for a while. I don't have any children yet, but just recently froze some little eggs for later just in case the chemo makes me sterile. I am 29, so Kasi, I feel you when you say you were the youngest one there ( I am in all the waiting rooms). In fact, when I went and tried on wigs, my mom went with me. Everyone kept assuming she was the one with cancer. I will say, the wig trying on was a relief because I had a fear that I would look like a used car salesman with a bad toupe'. But there are some that are very natural and real looking and made me realize that I could still look like myself during this. Also, getting my port on Wednesday. My Doctor said he was going to put it under my arm. Anyone else have it in this location?  I am looking forward to hearing about how everyone is feeling and coping with the wild cards of chemo. ",

I had my port put in yesterday and my surgeon tunneled it to my chest under my arm. It is very well hidden, but extremely sore. I had to take off work today because of it. Guess I thought it wasn't going to be as big of a deal as it was. Went to chemo class today and it really hit me. Can't believe I start chemo next week.  My heart goes out to all of you losing your hair as I know that is coming soon. It makes me feel better to know that we aren't alone. Aimska- I had 8 eggs frozen and 9 embryos with my hubby made and frozen as well. Gives me peace of mind having them in the bank. Can't believe all the young ladies on here. Glad to know I am not alone, but what's that all about?!? It sounds like we have similar treatment. How have you been feeling after chemo?",
