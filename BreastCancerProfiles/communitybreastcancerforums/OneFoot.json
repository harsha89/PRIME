Behind that breast tissue are silicone implants to help me look dazzling. I say the stuff other people are thinking but in a way that is shockingly humorous to them Cons: My humour can be dark, I say the stuff other people are thinking and waiting drives me nuts Janurary 26 I found a lump in my left breast, really painful, virtually appeared overnight. My GP sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound Jan 30. US results were Birads 5, mammogram results were indeterminate Feb 4. Apparently it is a complicated, irregular shaped \u201chighly suspicious\" tumour. My GP was trying to play it cool but clearly was freaking out. Sent me for a FNA and referred me to a Surgeon. FNA - results tumour benign, 7mls cyst fluid removed Feb 9. I saw the surgeon on Feb 12 and he examined me and sent me off for an urgent MRI and added review of left axilla. My surgeon introduced me to a breast care nurse and now we're buddies. MRI Feb 14 - results Birads 5 for boob and Birads 3 for axillary nodes. He rang through an appointment for a core biopsy of breast and FNA axillary nodes. They got 6 core samples of the tumour (2x 4mm, 1x 5mm, 2x 6mm and 1x 11mm) and 1 sample each from 2 nodes inn Feb 21. Went back to the surgeon Feb 26 for results of core biopsy and FNA - no malignant cells seen. Both the surgeon and breast care nurse were a lot surprised by the results. Surgeon taking my case to specialist conference on Mar 8 and sent my samples to Oncology hospital for second review. Current happenings- saw the surgeon on Mar 12. Oncology from hospital want \u201cimmediate excision to exclude Ca as core not clear. Specimen needs to be sent fresh URGENTLY for both histopath/margin analysis and to exclude lymphoma\". So I'm now booked for pre-op marking on Mar 18 and surgery on Mar 22. Apparently, according to my breast care nurse/ surgeon, it will either be cancer or a cronic inflammatory change, go figure (shrugs shoulders). I currently have a few questions derived from my bc nurse and surgeons conversation and I did ask them but I have forgotten again. Log in to post a reply",
