However, I have experienced alot of fatigue. I had one lumpectomy on June 2nd and another on June 22nd. Both times the same fatigue. I am able to do most things in moderation. Do take it as easy as you can while your parents are there. After they are gone let the little things go (the dust bunny's can wait). Take care of yourself and best of luck!",

The second was because the margins were two small. Now the oncologist is worried because I am er/pr- but her2+. I am considering bimast just for peace of mind. I am hoping to get some input and info on this site.",

My plastic surgeon was wonderful but I chose to stop having surgeries. Those scars bother me but not my hubby. I could have chosen to have the scars \"cleaned up\" and had nipples done but didn't. It is so hurtful to me when people say things about me getting a new set, perkier, ect. I cannot understand how insensative people can be. My breasts, boobs, t*t's are gone, and no I don't want a new \"set\", I don't care if they are free, perky or bigger! What I have under my clothes are not breasts, they don't even come close to looking like breasts, and they certainly don't feel like breasts. No my scarred, flattened buns, hard to look at in the mirror chest doesn't matter to my husband. They took my breast tissue not me. He loves me <3",
