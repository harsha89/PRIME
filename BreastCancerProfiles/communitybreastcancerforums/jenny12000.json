I have lots of sick leave accumulated and really could take a leave with pay. But I decided to stay on working full time and just see how things go (my work place is very understanding). I am glad that I kept working becuase radiation really is not that bad at all and I would have been bored if I stay at home. I am finished up my fourth week today. The fatigure really came on the second week to me as well. It's not significant..just in afternoon, I feel drowsy like my eyes get heavy and I could just fall to sleep there. However, I just manage through. My appt is at 4:20pm and I left work at 4pm (which is so good to prevent me from overworking like I had always been). I finish my radiation and go to YMCA to exercise classes. It has worked out well for me. The daily exercise also keeps me active and strong. I force myself to go to bed before 10pm to make sure I got enough sleep.",
