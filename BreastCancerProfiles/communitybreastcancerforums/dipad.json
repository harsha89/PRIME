I am freaking out because the nurse called today and MO wants to do pet scan because markers came back elevated at 7.0. Has anyone else had elevated markers? She said some woman just produce high markers. Every time I try to stay positve and strong I get knocked down again. I am trying so hard to stay calm and keep my life as normal as possible. ",

The nurse suggested physical therapy in next week if not better. i am so fristrated and want the soreness to ease up before chemo begins. Anyone out there doing PT and finding it helpful?

The report basically said that one area could be fybrocystic and lets wait and see with 6 month follow-up. Other area on left breast highly suspicious of invasicve carcinoma. Doctor decided to do MRI biopspy on only that area that is highly suspicious. I recieved good news today that the new area biopsied was negative. However, I am still worried about the \" wait and see area\". The doctor's office already scheduled me for lumpectomy next week. The doctor does not want to put off the surgery for another mri biopsy. I feel that I am jumping into this too quick. I'm concerned about having a wait and see attitude on a breast that already has cancer. She suggested that when she does the lumpectomy she can biopsy that area at the same time. If it comes back positive I would have to than have additional surgery. My question- do you think it's safe to wait another 2 weeks for surgery and have additional biopsies or have the lumpectomy and move forward from there?

Why wouldn't i want to do RADS? She said because my cancer was on left breast. 5% chance of heart disease. Geez I'm not sure what is the worst of two evils. My Onc had said guidelines were changed last year to 1 or more lymph nodes involved. Any advice?",
