Brown on Saturday.  Can't remember the brand now, green box?  LuvRVing, it was whatever you used?? Eyebrows are powder, always have been, they have always been so light you can't see them.  Which I guess is good since they have always been rather thick up until recently.   ",

Hoping your dog just senses that you don't feel good!  I know my one dog did not leave my side at all during the first few days when I felt crappy, he's still my little shadow. ",

Hope this helps. Let me know if you need anything! Love ya. She stressed that proper blood flow is most important, hope this helps a bit. ",
