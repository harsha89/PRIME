    "Content": "Apr 27, 2014 01:47AM - edited Apr 27, 2014 01:55AM by suzanneleempoels I was diagnosed with her2 +++ positive, ER/PR negative bc in march 2012. Lumpectomy, no lump nodes affected but 19 lymph nodes were removed after false positive testing.Â  3 x taxotere, 3 x FEC and 17 x Hereptin (until the end of may 2013) and radiation therapy. August 2013: local recurrence and 1 lung meta (2 cm). 17 x carbotaxol in combination with herceptin (every 3 weeks). Clear scan after chemo, lobectomy (end March 2014) and mastecomy (begin April 2014). Lab results show complete respons to chemo and total remission. Oncologists are still discussing further treatment but tend to stop herceptin after 15 rounds to avoid overtreatment (pertuzumab is not available yet in Belgium).",
