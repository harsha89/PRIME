NOTHING I MEAN NOTHING WAS EVER MENTIONED ABOUT MY LEFT BREAST. Three weeks ago I found a lump on the back of my neck, and I had neck pain for a long time., went to PCP and he ordered a ultrasound of my neck, I mentioned to him I have been having some pain occasionaly in my LEFT breast, so he said we will do a ultrasound of your LEFT breast also. Here are my results: Corresponding to findings on mammogram dated 1/2015( I have my reports from then and absolutely nothing was every mentioned about my LEFT breast.) It goes on to read: There is a hypoechoic nodule measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm in the 11/12 oclock position of the LEFT breast. There is internal debris. The margins are slightly lobulated. This findings are suspicious and ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended. MAMMOGRAM Code: Four suspicious findings., ultrasound guided biopsy of the nodule in the left breast recommended. I am very upset., why was nothing said before and wait does this meant. Log in to post a reply",
