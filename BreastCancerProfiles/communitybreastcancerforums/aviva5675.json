I wasnt aware that as the te fills the openings move around so they have to look every time to find them. Generally the only pain Ive felt was the needle prick (on left side). The filling doesnt hurt- just takes a few minutes to empty the cannon sized syringe. Only after my final fill did I have back and neck pain, that now seems to have resolved after about 2 weeks.",

Have paper cups or I used a light weight rubbery commuter mug for awhile. Have your helper help you up from bed-- put their arm behind your back and shoulders and lift you up, then you can swing legs over and get out of bed. Fill your pain prescription beforehand. Youll want it when you get home. Ask about any arm excercises you can start doing and when. Ask nurse how to strip your drains. Take colace or miralax stuff even a few days prior-- all the pain meds will make you really constipated. Read the threads about getting ready for surgery. Have button front shirts to wear for first few weeks. If you cannot shower til drains are out, have a plan for washing up- maybe get a type of wipe or butt washer cloth thing to be able to wash with. Your helper will probably have to help you at least for a few days. Ask the dr or- I ended up putting some gauze pads taped over where the drain tubes exited my body. Dabbed a bit of neosporin there also. Felt more comfortable even psychologically, having that area covered and not against my shirt. Also pinned it (around the tube), a few inches down from there to my shirt, and then put the bulbs in the drain belt pockets...so they were dragging least possible.",

I guess (mine was Aug 23), big button down shirts to wear for awhile, drain belt for the drains, or something so you can pin them up so they dont drag or get caught. Have your helper person the first few days help lift you up out of bed or chair by placing hands on back and pushing/lifting, will make getting up much easier. Put things youll need on the counters - you wont be able to lift your arms much or pull. Couldnt open the fridge, reach up to the micro, even lift a coffee mug-- so having things counter height helped. Paper or light weight rubber mugs for coffee/tea...Some surgeons let you shower and some dont til drains are out. Just a heads up- you might be sponge bathing for awhile! And my favorite: in the hospital day 2 my hair was so icky, I jokingly asked the nurse if there was something they could do, she said sure thing! and got this thing-- its basically a shower cap, she put it on, massaged my head a few minutes, took off and voila! my hair was clean and nice. Its somehow contained in the cap. Brilliant. So if you are in a few days or for at home ( I think even Walgreens has them) and want clean hair, try it.",

I read at least once where the surgeon took one side and nurse the other and did both at once. The first one I was yapping away and didnt even realize it had been removed! I had to be less than 30cc draining for at least 24 hours before he would remove. No showering at all till both were out ( 2 1/2 weeks for me). I did not have a catheter. It was never mentioned. I did pee a few times in pre op, but theyre pushing fluids during that time as well. I tolerated anasthesia second time better than first, and am trying to get that 2d anas. dr for my exchange surgery in Jan. I was surprised about the lifting- I definitely couldnt lift a mug- first many days I used paper cups and a light rubber travel mug for hot. Couldnt cut/chop. Couldnt raise arms to my micro, let alone pull open the door. Couldnt open the fridge first few days. Pan of soup- well, you can probably put the pan on, can probably put the soup in- how will you get can open? Id say opener is out and so is pull top. Then trying to pour pot out, might be tough. Definitely try to have someone or a rotation of someones at least the first few days. Have them help you get up especially out of bed by lifting/raising you from your back. I slept in bed at night, during day rested on a couch, could push myself up better with legs from there. But all those things get easier after about a week, some faster than others, and Im sure we each recover at different rates.",

Put it on my head, massaged for a few minutes-took it off, my hair was wet and clean. Brilliant!!! Have a small pillow or sweatshirty thing to hold to your chest on ride home. To cushion the shoulder seat belt. or, I rode in the back, with lap belt. Have things on counter at home- you wont be able to reach up. Have bottles open, etc, or hopefully a helper for a few days to reach and do things for you. You wont be able to lift even a coffee mug, let alone a full one, for a bit. Have paper cups or I used a light weight rubbery commuter mug for awhile. Have your helper help you up from bed-- put their arm behind your back and shoulders and lift you up, then you can swing legs over and get out of bed. Fill your pain prescription beforehand. Youll want it when you get home. Ask about any arm excercises you can start doing and when. Ask nurse how to strip your drains. Take colace or miralax stuff even a few days prior-- all the pain meds will make you really constipated. Read the threads about getting ready for surgery. Have button front shirts to wear for first few weeks. If you cannot shower til drains are out, have a plan for washing up- maybe get a type of wipe or butt washer cloth thing to be able to wash with. Your helper will probably have to help you at least for a few days. Ask the dr or- I ended up putting some gauze pads taped over where the drain tubes exited my body. Dabbed a bit of neosporin there also. Felt more comfortable even psychologically, having that area covered and not against my shirt. Also pinned it (around the tube), a few inches down from there to my shirt, and then put the bulbs in the drain belt pockets...so they were dragging least possible.",

I knew it'd be pcp getting the results, they told me that at the test. Bu for all he knew I couldve been driving, at work, etc. I thought he could have at least asked if I wanted to come in, asked if I was with someone etc...Its not THAT big a deal, but afterwards I was a little upset at how I got the result.

She said no they dont do further blood work or testing as a baseline other than the dexa scan. She did have me start 500mg of calcium x2 a day tho. Said its good for all women anyway. So things are good. I go back in 3 months and see the actual MO . I guess they switch off. Nothing to do but be watchful for abnormalities in skin, bone pain, persistent cough or abdominal pain. Things that could signal recurrence. So all in all, went well!",

Only when I sleep on my right side do I have a bit of small pain. Amazing the difference in recovery from this vs the bmx. Night and day. Saw the ps office this week for 2d visit. We agree that both sides, especially left will need lipo to remove fat and even up, and to make them less wide.  The np I saw feels that once thats done Ill feel better about the projection, which I think is larger than I wanted, tho it does look fine. They look fine but are still larger than Id hoped. So I go back 2/13 and hopefully will get a date or time frame for the (first) revision work...But they are even, not weird looking, just really wide right now and a bit too projected (for me).",

I read alot on these threads, consulted Whippetmom, and then talked to ps. The concept of an anatomical shape sounded more right to me than a round- as I was picturing Barbie hamburger buns in rounds...but I think if the sizing is right and after a drop and fluff, the rounds can be right for some people too..its an individual thing. Right now with extra fat to be removed you cannot tell the anatomical shape so for me they arent necessarily doing me any good. Like I said, Im going to talk to him more and then decide.

I was nervous about the wire guided thing too- but it was easier putting it in than I expected.  Probably the worst part was the little needle stick when they numbed it up!  I didnt feel anything after that, and it was pretty fast. Yes it was weird looking at the little wire sticking out but they wrapped it up (huge!) right away and put the gown back up, and I never felt a thing after that. The surgery was good too, recovery room took awhile.  Took the vicodin that night and motrins after that for maybe 2 days, twice a day and no pain pills since.  No drains, yeah!  Went back after two days to PS office and he  unwrapped me and there they were. A week after and I feel good.  I have to say read up on the boards there are good suggestions for post surgery. One thing I did , ok two , is got front closing shirts to wear, and used an old soft tshirt of hubbies underneath, to pad the scar. But not sure you will be having that if its lumpectomy only. Good luck! Hope results are good for you and this will be behind you!!  I had less good news and more surgery now coming Friday (dmx with reconstruction)...Im in your shoes now- scared and wondering how that one will go.",

I had found a belt online, actually thru that TLC wig/scarf/supply place that worked great and ended up being easy- velcros around the waist and came with 4 little velcro on pouches to put the drains. I dont have LE and want to keep it that way. My BS said my chances are minimal but still. My PT is more for range of motion. My right side, 6 nodes taken, has less mobility than left side (2 nodes). I did agree to participate in a process improvement project thru my hospital- to identify and treat potential arm side effects following breast surgery. So this will give the PT with emphasis on LE avoidance, and follows me for a year.  So helps me and helps my wonderful hospital. (Good Sheperd, Barrington, IL). My BS has said pt even before the surgery so Im glad its working out this way. I think the arm port goes above the elbow on inside of arm? I only heard about it online here at these threads, then did a bit of other looking around on Dr. Google. Will advise what MO says after Thurs appt. Anyone looking at knit caps? Im looking ahead (even tho totally hoping no chemo)- figure Id just wear those knit caps 'like the kids wear'... anyone found soft unfancy ones?",

In the hospital ask if they have the hair washing shower cap- its genius! she warms it- puts it on like a shower cap, rubs your head for a few minutes, and voila your hair is clean.

Other side tho was painful for 10 seconds. Then they had to redo right side, 2 more shots! Was at nuc med for 1 1/2 hrs.  Got back and it was time for surgery. Coming out of anasthes was better this time than before. Got up to room around 8pm, thank goodness for morphine button~ By the time nurses were done, tried to eat some soup, was midnight. Tried to sleep. Up all night but dozing at same time, odd feeling. Up and to bathroom about 6am. Was surprised I could do that~ So the day went well...walked a bit, sat up. Tried to eat. Second day better- tried to stay off morphine, went on Norco. Like I said , got home 230- napped. It was a long night last night- trying to find right position in bed-- it took about 3 times of rearranging all the pillows but finally got it ok. Norco every 4 hours. great hubby set his phone alarm and kept waking me up.  At hospital the breast care center gave this big bag of stuff including a zip up cami-  the ps took off the compression wrap at hospital said I dont need it if I dont want...went with the cami- but the seams were painful.  Ended up putting some gauze pads over the seams and unzipping it most of the way. The drain tubes are pinned to it, but its not compressing the surgery area. Was a bit surpised he was fine with nothing comprssing, but he was just 'be normal' with things... Drains are fine.  A bit painful on my sides, but easy to wear ( I have 2), and not draining much. Hopefully at least one out when I see him tomorrow.

She did find minor cording in one area and helped me with that. By the 3d visit that was gone. She did talk specifically about getting sleeves if I am going to fly. I said maybe next fall- so she recommends waiting til about a month or two before, as weight gain/loss of up to 10 lb would make a sleeve I get now inappropriate. Its the one thing she seemed to be very specific about. Also mentioned avoiding very/overly heavy lifting (think 40 lb bags of dirt in the garden). Otherwise the visits were for range of motion, which she measured my abilities each time, and did massage, gave me excercises to do and showed my scar massage.

Yesterday was more tiring that I expected- more moving/stretching arms so by the end of the 4 hours my chest was sore. Took Tylenol when I got home, took it at work today about half way thru, and I feel a little better today.  The doors there are all solid, I never noticed how heavy they all are!

So it is possible. Talk more to your BS.

Make sure they give lots of nice medication to numb you.  I developed a bit of hematoma after , took few weeks to resolve but was ok.  Long story short, found a dcis. Went few weeks later for a lumpectomy, lift, with matching lift on other side. Wasnt terrible.  I was glad I did that because (and this is me- not what will happen to you!), found smaller invasives on both sides. One that the biopsy needle had just missed. Went back 10 days later for double mastectomy (bmx) with tissue expanders (te) for reconstruction. I too was freaked out, knew not what to ask, ets. Found this site and it helped tremendously. Stick to real sites like this or Mayo etc for info, to get real facts, not freaked out people screaming.  Your data can come back clear! But if not you are not on the journey alone. Many have walked before you and can help.  Lots of threads here full of good info. and be sure to read the actual fact articles on bc.org, full of info about each part of the disease and treatments.  Good luck!",

I ended up bmx 10 days later. for that they did a snb, and I got the dye shots. That hurt a bit but only for about 10 seconds while it went in. Of the 4, 2 hurt since the other sides of my breast were numb from the previous surgery. So not fun, but couldve been worse. Was on norco and tylenol by day 3 and only took the norco at night few nights after that, only Tylenol in day. Im lucky and my te are ok, Im almost 4 weeks out and really no pain, have been gently side sleeping, and drove about 45 minutes today with minimal problem. Agreed also: keep things low. Get paper/light plastic cups for hot drinks, dont try to lift mugs. My microwave is high and couldnt reach it for a week. Couldnt open the back door. Get baby type wipes to help you wash. Hubby washed my hair in sink for 2 weeks. Have lots of various types of pillows to nest/prop you in bed or chair- I use one under each arm still, and you will be back sleeping for awhile, so find a way to get comfortable. I used one under my knees also for awhile, I stopped but might go back. They did that in hospital and it was comfortable and helped me like a wedge to lay back on the upright pillows.",

We do all have different reactions, so this is me.  The pain the first 24 hours after surgery was bad, yippee for morphine drip! After that I went to norco, used the morphine a bit that 2d night. Then norco only, 2 more days, if that, used only at night, tylenol during the day.  It was very difficult using/moving arms for awhile. Have things on the counter, paper hot cups- you wont want to try lifting a mug. Obviously if there is someone to help you at home, thats best. I back slept for a good 3 weeks before even trying to go to the side a little. A pillow between the te helps. Now I clutch a pillow, but can sleep on my side. I got 100cc during my surgery. Pillows all around are your best friend. I dont really feel my te. That will probably change as I get more fills, but for now in general I dont think much about them.",

The tingly stuff is better, but not gone (7 weeks today from surgery). Ref chemo: you can see my diagnosis below. I had oncotype test and my result was a crazy low 2. So no chemo.
