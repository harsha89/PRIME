Be prepared for chemo.  At your age and HER2+ you will almost be guaranteed a spot in the chemo chair.  It's hard but it just means you have more big guns to fight with.  Take a big breath and buckle in for a long ride.  It's been almost 16 months since my diagnosis and I just finished with herceptin last week.  Don't stress about that too much though...One step at a time. If you have any questions about breast surgery/reconstruction, please PM me.  I will help any way I can. Congratulations on your baby.  Don't forget to enjoy him and love him.  Give that baby an extra tight hug tonight before bed.  Breast cancer can't take away the special experience of being a mom.  Keep living.  Best wishes. Christean ",

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2011 09:46PM - edited Sep 7, 2011 09:51PM by Christean cgmartn12 - So sorry this has happened to you.  It is a scary time.  We have all been there.  This is a fabulous place for advice & support. Be strong.  You CAN do this.  I think half the battle is a positive attitude and a cheery outlook. Before you make your decision, I would get a consult with a plastic surgeon.  If you are even considering reconstruction you will need to evaluate your options before you even make a decision lumpectomy vs. mastectomy. As a PS nurse and a BC survivor who has also had to make these decisions for myself, I can tell you that radiation is a big factor when it comes to reconstruction.  You will probably not know before surgery if you will need radiation or not.  The need for radiation is usually dependant on 3 things:  1)  final tumor size 2) clear margins and 3) lymph node status.  All of these are unknown until your final pathology comes back.   If you do need radiation, you will need to do some research in order to make a knowlegeable decision.  Do not make a decision based on emotions or fear. Your options for reconstruction are typically either with a expander/implant or with a flap procedure.  Both types have pros and cons.  But, if you have radiation prior to reconstruction- you will most likely not have the option of expander/implant due to high risk of complications.  Your only option would be a flap procedure. If you do chose a mastectomy, one option is an immediate reconstruction with tissue expander placement which is done during the same surgery as your mastectomy.  Your PS and BS will work together.  It eliminates one surgery if you go this route, but you have to decide before you have the mastectomy. I have alot of experience with reconstruction and will try to offer any advice or answer any questions you have that might be helpful. Finally, remember this is a decision only you can make.  It is a very personal decision and there isn't one right or wrong answer.  Make the right answer for you and trust yourself and your doctors...and then get the ball rolling towards being a breast cancer survivor and moving forward.  It really helps to have a plan in place for surgery, MO visits, beginning of chemo etc.  Don't let anyone pressure you into one surgery vs. the other.  It has been my experience that BS and even MO steer towards lumpectomy.  But, remember...ultimately the choice is yours...and whatever path you choose will be the right one for you. Let me know if I can help you in any way. ",

Make sure you know the plan and that you are comfortable and feel safe with it.",

The alterative to putting the drain back in is opening the incision to allow for the fluid to come out.  This involoves packing the area with gauze and then allowing it to heal from the inside out.  It's a long process and really sucks.  I'd pick having the drain put back in if I had a choice.",
