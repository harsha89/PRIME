    "Content": "BRK wrote: Hi, I am a swedish designer and I have set myself the goal to design the perfect mastectomy bra. I have done some research to see what is already out there, so I have an idea of what is wrong and right with most existing bras, but through this forum I would like to reach out to you, the strong women who actually use these bras and ask you for your experiences with them. What makes a bra work for you, or maybe more important what are your problems with them? All your insights are very much appreciated and will help me to ultimately design that perfect bra. Many thanks!Â  Log in to post a reply",
