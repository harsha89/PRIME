It was a very bad week, with more bad health news. The irony is she had a abscess on the breast that was most likely malignant. She was a dear girl. May the both rest in peace. Tish",

This is apples to oranges as my grandmother was 80 ( me; diagnosed age 50) when she was diagnosed with BC. She had a mastectomy and took the then new drug Tamoxifen. She was found to have bone mets at age 85. A church lady friend \"jokingly' said at least you know what you will die from....Grandma died at age 93 officially from Parkinson's disease. She also was the oldest member at the local fitness club attending water aerobics classes 2 to 3 times a week till age 90... She never dwelt on the past but lived life to the fullest. She is my mentor.",

I use them for hiking and camping before chemo and added to my collection during chemo, but mostly went commando. I have not done much hiking the last few years so they were forgotten. A dear friend has started chemo and I am going to get her a Buff!! I have made an \"alter\" of cancer cures and well wishes on my desk at work. I may have to get a larger desk! All the well meaning diets, faith healer information, books, pamphlets, tokens and trinkets are nicely arranged. I even have the proverbial bus ( as you could get hit by a bus tomorrow...). Some I keep, others I have passed on or shared. It works for me. People look at it as a library of information others as reminder that there is always hope. I look at it daily and ask for strength and dignity to coupe with this adventure beyond a cure. Tish",
