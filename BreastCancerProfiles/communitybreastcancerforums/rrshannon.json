We told our older two after a positive surgical biopsy that didn't have clear margins. Which was 1 week before the Sentinel Node Biopsy. Fast forward to last month and I had to tell them the horrible news that I had a new cancer. Now 17, 26 and 28 I wanted to tell them all together with my husband. Their work schedules and the fact that my husband works out state did not make that possible. I had to tell my husband over the phone but then proceeded to visit each older child on the same day to break the news and ended the day with my 17 year old daughter and having to tell her. Though it was hard for me to give the news multiple times it was nice to be able to spend time with each child and answer his or her different questions. Since they each process news differently. Good Luck with your treatment, wishing you complete healing.",

I feel a lot of time for me at least it is easier to go through the treatment than walk along side a loved one going through treatment. Which unfortunately I have had to do. For my first time when my kids were younger, the new their great grandmother had recently passed from cancer a few years before. Since I was stage 1 and not stage 4 I told my kids that I was going to easily beat this and not to fear I was going to die from my cancer as did their great grandmother. Maybe this was for my affirmation :)",
