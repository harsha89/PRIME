Do fibroadenoma usually stay the same or can they grow? I am just worried they could\u2019ve grown. I\u2019m 36 so know I\u2019m at the age to get them. They have not mentioned biopsy due to BiRads 3 but will they need to be removed if grew? Is it a one day surgery? Sorry for all the questions. I\u2019m hoping they have shrunk since my October appt. Thanks everyone! God blesd Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "SaintsDoll9 wrote: I received my ultrasound report and I have three solid masses. They all have oval in description and circumcised. The radiologist marked them as benign and score of 3 on bi-rads. I am supposed to go back in six months for ultrasound again. Right - a cyst and a solid of 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm Left - I have two solid of 3.6 x .1 x 2.9 cm and 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.7 cm I'm just alarmed by having more than one possible fibroadenoma. Can you get several? Is there anything I can do to shrink it or manage it? I'm trying hard to wait six months if possible since they look benign and I'm 36 with no history .
