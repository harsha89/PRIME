I finished chemo on October 12th, and happy to be done with that phase! I'm nervous about the long term effects of radiation, but my Breast Dr. and MO both recommend it, so I will do what they say is best. I'm reading through all the posts to see what I can learn from others who have gone before me... I'm really more anxious about radiation than I was about chemo, go figure.",
