    "Content": "mhk531 wrote: In 2/2013 I had her2neu cancer removed from the left. Was located in chest wall. High cell proliferation rate. Estrogen positive, progesterone positive. Lost 3 neg nodes, but had lost a few others from a disastrous episode with polyurethane implants after a subcutaneous double mastectomy in 1990 due to fibrocystic breast disease that turned into blood poisoning after a gyn put me on ERT. After the cancer surgery, I developed a seroma the size of a junior basketball. That was drained 3 times before I could start radiation. Had 7 weeks of radiation on this left. I have a heart condition and they were careful to guard exposure to my heart. I have developed a chronic wet cough that has been worked up in every possible way: neg for lung cancer, had gastro endoscopy, etc., never smoked a day in my life. Seasonal allergies medicated. Radiation complication: I'm five years out and I have developed a double fist sized mound of unmovable scar tissue. It is in the left half of my left breast. It feels like it's goung to explode from pressure. A surgeon here in ATL, 3 years ago did some fat transfer revision work across the top of my chest. I'm condidering getting her to remove this even if I lose the entire breast. I also have lymphedema with cording. My dear husband learned lymphatic masssge and gives me 30 min masssges about five nights a week. This blob throbs like an abcessed tooth. I can't take asprin products of any kind...stomach ulcer. I don't want him to spend the next 20 years having to do this masssge routine, although he's never complained. I am not a good candidate for latissimous flap because I have scoliosis. Oddly enough I also had a 14.5 hr abdominal free flap in 1993, and I've developed an unrelenting right back ache that needs cortisone shots for relief. My back is carrying the load my abdomen used to carry. My back is already ruined. QUESTIONs: Does anybody know if I can expect this scar tissue blob to re-grow? IS THERE ANYTHING ONE CAN DO TO PREVENT THIS RUN AWAY SCAR TISSUE FROM FORMING IN THE FIRST PLACE Once a person has cording removed, what happens to the lymph fluid? Thanks for any advice.
