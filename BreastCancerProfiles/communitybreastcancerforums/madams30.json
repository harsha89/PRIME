A Pet scan and MRI showed no cancer present anywhere else in her body. Her breast tumor was large about 9cm and there was lymph node involvement. She had 16 weeks of AC and Taxol. She had a mastectomy in February with 15-20 lymph nodes removed. The doctors told her that no signs of cancer where found in the breast tissue or lymph nodes removed and she was cancer free. She was just finishing up her last week of radiation when she started having this severe pain in her right side. She immediately had a CT scan and they found changes to the liver. A biopsy confirmed that the BC had mets to liver. The strange twist though is that the cancer in her breast was ER/PR+ and HER2- but when it mets to the liver it is now ER/PR- and HER2+. I'm going to defiantly ask the doctor about the pain with shrinkage.",

She's on a 12 week course of Navelbine/Herceptin. Cancer is ER/PR-, HER2+. Doctor said they would get an indication whether the treatment is working based on pain level. She's still in a lot of pain after 4 treatments another one scheduled today. Is that normal should we be seeing results by now? Should we ask for a scan? I guess I was hoping for quicker result. I know I'm probably being totally unrealistic. It just breaks my hear to see her in pain. Any information or advise would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

Three weeks ago she was in her last week of radiation and started having right side pain. After a CAT scan and liver biopsy they found the breast cancer had Mets to Liver. She has a 4cm lesion and two smaller one less than 1cm and one lymph node that looks like it may be involved. However now the cancer in her liver is ER/PR- and HER2+. Is this good or bad? We are getting mixed reaction from the oncologist who admits she's never seen this happen.  Log in to post a reply",
