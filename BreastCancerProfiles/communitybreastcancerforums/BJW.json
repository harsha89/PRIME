Posssible, but not definite disk pathology L-5 to S-1. 8-17-06 lumbar spine MRI Impression: Single 1 cm fibrotic or densely calcified subcortail lesion superior endplate L-2. Radiographic differential includes: Old Schmorl's node, previous treated metastatic disease, as well as a sclerotic meatastatic lesion. Recommend correlation with plain films and/or a limited noncontrast CT through this area to begin differentiation between these entities. If CT in non contributory, recommend a bone scan with SPECT imaging focusing on the lumbar spine region as well as the rest of the skeleton to rule out metastatic disease. No further tests or scans until the 6/21/07 bone scan showing all the hot spots and the 7/3/07 xrays showing �ill defined 2.1 x 3.4 x lesion at the acetabulum correlated by previous bone scan highly worrisome for metastasic disease. I had a meeting with him in October of 2006 where he told me the MRI confirmed the degenerative disease seen on the previous xray. Does that MRI mention degerative disease anywhere? I went on my happy way for almost a year until I, yes I suggested doing another bone scan as I was still having pain and we did the scan on 6/21/2007 which led me here. Where was the recommended CT? Why wasn't another bone scan not ordered in August, even tho one had been done 2 months earlier- why wasn't more testing done in 3 months-5 months to see what those area were doing? I am meeting with him tomorrow-I had trusted him, had confidence in him and now this? I am beside myself. This is the second time in this journey my doc has failed me-failed me miserably with serious ramifications. How do we trust them? I can't sleep-tis 3 am here.How do I move forward with him-I was going to get the game plan from seattle and have this place administer it-like weekly herceptin there instead of traveling into seatlle...there are 3 oncs at this place-2 down...if I confront him he will likely dump me, like I did something wrong. screaming inside, jill Log in to post a reply",
