Here is the link to my first post on the \"waiting for results\" board. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/62/topics... I don't know yet the ER,PR, HERP-2, or ki67 status. I have a Grade 2 tumor/s and they are intraducular carcinoma, infiltrative. I was told I am maybe a Stage lll (maybe 2). I will start chemo next week and I won't get my mastectomy until I am done with chemo because the tumor is so large and lymph nodes are involved. I will be getting a breast MRI next week to get a better look at the tumor/s to establish grade and also a PET/CT scan next week to see if it has spread. -Michelle  ",

Within the last week I had been trying to get off my antidepressant too, but have decided against it. I have taken meds since I was 18, I am 34 now. Unfortunately even tiny doses of an antidepressants give me insomnia now. I haven't slept good in over a year since I stopped drinking and got off Klonopin. That why'd I have been wanting so bad to get off of it. I have tried every sleeping pill and natural supplement and nothing works",
