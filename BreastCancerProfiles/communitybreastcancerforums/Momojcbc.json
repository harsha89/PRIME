I had a strong feeling I needed a Pet scan after MRI showed cancer was throughout my breast. I had to switch drs to get that ordered. My scan showed multiple node active under my chest muscle and next to my airway under my breast bone, as well a tiny spot on my Lung. The Doc said she is more worried about the Lymph node then my lung so I am getting another biopsy next week.I was told I would be stage 4 if those nodes are positive as it is considered distant spread. Has anyone else had spread in lymph nodes other than arm pit and not to other organs? What was your treatment//experience?",
