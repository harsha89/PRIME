Terry, and Bonnie one more treatment, girlfriends, you and I are DONE next week YAHOOOOOO....We need to party, lol. Bonnie, hope your fever is better today and Terry, hope you are feeling better too...dont' want to delay getting that last treatment...I've been so afraid of the same thing, but luckily I haven't come down with anything bad enough to do that. Kathleen, I get the Nuelasta and it's about $2000. I get the whole bone pain thing too, thank goodness for pain killers. Debbie K, lol. Your grandson sounds wonderful. Isn't it great being a grandma? My oldest granddaughter asked me the other day if I will have hair for Christmas, lol. I think she thought that's what I should ask Santa for, lol. Debbie M, good luck with the radiation. I can't have it as I have Lupus, so that kind of bothers me, I think I would rather have it and have that extra assurance...but oh well. Cyndi, I'm so jealous you have hair and EVEN jealous you shaved your legs, lol....thought I'd never make that statement. The kids are home this weekend, so I'll get to spend the weekend with my granddaughters...which is a wonderful way to spend the weekend. Then my last Taxol on Monday, Neulasta on Tuesday, Oh, yeah, forgot, Procrit on Monday too, I'm still anemic. I'm so ready to have this done, but am getting really worried about the port coming out, especially since they are doing it in the doc's office. Also, are any of you ladies wondering just HOW we get on with life? I didn't work before cancer, due to Lupus, and now I'm wondering....NOW WHAT? What do I do with all of this that I've been through? Do I just go on day to day without doing anything? What comes next? I want to help others, but I'm in a little tiny town, so there might not be much chance of that. Anybody have any thoughts on this? Blessings to all of you and I keep you all continually in my prayers. Gracie",

Debbie K...I haven't told you this yet, but I SO admire the fact that you have kept working and traveling. I don't think I could have done it. You are ONE strong woman. Terry, am so glad you are done too :) Hang tight, you will feel better in no time. Bonnie...LOVED the pics...glad you rang that bell long and loud. I got a baloon :) Kathleen, I hope everything turns out all right and that it's just your period trying to start again. Denise, that Ativan is a lifesaver sometimes. I have worried though that I was leaning on it too much during treatment and now that treatment is over, I worry that I wont' be able to sleep without it. Time will tell I guess. Next Wednesday I have my bone scan, then pet scan the monday after that, then doc's appointment that Wednesday 10/10, to get the results. I have to admit, I'm getting more and more nervous as I get closer. I hope and pray that there's nothing. Then, port out on 10/15..and that's going to be done in the doc's office and I'm scared about that....I wonder if there will ever be a time when i won't be scared? I'm starting to think not. I'm still trying to decide what my future holds. You know, I've heard so much about women going through all of this and it changing their lives. Yes, it's changed my life...but I have NO idea what to do with it. I wasn't working before the cancer, due to the lupus, so I doubt I'll work after, although it would be good to have something to do....so what do I do? I have no idea. NO answer to that question. Hope this finds everyone well and safe. You girls have helped keep me going through these awful weeks of chemo, even though I've not posted as much as some. Just knowing you all werer here and going through the same thing and I could come and ask questions, and read and have others who were sympathetic has meant the world to me. I can't express how much all of you ladies mean to me. Blessings and love to each and every one of you, Gracie",

I hope your blood counts on teh Coumadin start doing what they are supposed to :) Shrink, for some reason, number three and four were easier for me on Taxol I hope yours are too. You are almost done :) Kathleen, is this your first trip to Italy? I was there about 30 years ago...my daughter was born in Vicenza, we were in the service. Loved Rome, I hope you have a great trip and you love it too. Debbie K...how are you doing? Hope everything is going well. When do you start radiation? Linda, since I'm post meno pausal, they are putting me on either arimidex or femera. There's a blood test you can do that shows how much your one ovary might be working.

I got really depressed, and it seemed the more I read about others, the worse I felt. So, I took some time off, and just about got my head on straight again. THEN, I found a lump. It's on the mastectomy side, right above the scar line. My surgeon looked at it this week. She's stumped. It's very clearly there, you can feel it easily, but the sonogram (or whatever it's called, can't think right now), just shows normal tissue. She wants to look at it in about a month to see if there are any changes. She said, it may need to come out to be tested. Also on the OTHER side, right under my breast, under the rib cage, I've been having alot of pain. It started in December, hurt for a few days, then went away. Then came back. Hurt a little off and on occasionally, then it was hurt a little every day, and now it hurts daily and I'm taking pain killers, which aren't killing the pain completley, but aleviate it a bit. SO, I see my onc on April 22 and see what's up with that. Sorry I've been gone so long. So much has happened to so many. I've kept you all in my prayers. And missed you all as well, but my state of mind just wasnt' in a good place. Gracie",

My son in law has been transferred to a town about 15 minutes from us, and they haven'tfound a place to live yet, and their other house is on the market, so for the meantime, they are here. Then my mom had a really bad fall last week, blood sugar bottomed out, she's all banged up, so I spent days last week at her house. I've also had a little scare, will find out more on it on the 17th, I have an appointment with my surgeon then. I have found a lump under my arm on the mastectomy side. I don't know if it has been there, and I'm just finding it, or if it's something that's just come on slowly. It's pretty good size, can't feel it if my arm is in any but one position. I'm hoping it's just scar tissue, and not a node. My last pet scan and everything came back clean, but I know that's no insurance policy either. So, life is crazy right now. I'm so sorry for those of us who are having continuining problems with this beast...it's just not fair. But I am keeping you all in my prayers.

I hear it's really yucky :( Will be praying for a good outcome for you too. Started really reading and investigating about nutrition. Am starting a whole foods diet, plus trying to cut down substantially on my sugar intake. It was absolutely ridiculous how much sugar I was taking in. After chemo, I was like a kid in a candy store, you know, the whole, \"dang it, I survived chemo, I need to eat\"....but then I realized a few weeks ago, I was eating sugar all day long. Sugar in my coffee, sugary cereal, muffins for snack, tons of chocolate, every day, white bread, potato chips, corn chips....so I've decided that's coming to an end. If I'm going to beat this thing, I've got to get serious about my diet. I hope it's not too late and the cancer hasn't spread. Anyway, going for now, thanks to you ALL on the board, you are so inspiring. Blessings, Gracie",

I've hated it for years, too small, not enough storage space, need new appliances. But it looks like I'm going to have to live with it, Tom had a heart attack about 8 weeks ago, and he's going to take his retirement, which means we will be on a fixed income. He will still work part time, he's taking early retirement at 55, so hopefully he can find something part time to keep us in the black instead of in the red. I'm going to lose his good insurance, but have medicare because of my lupus. So, now I've got to find a secondary, and get something to help pay for my drugs. He'll still have his coverage and drug coverage, but they won't continue to cover me, as I have Medicare. Sigh. Anyway, let us know today how things go today, will be keeping you in my prayers.

Garnet Ann, I hope your next treatment is easier. I had almost no nausea on Taxol at all, so that was a real plus to me. I'm just so glad I'm done. Now if my bone scan and PET scan come back clean, I'll be a happy camper. I have my PET scan tomorrow, bone scan was last Wednesday, of course they wouldnt' tell me anything, so I have to wait until Wednesday of this coming week to see the onc....hoping and praying they are clean. I've had to cover my head at night too, Terry..it gets so cold and then I get cold all over. Then I cover up..then I get too hot...then I uncover...etc...e.tc...etc...it's a never ending battle...I would have thought the hot flashes would have stopped too, two weeks after the last taxol, but mine haven't yet. Have yours? And I have NO hair yet coming in...waiting, waiting....lol. Keeping you all in our prayers continuously, Gracie",

Don't know yet if the insurance is going to pay for it. But with one daughter and two granddaughters, if the insurance doesnt' pay for it, it will still be worth every penny, and I'll pay for it gladly. Terry, I hope you get your port out soon. You will feel so much more normal without it, NOW, if I could only grow hair, lol. Will be praying for you and your tumor markers, that they are perfectly normal :) I wish your sore would heal up...will have to do some EXTRA praying for that :) Debbie M....how frustrating for you :( Can I come and tell somebody off in your onc's office for you? ;) Truly though, I hate that you had to wait, but am praying for good results in the meantime. Bonnie, let us knowk when your port is coming out. The blood clot issue is specifically why I'm doing arimidex. I have a tendency for clots. I really waffled for a long time on the brca test....did I want to know, or not? It was a hard decision, but it really came down to my daughter. I just had to have that information for her. Now that I know, I'm really glad I did it. Good luck with your decision on that. Trish, thanks so much for coming in. It's invaluable to know that others have gone before us, that others have survived, made it through , gotten hair back (lol, that's a BIGGIE), and are leading somewhat normal lives. Congrats on being a survivor. To everyone I've missed, know that you are all in my prayers. Love you all, Gracie",

My blood calcium levels have been high, now I was taking Tums for my stomach so it might be that i just had too much calcium, but it can also indicate bone mets, so my onc is doing a bone scan before I get my port out to make sure. My tumor markers are also up, he says that happens alot on Taxol and it could be nothing, but he's also doing a pet scan to make sure, so if you all pray, please say a little one for me :) I'll let you all know as soon as I know anything.

It scares me that some women might not get the treatment they need because of one study. Cyndi, I actually didn't know they had pulled the catheter out of my neck until after it was done. Never felt it at all, no tug, no pull, no nothing. The only thing I really felt was the first shot, due to the kind of medicine they use to deaden it, it stung...after that, I felt very little. I am blessed to have a wonderful surgeon, who absolutely knows what she is doing. I think that helps :) GARNET ANN!!!!! TIME to do the HAPPY dance, girlfriend :) Congrats on being done. Give yourself a few weeks now, get plenty of rest and let your body recoup. I'm so happy to hear you are done. And you made it through, you are one tough woman. Fists up :) KATHLEEN!!!!! HAPPY DANCE time for you too, girlfriend :) You are DONE :) We all need to get together after everyone is done and have one heck of a party ;) Yeah, we lived over there for about a year and a half. I hope you have a WONDERFUL trip and you have to take alot of pics and bring back for us to see ;) I loved it over there. wish I could go back someday. Maybe I will :) Terry, I guess I didn't realize until you posted that you still had that open hole :( Have they given you any indication on how long it will take to heal up? Hopefully since you are done with chemo, your white count will continue to regulate and it will be easier for your body to heal. Debbie, I can't do rads, due to Lupus. I kind of wish I could, it's another assurance, or would be for me. I had a little bit of a scare this week with lymphedema. Swelling under my arm, but it's gone down, both the surgeon and the onc's PA said they weren't concerned. It was a very small area, and they both think I overdid with the painting. So we are just watching it for now. But I can understand your concern about lymphedema...sigh...one more thing for us to live with :( I found out this week, I'm brca negative YEA!!!!! It lessens my worry about my daughter and her daughters. Also, I start arimidex on Monday...am hoping for the best...we hear such horror stories about it, I'm starting to wonder if ANYONE takes it and makes it all through the five years :( Dawn, I'm still struggling with whether or not to do reconstruction. It scares me. But now that I have the brca test back, I'm not sure my ins will pay for taking the other breast off, so I would have to do like you have. Blessings to you all, love you girls :) Gracie",

Bonnie, it sounds like you were really down :( This last treatement kicked my butt. I was MUCH more tired and am finding it much harder to get to a point where I feel human again. But thank goodness it's over. You and I and Terry are the only three I think at this point who are finished. I had a neulasta shot too, after this last treatement and got another procrit shot yesterday because I'm still anemic. They said they will continue the procrit for a few more weeks to make sure it is going up. I have my bone scan tomorrow and am very nervous about it still. You know, this is what happened to my dad, he had a very aggressive cancer, did chemo only to find it hadn't even slowed, but had progressed substantially during treatment. Now I KNOW I'm not my dad, but darn it , I just cannot get that out of my mind. I'm truly wondering if I should try to find a counselor who deals with cancer patients. What do you all think about it? I still have that tingling in toes and hands...they graded it at a 1, so it's very low, but still it bothers me. Terry do you know what yours was graded? Kathleen, I'm SO glad to hear (I agree with terry isn't it funny to be glad ot hear you have a UTI?) that it was just an infection and not something else. IT had to be a huge weight off of your shoulders. Take really good care of yourself now and let your body heal up a little. GarnetAnn...you are just ALMOST finished aren't you? Woohoo :) Will do a little happy dance for you on your final treatment :) Linda, I feel like you too,like I should do something, but I live in a small town and I just dont' know what there is I can do. I'm hoping something will come to me as I start to feel a little more human. If you come up with any ideas, I would love to hear what you are thinking about :) Debbie, I'm so jealous that you have your pool open :) And enjoy that watermelon and tell us how good it was ;) Teach, hang in here with us. And even though you are drinking what is required, keep doing it, your body needs the water so much right now. I know you must be very tired, as I was too, although I wasn't on the same regimen as yours. But you are almost to that light at the end of the tunnel. My node that was found was like yours, not just little cells, but actually a tumor IN teh node itself. My onc was very concerned, and I think that's why he's been so proactive with everything. You are almost done, Teach. And there are many here to provide wonderful support and advice. You are a fighter :) Cyndi, it's great to see you :) You didn't say how you are doing ? Let us know. :) I know I\"ve missed a whole lot of you, but you are in my prayers daily. Blessings to everybody :) Gracie",

I took some painkillers last night after the local finally wore off. Back to tylenol today, and it's not bad at all, just sore. I have to go into the onc's office tomorrow and have the PA look at my arm and the swelling. She wants to actually see it before she decides anything. They might want to do an ultrasound of the area. So I'll let you know tomorrow. I won't have rads, becuase I have Lupus, so the chemo was the only option I had.

I'm glad you have made your own decision and you have EVERY right to do so, based on the research you have done and what you and your onc decide. I know many women who have forgone chemo altogether, for the same reasons. But dont' come onto a site and tell women who are going through Taxol that it's not going to work.

I have a few questions if you don't mind? Ok, I have cancer in my left hip and left femur. So right now the onc said he thinks I'm probably stable but is doing a PET scan in two months to confirm that. My concern is this, that hip hurts like the dickens. If I really want it to stop, I use Lortab. Otherwise, I can live with it, but it just hurts constantly. Am I going to hurt that hip by walking on it all the time? I've got to lose some weight and since I've never really been athletic in any way, walking seems like a good fit. Can I break that hip bone by just walking, even walking while it hurts? I told the onc when I went in last week that he was just really hurting and he never said a word about it. I think he's looking at the bone scan and not concerned? Any suggestions would be really helpful and greatly appreciated.",

The problem with my appetite is I can't have most of what I crave due to so many food allergies, so I get bored with food... But I'm eating at least twice a day, and trying to snack on good stuff like fruit and nuts and seeds. Not saying I don't cheat, Lord knows I do, but am really working at it. Doc will check my thyroid next time I have blood work up due to being cold so much all of the time. If that comes back ok, I've just got to blame it on the femera.

Decided to wear my fit bit yesterday when I went to get my shot and did some shopping in Wichita afterwards, no more than I normally do but I got over 6000 steps !!! Woo hoo !!! The day before or maybe two days before I wore my fit bit all day and just around the house cleaning I had over 4000 ! Today so far I've got 3600 and the day isn't over! So I'm thinking I might not be quite as sedentary as I always have thought I was! I didn't have any idea that I got that many steps during the day just keeping house and doing laundry and taking care of the dog ! I'm going to really push to try to get 6 to 7000 daily!!! I hate to miss this but I don't even know what kettle balls are , but I'm sure that they are something really heavy! I am still dealing with my heart rate and trying to figure it out, if I do much around the house like someone else said laundry it's spikes right up to 115 in no time at all but then it goes right back down to 60 like within a minute! I am hoping that with the walking that I do it will help strengthen my heart and maybe more heart rates will become a little bit more normal, Is that an unreasonable objective",

Also since I've never been into this whole fitness thing, I'm wondering if you get up at early in the morning to go for a walk do you eat breakfast before you walk or do you eat breakfast after you walk. And if you eat breakfast after your walk do you take something before you walk to give you a little extra energy boost while out moving please let me know because I'm trying to do all of this right. Good to hear that everybody goes out and moving ! Z you continue to inspire me to move! I swear girl you've got the stamina and energy that all of us would love to have, between you and Illimae,",

So when I\u2019m here by myself looking at my life, it\u2019s hard to see why I should be trying so hard. I had a really good friend snub me this week. I had gone to the school to pick up my grandchildren and noticed her picking up her niece and I said hi and she said oh hi like she didn\u2019t even know who I was! And then walked away. My girlfriends, Who I\u2019ve hung around with since grade school have quit asking me to lunch and coffee and get together\u2019s. It just sucks. Put that on top of being in this house 24 seven alone and it makes for a horrible mix. This week I\u2019ve started having a lot of pain in my left upper neck and down into my shoulder, , To the point that I can\u2019t move my head without getting a shot of pain. I\u2019ve resorted to Norco which I absolutely hate because it makes me feel like I\u2019m not breathing. And I can\u2019t take the Norco and the lorazepam together. So everything came together this week and was just a bad storm. I\u2019m still here and still alive, but wondering what my next move is going to be. I see my oncologist on Tuesday and I\u2019ll talk to him about this pain. But my future is just not looking Rosie at all and I knew it was going to be hard trying to fight this all alone. I just don\u2019t know that I knew how hard. Thanks again for all of your thoughts and kindness . They do mean a lot. This pain in my neck has me buffaloed right now... of course my mind goes to the Inrabce must not be working, which just terrifies me. Thanks to everybody and big hugs",

September should be cooling down a little too and I love Colorado. It's such a beautiful place! I start Abraxane on Monday and then port placement on Friday. Am concerned over the port placement. Trying to rmemeber from last time. I remember I couldn't sleep on the bed for over a week, just couldn't find a comfortable position, and then (ok this is a little funny), I'm so danged short, that the only recliner I have left is Tom's big one, and honestly, sometimes I struggle when I'm in good shape to be able to reach over the arm of the chair and hit that danged lever to put the footstool down! I'm thiking good grief, what if I can't get out of the chair???? I am going to look into a lift chair I think since I'm here by myself, but am not familiar with them. Anyone have any advice on a chair, brand name or anything? And anyone have any advice on getting through the weekend after port placement alone?     ",

      "Content": "Feb 2, 2009 04:57PM GracieM2007 wrote: Hi ladies.  Am reading a little back to see how you all are doing.  I was diagnosed almost two years ago, and went through all of the chemo, etc. that you all are going through right now.  The thing that helped me alot was talking to women who had already been through it all.  And I also was part of a group on this site, and we talked constantly during treatment, to compare notes, and boy was that a Godsend.  Anyway, wanted to stop by and let you know that others have done what you are doing, and many of us are doing well right now. My cancer was found in April, 2007.  I originally had what they thought was ovarian cancer, so had a complete hysterectomy in February 2007, to find out it wasn't ovarian cancer.  I was so relieved.  Then in April they found breast cancer.  Kind of a double whammy.  Mine was 1.7 cm, IDC, Stage 2, Grade 3, 1 node positive, er/pr+, her2-, BRCA negative.  I did four DD rounds of AC, every two weeks, then four DD rounds of Taxol, every two weeks.  I couldn't do rads, as I have lupus.  So I went on Arimidex after chemo.  I got the nausea drug that starts with an A (can't remember the name right off hand), with my chemo every time.  I also took Emend, and supplemented with Zofran and Compazine during the two weeks.  I used Ativan regularly, not only for nerves, but it also helped with the nausea, and I had Reglan if I needed it.  I couldn't use Decadron, had a really bad reaction to it, so during Taxol, they used Benedril.  I had shots of Neulasta during the AC, and then during Taxol, they added shops of Aranesp. My nausea was handled pretty well, although I did end up at the emergency room after the third AC, for IV fluids.  It was the only time I ended up in the hospital though through the whole thing.  I used the hand lotion Cetaphil constantly (someone was talking about red spots on skin, this helped me out), and used the Biotene toothpast and mouthwash for mouth sores, and kept mine to a minimum.  We were kind of manic about washing and keeping things clean, but I think it helped me alot.  As you start Taxol, or those of you already on it, or Taxotere, you might find the skin on your hands and feet peeling very badly.  I got some \"Bag Balm\" from my drug store.  It's what they use on cows when they get bad spots from milking.  It smells awful, but did miracles for my skin. I was very anemic during all of my treatment and all of my counts got very low.  I was confined to the home during alot of the treatment due to my counts, but it went a whole lot faster than I thought it would. Eating was a problem always, so I ate as bland as I could.  I usually was ok the day of treatment and the day after, it was always the third, fourth, fifth and sixth days that were bad for me, and then I started digging out of the hole.  By the time I was ready for another treament, I usually started feeling kind of human again.  It's depressing time after time, but I'm very glad I did it. All in all, chemo is doable.  Not fun, at all, but doable. I also had neuropathy.  They started me on a study using Vitamin E.  It really worked for me, and the neuropathy not only didn't get worse, but it actually got a little better.  I have no residual neuropathy at all. My heart did very well throughout treament and it is still good to this day. In April I will be two years out.  I did what I felt was necessary for me, doing chemo and all.  Hope things go well for all of you.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask, or PM me. Blessings to you, Gracie ",

If it turns into a bacterial infection then they would probably delay and put me on antibiotics. So ask your doc if there's some way they can tell beforehand if it's bacterial or viral.

Leapfrog, you are in such a difficult situation! I can only tell you this...after being forced to live alone five years ago, due to the death of my husband, I have finally gotten to the place where I like my time alone. I wish there were no illness going along with it, but there is. Take your time and if you need to grieve that which is gone, by all means allow yourself to do that. Just remember to go talk to a professional if you need help. My dear Mother (whom I loved to a fault) would always ask me one question when I was facing any difficulty. \u201cCan you change itt?\u201d If you can\u2019t then you have to find a way to live with it. That question stays with me now. I can\u2019t change any of this. But I\u2019m finding ways to live with it",

Micmel, I have been trying to think about what to say to you about your DH. I know when I went through cancer the first time and Tom was alive it was really hard on him. He was a lot like your husband, he was absolutely my rock, but like your husband also he had his moments. He didn\u2019t talk about it much, but I know that afterwards after things had calmed down, he told me there were moments when he was feeling very scared. It\u2019s hard knowing that the person that you rely on for almost everything is going through the same thing you\u2019re going through. Will be saying many prayers for you and your husband, as you go through this walk together. I know how much you love him, and I know he must love you just as much, or you wouldn\u2019t be so happy with him. Big hugs sending you much love! Mae, irs good to see you! Bigbhome, i\u2019ll be thinking about you and about your husband, I can\u2019t imagine trying to take care of yourself and someone else while going through this. Tom has been gone five years, and I\u2019m walking this road alone, however if I were in your shoes, and Tom needed me, I would take the back burner, and he would come first. Such a huge sign of your love for him. I wish you only the best in the next few months as you take some time off, and will be keeping you in my prayers. Lynne(man), I\u2019m doing a little better taking one day at a time. Not ever the happy person I used to be, and I find it hard to recognize any joy in my life anymore. But I know it must be there somewhere, or I wouldn\u2019t be fighting. Thank you for your concern sending you big hugs!! So I had my visit with my oncologist yesterday and got the results of all of my blood work up. All of my accounts are way down, and my tumor markers continue to rise. Because of the extreme pain I\u2019ve been having in my neck for the last week he\u2019s going to do an MRI in a couple weeks. He\u2019s concerned because things should be getting better and instead they\u2019re getting worse. I\u2019m hoping and praying it\u2019s just flare , and doesn\u2019t mean the Ibrance is failing me.  ",

MJH, thank you, and sending you hugs back! Keetmom, thinking of you also and keeping you in my prayers! Grannax, I agree we are much stronger than we think. I took care of my Mom, (primary caregiver) for about 18 months before Tom's last year also. The night before she passed, Tom had his second large heart attack, so I had to make the decision, stay with my Mom, or go out of town to be with Tom. I went to Tom of course, but that decision haunted me. My Mom had ovarian cancer. The next day, my Mom passed away, and I was back in time to be at her bedside when she went. Then we had the year with Tom being so sick, his Dad died too, and a week after Tom's funeral I was in the doctors with my only brother finding out he had stage four cancer, and had to have extensive surgery as it was in his jawbone. So I cared for him for a solid two years. I never had time to grieve anyone. So I fell apart finally, and then picked myself up and went on. To this day, I believe all the stress was part of the reason my cancer reoccurred. I look back now and am not at all sure how I did it. But I did. I feel for anyone who has to be a primary caregiver. It is hard, has to be even harder when you, yourself are fighting cancer. I can't even begin to imagine. By the way, your grandson, is a little doll! Congratulations to him!!! BigB, am thinking of you and praying for you daily. Hope your party turns out well :) Marguiritaville!!!!! Thanks, Lynne, I am SO read for baseball season, although KU just beat Duke yesterday in Basketball, so focus right now is on the final four!!! Go KU!!! Thanks so much Tanya, for your kind words!!! I celebrated my son's 39th birthday this weekend with his family and extended family. It was a good time, and good to see my grandkids. I was the only family member he had there. It's weird, he grew up with a huge gigantic extended family and we have all kind of scattered just in the last five years. Sad really. I miss my big family so much! ",

I\u2019ve developed a large lump on the front of my right ribs, mastectomy side. It\u2019s big enough to be seen. I\u2019ve had a few conversations with both of my kids and they are both going to accept whatever decision I make. My son is getting family leave paperwork filled out so he can be available more often to go to Wichita with me. I\u2019ve got two girlfriends who have said they would help with rides and am having lunch with two others on Friday that have both offered to help. My onc said no palliative care but my son said today he\u2019s going to insist that they get me some kind of help. I think having a complete meltdown made them look at this situation differently (the kids). I think they both thought that mom is just doing great, because I don\u2019t really talk to them much about it, because I didn\u2019t want to put any added pressure on them. So we\u2019ll see what the scans show and then make some decisions. I know that if I went off of chemo that I\u2019m looking at a horrible time and probably just a lot of pain and all that. I kind of have an idea what\u2019s coming at me, having cared for my mother who had ovarian cancer that spread all over her abdomen. It\u2019s not a pretty thing or a fun thing to think about, but if it comes to that I\u2019m going to insist that they give me heavy duty drugs. If I have to, I\u2019ll go to M.D. Anderson in Houston to get a second opinion. Anyway just wanted to come in and say thank you to every single one of you that answered in anyway, it may not seem like much to you but just having other people give me their thoughts helps me clarify my own. I love you girls, you are just the best!!!",

I lost my father-in-law and my mother and my beloved husband all in one years time, and in fact the day before my mother died as I was sitting by her bedside I got the news that my husband had had his second massive heart attack , so I had to decide whether to leave my mother or go be with my husband and I left of course and went to be with my husband who ended up living a little while longer my mother died the next day and luckily I was able to get back home and be there with her, but then my husband passed at a later date,and a week after his funeral I had to go with my brother to an oncologist to find out that he had stage four head and neck cancer. So then I was his caregiver for two years. It was the hardest time I've ever gone through. And that first year after my husband died I can tell you that I just was in a complete fog. There's so much time that I don't even remember things I did that I have no memory of what so ever. I am sorry for your friend because she's going through something very similar. But through it all I always knew that my friends were there for me and would come if they could. And I think that she knows that too about you. Just remember that you still have lots of time to spend with her. And believe me the worst of times it is about 10 days after the funeral when everyone goes home. She will need you more then than any other time. Blessings to you.",

I\u2019m cleaning out my office/craft room. Everything is coming out into the living room and am sorting, thrown by away and reorganizing everything, including the bookcase and my desk!!! I do this every three or four years just to par down and although it\u2019s going to wear me out, I\u2019ll feel so much better to have everything sorted. I\u2019m becoming much more of a minimalist as I get older. It might take me a few days but am determined!!",

But to be truthful,many kids her age are horrible. I know you love her to a fault, and sometimes that gets you hurt. I\u2019m sorry you are going through all of this heartache and sorrow.

Always makes me wonder what our world is coming to when I see things like that on the news. Very Very sad! Will be saying prayers for her and her family and of course you and your family also. It sounds like your kids found a place to live and I'm hoping and praying that it relieves some of the stress from your life, so you can carry on with the job of healing! Gosh you need some peace and quiet to heal! Keetmom, am glad you are feeling better and on some meds to help with that seizure. My RO mentioned that this week when i saw him and it does scare the heck out of me! Will talk with my MO next week about the odds of that happening. Grannax, it is so awesome that your granchildren have access to the arts!!! Congratulations to the part in the musical, the costume was darling! And your pirate kids were so cute! Such a fun thing for the family to do together! Micmel and Katy, I can tell you that I lost Tom going on six years now. I've never been on a date since he died, nor do I have any iinclination to do so. He was the greatest love of my life and there will never be another. I\"m sure your husbands are going to feel likewise should they be in that situation. I think your hsbands both love you very very much and they will greive greatly when you are gone someday. Claudia, I hope that Xeloda does a great job for you, I've heard of women on it for years! Here's hoping that's you! MJH, I love your flowers! Mine are suffering a bit right now, I've neglected them this last week and a half, just too much going on right now. And the BIKE!!!! I want that bike, lol! Tanya, it sounds like you are having wonderful travels this summer. Morrocco!!!! Have always wanted to go there, the history is just awe inspiring!!!! My progression is in my brain and liver. Sucks, but it is what it is! Minnie, glad to hear your hip is stable! I hope it holds for you for a long time! Lynne (Man), your mini- car trip looks and sounds like so much fun! My cousin has one and I love to see her whizzing around town, lol! I would love to have a little Fiat! Mae, I am totally feeling that \"this is the last one\" thing too. Last baseball game...last visit from the granddaughters, last chance to pay off all bills and be completely debt free...time is slipping away from me quickly and I hate it! Thanks, Lynne, for posting about my progression over here, I really do appreciate you doing so. And thank you so much for everyone who replied to my post about leaving. I wasn't in a good place at all, I knew there was something going on in my head and in my liver, just wasnt' sure what it was. So I was already emotional. As I said, I knew none of it was done on purpose, it was just that evleryone had so much going on all at once, my stuff was kind of back burner. I know I've done that with posts too at times. So didn't really want alot of drama, but just wanted you all to know where I was coming from. So progression. I have a lesion in my brain. It's right frontal about 2.5 x 1.2 cm. They are doing cyber knife on it, and I'm already getting everything set up for that. Not at all happy about it, but I know I can't change it. RO said aout 80% chance they can zap it, but there's liquid under it, so it may have seeded already. Liver is very small, so I'll start Abraxane weekly to tlry to zap that one too. Femera and Faslodex completely failed me, so they did a big biopsy of a new lesion on my right hip to get more information, and I hope to check for anything it may have morphed into. Hope you all have a great weekend. God Bless you all!  Gracie",

My dad and his uncle were best friends growing up and all through high school and after school. So I knew his family and his extended family and he knew my family. He and my big brother were friends. They used to throw rocks at me when I was little. I was that obnoxious little sister or kid sister who idolized my big brother, and wanted to do everything he did. Needless to say my brother and Tom didn't want me around. We both grew up and went separate ways. He moved away from our hometown when he was a young teenager. I married a hometown boy and had kids. Tom never married. After I was divorced a friend of mine was joking one night and said ,\" you should date Tom .\" To which I answered, that would be kind of like dating your cousin. But that friend ended up inviting us both to go camping. When we got to the campgrounds I asked my friend and his wife, where in his tent he wanted me to put my sleeping bag. He said, \" oh you're sleeping in Tom's tent\". Boy oh boy was I nervous. But I figured what the heck I've known him my whole life and he's never been interested in me so I should be OK. That night when everyone went to bed I got into my sleeping bag and zipped it all the way up to my neck and said\" thanks Tom for letting me bunk in your tent tonight. I've had a lot of fun.\" Then I rolled over and went to sleep. Now at this point in my life I was 29, divorced and raising two kids by myself. Tom was 32 and had never been married. He told me later in our life that that night made him fall in love with me. He thought it was really cute that I was so standoffish. We started dating the next week. We were married six months later until five years ago when I lost Tom to multiple health problems. He was the love of my life and will always be. And I was the love of his life, and was until his death. That's the end of my love story. We had that happy ending, until death we did part. Now I hope and pray that Heaven is real, and that someday Our Love story will continue in a different realm.",

Living by myself and being by myself about 99% of the time I\u2019m really concerned about lightheadedness and falling or just passing out and nausea and the exhaustion it takes everything I have right now to keep my house cleaned up and yardwork halfway done because I never get it all done and I am at it from sun up to the time I go to bed trying to keep things in order around this house I cannot imagine being out of commission a week or more every month. When I went through chemo before Tom was alive, and he was such great help. He helped around the house and he was here if I had a panic attack or if I got short of breath or if I didn\u2019t feel good I got nauseated. He cooked for me when I was sick to my stomach. I truly have no idea how I\u2019m going to get through this by myself!!!",

I have a liver biopsy next Wednesday to see if the beast has changed, then back to something. I'm pushing for Xeloda, onc really wants Halaven... We'll see! Am really nervous about the biopsy, but my onc said he wanted a big biopsy for foundation testing, which we tried to do in September, but they didn't have enough! Don't come in much, but follow along reading! I need a lot more time and hate that this progression has been so massive! ",
