      "Content": "Sep 5, 2010 04:24PM - edited Sep 5, 2010 04:26PM by Jenlm You guys are awesome! I can't believe I haven't been back here, yet! Life is just crazy right now! Bill got home from the hospital, and he is doing well. What crazy times, though! I don't know what to worry about! There is plenty, lately! I posted the original post when I was so tired I could barely see straight, and I just now have time to come back and read the responses. So exciting! Thank you! Thank you!  I am still worried, of course. :( Thing is, my lump is on the right side,  and is so sore! I can feel it really well and it is so heavy and thick feeling, there. Kind of like when you have your period, or before it, but much worse. It makes me keep thinking about it. Now there is a terrible bruise all over it and it's even more sore. I don't know what type of bra to wear to make it so I don't notice the pain and the recurring thoughts of BC all the time. When I first found it, there were little pimple like things over the top of it. Just a few, but I thought that was weird. Am I crazy for trying to notice every little thing about what is going on? I wouldn't think twice about an ingrown hair, but now that it might be something, I'm trying to add everything up! BTW, Is it normal to have extreme bruising after the biopsy? My whole right side over there is deep purple!  The radiologist called and was so, so nice. So concerned and tender, and someone from the Breast Health Coalition sent me some information. The radiologist said it is a BIRAD 4.  Anyhow... thank you for the reasurance. I am in total denial. I don't have that \"C\" word. I just don't. Couldn't happen to me, right? Isn't that what you all said? Ach. :(  I have to do a search on this site for spell check, etc. For some reason, it won't let me copy and paste, either! I'm so used to my bulletin board software. I run a bulletin board with 35k members and it's similar, but it's hard for me to have some things different!  I'm too tired to make any sense, but just wanted to thank you so much. What comfort you bring to people! What an awesome board! Jen",

I need support, too!  For some reason, I just can't talk to those close to me, yet. I just don't know what to say. I'm stifled! I was taking a shower and felt a huge and sore lump. It took a week to get into the doc, and the mammogram was very clear that it was a lump with rough edges and a shadow. Then, they went on to ultrasound and that showed that it was not liquid... not a cyst.   Sorry that I don't know all the terms that you use? I don't know what all the ratings mean, or how I find those out? They felt a biopsy was in order, so I did that yesterday. They took four pieces of me (ouch!) and accidently hit my pectoral muscle, which is now sore. They say I'll have to wait until next Wednesday or so, to get the results. Wow. That's a long time. I don't know what to do with myself in the interim! I'm so worried! On top of that, the day I found it, my partner, Bill, was all worried and at night, he began to have chest pains. We took him to ER and he had a blood clot in his lung so they kept him! Sheesh! Is enough enough, already? I have marfan syndrome and had an aortic dissection four years ago... I\"died\" a couple times in the surgery to fix it. It was a long haul, but I'm walking and doing pretty well, now.  I thought for sure, this would be how I will die, but now, cancer, too? I have a new aneurysm and they are watching that, too. Wow. I mean,I know that I may not have it. I've read that 80 percent of these are fine. That sore is a good thing... But, what if? I don't know this road, so I'm so glad to meet all of you.  God must think I am very strong or something, but I can't take this! (Yes, I can... Yes, I can...) Somehow, lately I've had the \"peace that passeth understanding\" but I'm afraid that I'm on the edge of panic! I was going to copy and paste something in here, but it won't let me? I'll hand write it out in a while. Just wanted to say hi and be a part of this family, please. You all sound so wonderful. God Bless you for the good work you do!  Thank you for listening.

I have questions about this, and I can't find it, anywhere. I was taking a hormone replacement called \"Combipatch\", the lowest dose. When I found out I had BC, I ripped it off. Now, I'm having horrid hot flashes and I'm so uncomfortable. I am so tempted to put it back on. I mean, I'm sweltering, dripping! Is there a section or thread, somewhere about stopping this kind of drug, when you have been diagnosed?  I'm sorry that I don't know how to manage this forum, but I've searched and searched. Any help would be so appreciated! Also, they said that my pathology from my biopsy was being \"digitized\" and should be available today. What does that mean, and what might I find out, today from that? Thanks so much. I sure hope someone can help me. I'm so anxious I can't sleep.  Jen",

It just aches. Is that from the biopsy or is that the lump itself? It did hurt the morning I found it, even. But, now it really bothers me. A deep, awful ache... Thank you so much for all of your support. I can't tell my Dad about it, and I didn't even want to worry my family. So, my sisters and my immediate family is all that knows, besides this great big family, here! Thanks so much. SO much. You have no clue how much! Jen",
