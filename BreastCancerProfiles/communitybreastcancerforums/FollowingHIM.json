I told him that the radiologist felt the lump but only saw dense fibroglandular tissue in the area. He (the surgeon) just commented that it was \"interesting\". The surgeon felt the lump and said that it feels like it might just be fat. Then said \"there's actually a larger area on your other breast. I'm not particularly concerned about it.\" \"Keep an eye on it for changes and have a repeat ultrasound in 6 months. On secondthought, let's make it a year.\" I asked him about possibly having a mammogram but he told me he doesn't think it would really show much since ultrasounds typically show more than mammograms. And voiced again that he's not \"particularly concerned\". I guess I should feel relieved. But I don't at all. He barely even pushed on the lump....and it's pretty deep and firm. He didn't even bother checking my lymph nodes or anything (even though I told him I've got tender spots below my armpits on both sides). I just felt like he completely dismissed me because of my age maybe?(I'm 32). I'm sitting in the parking lot literally crying. I know I should be happy and don't get me wrong.....it's not that I want something to be wrong with me......I just have such a bad feeling about all of this :( Anyway.....I wonder if I should seek a second opinion? I don't have insurance though. This was covered by a special program from the Komen foundation. I'm just really upset right now. Sorry for rambling. Log in to post a reply",
