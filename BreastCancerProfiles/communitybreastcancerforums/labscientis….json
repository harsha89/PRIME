I am in week 3 of taxol, waiting, dreading for my doomed hair to give up the ghost. It smelled weird today in the shower, its a terrible feeling, waiting ....I have a really bad feeling that I won't be as brave when it does fall out. Isn't that funny? they are shooting me full of poison every week, I had surgery and survived, but I am bummed about losing my hair? Just seems like one more violation from crummer cancer. This is a blessing to be able to vent. I know I am at the beginning of this trial still (although, 8 weeks out from surgery, so not really I guess) just seems like a long road to hoe. I am doing A/C after, so if the eyebrows or eyelashes don't fall out now, I know they will then. thanks everyone for listening.",

I shave my husband's head regularly because of his thinning hair, so he's totally sympathizing with me. I think once it happens and I am sad, then I can be ok with it.

Neither of those choices are useful for anything. I am just struck over and over how crazy this place is - being a cancer patient is like being kidnapped or hijacked. In all honesty, my friend & 16 yr survivor of triple neg IDC came up with the chemo-sabe. I thanked her for being my chemo travelng buddy she fired back with that wonderful pun. My other friend, who is 3yr bc survivor says at chemo is like going over a cliff on top of an avalanche & hoping you don't get buried in too much snow. sleep well both of you. My port incisions are sore & itchy from the waterproof bandaging to keep dry in shower. arrgh! Thank God for Aquafore.",

Dehydration is no joke, it can make you super sick, damage organs or even kill you quick if you don't stay on top of it. You are a stong, brave courageous soldier, but you gotta keep your weapons girl! This is a war of attrition, and we have to be the survivors, while the cancer cells DIE! Ok, sorry, off my soapbox.

I think cancer steals stuff from people, thats one of the stupidest, suckyest things about it. It steals our woman stuff, our energy, our healthy guts and our dignity. and then it steals people's coping skills, I think most people have no frame of reference except scary,and death and thhhhpt.

NYISSA: thanks for your experience too, My hair is due to fall out any time now (wheee, lucky me)...its good to know what to watch for. Edu: heads up about omeprazole, while it works better than ranitidine, there have been some good studies lately warning about scary heart side effects. I had reflux since I was pregnant, (lucky me, right?) and have been taking omeprazole to help it for a while. I changed to Zantac (ranitidine) cause I want my heart to be healthy, and that was a couple years ago before I ever knew I had cancer. also, I have a friend who's 3 years out of surgery, chemo & rads (IDC, and Inflamatory BC) and she recommended to me to take aloe vera juice for reflux, aka the burning insides. It doesn't add to constipation (which I have too, so special!) and seems to help. IT tastes NASTY, but only need a couple swallows to help. You can get it at Trader Joes or Whole Foods or Sprouts. Hope that it helps! Mykidsshavepaws: welcome another triple negative! Are you having surgery after chemo? We are putting up the good fight!!! My oncologist says taxol is very effective against triple negative. I am due for round 3 tomorrow. Have been feeling drained, and weird in the head since Friday, like I spent too long in the sun at the beach. Very different from the first week, but I also attended all the graduation stuff for my son's end of 6th grade, so maybe I just tired myself out.
