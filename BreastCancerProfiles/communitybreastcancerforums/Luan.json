Your intuition plus the fact that u are not feeling well at all, IBC is an emergency situation. When i showed my lump to an endo 2 weeks after that stupid family doctor, she told me that if i had to crawl to the breast center to do so. Was biopsied same day and had surgery within one week. It was an ER situation. had a lot of pain, redness. My situation was dire also, had lost my job six months prior, but our health is priority no 1. Please let us know how everythimg goes.",

All doable :) Hated with a passion the neupogen shots ! Rads only made me feel a bit claustro (never liked machines much) and a little bit tired. Was given Tamox 3 weeks post chemo. as for SEs, it seems to affect my brain, i.e. memory, cognitive functions...no nausea, as i take it with dinner, so sleeping on it. A tiny bit of depression, so before i move to an anti-dep, i,m gonna up my fish oil to 2000 mg, and of course tired. endo is sending me for a sleep study, i wish he would take care of my thyroid instead... so basic stuff most sisters experience. after having gone through the process, i realize that fear of the unknown and the apprehension were probably the worst for me. during chemo, i was well controlled with meds, so overall, not so bad. i,m trying to rest as much as possible, eat right, gotta work on the exercise aspect of things though. Don,t hesitate to pm me anytime, if u wish. It will all be over before u know it then u,ll be saying to yourself \"now, what?\" ;))",

How are you managing your fibro ?  Any tips or treatments that are working for you ?\" Never got a response.... Barb, I hear you sis ...am also compounding big money problems on top of everything else and feeling most of the time that I just cannot cut it. I feel so reassured to not be sitting all alone watching the world go by without me.  God bless",
