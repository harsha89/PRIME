Got cellulitis Apr left side of face just spent the nite in ER with an IV drip.Next bout June right side of face, hospitalized 5 days and had an IV line for another 5. Another and hopefully the last bout in Aug on forehead and scalp home with bedrest and antibiotics for 3 weeks.Monday I see a dermatologist.Seems like the drs that I have seen think it is related to my psoriasis (which is not very active, but there). I also was supposed to have a surgical biopsy this morningÂ  but the wire insertion seemed to be a problem for the radiologist so they want me to do an MRI first. This has been going on since Aug 29 when my mamm and US showed some ??? areas near the chest wall.Good luck to all. Sometimes life has a strange way of teaching us things.",
