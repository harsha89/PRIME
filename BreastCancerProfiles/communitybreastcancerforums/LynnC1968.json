I had the neulasta injector and it went off this morning and leaked so I had to take it off and now driving for an hour to get the shot. Oh well at least I'm still feeling great.",

I knew I couldn't feel it at all but thought it was wishful thinking on my part. we discussed further chemo and I am still on track for all 6 treatments due to all of the studies that have been on herceptin. so I am going with it. I am still scheduled for a lumpectomy beginning of Feb. I am hoping the best for all of you ladies as well. This treatment is pretty amazing and to think that Herceptin from what I have been told was almost Not accepted as a clinical trial. it has helped so many people!!!",

Supposedly there are 3 components to it. 2 of them are negative and 1 is positive. unfortunately the part that I am.positive is very rare and there haven't been much studies done. So I have a 10 to 40 % of getting additional breast cancer. but they can't tell me a number because they just don't have the information since it's rare. so my cancer is gone and I am scheduled for a lumpectomy the end of Jan. now the surgeon wants to discus other options I am assuming a double mastectomy which I don't want to do. just looking to see if anyone is in the same boat. I'm so frustrated everything was going so well.",

I got a weird pain in my stomach then it moved up and I couldn't breath very well it was like a weight on my chest then I turned sooo red and hot it was sooo scary. They turned it off and it all stopped. I then got a bag of benedryl and they tried again and it started again. So now they slowed to a 2 hr drip and it was fine. I'll be a nervous wreck next round. But overall the good news of my day is the tumor has already shrunk to half it's size after only 1 treatment. My dr was shocked and so was I. It felt smaller to me to but I thought it was just more wishful thinking because I want it gone. I'll be glad when this is all over. Congrats to everyone finishing up their treatments!!! And for everyone else hang in there we will be there soon!!!",
