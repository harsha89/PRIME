When first diagnosed, I had times of positive \"I can do this\" thoughts, as well as times of being terrified. The trauma to the family is deep. Make sure your daughter's school knows what is going on. I had very little energy for my kids, a deep depression,  and not much family support other than my husband, and my kids have made it through to the other side. My daughter is a freshman in college, and enjoying her first year at a challenging school. My son is at the top of his class and is going for his driving test next week.   I think I have been a role model for my kids should they ever experience a serious life setback or illness-I worked really hard at getting what I needed, put myself first, and made it through to the other side. My very best wishes for you and your family, Cat ",

Years ago, when my hs senior was 4, I had a vivid dream that I had breast cancer. I woke up crying. I wonder if the changes that led to the cancer were taking place then...strange.

Sometimes when I'm talking about growing older/retirement, etc. there's a little voice in my head that says, \"if you live that long.\"  We recently almost put our house on the market and to move to  another house, not even another town, just another house, and I had a little breakdown.
