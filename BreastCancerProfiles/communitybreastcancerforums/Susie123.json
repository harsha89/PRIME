The fear and anxiety would have eaten me up inside if I had not opted for the bmx. Our life experiences also make us who we are, and I've known alot of women who started with lumpectomies and ended up with mastectomies. I just wanted the surgical part of it over. I have not regretted my decision. We can look at facts and figures all day, but in the end we have to make the personal decision for ourselves that will let us sleep at night.

After all those years, 30 of them, diagnosed at age 49 with bc, none of those worrisome lumps turned into cancer. My cancer was cluster microcalcifications, like grains of salt, not even a lump. They were so small the radiologist didn't even see them, the software on the digital mamo machine flagged it. I too had no family history of bc, only fibrocystic breasts, for 30 years. All the call backs are a pain, and scary, but those follow ups found bc in its very early stage, that was unrelated to the fibrocystic issue, but found early because of the fibrocystic follow ups. Mastectomys are tough and they change you forever. I'm glad you are taking the summer to think about it.",

Your diagnosis line is pretty much the same as mine. The only thing that changed after my mastectomy was the size of the tumor, which was bigger than they thought initially, but still a stage 1. For an invasive breast cancer, you have the best kind to possibly have. I know that sounds strange, but as you find out more about breast cancer you will realize how important that is. It's the least aggressive (grade 1), hormone positive (because they have meds to treat that well) and you're her 2 negative, which is very good. It's perfectly normal to be extremely worried and freak out a little at any ache or pain that's not normal. It will get easier as time passes, I promise. If the anxiety gets to be to much, ask your Dr for an anxiety med, it's perfectly normal to be overwhelmed when you've just been told you have cancer. Something you never thought you would ever hear, and still can't quite believe it. (((( HUGS )))) Susie",

After you see the breast surgeon you will have more answers, but most of the info is not available until after the surgery when the main pathology report comes in. Don't be so worried about them taking lymph nodes. They don't just take them randomly anymore. It's more of a science and they take as few as possible. It's common practice to check the lymph nodes now so please don't think that means your cancer is worse than your moms was. If you need anxiety meds to help you get through, please do call your Dr. And it sounds like things turned out well for your mom, it's been 17 years. That's awesome. Hang in there, things will get easier when you have a game plan. This is probably the hardest part, when your diagnosed but have little information. With each Dr visit, test, or procedure those puzzle pieces will start clicking together and your plan to kick cancers but will become clearer.

He thought it was because I had just had exchange surgery and they would come down. We waited a month and retested, they didn't come down. We waited another month and retested, yesterday. I'm waiting on the results. If it hasn't came down this time, I will need a liver and bone scan to check for mets. I just can't wrap my mind around the possibility that I have gone from stage 1 to stage 4 in 6 months. I also am very worried that I didn't have chemo. It's a hard decision that we all have to make and never know if we've made the right one. It looks like you're still very young, and with the grade 3 cancer chemo would be effective because grade 3 cancer cells grow much faster than normal cells.",

Have the mammogram to get it checked out and then find another Dr. I have breast cancer and I had no symptoms at all. Also try and find comfort in the knowledge that most lumps are not cancer. You sound totally overwhelmed, is there anybody you can see locally for support? Maybe a counselor, support group, or a therapist? Sometimes life puts so much on our plate that it's hard to handle alone. We're here to help too. Start by getting that mamo and staying off google.

I went to a group of surgeons who only do breast cancer surgeries in the city (Atlanta) even though it was a few hours from home. I felt more comfortable having a surgeon who only dealt with breast cancer day in & day out instead of just a general surgeon. As far as timeline, after diagnosis it was almost a month before the surgery. I too am a worrier and chose the bmx. Another good thing with a bigger hospital is that the breast surgeon coordinates with the plastic surgeon who starts the reconstruction process during the same surgery as well as the sentinel node biopsy at the same time which saves having more lymph nodes removed than necessary which is important. As far as the timeline, it was over a week before the breast surgeon and the plastic surgeon could coordinate their schedules and an OR was available so if Hawaii is immediately after the breast surgeon it probably would be at least that long a wait anyway. It's a very personal decision on the small town hospital with general surgeon or the big city specialist and hospital. I have friends who chose the small town, but I know that I wouldn't have been happy with that, but I also understand wanting it out now! I felt the same and in my case the local surgeon and hospital would have been quicker, but in my opinion not better. My best to you in whatever you choose.",

I cried for 3 days when I was diagnosed, then I was mad, sad, and then just numb. I know it doesn 't seem like it now, but it will get easier. Be sure to take something that buttons down the front, not pullover, to wear home from the hospital. You won't be able to lift your arms well. Take a pillow to put under the seat belt for the ride home. Plan on having extra help with your son for a week or two. Pain meds will be your friend for a while, but each day you will feel a little better than the day before. You'll be amazed at how strong you are. We're all stronger than we know. A friend gave me a shirt with the pink ribbon and the words \"fight like a girl\", I know it's kinda corny, but that became my mindset. I wore that shirt to the hospital on surgery day. So you go in the morning and fight like a girl!  If I can help in any way please feel free to PM me.

The problem occurs when they become \"cluster calcifications\", which can be the earliest stages of breast cancer. My \"cluster calcifications\" did turn out to be early breast cancer, but I had no pain in my breast at all. I understand your level of anxiety. My diagnosis is still fairly fresh. I was told that it was BC 3 days before Christmas. At the time I thought it was the worst thing that could ever happen, especially at Christmas time. Since then I have came to see it as being a blessing. I know that sounds odd, but catching it this early makes so much difference in being able to survive BC. I know it's really hard not to worry, but the breast surgeon told me that 85% of the time calcifications turn out to be nothing. Please try to take comfort in the fact that even if you're in the 15% that is BC, it's very early stage and has a very good prognosis. I didn't need chemo and was given only a 5% chance of recurrence in the next 10 years. For that I am very grateful for the early detection. Hang in there... ((( HUGS  ))) Susie ",

They only do breast cancer patients, unlike general surgeons who do everything. It looks like you have DCIS as well as IDC, which is the same thing I had. It also looks like your cancer cells are well differentiated, which was also the same as mine. If you have to get an invasive cancer, then that is what you want. It means the cancer cells still look very similar to your regular cells, so it's a low grade cancer. Your treatment options will be determined by the size of the cancer and it's location within the breast. Stats for survival are determined by the final pathology report after your surgery. So far you sound alot like mine, I ended up with no chemo, just a pill called Arimidex for 5 years, and a survival rate of 95% . Hang in there and try not to drive yourself crazy worrying. I know it's hard and feels like it's taking forever, but what they don't do is a very good job of explaining to you how it's a step by step process. The results of one test will determine what the next step is. You will also need an oncologist. Make sure that the oncologist follows NCCN protocol. That means they're treating based on the latest research and protocol. Sending you warm hugs, this is really a hard time, but it will get better. Susie",

I always shop after Christmas sales to begin my Christmas shopping for the next year but I didn't do that, I thought my life was over. It wasn't. By spring I was back to normal. Planning for the future, feeling like I actually have a future again. You do have some tough time ahead of you, getting through the mastectomy and the reconstruction, but honestly it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. As far as if you want the reconstruction, ask your BS to see pictures of what it looks like without it. Then look at some pictures with it. That will help you decide. Talk with a PS before your mastectomy too so if you do decide on the reconstruction they can do it in the same surgery. About what  questions to ask, I recommend going to the Susan G Komen website. They have printable lists of questions to ask the Drs at every stage of the journey and they're very good. Be sure to write down the answers as the Dr gives them to you. You think you're listening and comprehending what they're saying, but you won't remember everything, it's just to overwhelming. As far as a support group, I live in a small town, we don't have one. The ladies here have become my support group. As you go through all this keep focused on the good in your diagnosis, BC is never a good thing, but with DCIS your cancer is contained. It hasn't became invasive, your prognosis is awesome. Hang in there, it does get easier. ",

By the time I had my third surgery in my 20's, the normal procedure was to have it removed with a \"local\" in the hospital instead of having anesthesia. As time progressed, the final biopsy at age 49, which showed IDC was a stereotactic. I took it as the progression of medicine, learning newer and less invasive methods to achieve the same results. But I do understand your concern. I too was worried that the last biopsy had spread the cancer, but I would have had the same worry about spreading the cancer if it had been diagnosed in 1977 with the first surgical biopsy where the lump was removed \"in tact\" as well. I think that comes from having heard so many times through my life others comments about cancer patients, \" you know they were doing so well until that Dr did _ _ and the it just spread all over. I think the truth is, we never really know how we got it, just as we never know how or if it will spread. I do think the stereotactic biopsy is the best available now. Even with my fear, I don't regret having it. I hope you will find peace with it too.",

Others want to preserve as much of the breast as possible so they opt for lumpectomies and radiation.

The biopsy and initial testing can give some insight, but they won't know for sure until after the surgery. Some folks have chemo before because the tumor is so large, they try to shrink it before hand. Your tumor is not that big so you would not have chemo before. Depending on your final path report (after surgery) you may not need chemo at all. Your initial findings show a tumor the size of a stage 1 tumor. As long as there is no lymph node or vascular involvement, and you end up hormone positive and her2 negative (that kind of info will be on your final path report after surgery) you may not need chemo at all. So much of the treatment can't be determined until that final path report is in. I know it's really hard to wait, each day seems like a lifetime, but it will get easier after the surgery is done and you have that path report. You will have a plan of action then, and feel a little more in control of the cancer instead it totally controlling your every thought right now. Hang in there and take it one day at a time. I promise, it does get easier. Susie",

My cancer was grade 1, which means the cancer cells are very similar to normal cells. In grade 1 cancers the \"bad cells\" don't grow much faster than the \"good cells\". Chemo destroys ALL cells, both cancerous and good ones,equally, it can't differentiate between a cancer cell and a normal cell. For chemo to be very effective you must have the higher grade cancer where the cells are very different from normal ones and multiply and grow at a much faster rate than your normal cells do. That way it kills the faster growing and multiplying cancer cells before it kills you. With the lower grade, both good and bad cells grow and multiply at about the same rate. Chemo wouldn't help us just because of the nature of our cancer. And it's good that our cancer is low grade. Stage 1, Grade 1 is the best you can have for an invasive cancer. Of course that's not an absolute guarantee that it will never come back. We all have to make decisions that we feel are best for us, but never truely know if we've made the right one.  Do your research, and then go with what you feel is right for you, then put it in Gods hands. It will drive you crazy if you worry about \"if\" you made the right choice. I wish you the best with your decision. Susie",
