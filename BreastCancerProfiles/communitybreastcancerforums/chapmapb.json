I had a BMX with expanders for reconstruction on 10/23 and at that time, they thought I wouldn't need radiation or chemo. There was a delay in getting my oncoscore back (27) so trying to play catch-up when they said I needed chemo. Scheduled to have my port put in on Monday 12/17 and my first A-C treatment for Friday 12/21. I'll be doing A-C every two weeks x4 then Taxol every two weeks x4.",
