      "Content": "Patti7920 wrote: Hi Everyone, I am new to this sight, I went for a second mamogram and a ultrasound, they found 2 round growths connected the size of the radiologist's little finger nail, I am so afraid. I have to go for a biopsy. The radiologist said that he would say 80% that I would be ok, but of course he is not sure. The worse part is worring, and ever since, I feel so achy all over, must be nerves. I am so afraid. The women that did the mamogram said that the growths are perfectly round and that is a good sign. She explained that most cancers she has seen are oblong and are irregular around the edges. I don't know what to beleive since the radiologist said, \"he does not know what it is\"! I heard they can tell if it is just a cyst! That must mean its bad then if I have to have a biopsy?. If someone can help me get over this fear I would be so grateful. I just need someone to talk to, and am so afraid. I am staying strong for my children, but I find myself crying in private, with no one to share my thoughts with. Log in to post a reply",
