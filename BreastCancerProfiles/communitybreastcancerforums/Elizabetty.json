    "Content": "Elizabetty wrote: Hi, within the last month I've had two mammograms and an ultrasound. The first mammogram showed an area of asymmetry in the left breast not seen before. The second mammogram \"compressed\" confirmed the area of asymmetry. Then I had my first ultrasound on both breasts. The left breast did not show any corresponding concern where the asymmetry was except a small simple cyst. Surprisingly, the right breast presented with 3 cysts (1 complex) and two well circumscribed hypoechoic nodules. The report then said they were likely fibroadenomas but I would need to get another set of bilateral mammograms and ultrasounds again in 6 months and the rating was a BIRAD 3. I did take some time to look at the research and for the most part I've read that fibroadenomas occur in younger women. In fact, many National Cancer sites say that they only occur in about 5% of women over 50. In light of the fact that I am turning 51 this month, is it reasonable for me to ask for a needle biopsy?
