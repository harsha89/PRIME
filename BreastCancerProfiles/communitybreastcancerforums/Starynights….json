It has been highlighted with blonde for years with some of my darker color mixed in. I think going darker will make it show up better while its only 1/2 inch long ! Thanks for your input ladies !",

I wore it kind of in a short curly bob. ANYWAY when it started letting go I cut it to about 1.5 inches..then decided after it really started coming out everytime I moved my head Id just buzz it down to 1/4 inch. BIG mistake...its so stubbly its driving me crazy. Dont know if this is because its kinda coarse and curly anyway. So the question is...what do I do now ??? razor it down to get it smooth or just lotion it down? HELP",
