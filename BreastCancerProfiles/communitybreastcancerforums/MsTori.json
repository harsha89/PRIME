I just started my chemo on Oct 12th. What I did was try and find a group of ladies with my same diagnosis. Wow! Are they great. I have learned so much and what a great group to have. Go over to the Starting chemo Oct 2012 board like the moderator said. Many ladies over there that can help. I pop in over there too. Look around at diff boards too. Your not alone.",
