It developed into a frozen shoulder, which is common in women in their 40s-50s, irrespective of whether they've had surgery or not. Your shoulder can freeze up for about a year, and then will unthaw. I also developed lymphedema during this time, perhaps from the lack of movement with the arm. So, net net, if you're feeling pain in the arm, be sure to keep working on range of motion, and strenghten the arm, so that even if you get lymphedema, you can try to avoid the frozen shoulder.",

I'll never forget one radiation doc telling me that if I got lymphedema, I'd have to wear a sleeve and my BC would always be public (she said it much kinder than that). My surgeon was really the one who wanted me to have the radiation, so that I wouldn't need to worry about \"hearing from breast cancer again.\" Well, they were both somewhat right. I did develop lymphedema, and I often am angry at myself for choosing radiation, since I was in the grey zone. I love cycling, and in the hottest weather, I have to wear a sleeve. It really makes me angry, I can never go for a bike ride and feel the wind on my arm. However, I can't say how I'd feel if I were on the other side, and hadn't chosen radiation. I might be worried constantly. (I know my mother would never have forgiven me.) If you go down one path, you can never know for sure what would have happened on the other path.",

He's a DIEP doc, but I have a clotting disorder, so I think he wants to be conservative.  We did not specifically talk about PMPS, but I think that's the undertext, it's been a few years out from my implant reconstruction and I'm still complaining. MLP, I still have the pain but it seems to be regressing. It used to be all over my chest and arm. Now I think it has a lot to do with the tight pec, but also the radiation. The PS thought he could loosen my scar, which runs into my arm pit. That and FG to even out the top of the implant, he thought all that would help with the pain.  I used to take vicodaine every day, now I just take it occasionally, and I stretch my arms above my head a lot.

I hate to admit this, I have fairly olive skin and I do not use a lot of sunscreen, and never on my arms under the sleeve, but I know I'm living dangerously.  I have some interesting news on this entire cycling/lymphedema issue . . . I got laid off recently and took an old friend up on his offer to come visit he and his wife in Thailand. A lot of cyclists are discovering Chiang Mai, the cycling there is fantastic--you can ride flat, hilly, mountainous, all pretty much outside your door, and there's a nice ex-pat community of cycling enthusiasts. Before I left I was seeing my therapist because I felt my arm was getting larger. She noted my other arm was up a bit, too, and asked if I'd gained weight in general. Yes--I developed rheumatoid arthritis last summer and spent 5 months off my bike, put on some weight, then put another 5 lbs on over Christmas. A blouse that fit me in September all of a sudden was too tight for my arm. But I discounted the weight gain--the other sleeve fit, so it had to be the lymphedema, right? Well, on to Thailand. I know my friend from my racing days and he vowed to get me in shape. We were riding 50 miles to start, then it got up to 80+ mile rides, and really, really steep. When I got there it was in the low 80's, towards the end of my trip, high 80's-low 90's. I wore my sleeve and tried to ignore the heat.  Guess what? I came home, and not only did all that cycling in the heat have no negative effect, I've dropped 10 lbs, and all of a sudden, my clothes fit in the sleeves and my arm looks so much smaller! I'm always self-conscious about it in the summer and try to wear light weight sweaters, but it's small enough now that I might dare short sleeves. It was kind of a \"well, duh\" moment for me. I hadn't really realized how much gaining and losing weight really affects my lymphedema.  Nordy--I did STP many years ago, but in two days. I wished I'd gone for the 1 day option. Good luck! It sounds like so much fun. If I'm ever out that way I'll look you up, it'd be fun to ride. I'm sure I wouldn't drop you at all, it sounds like you'd drop me. :)",

The problem was a neroma (cut nerve), the implant with radiated skin (which is not a good combo, but no one told me that) and a lot of scarring. I went to see a lot of docs about free flap surgery, including Dr. Serletti, down at U Penn. He's really good, perhaps you should see him. I really wanted a DIEP, but I have a clotting disorder, so no one wanted to do a true free flap on me. And I'm athletic and was dead set against doing ANYTHING that would move a muscle, such as a TRAM, which is what everyone tried to sell me. I ended up doing fat grafting with the Brava system. Google fatgraftpatients.com and you'll find a community board about it where you can see pics. It's a fairly new procedure. They lipo your own fat and inject it into your breast area to make a mound. The downside is it takes several operations--they can't transfer too much fat at a time, or it won't survive--and you have to wear a large suction cup on your chest at night for months. I was pretty aghast when I found out about the protocol and didn't think I could go through with it, but I got used to it quickly. On my first procedure, my doc put in a smaller implant with some fat, then in the second procedure, she took that implant out completely and now I'm implant free. She also covered the neuroma with fat. It's made such a huge difference. I HATED those implants. Now the pain is gone. A lot of the ladies here are big boosters for the free flaps, and I wish I could have gone that route, too. But if for some reason you don't want to do a flap, you should research the fat grafting, it's a good option.",

I could put my finger on it, it was like a little bump with a burst of pain under my arm pit. So my plastic surgeon put fat over it, twice, and the pain went away. It was a different pain than the implant pain, which was more of a burning on my chest. I don't know if there are different types, I think it's sort of a general term. Ask your doc how he's going to fix it. My pain doc said they can't cut the end off, it will only reform. Because the nerve isn't feeling the pain, the site in your brain or spine that the nerve connects to is feeling the pain. Yes, insurance paid for the Brava reconstruction. I don't know about the rash issue, you'd have to ask the right doctor. However, my doctor insists that the Brava is the best solution for radiated skin, which is what I have, because the whole idea is it brings new blood flow into the area and helps restore the skin. If you have more questions, check out fatgraftpatients.com. there's a lot of women there with a lot more knowledge than I have. There's also a list of doctors who do the procedure. If you're near NYC, you could go see Dr. Christina Ahn, she's my doc.",

I think the pain has changed over the 4+ years since mastecomy (lymph nodes removed, chemo + radiation, frozen shoulder then lymphedema developed). For a long time I was on a low dose of vicodin. Finally the pain seemed to seperate into a section under my arm, and the discomfort of the implant. At that point a pain doc was able to help me. The pain under the arm is from a cut nerve that's trying to grow together but is wonky, it feels like a little knot. He gave me first lidocaine patches, and then a cream, and that has helped. He suggested a snug wireless jog bra for the implant discomfort, and that's helped a lot, too. I'm flat and all squeezed up but much more comfortable. I hate the implant, but strangely enough, I find when I'm really active--lifting weights, doing a lot of long bike rides--I feel better. Maybe it's the summer weather or the endorphins. I freelance, so maybe when I'm stuck at a desk all day long my body just gets stiff and I feel the implant more. OR maybe time is just working its magic.",

It's crazy that so many women complain about this, and yet we're all looked at like it's some unheard of problem. I went through three or four implants trying to fix the problem, the pain always came back after a month or two. I used to feel a lot of pain sitting at my computer all day, that burning, burning on my chest, and I had to take vicodin to cope. For a few years. Sometimes now I sit there and think, wow, that's all a bad dream, the pain is really gone! I had 3 issues--a neuroma under my arm (like a cut nerve), the burning pain of the implant on my chest, and how tight my arm was when I raised it because of the implant under my pec. I chose the new fat grafting procedure--doc covered the neuroma with fat, and the process of wearing the brava suction cup has really helped the quality of my radiated skin. I was adamant that my final goal was no implant. Reconstruction is still in process, but the implant's out, range of motion is restored, and all that pain is a thing of the past. I'm really grateful I found the right doctor finally. Maybe doctors say you could take the implant out and still feel pain because radiated skin could still scar down on the chest wall if you didn't go with another type of reconstruction? Just speculating.",

I think i'ts \"all in Yoga.\" They have beginner to advanced, with written instructions, a voice that reads how to do it, and each has a video of how the pose is done. Even the beginnining poses feel much more aggressive stretches than just \"stretching.\" I can feel all the muscles in my chest wall and arms really stretching out. It also helps w/ the aches from the meds. It might be not connected at all, it might be that my pain is just dormant right now, or maybe it's finally gone away. But I'm really surprised at how much better I feel.",

I know, for me, the pain was diffuse for a long time, but then grew more specific, and I can point to the implaint and a neuroma, or cut nerve under my arm, as 2 different causes. Docs now are suggesting fat grafting along the scar and over the implant as a solution. (I found another study on the internet, go back a few pages, that suggest fat grafting as help for PMPS.) The last doc I met (who I'll probably do total FG with, taking out the implant) she said she's put fat back into my arm pit, and over the cut nerve, and that should help.",

Helped to sort of numb the skin.  I had 2 kinds of pain, too. A wonky nerve, and pain from the implant. Doc said the nerve was sort of bunched up at the end. He suggested a couple treatments, including an SSRI, but I just waited and after a couple years and it died down. The other pain was from the implant, and that's died down, too, although it was 2-3 years as well. So, net/net, I liked the patches and the cream, they might be worth looking into, but for me they weren't a total cure.",

It was heavy and stiff and I hated it and only wore it when I flew. I think he was way too cautious because I didn't really have lymphedema at the time--I'd just gone for a consult about what I should watch out for, as recommended by my surgeon. I regret not knowing about the lighter off-the-shelf sleeves, because I think I would have been more amenable to wearing one when my arm started swelling (it's my upper arm, and sort of snuck up on me). AND I learned there are different compressions, and I really don't think I needed that heavy of compression. My current PE sent me to Faulk's (or Falk's) Surgical on the UES where Maria measured me and fit me for a non-custom sleeve. It's much easier to bear. You should try them out. Be warned that the customer service is pretty poor at Falk's--I like Maria but everyone there is loud and rude and won't really acknowledge you until it's your turn ... just be warned. : )",
