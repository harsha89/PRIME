I was told by my rads nurse to buy a sports bra 2 sizes larger to wear during rads, if I even want to wear one at all.  I also bought mens \"wife beaters\" tshirts in smalls to wear around the house, cheap and not a biggie if they get stained.  Wishing you all the best as you proceed with your treatments!",
