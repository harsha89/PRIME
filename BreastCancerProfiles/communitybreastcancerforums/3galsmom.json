I now have a mass in my L breast and they are rescanning that on next Tuesday? I know that supposedly the hemangiomas are benign, but I am hoping their is no relation. I don't have much faith in medicine these days. I am 39Â and mom of 3 girls and I want to see them grow-up and have wonderful lives. I can only pray this is nothing and I guess worry when I have too? Easier said than done. Keep on your docs and be your own advocate. That is the best you can do for you.",
