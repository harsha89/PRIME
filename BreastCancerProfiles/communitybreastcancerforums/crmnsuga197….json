I will tell you one thing the doc told me, until you are diagnosed, you are not sick, so live. Sure something is amiss, but until a definite answer is given we have to get up and live. And if we get bad news, we still have to get up and live to fight. I have to remind myself sometimes because being in limbo and waiting is the worst for anxiety. Hoping for good results for us all.",

I haven't been around here for long, and I haven't been diagnosed, but I feel the strong sense of community and support within this group of people. So no matter our outcomes, we are in a good place.

Seems standard practice here in my neck of the woods. 2d and 3d screening are done at the same time, so if you've had a mammo before it will be the same. Because my lump didnt show n either I was sent to MRI. MRI was a little uncomfortable. You lay face own, drop your breasts in these little areas here they clamp them in place. No more pressure than a mammo. There is a bar, if you will, that you lay on that separates your breast, not comfy for breathing, but bearable. Arms overhead and a squeeze ball to stop at any time. It took 30 to 45 minutes. I'm claustrophobic and managed to fall sleep during mine. Dress lightly, it gets warm. Hope that helps.",
