I got my Ivory liquid unscented soap yeaterday.  I won't have to hide it because DH and I are the only ones at my house.  I was doublful when the rads techs put those marks and tabs on me but they have not come off.  I was told to just take my hand and wash where the tabs were and let the shower gently wash the soap off.  I have been using my crystal deoderant and so far I am happy with that.  My radiologist and the techs told me that they would give me cream for redness.  I plan to ask for it when I start my treatments next week.  I want to start using it to begin with.  I do have the aloe vera.  I keep thinking I really need to buy a couple of cases of everything but I remind myself this is not going to last years just a month and half.  If I have no problems I will finish Aug 19.  My prayers are with all of you, ",

I have not had too much time to dwell only myself since January.   Hubby went from peritioneal dialysis to hemo-dialysis.  He also had to have his toes amputated and a bypass done on his leg because of diabetes.  He had to have four surgeries.  Things are going well with him now.  Looks like things are healing nicely.. His doctors are proud of his progress.  Thank goodness he is able to walk with a walker.  I looking forward to him graduating to a cane.  Summer has hit here in southeast Alabama and it is hot.  Heaven only knows what June, July, and August will bring.",

It is so nice to look in the mirror and see my head with some color even though it appears to be salt and pepper looking.  Since I hate my wig I wear it only when I had too.  I go topless at home and yesterday when I went to the grocery store I just put on some makeup, earrings, and grabbed a pink basevall cap.  One sweet thing about losing my hair my DH would rub my head and call me his bald headed baby.  Now when he rubs my head he says he won't be able to call me bald too much longer. It does make me feel good to rub my hand over my head head and feel hair.  My eyebrows are even coming back.  I have enough so I can use my eyebrow pencil.  Yeah. Since I have always worn my hair real short I will probably start going topless before too long.  I start radiation next week and right now I am thinking I will just go with my hat and leave the wig at home. All of you are so strong and brave.",
