      "Content": "kgue85 wrote: I had a mammogram and ultrasound after experiencing pain and nipple discharge. Both came back with a clean bill of health. Read my final report which stated my breast are dense and an MRI was recommended and complete. Results say in right breast in the 6 o'clock position I have enhancement, mass is visible and granular. What does any of that mean? I was also given referrals for an xray (why are they looking at my bones, the nurse wouldn't say) and I will have a MR guided biopsy on the 28th. I will also have a ductoscopy in September. Worried because of my strong family history. Great aunt and grandmother died of breast cancer, my mom had a double mastectomy at 36 after finding precancerous cells, maternal aunt diagnosed 2 months ago with breast cancer. I will have my aunts gene study results in 2 weeks. Anyone able to explain the enhancement and granular terms or have experienced a ductoscopy please let me know. I am 32 years old and ready to fight if I must. I'm not afraid. I just want a definition that I can actually understand. Google searching is no help! Thanks in advance! Kim Log in to post a reply",

The American radiology website says my results won't be available until Saturday now. Had my chest xra y today. Not sure why that was ordered versus a CT or PET scan but I will have those results tomorrow",

Although this almost certainly represents mere glandular enhancement, given its focality and disparity to the remainder of both breasts, and the patient's presentation, the possibility of lobular carcinoma cannot be dismissed. No abnormalities are identified in this area, even in retrospect, on recent mammogram. RECOMMENDATION: MR-guided biopsy. MR guided biopsy is recommended. If indeed glandular, there is a reasonable chance that at the time of biopsy, this area may not be apparent, in which case the need for biopsy at that time would be obviated. ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS Category 4: Suspicious findings",

RIGHT: Precontrast images reveal a bilobed nodule in the far posterior aspect of the right breast at 9 o'clock. This demonstrates moderate enhancement, measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. There does appear to be some internal fat based on the T1-weighted sequences. This is also visualized on recent mammogram and has an appearance on both studies consistent with a benign pectoralis lymph node. Following contrast, there is an ill-defined rather large area of low level enhancement extending from the nipple far posteriorly at 6 o'clock, maximally spanning an area of 8 cm. This is best appreciated on the sagittal MIP images, and subtly on sagittal dynamic image 97/120. This demonstrates very low level kinetics with benign progressive-type enhancement, but is quite asymmetrical to the contralateral side.",

Left side of right breast is dark red and purple. Also my belly is very swollen. Is this normal?",
