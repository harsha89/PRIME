After palliative care to the breast my mom passed away suddenly (she was on an up-cycle physically so it was not expected even though we knew she would pass sooner rather than later) on June 5. She was 52 years old and it was my Dad's birthday.  May God continue to bless you all as you bring the fight to this disease. I appreciate all the support you gave to me.",
