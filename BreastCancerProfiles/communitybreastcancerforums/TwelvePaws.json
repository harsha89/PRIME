I can interpret the below report except for one line, but will provide the entire paragraph for context: I had an annual screening 3D mammo which showed an area of increasing nodularity in the lateral upper left breast. No suspicious masses or calcifications are seen. \"...demonstrates a hypoechoic solid mass at the 1 - 00 position, 3cm from the nipple which is taller than wide measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.7cm. There is an adjacent crossing vessel. There is no definate internal vascularity. There is mild tissue stiffening. No suspicious solid or cystic masses are seen in the retroareolar left breast. There are no morphologically suspicious appearing axillary lymph nodes. Impression: Category 4 - Suspicious Abnormality\" Recommends biopsy with ultrasound. Questions please - define adjacent crossing vessel; what would the normal next step be? Could an MRI be appropriate. Full disclosure, while this was found during my annual exam, I did have some scant, spontaneous slightly bloody discharge several months ago (from this breast only) which is now clear, but infrequent. There was slight clear discharge during the 3D during compression. No lump can be felt, there is no pain whatsoever. 57, no family history, NCI Lifetime 9.8%. The screening hospital wants a biopsy. I have my annual exam tomorrow with my lovely GP whose wife has had recurring breast cancer so is familiar but I would like to be able to discuss this with him with full information. A close friend also has breast cancer and I have been to all of her amazing Dr's with her and after meeting with my own GP, may make an appoint to see her surgeon for his opinion. Would you jump to a biopsy? So grateful for any opinion from those with more experience. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
