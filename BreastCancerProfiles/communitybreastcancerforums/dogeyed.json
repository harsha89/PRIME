STCC, so glad you got your surgery situation straightened out to where you will get it done sooner rather than later!  ROCKYM, that hematoma thing was quite a story!  I am relieved they were able to see you quickly and get that thing squared away. ALL, with me, I had an injury right after surgery where my drains and stitches were pulled when I was told to move from the gurney down to my bed, and I fell and pulled all my stuff.  They said it was okay, but I kept whining about it hurting and bleeding, finally an R.N. came in and pulled all my bandages off, they were blood-soaked, and she redid them, they leaked for about five straight days after I left the hospital, went thru a bunch of T-shirts and many bandage changes.  Awful!  So, reason I mention this is because where my upper inside arm rubbed against the drains, especially when it was damp, really swolled it up, as of course did the area where the drains were, and it is so uncomfortable.  I don't think I have that hematoma that ROCYM had, just irritation.  The ONLY problem I have besides the swelling in my upper arm is I WISH I had asked nurse last Tues when she took my drains out to renew my pain pills.  They always act like I have three heads when I do that, so I let them run out, and now I'm in SO much discomfort, I don't know how I can wait until Thurs when I see my surgeon again.  Then again, the pain might settle down over time.  It's just it's hard to relax with all that going on. QUESTION:  I also thought about putting some ice packs under my arm, to get the swelling down from all the injury and irritation that happened there.  It's not red, just sensitive and swollen.  I'm thinking, ROCKYM, since your ice got your swelling down, even tho it was really a hematoma, that perhaps I should try ice to reduce swelling.  I don't think it's lymphadema, size of arm is same on both sides, it's just that irritated part is swollen on both inside upper arm and where the drains were, keeps rubbing.  I put lotion and loose clothes, no help. Thanks for letting me post.  And welcome to the new girls here, it is important for all of us to share what happens, helps others who run into trouble to read how we dealt with it.  GG ",

Sooooo, since you've got some time before surgery to get it done, by golly get it done!!!  Believe me, you will have enough time after surgery to goof off and really rest, which is precisely what you should be doing.  You will feel so wonky and wierd and won't sleep right, you'll want those days there, not so much before.  I know, we all want our mini vacations when we can get them, especially before such a marathon of treatment, but since the week before surgery you'll just be resting up, a little visit to the dentist is not going to be a big deal.  But if you wind up after surgery with a hurting tooth, you'll kick yourself for not doing it sooner, especially an extraction.  I'm two weeks out from surgery (I had chemo first) and I STILL cannot \"get it together\" to go down to the dental clinic and get some teeth pulled.  It takes a while to regain your strenght from surgery, altho I took longer because I'm 60 and disabled to begin with.  But, PLEZ, get that tooth pulled NOW, before surgery.  GG",

And you tell your room's nurse you have whatever top two medical problems you have (BP etc.) AND that you would kindly appreciate them giving you pain relief every four hours, tell her that stuff right off the bat.  And if you need a nurse to come help you or need pain relief, when you call down to the main desk for your unit, ASK FOR YOUR NURSE to come forthwith to your room, instead of trying to explain to the front desk what you need, your own NURSE is who you should discuss any and all medical or medicine issues with.  That'smy advice, basedon how things went for me in hospital. Also, Nanadeb, I was SO saddened to read on your website about that darling little girl who didn't make it.  And if this is any help to you understanding what happened, we are born into a life of survival, and these bad things that happen to good people along the way is not God's doing, rather it is the Evil One's doings.  God just does what he can to make disasters a positive experience for us.  For God and Evil are in a heavenly battle, with God winning out, and the reason we have so many crimes and illnesses and unexplicable insanity going on these days on earth is because the Devil knows his time is short, so God is winning not only the heavenly battle, but the one on this good earth also.  And when we pass away, like the little girl on your website and my dog, God gives the dead the most beautiful existence imaginable, where (paraphrase) He dries all our tears, death is no longer, and love and comfort are the sole aspects of our existence. ALL, a few days ago I briefly re-read my first surgery post and I was truly out of my mind.  This past week's post-op has been a blur of a lot of soreness, changing bandages where my drain tubes had been almost pulled when I fell trying to get from the gurney down to the bed, and my sleep is all mixed up, and I cannot do one dang thing except stagger around my house counting the days for when they remove my drains.  I'm gonna tell my cancer clinic nurse to put an anticeptic salve and thick dressing on those two drainage incisions that even Godzilla couldn't take off.  I've been afraid to take a shower, I'm dizzy, so have just kept the drain places clean, alternating between damp cloth or kleenex of hydrogen peroxide and alcohol, in an effort to prevent infection.  So far my temp has hovered around 100 degrees, but my papers say 101 is the cut-off for calling to go back to hospital care, so I think I can make it this one last day until my drains come out tomorrow.  I am incredibly weak, sleepy, and on top of the surgery I've had a couple teeth that need pulling, and so they really hurt something fierce, worse than the surgery, plan to get them out sometime next week. They've needed pulling for months, but was told not to have dental work until chemo was over, and then wait until after surgery is over.  How I wish I had ignored that and gone ahead and had some teeth out long ago.  Thank heavens for pain medicines.  I take my own, plus the ones they finally called in for me, and I am of the opinion we shouldn't have to ASK for pain relief, for crying out loud.  I had a mastectomy, and chances are it's a gonna hurt, which mine sure did after my injury when I fell and pulled my drains and incision. But once those drains come out, I'm going to be a happy camper.  Those things hurt like hell and I hate them, and I'm SO tired of bandaging something so hard to see whilst putting new gauze on, which is more or less under the arm.  One more day, tho, one more day.  I'm 60 years old, so I feel all these pains more than younger women, but just in case anybody has a problem, I've tried in this post to give my advice from my experience, justin case a few of you run into the trouble I had.  Love always, sister Gail",

SARASOWISE, I have a port, it's a semi-minor operation, you're out the same day.  It is a small bump under the skin, that's where the chemo nurses put the I.V. needle in for the infusions you get.  If you have lots of infusions, it's a good idea, becuz otherwise, as LILY and WARRIOR said, the toxins can seep out of a regular vein and create burns.  I pay very little attention to it, it does not hurt, I've had it in there since February, and soon I reckon they'll take it out, I keep forgetting to ask.  Oh, and taking it out does NOT require an operation, they can do it right in the doc office. RANGERMOM, you had said you were going to get your drains out, but you didn't mention it in your last post.  If you did, I know you were relieved!  I'm glad your labs came out good, too.  I've been reading your posts, but you seem to be getting along so well, I didn't say hello until now.  Have you got radiation to do? LILY, I did laugh at what you said to the nurse about your pain!  I know you are fed up.  I've heard of people still draining I think a month+ after, but gosh the drain area is SO sore to begin with!  Do you have the original drains still sticking out, or did they remove them and decide to needle aspirate you after?  PROFBEE, you can put a small pillow under your arm, sort of lessens pressure on drains from arm.  Even after they were pulled, when I went to bed, I'd stick a big pillow under there when I laid on the other side, becuz I had some swelling in my upper arm, it's gone down a lot, but still hurts some under armpit. Many of my post-chemo and post-surgery pains have gone, but I cannot believe how wiped out I feel in general, especially at end of day.  I tried more protein, added weekly vit/min w/iron pill once a week, but walking every other day seems to help strenghten me the most.  I also feel sad sometimes, but usually that's when stuff gets to hurting, like muscle spasms in back shoulder, which I get on floor and roll out nice and easy, getting back up with unaffected arm.  Best wishes to my sisters, GG ",

I could not go out in the yard to \"exercise\" (walk to the gazebo or water bushes) until the first week was over and they took out the drains, so maybe ten days after operation I could stroll every other day.  I finally drove the car a little ways with husband another ten days after that.  When I drove across town to the hospital yesterday (almost one month after surgery), my left arm got rather tired.  But keep in mind, I had some level of pain pills to get me thru all of that.  So, when you get your other operation on Friday, you could ask for a bottle of pain pills.  They have mild ones and stronger ones.  Also, a few days after surgery, I DID do some very simple range of motion exercises in my upper body, they gave a little list to me to follow, I did them haphazardly, especially when my muscles were so locked up everywhere.  It's basically just a very mild stretch every whichaway, most of them supporting the bad arm, including pulling my shoulder blades together, which feels really good to my wrecked-up back from a long time ago.  I also feel the worst in the morning and evening, can't do a thing.  And a couple times early on after surgery, I also woke up early from the pain, had forgotten to take something before bedtime.  And every time I do a little walk, the next day I'm wiped out, so that's why I \"exercise\" only every other day, even now.  But I still do my range of motion movements on any day whenever I feel sore.

My rads are to start either end of this week or beginning of next week, they're going to call me with the date and haven't as yet.  I had five months of chemo, then surgery, and now rads.  The rads are important because of my inflammatory breast cancer in my skin, and I presume it will be equally important for the melanoma in my breast, too, as it follows same pattern of treatment as I've already been thru.  I see a melanoma expert today, don't know what she wants to do, seems like there is a drug named something like interferon that is helpful for preventing a spread of it.  Thanks for sharing, all!  Always, Gail",

ALL, for anybody else interested in dental work during rads, my cancer doc wouldn't let me do it during chemo, then he said we'd skip it for surgery, but he said I could do it during rads.  I am on antibiotics from my dentist visit, but since I'm taking pain meds for my bad back, the dental assistant suggested to the dentist that I wouldn't need pain meds.  Well, I'll tell you what! getting one or two teeth out is one thing, but getting a half-dozen out is a whole diff ballgame.  Thrice I thought I was going to faint from the pain, legs felt so weak and head was falling off, twice the first day and once the second day.  So, next time I think I'm going to experience something like a downed satellite crashing into my mouth, I will say to anyone who says I don't need pain meds, \"NO, those pain meds are for my regular health issues; I will need drugs on top of it!\" and I'll explain how I've had to double and triple up what I usually take just to make the mouth pain stop, and that means I will run short just before refill.  I did put some orajel on my sore gums, that DID indeed help.  I also swish baking soda in my mouth, also eases discomfort.  This is the third day out from dental demolition, and I've got chipmunk cheeks and STILL very sore, I cannot believe it.  You know, I've really got to have a regular doc again, there was some confusion when the free clinic moved to a new building, so I have to start all over with my records.  Sigh.  But if I had one, THEY would give me pills to cover this sort of thing, I should think.  I just wish I had called the dentist that afternoon and explained what was happening.  There is no way I could have had this done with all this discomfort either during chemo or just before or shortly after surgery, altho that was not the reason my doc felt I shouldn't have it during surgery part.  He said something about how anesthesia might affect it somehow, but I don't remember the facts.  I will say this, I'm early enough in rads (one week and three days) that my skin is not bothering me (yet), my surgery had plenty of time to heal up, I'm not doing reconstruction from the mastectomy, and my understanding is most people get rather tired from rads towards the end.  So, I apparently timed it right doing it towards the beginning.  It REALLY could not wait another second (I had had a painful molar since chemo started and a front tooth was knocked out by anesthsiologist).  Oh, and I do recall hearing about people who DID do emergency type dental work during chemo, even tho I was instructed not to.  QUESTION:  Anybody else who is further along in rads have those dog ears on either side of the incision?  What I want to know is, do they get smaller as you go along?  I'm just a week in and one seems smaller but the other the same.  Whenever I get some more money together again, probably a year or two from now, I might have a plastic surgeon smooth those puffy places out OR I'll get a tatto on it to cover the ravages of the scar.  I saw a fabulous pic of tattoed morning glories, it looked so natural, couldn't tell there was surgery at all.  Thanks for any info.  GG GG   ",

Has anyone else had a return of the shoulder pain that many of us experienced following surgery?  I mean, it yanks the whole works all around there, and I remember I went through radiation after that, and seems like some of those girls talked about shoulder pain, too, so maybe it's an old rads scar tissue that is trying to loosen up.  I KNOW I don't have cancer again becuz I sure as hell wouldn't feel it up in my shoulder muscle, for crying out loud!  And no lymphedema because arms are almost the same size, no cording.  Maybe it IS the rads people that talk about the shoulder hurting... well, most of you would have had rads, too. Anyhow, sorry I jabbered so long.  I just thought for sure my sore shoulder wouldn't have just returned for some reason.  Anybody else dealt with this from time to time?  Thanks for any tips to make it stop.  GG ",

Oh, DEBBIE, I feel for you and those drains.  My gosh, I am so annoyed someone did not explain to you how to pin your drain bulbs up.  I'm just glad you are home now.  You had a very scary go of it. SCILLA, I realized later an error I made and also read a post (THANKS HALO) regarding how far to push yourself with exercises.  I had said push however hard you want.  But I want to CHANGE my advice so as not to give folks the wrong idea.  I put stars at my original reply to you a few pages back, so in the future when women read it, they will not think you should pull so hard that you harm your muscles or incision AT ALL.  And please read HALO's advice on this page, she is a nurse.  Protect yourself, you don't want to push and pull so hard on everything that you wind up with an injury to a muscle or tugging too hard at the surgery site to where it doesn't heal well.  TIGER, I am so sad to hear about your esophogeal inflammation from medication.  Gosh, that's so unfortunate, especially when you're trying to heal from surgery! LILY, I think your description of \"hysterical\" is precisely correct about those drains.  I went a little mad, too, not realizing it was the awful pain there that made everything hard to deal with.  Pain meds helped, so I cannot imagine having drains without those drugs.  Of course, I pulled mine accidentaly on the same day of surgery, someone should have moved me to my bed and instead I was told to do it alone, which made my post surgery all the worse. EEMA, oh I felt pain pop up all over the place at diff times for two weeks, but I am SO much better, and I guess after what I would describe as major surgery, we ain't gonna be able to play soccer the day after!  You may have a muscle spasm, could be when they pulled the drains, your body was so relieved, you finally felt where a muscle had been \"holding in\" for you, and it's now easing up and doing a spasm.  I cannot get over your PCP.  You CAN go ahead and do her job and set up your own stuff, and THEY can get a referral from your PCP.  Or your own breast surgeon or oncologist can do these things for you since your PCP is so out to lunch. TLAQUEPAQUE, oh, I am SO happy to hear your news!  I cannot wait to get that news, NED, \"No Evidence of Disease,\" but gotta do rads first.  And THANKS for the tip on breathing deeply, I had almost forgotten! ALL, I am feeling worlds better today, each day is like that, and for me, I think I \"suffered\" more than the usual on account of I was told to move from my gurney to my bed, and wound up pulling my drains and incision.  If you are conscious, girls, DEMAND they move you to your bed, you cannot do that by yourself.  But still, I just want the girls to know, who have surgery coming up, it's gonna be okay, most of any unusual problems are identifiable, you're in a HOSPITAL and they will take care of you or at least fix what they may have done wrong.  And people recover at different rates, some are out doing things just a few days later, and some it takes a few weeks, like me.  This is surgery, but mostly what happens afterwards is RECOVERY.  During recovery, we women need our pain medicines and our rest, careful and easy movements, stay in touch with your surgeon's nurse about ANYthing that is bothering you, ask her for tips about your recovery.  And most of all I, for one, am just SO GLAD to have gotten that cancerous breast off of me, all thru my chemo I wanted it off, and finally they removed it and I am SO relieved that source of cancer is gone now!

BLONDE, you asked about our incisions.  Mine did not involve pulling the tummy skin up like you.  But I think mine looks kind of sloppy and lumpy, as if a third grader made the bed and pulled the sheets as a bunch and tucked in diagonally.  I also have a couple fatty type places on either side of my scar.  The scar itself is pretty thin, if I hadn't fallen in the hospital, I think most of it would be a straight line.  I definitely have a shark bite apperance on my left chest.  The incision runs from my sternum, kind of wobbles in the middle, and then divides near the armpit, one going down and one going up. But the WORST thing about my scar is I had a smudge mark from I thought the IBC part of my cancer, it appeared on my skin maybe a month after noticing my boob was diff.  Well, right at the incision where the rumpled sheets thing is, I could have sworn that part of that mark was still there!  I told the surgeon and he said he thought it was a surgery injury.  So, I told the radiologist, and she agreed with the doc, and that it was kind of peeling like an injury healing.  So, I said the mark was peeling, too.  Anyway, the rad doc knows about it, and the surgeon did say the incision margins were clear.  Worries me, tho.  I don't want IBC recurrence right in that place, my biggest concern of all this.  One thing I did look at online was some amazing tattoos that go over practically the whole breast, leaves with flowers usually, and these vine parts go over the scar, with a big flower at the middle, and unfurling up here and there, it makes it look like a boob is there sort of, and kind of takes away from the strange flat look.  I'm not having reconstruction, and probably no tattoo, but gets me to thinking.  Maybe in the spring when I have some hair and my scar/rad situation is healed up, I'll go to a salon and get my hair fixed and then to a tattoo shop to get some morning glories put where my boob was.  I wonder how expensive that will be. Love always to my chemo sisters, Gail   ",

But ladies, I am SO glad that boob is gone, had five months of chemo before this surgery, so annoyed.  I guess we're entitled to be annoyed, altho I TRY to be kind. But we had to put our dog down day before surgery, of all things, it's been a hard bunch of weeks, and last of some chemo is still with me, but I heard five to seven weeks is the magic release..  On subject of sleeping, the pain meds kept me up until 12, then woke up at 3 a.m.  Gee whiz.  Been a stressed time, but chemo is over (I hope for good) and now surgery is over.  So, I'm free to enjoy some freedom, hope my wrecked mastectomy wound doesn't get worse, and so now for a liitle freedom until the rads thing. My emotions are, however, all over the place, gotta go take a Valium. TIGER BLOOD, when the anesthesiologist talks to you, he'll write the orders but probably won't wheel you into the OR, but tell him you are fearful of going under, so would he please put something in your medicine to make you happy when it's over.  He'll figure something out.  I've had good anesth and bad ones, depends on anesth doc, so it's good to tell yours what's up with your probs.  GG   ",

      "Content": "Aug 15, 2011 08:53AM - edited Aug 17, 2011 09:09AM by dogeyed SCILLA, caught your post just before I put this one, so am adding this in.  Yes, it is normal to feel that achiness all the way down your arm, it is sort of a swelling thing.  Just squeeze your hands in and out a lot, gently squeeze your arm up and down with lotion, hold them outside knees when sitting and twist them around one way and then the other, like stretching.  And yes, I also have these oddball flabby places around my arm and on side, just hate it, but it is also a swelling feature.  Compare it to the other side, you'll see those \"ears.\"  The drains will get rid of some of it, and when they come out, then you can put those 4x8\" freezer packs alongside the top inner arm and also so it reaches where the drains were, just hold it in there, I wrap it in a silk scarf.  As for how far to push exercises, I pushed as hard as I wanted to***, and also used arm and pulling it more than I probably should.  The hardest is getting it over your shoulder after drains come out, and I am very careful with that.  I wound up with a very tight muscle group in my lower back on the side of the surgery, got on floor and rolled it out. ***8/17 CHANGE:  Please, ladies, this does not mean to OVERDO.  Exercises I had to follow were very mild, and I did not do them frequently becuz I was so wiped out.  But sometimes I would reach too far with the surgery side and I could feel it pull too hard in my arm.  But as someone else posts much later in this forum, you don't want to disturb your incision area, so always guard against that. LILYLADY, I had the same chafing in my armpit and upper arm, especially where the drains were, and this continued even AFTER they got the drains out.  So, what I did was, I found a silk-type scarf and hung it inside my t-shirt arm so it wouldn't rub, and also i finally took to icing in my armpit.  Husband has these 8\" x 4\" or so rectangular freezer packets, I take them out of there and wrap that same scarf around it, and I put one end inside next to where my drains were, and the other end right up against my upper inside arm.  I guess I ice it maybe two-three times a day, and it DOES bring the swelling down little by little, actually have a new spot where it does not rub anymore.  Lotion didn't seem to help, but I put it.  As for the appearance, I just had one breast off, but anyway, to me, I just look like the one-armed man, kind of battle-scarred, you know.  If anyone inquires, I'm gonna tell people I went too far down the Bayou and got into a knife fight.  You CAN decide later to get reconstruction.  EEMA, I was SO glad to hear someone else felt pain, too.  I was miserable up until yesterday, and that's about two weeks since surgery.  I let my pain meds run out, and, like an idiot, I didn't ask for a refill.  You'll read in my post to Lily what I did with icing it.  Another woman did it that I read about here, and so I felt like it would be okay.  I would have been VERY troubled if they had mixed me up with another patient, too!  Gosh, you poor thing.  I hope you get sorted out. CHULITA, That burning sensation when you lean forward, I have deduced it is pressure on the incision site, I feel it sort of in the front, so I try not to lean forward very much. BLONDELAWYER, As for TIPS AFTER SURGERY to those who have not had surgery, I gave some much further back in this forum, but my tips had more to do with how to handle the period of time in the HOSPITAL ROOM right after the surgery, so I'll give it again here:  (a) Do NOT try to slip over into the bed from a gurney; MAKE them move you to the bed.  This is because I did move and I fell and pulled really hard on my drains and my incision, bleeding everywhere, lots of lasting pain.  (b) Tell your room nurse when you meet her that you want pain medicines every four hours, and you want your own medicines at whatever times you usually take them (tell her the times), and tell her what other health issues you have.  This is because my nurse would leave for hours on end and I didn't have anybody to ask for pain control, etc.  (c)  If you have to push the button to talk to the main desk, do NOT tell them whatever your problem is; simply ask for your nurse or any nurse, insist. When I got home, I was able to move around a lot better than I thought.  I wore large soft T-shirts inside-out, I could pull them off easily by getting good arm out first, then sliding it off the bad side.  Get some safety pins in case you wind up pinning your drain bulbs to that T-shirt.  Get some bandaging materials, both square pads and long rolls that wrap around your chest, and also some medical white tape, you MAY need them if your drains leak.  You need to have a mirror where you can see where the drains come out.  I wanted to sleep on the couch becuz I was afraid to go to bed (I was nervous), husband almost always fell asleep in the recliner with me whilst watching TV, you'll need a bunch of pillows of all sizes.  I ate frozen micro meals, cereal and Milk, OJ, V-8, and you need a source of IRON (I ate spinach).  Ask someone to fix a very large pot of your favorite meal, and for me it was my large noodle & sour cream & cream of mushroom soup dish.  Have plenty of snacks and deserts.  You will need Smooth Move tea and some laxatives, including suppositories, to get the digestion moving; it IS going to stop up big-time.  When you're discharged from the hospital and they ask if you need pain pills, JUST SAY YES, whether you think you will or not.  GG ",

My drain output was similar to KATHE, I emptied the bulbs out two or three times a day, combined two drains into one little measurement cup and it filled it up for maybe two or three days.  Then it gradually went down, up a little, down more, etc.  I was scheduled one week from surgery to get them out, and one drain had stayed consistently low, the other one was right at the cut-off amount daily total for three days, and the morning to get them out I emptied the right amount, and dang if the bulb thing didn't suck in another same amount!  So, I just counted it as that day's amount and let them pull the drains.  I figured my body would absorb the rest.  I don't recommend this for anyone else, but I just could not STAND them another moment.  My doc seemed to think the mark I had on my boob that I thought a part of cancer, that was left near the incision, was rather a bruise from surgery.  So, I asked him if it WAS indeed a part of the cancer situation, would rads kill it, and he said yes, but that he had good margins to incision, and so it didn't have cancer in it.  Still bugs me.  Am seeing a melanoma specialist since I had that, too (three kinds of cancer in one boob), the margins should have been a little larger, altho surgeon and I agreed it was good enough.  BUT if that melanoma guy thinks surgeon should go back in, WELLL, I'll get him to take off what I think is that skin marking, and maybe get RID of the two fatty places I have on either side of the scar.  My scar tapes were removed yesterday, that's when I saw doc, and cleaned up, it looks healed and thus fairly good, altho not exactly what I would call straight, and I think in general I look sort of like a one-armed man.  But I had seen my Dad's breast cancer scar two years post-op when my stuff happened, and his quarter-inch white part blended nicely and did not look odd at all, so I know mine will be the same... in fact, they used glue on me (and I think dissolvable sutures), and he had regular stitches, so I think my scar will remain very thin. They wanted to start rads, but I begged for another week, I'm just so weak and still feel some pain in my upper arm.  Doc did not say anything about it being lymphedema and in fact said my scar and everything looked real good.  The swelling HAS gone down.  So, I did get some more pain meds, it hurts right now but am waiting a little longer to take the drugs.  I think it partly hurts because I've pulled it too much since surgery 2-1/2 weeks ago.  But in general the general discomfort is SO much better, I thought I'd go crazy that first 10 days or so.  I may also have some spazed-up muscles in that arm, too, so will try to rub it out a few times a day for a couple days, see if it helps.  Also am now taking a weekly vitamin/min with iron in it, to hopefully restore my strength.  LOVE TO ALL SISTERS, GG",

DEBBI, you cannot get a break in this, it seems.  I felt like my world pretty much collapsed too.  Like BLONDE felt about her husband passing, I felt when my dog passed day before surgery, and sometimes it all just comes crashing down.  And here we were, already in a weakened state, still stuck in treatment, and stuff keeps happening.  I hope your latest scare works out and that good health will catch up to you.

While my range of motion is better, I still do not use that arm to do strength stuff, and so last night I was trying to get rearranged in my bed, and stupidly used my left arm to lift myself up and let myself back down, and I could feel it pull the muscles in upper arm.  It's still sore there right now, so I reckon I need to start adding some very gentle muscle strenghtening to that arm's \"workout\" when I exercise it from time to time.  I have slacked off on walks, overall good strengthening activity, so I simply MUST get back into that, especially with rads coming up, I'll have some tension buildup in me from that, for sure.  GG",

Well, there is one other, unrelated to the breast surgery was the chemo port surgery, taking it out.  They stitched up the hole where it was, and these are dissolving stitches.  But the lady doc left one piece of thread sticking straight out of my skin, it was about 1/4 inch.  Drove me crazy.  So, I trimmed it down a little, but I can still feel it.  And I'm wondering how can that stitch dissolve if it's sticking out?  So, didn't know if anyone else had a tip on how to rid myself of the thing or not?  Well, that's it on the surgery front.  Hope all of you are managing with any reconstructions, or rads like JOANIE had, or any of my nonreconstruction strangeness or \"shark bite\" as I like to call it.  GG ",

But I'm also with USAF about settling down in front of the TV, I can't tell you how many times I've slept on the couch thru all this cancer routine.  GG  P.S.  Ask your doc for oxycodone next time, it's a no-refill script, but it's a lot easier on a person.",

As for how fast things progress with appointments, it goes very fast in most cases, with the above 10-week thing maybe a misstep somewhere in the offices.  The reason being for going fast, they want to get at whatever is in your breast quickly, becuz just by speeding things up, they improve chances you will be cured of this thing.  People around ME literally dropped everything and got me set up with a treatmentn plan... I think from mammogram to surgery (to put in a port for chemo, I had chemo first) was all within a two-week period, with chemo being put in my veins just two days after port surgery. So, as some other posters here have said, YOU must be the one to call the doc who ordered the tests and make CERTAIN any information about your results be conveyed by the doctor or his nurse who should know for certain, too, what he knows.  You see, the doctor knows your HISTORY, which is you have a lump in your breast, whereas the radiologist guy doesn't know ANYthing about that, unless he had the records in his hands when he looked at your mammogram and US.  I would not rely on a quick, \"It looks okay,\" from him.  See, another radiologist has to check over his report, and then it's all sent to the doc who ordered it, and he sees the pictures and reads the report, and based on the lump you had, let's say if the radiology people ignored it by mistake, for example, he'll be on the phone giving them hell about not identifying the UFO in your boob!  So, no, you must not just \"wait\" and you must not just \"followup\" with your doc.  NO.  You must find out from the doc who ordered these tests and find out THIS WEEK (today) about should you have a biopsy, what IS your lump, and so on and so forth.  I just wanted to be sure you understood if THEY aren't going to jump all over this, YOU MUST.  Let us know what happens.  GG ",

I lost a dear friend, he had Muscular Dystrophy, I've known him for 40 years, always kept in touch, he was a sweet, funny person.  I still miss him and he's been gone three years now.  I just wish he were here so I could pick up the phone and say hello, send him an email, just knowing he was there was so important.  A song comes on the radio that reminds me of him, and oh I still just cry and cry, even today.  But when husband and I speak of him now, it is the good times we remember, and we share a good laugh, and THOSE are the things you must think of about your stepsis now, before she got sick, the jokes you two shared that were so funny even while she was sick, the beauty she brought to your life for all your life.  THAT is what pulls us through when the ache gets so bad in our hearts that we cannot breathe, the smiles we shared and the knowing. You need time to grieve, it takes a long time just for the tears to stop, just to be able to leave the house.  Anger visits you, and other emotions, all stages of grief come and go, and i for one am honored that you came to this website and told us how you felt, and I am glad to be able to hug you with my words just for this brief moment in time, for you have much time left to go in this beautiful world, and so do I, altho we all live so closely with the fear of endings, these lovely women all here hoping beyond hope that we shall not submit, rather we shall hold our heads high and live proudly, for this is the way of females, to shoulder it all, to take it all, and not bow our heads once, except when we are home alone and with our closest peoples.  God bless you, Yellowdog, I shall think of you today as I go through the paces and of your dear stepsis as she goes into the light.

Any other ideas of types of tattoos?  I would LOVE to hear them.  I saw some Scar Project website pics, no ideas stuck out except the morning glory.  While I like the morning glory idea, I also like abstract scrollwork designs, but wonder if that would look as good as the flower thing.  But I just love Medieval Celtic-like touches to my home, I choose designs that are that scroll stuff, can be loose, repetitive, or random.  I want to draw my own, perhaps, and have muted fav colors to sort of fill in here and there. Glad I found this forum.  My scar, I may get used to it, but I just thought upon seeing some pictures of people with the tattoos, gosh they look so good, might help me get past this.  I've been having very nervous episodes a week out from rads, watching the scar is no help.  I'm 60 years old, but I was a hippie type and think I can wear a tattoo with confidence and won't feel like an outcast, altho only way anyone else would see it aside from docs and husband, is if husband were to pass away before me, or if a girlfriend wanted to see my tattoo.  GG ",

It DOES depend on your type of chemo.  If you're getting a couple drugs initially, to be followed in a couple months by a single drug, then I am relatively certain the first ones, that like the others said, you will be okay for a couple days after infusion.  It doesn't drain you until a couple days later.  But the last single drug later, that might be in the Taxol family, and that one they give you benadryl and THAT'S the one you need someone to drive you home FOR SURE, the chemo people usually won't let you go home alone.  So, if you are not sure, you must get some assistance.  And hey, a cab is fine if you are truly upset about this whole help thing, and someone at the chemo place can call the cab and assist you out the door.  They know the score.  With the kids, you will know more about how you are when 5 rolls around, and if you're still unsure, ask a neighbor to pick those kids up, you may even be able to ride with them. Just a little piece of unwanted advice, when those side effects hit you in a couple days, and by the way Thursday is a perfect day to get infused, that's when I did, you may have a hard time dealing with the aches and such, and if so, you call down to that chemo place and tell them just exactly how rotten you feel, and your cancer doc SHOULD call in a prescription for pain killers.  Many clinic places you can talk to a social worker, an they will see to it that it's done, since docs are hard to get ahold of, or one of their nurses will talk to you and get it done.  I almost quit the program because of side effects, but I am quite a bit older than you, so while other girls in my chemo support group here were able to work and all this stuff, I could not.  So, I'm just saying, do not suffer in silence on that account.  It is too hard for any human being to bear, if you have trouble with it.  Whatever you choose to do, it will work out, I promise.  The main thing is to get there.  All the rest will sort itself out.  GG",

Me, if I thought I had cancer, I most definitely would get a second opinion.  And I paged thru your several titled threads in this newbie section to sort of get a timeline and it does sound a lot like cancer is tearing up your boob, but I can't be sure.  But a second opinion, that's the only way you'll be sure.  I wish I could comfort you and say, \"No, your boob doesn't sound like cancer,\" when it does SOUND like it, and vice versa.  That's why you've been told very simply to get a second opinion.  I know, it's involved, it takes time, after all the time you've already had to sit around and worry, but you MUST.  I can remember MANY newbies who posted in this forum and were told they were okay.  But some KNEW something was amiss, and they kept at it, and would report back to us in the original thread from time to time, and at long last it would turn out that dang if they didn't have cancer!!!  Some threads, my dear DJ, can go on a hundred pages!  And then once they got the diagnosis, then they'd finally move into other topic sections.  But I think now that all this commotion has been stirred up, and in fact you may indeed want to leave us as you said you would, altho you don't HAVE to, I want to encourage you to get that second opinion.  I would even say you may wish to try for a bonafide breast cancer clinic, where all they do is breast cancer, and many major hospitals all over the country have a breast cancer departments within them, even if you'd have to travel a few hours.  So, perhaps pull up online the yellow pages for \"Physicians\" or \"Cancer Clinics\" or whatever, and see what you can find at a much larger town in your state that's close to you, set something up with them.  But whilst you are at that, get some sort of treatment for what it is the docs have agreed you DO have, and see if it helps.  But still get that second opinion. And really and truly, try to keep in mind that the reason folks got upset is because they had taken the time and effort to respond to several other posts you had made, most on the same day you posted, which when a newbie starts several threads, it is sort of hard to piece together diff posts and pull together some sort of collective answer, and in fact some may not even know you had posted earlier, and it's hard for us to piece everything together becuz ALL our minds are in a deep fog, chemo takes it right out of you for a very long period of time, and so that's how come folks didn't appreciate you acting as tho no one had done nothing, when a lot of people said diff things to you at your diff threads, with what must have been a monumental effort for them.  You WERE answered, so it can be sort of shocking to us when someone says we haven't done anything.  That hurts.  But no need to apologize anymore.  You were just wanting answers so deperately, and ALL of us have been where you are.  But you needed to be advised, just as I am advising you yet again as others already have, that you can't just throw out the baby with the bathwater!  We DID respond to you!  If we hadn't, well, it might be another thing.  But I think YOU even forgot your other threads!  Ha!  SMILE. I wish you all the best, don't hesitate to come back and give it another go, try to keep all ongoing stuff to one thread in a section, and if you start a new thread, try to compile some sort of history so we'll remember what's gone on heretofore.  If you DO wind up with a cancer diagnosis, then you'll join a group of numerous women together, all in the same boat, where, for example, like when I finally got to chemo, I joined a group already going for that particular month, and I stuck with it for five months.  There were about 50 of us that all talked together for all that time, all in one thread, all of us began chemo in the same month.  Then you'll get more of an \"exchange\" of ideas, rather than folks answering specific questions you have. Well, I hope I haven't confused things.  My thinking is VERY confused so I almost didn't reply to you.  But I too wanted to help since you were pleading for it.  You did good to go to the doc you saw, you got your results, and so try to get some treatment of SOME kind from those people for what you DO have, and while that is going on, seek out a second opinion.  GG",

My cancer is both IBC and IDC, and my breast got sort of hard on the end, first thing I noticed, then I looked at my boob and it was indeed swollen more than the other.  Later came some pain, which IBC people will feel sometimes.  Mammo showed a pretty big growth, but I never felt it!  Each person really is diff.  But the odds are you do not have BC, especially since the mammo only showed a small area near underarm, which is where a lot of lymphs are, which will swell with infection.  Also, since it is small, even if it is BC, could very well be you caught it at a highly curable stage (the best kinds are at 95 percent).  And even dismal percents, people just live and live.  Since you had reduction, could also very well be infection got in there!  We are all hoping for you, and even if you have BC, treatments are very good now, keep us posted.  GG ",

FROG, seems to me if one side went well and the other didn't, something is amiss.  But I do still have a sensitive sore place right in the middle, I somehow imagine it is scar tissue gone wrong.  I DO know for the four or so months after surgery, my scar didn't look right at all, and I had seen pictures of the way they do, so I was concerned.  It finally flattened out, but pulls pretty tight near my armpit.  I'm glad some others here posted about massaging it.  I had been putting the prescribed Radiaplex lotion on it faithfully, I had rads shortly after surgery, but once it all healed, I stopped.  But I think I'll pick back up with it as a daily thing.  I also rub my dog ear, but I have no idea if it will help.  Just my two cents everyone.  GG",

Do you ever buy little outfits for your pups?  I've been seing some Pomeranians with little T-shirts on, and I swear they look like tiny bear cubs.  The avatar I use is a picture from a video of a very young puppy who lays just like you see, and then whilst dreaming he rolls his head around and cries and howls, really funny.  GG",
