My sister's across the country from me and unbelievably was also just diagnosed with breast cancer (DCIS). A friend was going to come out to stay with me, i was so happy about that, but she can't now. i feel so alone I can't stand it, can't sleep, can't stop crying, can't believe this is happening and I'm supposed to speak to my surgeon first thing tomorrow morning.
