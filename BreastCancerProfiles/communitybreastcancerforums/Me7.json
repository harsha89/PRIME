I am also doing a workout routine daily with weights, I have still not missed a day at it, but have changed up my routine so very light or no weights on some moves. Aerobics is out until I heal more, but walking alot is helping me keep my mind clear of all the worries along with a light workout routine. ",

In 10 seconds I was numb and nothing else was ever felt. He did 3 punch biopsy's of the nipple and also removed 2 suspecious moles on my abdomen. He did use sutures to close the nipple area and moles, so I have to go back for suture removal Feb. 2nd. He told me at that time he will give me the report on the biopsy's...so I wait again. Sure glad it is over though. I must say, I went in feeling pretty calm today, thanks to the prayers from all of you who were praying, so thank you very much. Anyway, if anyone else has to get a punch biopsy of their nipple, just wanted to tell you, it is not near as bad as it sounds. I am the worlds biggest baby when it comes to needles, so if I can get through it...well, enough said. Hubby is taking me out to dinner tonight, bless his heart. Gonna go take some advil now before numbing meds wear off. I'll keep you gals posted as to my results:) Log in to post a reply",

I am doing the P90x workout and it's very tuff, so think I will lay off of that particuliar one till I am a bit more healed. I noticed I have alot of drainage from the site. Not sure how much is to much. I was told to leave the dressing on for 2 days, then remove it and then I could shower. I thought sutures had to stay dry till they were out? He removed alot of my nipple, actually....most of it, from what I could tell before they dressed it. I think I may have to call his office this morning yet, as it looks like the drainage is beginning to really soak through the dressing. Has anyone else had this happen after biopsy? Well, it is what it is. And thanks to all of you, I know I can get through this. Whatever the results may be. I know many of you have had to go through and endure much more than I have and I admire all of your endurance through it all and am glad you are here to offer us 'newbiees' insight and hope. Will be awhile before I know my results, but I think I will keep returning here just to see how everyones doing and encourage others as you all have encouraged me through this not so fun, walk in the park...it's more like a walk in a maze...not knowing whats waiting around the corner.

He said although Mammo can even look 'normal' or ultra sound can show some abnormalities....( same as MRI, by the way) BIOPSY is only test that proves tissue is a cancer.

He is a board certified BS. I made the mistake of allowing my general practitioner set me up with a local general surgeon,...so now I have to possibly go through another biopsy. Not to happy about that. My regular internist should have sent me to a BS right away. I had friends tell me that local docs seem to want to send pt.s to other local docs for further testing instead of specialist, where they need to be sending them. So heads up girlfriend....request a BS, soon! Good luck, I will be thinking and praying about you! ",

I DO know that general surgeons are just that BUT some of them specialize in a specific area of surgery, such as the breast. Dr. Lilly, if you looked him up, is specialized in surgerys of the breast. It is his main focus...all he does, so he see's alot. He is board certified in that area. All surgeons are general surgeons. Some just take it a step further, such as MD's who specialize in say OBGYN or Pediatrics. Those MD, most are board certified and it is the only area they select to continue study in and work in. Dr. Lilly specialized in surgerys of the breast and therefore has continued Ed, in this field.  My Surgeon here, who did my biopsy is a great surgeon. I do not doubt that for a minute. But after further investigation, I found he does not have alot of experience in breast issues or surgerys for that matter. So in reality, going to a general surgeon who does not 'specialize' in a particular area of surgery is not a good idea, in my opinion. The nurse from Riverside, as well as my Mother who is a retired Surgical RN, said Breast Specialist are the best to go to in cases such as mine. They have much more experience's n this area, so I will feel better getting another opinion for my own piece of mind. Just like I would have more confidence in seeing a OBGYN specialist/Surgeon to preform a hysterectomy than a general surgeon, who does not hardly ever do them. As I stated, my local general surgeon is a great guy and a good surgeon in my opinion. He did a fantastic job on my hubbys hernia years ago. But I will feel better seeing a breast surgeon to get the final call for me, benign or not. Why would I even risk it knowing Dr. Lilly has much more experience in this area as well as training? Another RED FLAG, I have is the area that was biopsed on me with no attention to my sore/swollen armpit as well as having to wait so long for my results is not right.  Anyway, I will be thrilled if my local surgeon tells me my report is B9 on Tuesday, but I will still follow through w/ Dr. Lilly. My pain is still present as well as an underarm lump/node. Something is not right. I now my body and I would still encourage ANYBODY with issues of their breast to seek out a BS. Thats just my opinion. I am not berating you. I think everyone has to make the choice that gives them peace of mind. Perhaps your General surgeon has more experience w/ BC than mine? But thanks for your input.",

I know you are only trying to guide me and help and I AM grateful for that. I sounded mean in my last post to you and I hope you can forgive me. I am just real touchy right now, sorry. I can agree with you on some points. There are many general surgeons in our Nation that do not specialize in breast surgeries...they just dont do many of them and therefore they lack the area of expertize a breast surgeon has. On the other hand......there are many very good general surgeons who also do not specialize in any area, such as the breast, but they DO see alot of cases and they do a terrific job in diagnosing and biopsy. i realize I did not mention that before. I was wrong to say all people who have to have a breast biopsy should select a breast specialist. In my particular case though, I wish I had. As I mentioned, my general surgeon does not do many breast biopsy or has much experience in that area at all and I should have educated myself on that fact first. So, now I would say, if anyone must have a breast biopsy, they should educate themselves beforehand to see the experience of their chosen Dr. Yes, Dr. Lilly is a general surgeon. ALL breast surgeons are 'general surgeons', but they have more schooling in areas of breast . Thats the point I was trying to make to you. I have his paperwork here in front of me and he is Board Certified, and is a fellow in so many areas of Breast education I cannot even begin to list them. I have a dear friend who was mis-diagnosed by the same local surgeon who recently did my biopsy. It was Dr. Lilly, who found her cancer. I would have talked to this friend more about my situation before hand but she has been out of state until recently, otherwise, I would have gone to Dr. Lilly in the first place.  You are 100% right to say, titles mean little...experience counts. I guess I was in the belief that a general surgeon who has also specialized in breast disease and is board certifies might be a better choice to go to if a person has issues with their breast. I can see your point though, as far as their are many general surgeons who do not specialize in the breast, but still do many breast surgerys and are very qualified. It boils down to everyone has to do their homework. I just did not do mine very well. Once again, peace. I really did not mean to come off sounding so bad. Sometimes, I think it is hard to really get what the other is saying in the posts, when in all actuality, you were only trying to educate me and help. I will let you know how Tuesday goes....sorry and thank you again. I dont know how I would manage getting through all this without you and others like you and I sure don't want to find out.

      "Content": "Me7 wrote: Okay, as many of you know, I had my biopsy last Thursday. No word yet on results. I called the office and was told Dr. was out of town and will go over the results Feb.2nd when I go in for suture removal. Heres the problem... Today, the nurse from Riverside ( Where I had the breast MRI that led to me having to have the biopsy) called and asked me if I had followed up with more care. I told her, yes, I had a biopsy but had no results yet. She asked me is I had a general surgeon ( yes I did ). Anyway, she asked me where he did the biopsy and I told her, he did it right below the nipple. She told me that I need to follow up with a BS because general surgeons often do not biopsy the right area and can miss the problem as they are not as skilled in that area to know where to go. She also said my MRI report showed asymmetry ( which is often a very normal condition in many woman, but not so much in my case, as it applies to the nipple) MRI also showed enhancement of that nipple as well as Neoplastic Process. Neoplastic Process, she said, is the development of new cells that can be benign, pre-cancerous or malignant. She said it could also be infection, but doubts it since I was on a 10 day treatment of antibiotics with no change in symptoms that I had such as pinkish discharge, pain,swelling. So now she says I need to see a BS even if I go next week and find out the report shows as it being benign. Crap! To top that off, my armpit is very sore and a lump has developed, seemingly overnight. That area was tender before, but not like this and it was never x-rayed or whatever they do to check for soreness there.She is concerned that since my general surgeon did not biopsy the nipple itself, i may not get true results and she has seen alot of cases where general surgeons do not get the 'right' area. SO here we go again. Not much I can do now till I see my Dr. next Tuesday, but will for sure follow up with a BS right after to be on the safe side. I have to say, the call from Riverside was very unexpected. Cant believe she would follow up with this since I was only there for a MRI, but am glad she did. She told me she can give me names of reputable BS that will work with our insurance, and they do not have to be affiliated with Riverside, it is just a courtesy they provide when breast imaging comes back suspicious, I thought that was pretty nice of them. She also is going to mail me info on further options I have if I need them in the future as well as info on regular exams...free info stuff. I was surprised they go to this many lengths to help their patients and impressed as was my husband who took the call. So yes, I am freaking out a little. I thought no news was good news, since the Dr. said he would call if he saw anything bad.  Still could be good news, but I have a gut feeling that I need to follow through with this nurses advise and see a BS no matter how the results come back. I am a retired surgical assistant, but this is not my area of expertise. My Mom is a retired RN who worked in surgery. I told her what this other nurse said and she agreed , she did not know I had my biopsy done by a GS.  SOOOOOOO LADYS..........MOM KNOWS BEST....SHE ADVISE'S  ALL US GALS WHO HAVE TO HAVE A BREAST BIOPSY...HAVE IT DONE BY A STATE BOARD SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZES IN BREAST CANCER!!!!!!!!!!!!! TO BIG OF A RISK NOT TO...IT IS YOUR LIFE!!! WHY RISK IT????  My Mom was furious that I didn't and I should have know better. She said she has seen MANY women go through biopsy's, from General Surgeons in our area and get benign reports, only to find out later they were in fact pre-cancerous or malignant. So if you get nothing else from this post get this......See a Breast Specialist for ANY breast changes or Biopsy's....Love and hugs to all going through this or been there, done that!!!!
