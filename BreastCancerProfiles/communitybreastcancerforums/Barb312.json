I am still hanging in there at 77. I was dx'd in Jan. 2012 with bone mets from get go. I have been on Faslodex for 16 months and doing well. Fatigue is the killer for me. I live in FL and I am able to water walk almost everyday and that has helped with feeling down more than anything. My onc. told me last week I looked like I was 62. Bless his heart . So glad i found this site.",
