There is very little information on this. I was told by the radiologist that I would be notified with in 48 hours. I was called by my doctor's office on Friday, 72 hours later and told I needed to schedule an appointment for Monday to see the my doctor to go over the results. I was under the impression they would call to give me the results as they did with my mammogram results. I am so nervous and don't know what to expect. Log in to post a reply",
