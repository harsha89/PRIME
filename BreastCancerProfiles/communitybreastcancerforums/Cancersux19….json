I know as someone who doesn't have it I cannot relate to what she is feeling, but as her son I am very scared for me, her my young 14 year old sister and 17 year old brother, and the rest of our family. She needs to talk to people who can relate. We are being very positive and hopeful it is not in her organs, it is estrogen positive we do not know it anything else till the other test come in. There is one thing I am upset about my mom had to take the charge and made them give her the scan or else they mostly likely wouldn't of found it till it was in the organs.They say she can live for 5-10-20 years with this...thats still not enough time...I hate the not knowing what comes next...cancer is the worse.",

She had deep flap surgery and the scar was infected and took awhile to heal..but that was 6 months ago...I wonder if it could still be infected. They are not even doing a biopsy till next tuesday!
