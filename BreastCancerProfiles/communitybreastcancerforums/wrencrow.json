      "Content": "wrencrow wrote: So I had my stereotactic biopsy last Wednesday.  That was 7 days ago and still no word.  I read this article from the NY Times about women waiting for biopsy results and the fact their cortisol levels raised as much as someone who received the news they had cancer.  I can see how this is true, since I can't focus on anything at the moment.  My family has already dealt with too much cancer.  I can't imagine if this is a journey I'll begin to face.  I just wish I knew, then I could face it, do something, have a plan of attack.  I believe I have the slowest, most disorganized medical group ever.  If I am diagnosed I will be changing physicians.  Every step from scheduling the first mammogram, to the follow-up, biopsy etc.  has been like pulling teeth and now the waiting for results.  Of course my primary physician is on vacation, I believe this is her third this year.  This is all so frustrating.  I have huge projects that need my attention at work but I'm so distracted by all of this I can't accomplish anything.  I think anti-anxiety medications should be a natural course in this whole process.  Anyway, my prayers are with all of you who are going through battle, starting your fight, or like me in the limbo of waiting.   Log in to post a reply",

This evidently depends on which lab my insurance covers. Isn't two weeks excessive? That is a long time to wait and worry. Log in to post a reply",
