I've decided,  if I don't I'll have to fly back home for medical help as I'm not receiving any help here.  Today the nipple is hard and tender and my AREOLA tissue is darkened and thicker.",

Yesterdayy I found my nipple in the left breast that is the breast of concern is now splitting!!!! It's sore and tender and looks raw. The burning pain is still there and the skin around my AREOLA is changing in texture. I will take photos every other day and take them with to an after hours GP. It's not long after Christmas so clinic's are closed. Sigh..",
