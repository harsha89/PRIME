Before it didn't really relate to me but now everytime i see a pink ribbon, i have a mixed feeling. I am officially part of the group now. I remember last year when i saw the pink ribbon, i was telling myself, maybe you should get yourself checked. I waited till Jan this year.",

I agree with the other ladies that your treatment would have been the same anyway. It just gives you some comfort knowing that you are stage 2 as \"per statistics\", stage 2 has a better prognosis. Many of us have learned to forget about the statistics and do the best we can to move on with life. There are quite a few adies here who were diagnosed young and i am one of them. I think it is the part that sucks because mamagram is not a routine for us under 40. and everyone says you are too young to have breast cancer. Anyway, welcome to the family !",
