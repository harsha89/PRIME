Hope I'll still be able to get to the hospital as we are expecting a big snow storm. Why couldn't this happen in better weather? -No really it shouldn't happen to us at all! Thanks to everyone who has contributed. It helps.",

I had a perm the week before I started radiation in the hope that it would make less work for me. From what I had read, it sounded like my hair should not be affected because the radiation is not to my head. The nurses and radiation techs have said the same but am very disappointed. I'm also having severe nausea. With 13 more treatments I hope things don't get much worse! Am I being realistic?",

The invasive ductal carcinoma did not enter the lymph nodes. I'm weak and underweight (90 lb) from severe arthritis, so I'm particularly hopeful that I will not require chemo. Thank you for your supportive postings.",
