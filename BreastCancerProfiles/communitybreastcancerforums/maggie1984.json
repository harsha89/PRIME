My work suggested I wear a wig but that was not for me. I did buy an expensive one and no itching. But most of the time I wore a bandana or a scrub cap. Most scrub places have these they are made by Dickies and they don't form to your head. Most of the time during winter a would wear a tobbogin. I got really creative in buying funky hats. My friend who went through this before me had an earring and hat party. I had no problem with losing my hair. When I went for chemo, everyone there had on scratchy wigs til I would take off my bandana and then they would go bald. Be comfortable for you. Let them stare!!!! You are beautiful!!!!!",
