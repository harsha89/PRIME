They are young adults, but the last thing I want is to have them worrying about me. It is so typical that we, as women, worry so much about others. But sometimes I think that even helps us, as we try to be strong for others. I remember when my mom died many years ago, I knew I couldn't fall apart because I had to be strong for my kids. But I think you can allow yourself to fall apart for a little bit, cry, even have a \"pity party\" for a little while if you need to.  Then you will concentrate on your plan of action and you will get through this. All of the women here are so supportive and will be here for you every step of the way. ",

Mammogram and ultrasound showed nothing. Breast specialist referred me for MRI. Had to fight with insurance to pay it but they finally agreed. Had MRI yesterday. Report said \"mildly suspicious\". Breast specialist says it was coded 4A which means to biopsy but chance of it being anything is \"very, very low\" (those were her words). She didn't seem at all concerned but says we will biopsy the nipple. I am relieved, I think!! ",
