I will continue to keep you in my prayers. Sending you many hugs....  ",

It's not bad news and yet it's not exactly comforting either.  The positive is that you'll be more diligent with mamos and watched more carefully, so if something were to happen you'd be catching it early.  Have you seen an oncologist? If you are not comfortable with what you've been told you should try to schedule an appt with one. Take care...  Stay positive",

It'll be over before you know it and then you can concentrate on getting better and moving on with your life. Sending you positive thoughts and well wishes.",
