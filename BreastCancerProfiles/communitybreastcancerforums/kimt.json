Also, that is a question - whether to take the uterus too, or just the ovaries.  My surgeon was okay with either, let me make the call.  Because I'm on tamox, I wanted the uterus out too b/c of the small chance of uterine cancer (that's rare, though - my onc says she's never seen it).",

Oh - I would second that on the stool softeners.  AND be sure to try to get up and move around, walk as much as possibly to disperse the gas after the laparoscopic surgery. I had no idea about that, but they pump you full of gas, which can be uncomfortable until it disperses.  I was feeling totally fine in a few days, though.",
