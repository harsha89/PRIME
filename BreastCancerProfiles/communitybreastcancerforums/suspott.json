I am a three year survivor of stage 4 that had spread to my liver. They gave me 16 month to live...as you can see they were wrong!!! Things are changing on the bc front as rapidly as any other cancer. It is now considered a managable illness such as hypertension, diabetes, or osteoporosis! Stay positive for yourself and your mother. I promise it really does help! By the way...I am cancer free...No Evidence of Disease since Jan 8,2008. My 19th wedding anniversary! Prayers and Blessings coming your way from Va.",
