With doxycycline, my eyes turned tomato red and my feet swelled up, but that was by day 3 ( stopped immediately). With robaxim, I broke out in a rash, started to stutter and had involuntary spasms in legs and arms, but the symptoms developed after a week. I have read that some folks have delayed allergic reactions to TC (i.e. a few days after the infusion) so this is what has me worried. If you or anyone else has experience with this kind of history, I would love to hear about it.  Yes, I will tank up on water and protein!  ",

Flash, I am going to follow your adivice by way of seeing a top allergist in Boston who has experience working with chemo patients.  I want to be sure that my onc is on the same page as the specialist so that we have a plan in place in case I have a delayed reaction.   Madelyn, what you describe is exactly the scenario I am worried about so I will push the allergy specialist to have a plan for me. I don't yet know if the protocol for my first chemo will include steroids or just benedryl. (I have seen both protocols on the boards here, but I have to sort through that as well.)  I can take some steroids the question is what is the upper limit. (when I herniated a disk in my neck a few years back, i tolerated the first round fine, but then they gave me a second and I had some odd neurological issues. ) So, in my own mind, i 'd like to start on benedryl and save the steroids in case I need them, but not sure if that will be the right thing. In any event I meet with the doctors the week after next, so I am not going to start chemo until I have a plan in place. In the meantime, I did was to look up how they determine the dosage of Taxol to give any individual. It a a formula that includes body mass, age, etc. Age is a proxy for liver function, which is crucial because Taxol is 80% processed through the liver. Has anyone had a pre-test to see how your liver functions? I always wondered if part of my delayed allerigic reaction to the two drugs I took was partly related to the fact that they were building up in my system and I wans't processing them out as quickly as I needed to.   In any event, reading about other folks experience on these boards has been invaluable to me because it made me more aware of my own potential problems. Tthanks for all your help and let me know if you have any other thoughts!! ",

I also gathered a lot of courage.  I am posting today because I have a question about reactions to decadron and how to manage them. My second TC chemo got delayed this week because I had high liver enzyme counts, but before I learned that, I had already taken the premeds (4 pills the day before, 2 the morning of). I just had the hardest 24 hours of my life! Even without the chemo in my body, the decadron caused not only the usual fluid retention, red face, swelling, etc, but I also had an intense headache, nausea, muscle weekness and, worst of all, a sort of \"brain brakedown\", where I really felt paranoid, scared and unhinged. I took some ativan, which helped some, but the headaches and wierd fears kept welling up uncontrollably.  Has anyone else had this problem? Is this what they call the steroid crash?

You have been very brave and tough. I think that even if you quit now, you would still have gotten a lot of benefit from all that you have done.  If you go forward with the final one, you might consider a couple of adjustments that might make it more tolerable: 1) reduce this dose - maybe by 20% or some such number 2) ask for a 'slow drip\" and extra pre-meds. By slow drip, I mean 3 times as long as usual.  I got this because I have a history of allergic reactions. In your case, if the tight chest and swollen tongue is happening within hours of the infusion, it could help. 3) wait an extra week for your body to recover. I had high liver enzymes on my second chemo and had to wait a week longer. Not in my initial plan, but that was what my body needed.  I think that either decision is good. Only you know what is in your heart. Chemo is only part of the journey. The estrogen blockers are even more important statistically in warding off recurrence so you should also weigh that in your decision.  Peace with whatever you decide.  best, Beau ",

I am enjoying some warm weather on the east coast and a new cat that was a stray who wandered into our lives in the freezing days of January. Kids are totally in love with him. Working on staying positive and keeping weight down. I now feel that is my biggest challenge. It feels like the one thing we can do for ourselves is control our eating to improve our health, but it is easier said than done. I really want to loose 15 pounds. As it is, I feel so great with the weight I lost during chemo. (at least one good thing came out of it!).  I am now trying to change a series of eating habits - some have come easier than others. Otherwise, things are good - kids are good, husband is good, life is looking up.  I wish you all a s/e free day! best, Beau ",

I have been staying off the boards in an effort to re-establish a more \"normal\" routine, but miss the support of all of you. I am glad some other folks have checked in as well. I am definintely feeling stronger - my neuropathy has improved, my anemia is gone, my mind is clearer (not where it was, but better), my hair is growiing in.I did manage to loose weight on chemo, but since starting on the hormonal drug, Arimedex, is seems to be creeping back up. Plus now I have really pronounced arthritis, especially in my neck where I had two herniated discs previously. My understanding is that Arimedex will only exacerbate it. However, I manage with some NSAids for now and an ocycodone now and again (like when I take a long car ride, etc). I am scheduled to see a spine specialist in April to see if there are so other things I can do to improve it. Every day brings new challenges as well as things to be grateful for. I did read the anti-cancer book and have tried to follow some of the practices. I am drinking green tea, (mixed with mint tea, it really tastes great), drinking only low fat milk, much less meat and more veggies. Is any one else trying to follow a new diet? I would enjoy some support on this with this group - I feel we went through the worst of it together so it would be nice to stay in touch.  I am putting off any decision about a hysterectomy or another mastectomy until the fall. I just feel that my body needs to heal more.  ",

My stats are very similar to yours - grade 2, IDC, , clear nodes, age 50 at diagnosis. but I had a 2.1 centimeter lump. I was really scared of chemo because I had a history of allergic reactions, but after 3 consults, and the fact that I have 2 kids, then age 9 and 11, I opted for TC X 4. I am over a year past chemo now and I am really glad I did it. It was hard, but now, if it ever comes back, I know that I did everything I could to prevent it. My Oncotype score was 26 so even though it was in the intermediate range, three is a good chance that my proliferation rate ( grade 2) was in the range to benefit from chemo. I think that you should wait until you get your chemo score to decide. A second consult is a great idea too. I wish you peace and a cancer free future whatever you decide. Best, Beau",

The next time, they cut my dose in half, the pain was much more tolerable and my white counts stayed in a reasonable range so I kept getting the 1/2 dose. Maybe a smaller dose could work for you, but be sure that they check your white counts. best, beau ",
