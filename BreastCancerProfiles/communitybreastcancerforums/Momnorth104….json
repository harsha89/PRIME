Both doctors have stated they have never seen this but they are sure there is nothing to worry about. The second visit has ordered a MRI to be sure but now the insurance has denied coverage. She is fighting them to get this completed. My question is had anyone else experienced this? I had intense itching from November to May with a discharge at times and it seems to subsided from a steroid cream my primary doctor gave me. I just don't feel comfortable accepting the answer of nothing to worry about. My right breast is disappearing and they have never seen this. Just does not seem possible that there is no explanation. Any ideas out there? My mammo and US were both clear the breast specialist said. do I accept that this is nothing to worry about or move onto another specialist that may have seen this before. Neither doctor offered to consult with another doctor to see if they had seen this. So confused Log in to post a reply",

There is not a lot out there that goes with them and no I have not lost weight nor on hormone therapy or drink a lot of caffeine. I have had a intense itchy nipple on my right side since the end of November. When I first mentioned to a PA she stated I probably had dry skin and to use lotion and cortisone on it. (I have never had dry nipples) but I did....no luck. The itch wakes me up at night and I have to remove myself to itch in private at work. Fast forward to last week....I asked my primary about this and told her that my right breast has shrunk about 1 1/2 cup sizes since December, that the itch is just as intense and I have small little bumps on my areola. There is no discharge are color change of the areola and the nipple is just bright red with one little skin tag type form on the tip. Well she said that she had no idea and was referring me to a breast specialist. A week later no phone call or appointment. I have called and they say it takes time. I also have MS which in fact makes my immune system low. Just impatient and worried. Everything I look at points to Pagets. Has anyone had any similar symptom's or experiences?",
