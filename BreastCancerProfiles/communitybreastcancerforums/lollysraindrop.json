Then after that test I was told I had a cyst and Lymph node .. When I got the report it said this Two - dimensional & Color Images of the L. breast were obtained in all 4 quadrants. At the 11:00 position 5 cm. from the nipple there is a well defined ANECHOIC mass measuring 6x4x7 mm.  At the 3:00 position 6 cm from the nipple there is a HYPOECHOIC mass with a HYPERECHOIC center typical for Lymph node measuring 5x4x5mm.      It is doubful that either of these 2 findings corresponds to the one view finding described on the mammogram.    BI-Rads  2 Come back in 6 ms for a unilateral mammogram But he advised me to see the Cancer Dr. So what does all this mean ... Is it something to worry about or what? Wonder what the Cancer Dr will do now after she reviewed my stuff they made me an appt in 3-4 wks to see her . Of course I am so upset I can't think straight.
