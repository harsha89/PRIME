I went to the OB/GYN who scheduled for US. turns out 1 had two solid regular margin growths of about 1cm long each with some other smaller cysts. Was told to monitor every 6 months. The growths have remained pretty much the same (growing maybe 1mm each time). Fast forward 2 years, my latest scan last month showed vascular blood vessel in the periphery of one of the lumps, which is now 1.3cm. Radiologist recommended biopsy, went back to OB/GYN who then asked if I want to consider elastography before deciding on biopsy. I've never heard of elastography before, so the OB/GYN googled it in her office to explain. 1 week later I went to a different radiology center for the elastography. They repeated the usual breast ultrasound on the affected side (that took 15-20 minutes, this tech seemed more thorough than the last scan), brought me to another room, and a different US tech performed the elastography, which took about 30 minutes - she scanned the 2 larger growths, as well as 4 other smaller cystic/semi solid lesions. The radiologist came in 10 minutes later, turns out the growth with the blood vessel was slightly harder than the other one, and asked if I would like it biopsied. Without thinking too much about it (and freaking out it may be malignant), I said ok. Within 10 minutes I was prepped for US core needle biopsy. Looking back, had I researched what the biopsy involved and had a think about it first, I would have declined the biopsy, or at least sufficiently prepare myself mentally! What a painful long drawn process even with the local anesthetic! They took 10 samples from the two bigger growths, and each needle insertion was so painful with multiple adjustments to the needle path! The US tech holding the probe had to reposition her hands from holding onto the US probe for too long, and my skin was uncomfortable as I could feel the heat from the probe after 20 minutes but was too scared to move or voice out. The whole biopsy took 30+ minutes even though I was told 15 minutes. I did not expect to be in the radiology clinic for so long! I was there for 3 hours including waiting time! My hand was aching and numb from lifting up for the 3 ultrasounds, and I do not know if it's pyschological, but the boob felt odd the next day. It took 1.5 nerve wrecking weeks for the biopsy results - benign! The results were delivered at the OB/GYN's office, and she said she wasnt anticiptating anything different from what was said in the report. It's been 2 weeks since the results, and there's a rash just below the nipple, which is quite far away from the core biopsy skin incision site. I went back to the OB/GYN, and was given cortisol cream, she thinks it may be an allergic reaction (after almost 3 weeks?). I thought I'd casually search the internet for post biopsy allergy, and realised that people get burns after prolonged ultrasound! And to make things worse, there is mention of bioeffects of ultrasound, and I'm now going crazy that the prolonged exposure to 3 ultrasound in ONE day may be detrimental and cause BC! I've never had issues with all the previous breast ultrasounds as they were 1-off every 6 months, but having 3 ultrasounds in a day seems like an overkill to me! Has anyone been in such a situation before? I feel like I've been subjected to unnecessary testing and didnt think properly before agreeing to additional testing, both invasive and non invasive. My OB/GYN thinks I'm crazy to worry about prolonged ultrasound exposure, as it's \"only\" sound waves. I just feel so traumatised by the whole experience, and that I've betrayed my own body.
