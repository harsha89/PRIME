Well, life must go on, but sometimes it`s not that easy. About check-ups: Did you got pet-scan after your treatments? I had ct scan right after my surgery and bone scan, and they were both clear..",

It feels a bit scary on my own now, but i guess that is a normal feeling? Forgotten how life was before this disease, what did i do? What did i think before? Feels like cancer is the only thing that occupied my mind this days. Anyway, must try to do the best. TammytrustGod and I started at the same time with treatment, and we also have the same diagnosis, so would be nice to hear from you tammy. Lisa: Great news to hear that you are almost 3 years out. Hoping to get there",
