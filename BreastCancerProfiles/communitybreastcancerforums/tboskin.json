Hey, I got through the procedure, turned out that the radiologist decided that biopsying the one side with atypical clusters would be sufficient so that was good news. And honestly, it wasn't as bad as I had expected it would be. So good luck to you and don't worry too much about the procedure itself. Breathe and relax your muscles. It really helps. I'll be thinking of you on the 14th. Best of luck to you! T ",

I don't have any answers to your questions but felt that we are in the same boat. Kind of scary and I wonder about all of this major, major anxiety that I have had for several weeks for something that will most likely be benign! I typically have a very low resting heart rate and nice low blood pressure but every time my vitals are taken, they are sky high. We are not alone, I know. And I know that there is excellent care out there. Best to you (and me). T ",
