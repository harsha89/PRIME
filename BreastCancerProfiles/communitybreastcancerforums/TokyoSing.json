It is not, as far as  I know, part of the usual tests your oncologist performs.  The pathologist has to send your tissue samples to Genomic Health Inc in Redwood City where they determine your recurrence score based on a panel of  21 genes in the submitted tissue.  My insurance paid for it, otherwise it costs more than $3500.  As Debbie stated, in the early days, this test was only for node negative BC cases, now they will take tissues from cases with up to 3 node involvement.  I hope this helps!",
