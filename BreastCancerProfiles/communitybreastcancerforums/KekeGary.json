I've had ultra sounds which showed a lump and they did biopsy it.. it was nothing which is gone now apparently. I've had a mammogram which didn't see anything cuz my breast tissue is to thick, than I had 2 mri within 6 months of eachother which did show that one has shrunk and the other enlarged. I've had hormone tests its not hormones, my breast has no lumps.. pure liquid apparently. It has gone back to normal once! In 2 years which leads my doctor to believe it is not typical breast cancer as cancer doesnt shrink. I also have excruciating inner thigh pain from groin to knee so bad I cant take it much longer. My doctors are all at loss they have all said they've never seen anything like it. The only think they all keep saying is lymphoma, even my breast doctor was thinking that maybe, but its yet to be found. Please has anyone else got similar issues? Log in to post a reply",
