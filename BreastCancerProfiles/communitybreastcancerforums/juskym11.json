It's just a very depressing thing to think of having practically no hair for the rest of my life.",

In answer to your questions:  1. Whether you were premenopausal, peri-menopausal or menopausal. Post-menopausal 2. Your age at time of treatment. 53 3. Whether your hair was thinning, thick or in the process of thinning naturally. My hair was in the process of thinning naturally, but no where near what is now. 4. How much grew back after treatment. I would say about half of my hair grew back after treatment. Unfortunately, I am also prescribed Letrozole for the next 10 years, and I've read that about 5% of Letrozole users also suffer from permanent hair loss. I hope this info helps you in making your decision.  Or, if you've already made the decision, possible reconsidering if you chose Taxotere.  ",
