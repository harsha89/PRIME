I know it's early and I'm jumping to conclusions, but to be called back first for a second mammogram, now the ultrasound, is daunting and I keep crying.  I have supportive friends and boyfriend, but still pretty scared.  The radiologist didn't seem optimistic when she told me I needed the ultrasound, which also adds to my overactive imagination.  Just posting to let things out a little I guess....
