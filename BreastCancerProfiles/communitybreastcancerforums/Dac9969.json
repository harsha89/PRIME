I too had excruciating pain just by touching my breast. I do feel a lot better right now. There is still a little bit of pain. Tomorrow is my last day of the antibiotics. Crossing my fingers. Thanks so much again Deb",

      "Content": "Dac9969 wrote: I'm so sorry if this is a long post. I just wanted to explain the situation. I started my radiation 2 weeks ago. After my treatment I felt pain in my breast. The technician told me if I had an infection the radiation usually will worsen it. By the third treatment I was in agony. I thought to myself I've got 3 more weeks of this how am I going to get through. After making phone calls and and being seen by an on call Dr they pretty much dismissed me. I went in for my fourth treatment and there was a new tech,thank God for her, she looked at me and said you're a little pink you shouldn't be pink!! it's too soon for your skin to change. She sent me in to see the on call Doctor Who I previously saw. He sent me to my surgeon. Unfortunately my surgeon was not available so I saw the nurse. Nobody wanted to prescribe me antibiotic, NOBODY!! She was hesitant but she prescribed me 5 days worth of amoxicillin. She also ordered a ultrasound. The ultrasound confirmed what was thought to be fluid in a pocket in the breast .So I went in for a drain which was unsuccessful the liquid was not liquid it was too thick to extract.(JUST GREAT) the following day I went in for radiation and thank God my doctor was back. They pulled me in to see her and sure enough she confirmed I had an infection in my left breast. That gave me a week off of radiation. I feel so much better there is still a little bit of pain. However, I start my radiation up again on Monday I am so scared that this infection might not be a hundred percent cleared up and I'm going to go through this all over again. The doctor told me that once we start this again there's no stopping it. I guess my question is has anybody experienced a breast infection while going through radiation??? How did it turn out? The pain was really excruciating. I'm pretty tough and that was bad. Thanks so much Log in to post a reply",
