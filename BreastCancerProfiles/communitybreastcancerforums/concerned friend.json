My girlfriend has a lump in her left breast, she has seen the doctor about this lump and hase said its not cancerous but they dont know what it is. My girlfriend is 19 and rather large chested, shes actually going for a breast reduction next year ( to my dismay!!!) Iv been reading online about breast lymph nodes, which is something the doctor did mention to her, from what iv read if the lump on her lymph gets over 2cm then theres something to worry about. When my girlfriend actually went for her checkup it was bigger than 2cm. Its getting bigger, and shes in quite alot of pain with it, to the point where she cant touch her breast, her nipple or even bare wearing her bra. Â Her family have had a history of breast cancer, so for me, im worried as her doctors have advised against removing this lump. Any information would be great, thank you. Log in to post a reply",
