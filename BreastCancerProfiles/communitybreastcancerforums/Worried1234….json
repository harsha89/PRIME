I didn't know if my worries seemed baseless and soon after I posted, I deleted. I instantly regretted it. Second, thank you for the wonderful advice! I will start keeping a photo log of the indentation with dates. As a natural worrier, I think I will start off once a week and continue from then. Hopefully everything stays the same! Thank you again, Worried1234  ",
