Its not all the way in yet, but it looks like there is a hole in the middle of my nipple. Sometimes it comes out when its cold or stimulated, but lately it hasnt come out like it used to. I just noticed this 2 months ago and went to my Gyno, plastic surgeon, regular doctor, and a breast specialist all who said I didnt have breast cancer. I was not tested or anything. They just felt around. No lumps. Everyone keeps saying breast cancer doesnt usually hurt. I dont know if this is the cause of my implant I have saline over the muscle for over a year and this has just started now. I have had a little bit of pain and burning. Im going back to the specialist tomorrow morning, but if she says the same thing and I dont see an improvemnt then what can I do? Where do I go? Thank you for your time.Â  Log in to post a reply",

Also they think since I have my breast incision in the aerola it could be that too. Possiably damaged tissue or the tissue moving around. My cousin is an ultrasound tech and she looked at me and said that there was nothing, but to go to a different doctor. So I will have been to my plastic surgeon, my family doctor, my Gyno, and the breast specialist twice! I am going again to my family doctor because he wants to see me again for a check up. My family doctor said he didnt want to give me a mamo because it would prolly pop my implant and he doesnt think I need it, but I know if I cry again to him and say I want it he will let me have it. Im also scared because I hear that since I have the implant over the muscle the mamo has a harder time seeing certian places so what would be the point? I rather have like a tissue biopsy with another scar on my boob than a inflated implant from a mamo that could have missed something! Any advice on what would be best? Can a blood test detect if somethings wrong? By the way thank you for your answers so far!",
