    "Content": "DMW wrote: Hi all, this is my first post...last year I had 5 bouts of mastitis (I've just turned 50). My mammogram and ultrasound showed many cysts on both breasts but my right breast has been particularly sore! My GP sent me to the breast clinic and I was told not to worry about it as the biopsy did not show up anything sinister. I then went back to my GP to get another round of antibiotics as mastitis was back. She sent me off again not happy with the first diagnosis and me having to go on antibiotics each time I get mastitis. I ended up having a central duct excision last November...diagnosis inflammation of ducts. Biopsy was all clear ðŸ˜Š After 7 months of no further problems I have started to get pain in my right breast again! Back to my GP who put me on antibiotics again. She doesn't want me to go for another mammogram while I am so sore so she drew a diagram of the lumps she could feel and when I go back next week she will check again. She is concerned about the thickening in a number of different areas on my right breast...left breast is not painful at all. Cysts are very painful and I have had a few drained last year when I went to the breast clinic. I am waiting to see what the next step is. I have found going off caffeine does help. I thought after the central duct incision my troubles were done! Log in to post a reply",
