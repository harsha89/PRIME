    "Content": "Jul 28, 2010 04:23PM - edited Jul 28, 2010 04:25PM by halfchesty My reply isn't really about what anybody did for me, but what I did for myself to mark the personal triumph.  On my final round of chemo, the receptionist at the check-in counter noticed it was my last treatment and joked that I should be doing cartwheels. Four plus hours later, I finally finished the last of my T (following four rounds of AC and numerous delays because of ridiculously low white counts, stretching a 4-month dose dense regiment into a 6 month endurance feat).  On the way out, instead of stopping to make another appointment, I kicked off my shoes and called for the receptionist's attention. I said, 'this is for you' and proceeded to do a row of cartwheels down the hallway.  A few of the nurses watched, too, as the waiting room broke into applause. I put my shoes back on, and headed off to the pharmacy to have my final neupogen prescription filled.  I was a little dizzy and queasy - but it was one of my proudest moments. I began the journey with a 'Thanks for the Mammaries Farewell Tour' and ended it with a true Cirque de Soliel salute.  I'm not sure there was anything anyone could have done to make me feel better than knowing that I had finished treatment and done it my way. I'm sure your sister knows and appreciates everything you've done for her - an extra high five is probably enough.  Or maybe a gift certificate for a spa treatment when she's feeling a bit better? ",
