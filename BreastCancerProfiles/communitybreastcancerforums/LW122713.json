I had no idea what a cold cap was and it sounds like it could be fantastic but would take quite a bit of planning and work. I will have to check out other posts to see if anyone else has had luck with it and how they were able to able to work it into their routine. At this point just getting in the car and driving to the first chemo treatment will be a major accomplishment.",

Seriously...I had cancer but am more freaked out about loosing the hair and what other side effects there may be. I feel too like it shouldn't be as important to me as it is but can't help it. I know that I will be so depressed but reading these posts does make me feel better just knowing I'm not alone. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts and bits of wisdom. I've been wig shopping online, just checking out options. I'm hoping I can pull one off. What do you do about eyebrows and lashes? Does anyone draw them on or do they even offer fake brows? Just curious as I hadn't taken those into consideration until now but should have.",
