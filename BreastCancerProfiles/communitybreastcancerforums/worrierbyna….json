I am 46, and through a routine mammogram January 3rd, needed before surgery to replace my implants (had them for years..it's time for an upgrade! LOL), I was told I needed a 2nd mammogram.  That mammogram on January 10th showed micro calcifications in my right breast. At that time they suggested a stereotactic core needle biopsy, but stated that they might not be able to do it due to the location/closeness of the calcifications to the implant.  I was scheduled for the biopsy on January 29th, and sure enough, the attempt was not successful.  I was referred to a breast surgeon with an appointment on February 18th, and at that appointment was told that I would need to have a wire localization excisional biopsy.  That is now scheduled for March 10th.  It has taken so long to get to this point, but, I am hopeful that all of this will result in a benign finding.  I am happy to read that you have finally had your biopsy and are just awaiting your results.  I will be thinking of you.",
