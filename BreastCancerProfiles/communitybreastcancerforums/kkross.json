Hen later states about the \"extremely dense\" breast tissue. And basically says the findings could be crap due to the breast tissue being dense? I called my PCP who sent me for the mammo, still waiting to hear back. I know everything is ok. BC does not run in my family, nor do I have aNy other risk factors other than the dense tissue. Maybe that's why she hasn't called me back? I wonder...how many cases are NOW found that otherwise would to have been found due to falsely reading mammos with dense tissue?",
