I guess I will visit two hospitals (MD Anderson & NYP), then I might pay Dr. Maylin a visit at his clinic for a third opinion. Afterwards my wife and I will decide on best course of treatment. Hi Momine, Thanks for the info about the hospital. Also I appreciate reminding about the language barrier. I did speak with Dr. Maylin today, his English is not bad, but it takes for both of us to understand each other though. We don't have any American hospital in Riyadh, but we do have one in Dubai. The issue in Saudi is not the quality of equipment, we do have state-of-art radiology and laboratory equipment, it's the quality of treatment. There just isn't enough doctors per capita, so hospitals are overcrowded. Patient don't get enough attention. Regards, Abdul",

According to her doctor, she is at stage 1 (cancer is 1.8 cm x 2cm). The current recommendation is that she goes for surgery and chemo. But I honestly have my doubts on the current condition of local healthcare system.  @Momine, As mentioned, I'm from Saudi, USA would be my first choice. @dkb823 Thanks for the conprehensive list. I was thinking about either Mayo Clinic or John Hopkins, I'm leaning towards the later. @Patriotic Very much appreciated. I will contact MD Anderson Texas to see how I can get a second opinion. @Shirlann Thank you so much. It really helps to see survivors like yourself that I can show to my wife to relax her. She is extremely worried. Your advice about a second opinion is very valuable. Will for sure do it. @hale0811 Thanks for the valuble advice. Thanks again everyone, I really appreciate all of your support. I showed all of your replies to my wife and she really felt better knowing that this is not something that will mean the end to her. So far, she did the following: * Ultrasound * Mammogram * Ultrasound-guided biopsy (results are IDC) * CT-scan with contrast abdomen (normal fortunately) * tomorrow will do CT-scan with contrast chest  I do have soft copies of all medical reports and x-rays  Regards, Abdul  ",

He mentioned that he has pionered some new ways to treat breast cancer.  I found a video of him on the web. http://breastcancertreatmentandcures.com/pr-claude-maylin-la-radiotherapie/  I don't understand French so I'm not sure what's in there.  Regards, Abdul",

I will be in NY next week for an appointment at NYP for possible surgery within the next few days. Afterwards I think will get back to home to continue chemotheryapy.  @carcharm, thanks for pointing this out. I believe we have decided on the surgery to be either in NYP or MD Anderson then continue the chemotherapy back home (either Riyadh or Abu Dhabi). @Laura5, thanks a lot, the choice for sugery will be between NY Presberian and Houston MD Anderson. My wife doesn't like NY (the city) and prefer Houston, we have an appointment at NYP on the 11th and MD Anderson on the 16th. We are planning a surgery at one of them max by Apr 25th. Thanks again to everyone, really appreciate your input.  Abdul",
