    "Content": "Mystomae wrote: I found 2 lumps in my right breast . I had a mamo 4 months ago and they were not there then. My Gyno sent me for a diagnostic. They did a Mamo and an ultrasound saying that ( as usual ) I have extremely dense breasts and that lymph nodes were seen in both axillary regions . Does a BI Rads 3 seem right? I am currently undergoing investigation of a mass on my ovaries as well. The same radiologist initially said it was a swollen fallopian tube.( he was wrong) I am scared and am unsure of what to do, Is six months to long to wait Log in to post a reply",
