      "Content": "Jul 28, 2011 10:21PM - edited Jul 28, 2011 10:21PM by TML I found out on 14Jul that I have BC.  Thought I could have a lumpectomy, just found out yesterday that I need a MX.  Scheduled for 15Aug.  But I have some concerns.  I am not happy with my surgeon and I am at a loss as to what to do.  In the past week, I have met my BS, Oncologist, Radiation Oncologist and all, with the exception of the BS have been incredible.  I have had 3 ultrasounds, 2 biopsies, 1 MRI.  I have NO idea what to do about reconstruction.  My personal PS told me to wait, that I could do something after the cancer was treated.  He also suggested I get a genetic test ?? to determine if I am predisposed to breast cancer and then have both removed.  I thought I was just going to throw up.  I contacted my oncologist today to ask him to refer me to another surgeon and to find out how to do the genetic testing and his office staff informed me that my appt was scheduled for AFTER surgery.  I told her I wanted to see him prior to surgery, that I had some very important questions and she said that my appt was AFTER surgery.  I asked her if she understood that I had questions and she said she would 'discuss this with him' and call me back...which she never did.  What am I missing here???",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2011 05:57AM - edited Aug 12, 2011 06:05AM by TML STCC....I, too, had the same issue.  I found out from my BS while he was doing an ultrasound to determine if my lymph nodes were troublesome that I needed to go from a lumpectomy to a UMX.  I was stunned.  No explanation, just u need a mastectomy. I left the office reeling and had nowhere to turn.  I found a breast cancer coordinator through Sharp Hospital who walked me through it and told me that, without question, do not have surgery until I was sure of what I wanted.  I did not know if I should have both removed.  It took me 2 weeks, but I scheduled an appt with a PS, had a group meeting with the pathologist who went over EVERYTHING and even scheduled a 2nd opinion with another BS which i ultimately canceled.  I wanted to decide if I should have 1 or both removed.  I also talked with a geneticist to see if I should get BRCA testing which determines if I am pre-disposed to cancer.   My BS' office was livid that I canceled my August 15 surgery, but I told them that I wanted to completely understand what was going on with me and what was the BEST solution for MY issues. After the meeting with the Pathologist, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  The meeting I had with the PS also helped me with my decision to remove both. I am a DDD cup, so for any reconstruction to match the other would be a nightmare.  Much easier to start at the beginning and work UP.  I just turned 50.  I have IDC, ER+/PR+ , HER/neu -.  My cancer is in my left breast only and it is 2.5 cm.   Hope that helps...   Oh ...  and I am also having tissue expanders.  I do not believe you need to 'worry' about the time it takes for 1 surgeon vs another.  They will take care of that for you.  Think positive.  ",

What I think has helped me a lot is knowing how 'not' unique I am - which is insane.   Update:  I am moving my surgery date.  Do not have a new one yet.  Found out that I tested positive for the Estrogen/Progesterone, so that is a plus.   I am leaning towards a double MX since I am a DDD cup, even though I have cancer in only 1 breast.  I have spoken with a geneticist and after providing her all the information I could without actually doing it formally, she believes I have a less than 5% chance of being positive, which means that the likelihood of me getter cancer in my other breast is slim.   I am meeting with plastic surgeon to get his opinion on what I should do regarding the surgery (1 or 2) and afterward create a plan.  Considering my size, I think it would be difficult to 'match' rather than 'replace'.   Anyone else have this issue?  What did you do?  I also have decided to get a 2nd opinion, although I am fairly confident in the surgeon that I am scheduled with.  I just would rather not have any \"I should have done's\" in my history.  Will update surgery date as soon as I know. ",
