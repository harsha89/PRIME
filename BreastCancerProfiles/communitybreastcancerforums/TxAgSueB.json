I hope this helps!!! BTHO BC!!! Sue ",

I am praying for minimal side effects!  I plan to work as much as possible ( 3 kids in college and a wedding next summer!) but can take off when needed. 2 questions:   1.  Has anyone read/used \"The cancer fighting kitchen\" by Rebecca Katz? 2.  Vitamin D - I am reading more and more about Vitamin D levels and how sufficient levels help fight off cancer.  My Vitamin D level was tested in March and was low (15).  Normal levels are 40--60.  Anyone else know if you are low Vitamin D? I am praying for the best possible outcomes for all of my sisters starting chemo in July.  I plan to BTHO BC (Beat the Hell Outa Breast Cancer) and I expect you all to do the same!!! BTHO BC!! Sue",
