She is having a really hard time finding a compression bra that fits her well.  She is also having a really hard time finding any information on lymphedema in the breast.  Has anyone here had this.  She seems to be in the early stages - she has read that it can be reversable in the early stages. has anyone had any experience with this. I would appreciate any suggestions, insight or guidance you ladies can give us.  she is feeling so discouraged right now and I am trying my best to help her thru all of this.
