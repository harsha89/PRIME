Would rather see him before but he was completely busy until then :( Thanks a lot for your help",

What I mean is that if there was absolutely no chance, I would have been diagnosed with birad 1 or 2, that in fact is what I expected from my doctor. I know there's a high chance its nothing (hopefully), but as I'm sure you understand, I'm very worried Thanks for your comments",

He said it was probably nothing, as I'm 35 and no history of BC, but sent me to get an ultrasound just in case. I just got the results and it says : right breast small hypo echoic solid nodule identified superomedial aspect of right breast 2 o clock axis measuring 6mm suggesting being etiology. A lobulated relatively well circumscribed solid mass identified lateral aspect of right breast 9 o click axis measuring 1.4x0.6x1.0 cm left breast lobulated well circumscribed solid mass medial aspect of right breast 9 o clock asis measuring 1,3 cm. Birads III: short interval followup suggested. The doctor sent me to see an oncologist surgery to decide what to do. I know it doesn't look very bad, but after reading so many stories I can't help feeling nervous. Only symptoms I have been really tired lately and a weird pain (like burning) in my underarm every now and then. Impressions and opinions? thanks so much in advance for your help!
