The skin feels like road burn being rubbed by sand paper. Does it go away? ever? having a really difficult time. I have Percocet, but really don't want to be drugged all day long. Lighter stuff doesn't help. When did it get better? thanks, and much love and respect for all of you, Eve",

So Nipple sparing, implant sparing :) BMX. Thank you for the wonderful, generous answers. peace and good healing (body and spirit) Eve",
