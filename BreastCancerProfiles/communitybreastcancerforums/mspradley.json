Believe me, none of us have forgotten the freefall you are tumbling in, and we are here for you. All of my physicians and surgeons are in Charlotte and I was fortunate to have many friends helping me research the best fit for my diagnosis. I will be happy to share any information with you.",

I am sorry that I don't have time to read the thread all of the way through to see if this has been covered. My Paget's disease did not show up on the mammogram, it was found in the pathology following my initial mastectomy. However, my surgeon said that Paget's breasts almost always have either DCIS or IDC as well. Before you go nuts, remember that Paget's is extremely rare and for what it's worth, mine never itched at all. I would have your GYN check this.",

I only have one drain left, in my hip that is still producing about 75-80cc of fluid daily, so it won't be coming out soon. All of my other drains, (3 others with DIEP, and two with prior mtx), would eventually produce the \"straw colored\" fluid with an occasional piece of stringy tissue included. I am alarmed because this remaining drain is producing a thicker yellowish, fibrous liquid, that builds up in the bulb what looks like Crisco/lard! My ps is not concerned, but I can't seem to find anything like this in my keyword searches. Any advice?

She said that the abdominal drains will have a different kind of drainage than the breast drains, and when you get a liitle dehydrated this yellowish (not straw colored) thick drainage can occur. I upped my water intake and my drain looks normal. I just wish it would subside so that it can be removed!",
