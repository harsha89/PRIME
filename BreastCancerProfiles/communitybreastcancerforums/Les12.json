      "Content": "Les12 wrote: I started having breast pain about a month ago, I was concerned at first because of family history of BC but dismissed it after I read that \"cancer is usually not painful\". Last week my pain started getting worse, especially my right breast so I did a self exam and felt a lump on my right breast, i called my doctor and made an appointment for the next day, my doctor performed the exam herself and felt the lump as well so she sent an ultrasound (said she didn't recomend a mamogram because of my age, 26) the ultrasound place hasn't call me for the appointment yet but my doctor did warm me that because of the long weekend to give them until this Wednesday. I'm very worry because I'm still in pain and today I felt another lump on my left breast. I have never experienced breast pain before, not even during my period so I'm very concern especially because of the lumps and family history. I'm driving myself crazy reading and looking for information. I feel that if it is cancer I need to be prepared and have all the information. any advice is highly appreciated Log in to post a reply",

The reason I'm so anxious is because both my grandmother and aunt currently have breast cancer and both are HER2 positive. I'm trying to keep myself busy but it's hard not to know what's going on",

The tech performed the ultrasound in both breasts and took some pictures, then she told me to wait a few minutes because she was going to show the pictures. Came back 10 min later and told me to get dress and meet her in the hallway. When I went outside she just told me to follow up with my doctor and that I was done. I tried calling my doctor but no one answered so i have to wait until tomorrow to speak to her. While she was doing the ultrasound she kept going over the area where I usually get stabbing pains so I got a little bit worried. I'm not sure ifthe fact that she didn't say anything, just to follow up with my doctor is good or bad.",
