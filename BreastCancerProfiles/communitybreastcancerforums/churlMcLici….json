She tried to soften the blow by telling me that it was because someone was almost always home (I homeschool my son and my mom lives with us)--but I think it may just be because we are messing. Entry Two: As I said above, my mom lives with us. She is 84 and very active. She insists on doing all the laundry and dishes and she cooks almost every night. I let her. ",
