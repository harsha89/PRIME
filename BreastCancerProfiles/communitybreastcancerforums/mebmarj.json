You didn't mention your age but this is your first mammogram. So in essence there is nothing to compare this one to, right? The extra views may be for a baseline for you since there is some family history. Also, the younger you are- the more dense breast tissue is and extra views are kind of good thing, it means they're looking and taking time with your films. Even though there is some family history there, not everyone has the genes. They still don't know for sure how some of us get it and others don't. Definitely take charge and get the follow up done for your piece of mind. You'll have answers soon. Take care and best wishes to you.",

So often the media takes a celebrity story and runs with it, spinning it, cutting out details here and there, scaring people and throwing little factoids around that can have devastating effects on the person and our society in general. By getting in front of the release of information, AJ not only took control of her situation again but also the public perception of it. It wasnt leaked or twisted, it was just the facts as they occurred to her. Some people may not agree with her rationale, her surgery, her words used in the piece, the fact that she can afford whatever care she needs or wants, had recon and didn't reveal the horrors of what can possibly happen because they didn't happen to her, whatever. You can't please everyone all the time. Its impossible. There will always be criticisms, opinions, and discussion of celebrity health news. The fact that she could get in front of a diagnosis and possibly avoid one, that probably pisses off a lot of people who didn't or couldn't, and didn't have risk factors other than having boobs. Life isn't fair. Cancer sucks. Pink ribbons suck too because they have been bastardized and now give so many people the wrong impression. It's good she has been able to ignite a fire in people who are passionate and start some discussion for others who need to be more informed. You have to admit, the piece has people talking, asking questions and encourages us to be better self-health advocates.",

That sucks, it's frightening and any one of us that could do what she did probably would have jumped at the chance to avoid the road we were forced to travel. AJ- If you are with us here on BCO, sorry for your loss, glad you have support and thank you for your willingness to share. As to the tiny scars remark some people have taken offense to- who wouldn't try to minimize the impact on their children? How many of us have glossed over the gory surgical or treatment details in mixed company? How many of us don't want to talk about breast cancer all the time? When she is ready, I'm sure she'll say or do more. No one of us is perfect, it's easy to be critical and pass judgement, but how often have we all bitched about people's comments and stupidity in the face of our personal challenges related to breast cancer? Cut the woman some slack. Good luck to you AJ.",

Counseling, medications and support groups are available too.  Please use caution when thinking about a prophy mast. It is major surgery to reduce risk, alters your physical appearance, self image, as well as mobility.  Reconstruction is a complex process.  If you are really serious, talk to several surgeons about the entire process before you commit.   Best of luck to you.

It's pretty sarcastic and not at serious, but good for the funny bone. It's called \"OMG they found the cure for stupid.\" People generally intend to help, but don't really have a clue what we go through.with treatment. mlabroli- Sorry to hear about you too. This is my second time with BC. First time I was 32 and the kids were 4/9 yrs old. Had lumpectomy, chemotherapy and rads back then. Did everything right. This one popped up after 7 years of follow up. Kids are now 11/16 yrs old. It was hard the first time but the hair grows back and not everyone has recurrence or a new primary tumor happen. First time I was ER- and this time I'm ER+. I'm 7 wks post mastectomy with prophylactic mast on the good side. Had toyed with idea of a hyst due for a while(painful periods), well the PET scan helped suggest to get it done. I am now 3 weeks post hyst with ovary removal. Both of you can do this. You'll find you are capable of many things, especially when it comes to saving your life and making plans to live it fully in the future. Work of one kind or another will always be there. It's most important to care for yourselves today. May sound a bit selfish, but you can't do squat to help others if you don't care for yourself first. Remember you CAN accomplish anything you set your mind to doing. Wishing you both well with your coming decisions and treatments. -m",

Like someone said previous, the neulasta is one shot that lasts longer. They used to have a commercial that stated to expect mild to moderate bone pain. It was more then moderate for me. Did this stuff seven years ago. The whole idea behind the two shots is to encourage your long/major bone marrow areas to kick it up and improve your white counts. That's where the bone pain comes in the femur, hip carriage, spine and sternum. The chemo attacks fast growing cells, the blood cells are fast along with the hair follicles and the GI tract. As far as constipation, prune juice with a splash of lemon or try eating some raisin bran. Wishing you all well, -m",

All any of us can do is process the info we have at the time, listen to what options the dr offers and go with the one that is right for you.

In my first round a few years back, they weren't sure what my counts would do. When I had blood work about a week to ten days after, sure enough I was way low. That got me the neupogen shots for a few days in a row. After that they decided to prevent the low counts and gave the neulasta day after chemo. Hope I clarified that, sorry for the confusion. Yep, the procrit reaction is similar. More pain in my femurs with that one, whereas the neupogen and neulasta were all over bone pain. I think chemo is the way to go. It sucks, but there are so many other factors to consider. Wanting to zap any stray cells, that's the way to go. Best wishes everyone.",
