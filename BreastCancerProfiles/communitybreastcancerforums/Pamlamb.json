Scared? Yes. I dread the fact that tocix chemicals will be pushed into my body. Feeling overwhelmed with all the new information I need to process and all the appointments I have comming up. I'm a terrible organizer of schedules and dates. I don't want to deal with any of this at all and wish I could just run and hide away somewhere. During my chemo treatments I will be getting an Cyclophosphamide injection and then Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) drip. Then I come back for a Neulasta injection the following day. I hope I've got this right. I will have four rounds of this once every three weeks. Then I will be changing to a different regiment which I can't remember exactly right now. They told me this first initial treatment will be the strongest and from which I am most likely to have the worst and most side effects. But they keep telling me it's different for everyone and they just can't predict how one will react. So glad to be here to share with you ladies and wishing everyone good luck.",

I have a swelling and weakness in my left arm which is the same side as the port. They put me on blood thinners, Warfarin, and Enoxaparin which I have to infect myself with once a day for seven days. So because they found the blood clot they we unable to give me my 1st chemo but I will be having it next Monday. The chemo goes in the other direction than the blood clot thank goodness or they wouldn't be able to give it to me. My doctor told me if this blood clot were to break loose it will go straight to my brain. OhHeyItsDeeDee- Corgrats on getting through your first round! Jezikah - It's certainly normal for us to be anxious about all we are going through but counseling can help. For me personally, I have friends that I talk with and I have a very strong close relationship with Jesus Christ. So those two help me \"keep my chin up\" as they say. Especially since I just lost hubby 8 months ago and have no children, and no family close to me. bareclaws - Congrats on completing your first chemo and thanksfor giving us the report on how it went and you are feeling.",

It looks to be healing up OK. Somewhat painful if I move it by moving my shoulder. The only weird thing I'm having is the ligaments or tendons from my collarbone up through under my chin are very sore. Also the back of my neck and tops of shoulders same thing. It's as if I have strained the whole area. Had to take a pain pill last night. I've put a call into my surgeon about it. Starting the chemo tomorrow. Kinda scared and nervous. I hate that I have to put this poison in my body. My niece wrote to me in an email \"It will change you physically.\" Her mom had chemo. But I wish she hadn't said that. Not at all helpful or supportive. It's upset me. I sleep a lot. Struggling with this cancer and the loss of my husband 8 months ago. Sorry for being so negative here. Thinking of you my sisters with loving kindness and hope for bright days ahead for all of u. Pam ",

      "Content": "Dec 3, 2016 11:44PM - edited Dec 4, 2016 01:11AM by Pamlamb A few days after I had my port installed I began to have terrible pain circling my neck shoulders chest and back. I ended up going to the emergency room because the muscle ligament, whatever it was, pain was so severe. I was in agony! It kept me awake the entire night. I waited until 5 AM to call a friend to take me to emergency. They did X-rays, said everything looks good, gave me a shot in the hip , talked to my surgeon, gave me some pills and sent me home. We were there for hours and hours and as the time went by with the shot the pain began to reside. I tell you going through what I did that night before was a little bit of hell. I still have soreness left. It is not all gone. Thank you NextStorm for sharing your soreness and pain with me lol. ðŸ’Ÿ",
