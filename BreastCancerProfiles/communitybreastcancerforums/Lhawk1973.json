There aren't many options due to insurance restrictions and intense work and family schedules (6am 'til 7pm daily). The other places are very far away and my doc said 2wks wouldn't make a difference...I'm hoping that's true. I can't tell if the lump is moveable or not because my skin moves and I'm not sure if the lump is moveable also...are there any tricks to figuring this out? It feels smooth to me but I'm not sure exactly what I am looking for. Thanks again...it's nice to be able to ask questions and interact with people ",

      "Content": "Lhawk1973 wrote: So, as I said, just found(5/25/2016) a relatively large lump right under my right areola at the 2-3 position. My left breast has been occasionally leaking (incorrect term as it is NOT fluid) thick, cheese like, white substance for three years. I am 42yrs old, one living child 4yrs old (1 miscarriage and 1 stillbirth otherwise) with Hashimoto's disease. I am overweight but active and also have had a recent onset of multiple lipomas with no known cause. My doctor can't perform mammogram and ultrasound for 2 weeks, I have an appointment but am kind of freaking out. Family history has a lot of cancer but no breast cancer. I did breastfeed my daughter for 4 months but then dried up out of nowhere. Sorry for so much info, but thought I should include everything. I would appreciate any responses, thanks.
