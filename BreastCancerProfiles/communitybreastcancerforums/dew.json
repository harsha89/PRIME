Once I have a test and treatment plan I think I will be alot calmer, right now my mind is trying to process all the possible scenarios... invasive or non-invasive, learning that cancer can recur even after bilateral mastectomies, thinking about how my family physician didn't make sense when she told me that her reading of the path report said non-invasive but when I asked her for the DCIS grade she said \"different for different cores, some 1a and 2b\"... (or 1b and 2a not sure) and as I now understand it these grades are reserved for invasive cancer. Sigh. Oh well, it is what it is, but I will feel alot better when things start to make sense... lol! New2bc, absolutely, from the get-go of this recent diagnosis with such widespread calcifications I decided mastectomy. And my family physician agrees, though she said to expect to have a few more diagnostic tests first, and that these will provide more information for the subsequent surgery and treatment plan. I want to be strong and have started planning for some long over-due self-care measures, something as simple as daily walks for fresh air (used to tell myself I have too much to do, who has time!) and going to book a hot rock massage (it's been years! and I really do carry all my stresses in my shoulders and upper back). If it's one thing this experience does for us, and I say that with great hesitation, but it turns us back around to give ourselves some much needed loving attention, wish that it didn't take something as horrific as BC to finally get our attention. However we will have peace with what it is and warrior on at the same time! Beachbum, I know right? How can I blame this on so many things that I enjoy, I wouldn't change a thing honestly... I will, and forever will, enjoy chocolate from time to time... a nice glass of shiraz after a particularly unforgiving day... and milk? ...sometimes I drink so much milk my husband calls me a nursing calf. I might actually cut back on milk though, from what I understand commercial milk is loaded with hormones so who knows. If anything can be blamed or seen as contributing to BC it probably is the stress in our lives which eventually wears us down. We can try to balance our lives and control our stress but ultimately alot of where stress comes from is outside of our control and it just seems to be an accepted part of life. I guess how we react to the stress is key, and maybe when we get a diagnosis like BC we will finally learn once and for all to not give a hoot about the small stuff! I felt like that for a long while after my first diagnosis and then life caught up to me again. Let's see how I do this time! Ariom, thank you for your story. You chose to have a single mastectomy instead of bilateral for the same reason I did after my first diagnosis. But I will tell you, one of the Onc nurses said to me \"why not have a bilateral, what do we need them for now anyway?\" Holy cats I was taken aback. At that time I was 48 yrs old and there was nothing wrong with my left breast. My right breast had DCIS Stage 0 Grade 2 confined to 5cm and my BS told me an acceptable option would be to avoid the single mastectomy if I wanted and just have radiation because of unclear anterior margins after the lumpectomy. I quite liked my breasts and it was hard to part with one but it was absolutely the right decision for me. The problems I continue to have with my single mastectomy and no-recon relate not only to emotional issues but also to post-op issues. I believe if I would once-and-for-all address these physical issues I might adapt better and be more emotionally ok with my new look. My BS was wonderful, but I am not entirely flat (as I had wanted) and I have a very uncomfortable dog ear under my arm. I kind of gave up on trying to look pretty underneath (no lacy bras or lingerie). I find that if I can just look even and be comfortable in my clothes that's good enough. But it's very difficult. I gained some weight and now my silicone breast form is not a match for my other breast though my husband says it is not noticeable. And the dog ear makes it impossible to be comfortable. Not sure if I have adhesions in there, it can be quite painful. As a result, when I am in the house I do not wear my breast form (which causes all-out panic when unexpected visitors call at the door) and when I am in public I get pretty uncomfortable after just a few hours of wearing my breast form in my bra. So I still have the same 2 bras that I purchased 3 years ago after my mastectomy. I'm thinking that it's time I visit the No Recon Forum to see how others have dealt with this. I know I will be talking to the breast surgeon soon and will mention the dog ear problem. In the meantime I have found a great place for buying lacy bras and new more authentic looking breast forms and it is not too far from where I live. I think I owe it to myself and my darling husband to make the investment into some new pretty breast forms and bras after my next mastectomy. If you are curious here is the website address and there is a photo of one of their breast forms on the home page www.lisaboriginals.org/ Yes we can do this thing! Looking forward to getting to know you girls better :) Donna PS. sorry to be so long-winded but it is so good to be finally able to relate to women who understand!!",

Glad to say that I am starting to get past the blaming, hoping it's a passing phase of the initial grief, but I think I will be processing this new diagnosis for a while. I feel more like a warrior today and getting armed for whatever comes at me this week when I finally get \"the\" phone call. Then more tests booked. Then waiting for those results. Bren58 wow I just happened to mention in my last post that I had learned of recurrences after bilateral mastectomies, I was thinking I would be \"done\" once both breasts were gone but I see that is not the case, I hope you are doing well? Both you girls look so amazingly happy in your avatars, like Ariom too, and that gives me so much hope!! I know there will be up and down days. Think I will enjoy this good one even better now! Thanks for your caring and will keep you updated :) Dona",

Oh boy I so want that, what beautiful work. If you can believe it my Dog Ear is even bigger and I think it is because my BS had the drain exiting my skin right under my arm for some reason. Not at all near where your drain was, and as a result I believe I may have some leftover fluid build-up or scar tissue in my Dog Ear. Will definitely talk to this next BS about having the Dog Ear removed, speaking of surgery... Core Biopsy Test Results and Recommendations: I couldn't wait any longer for my call back from the Breast Clinic... knowing I have DCIS, and already it has been 2 weeks since the Core Biopsy, I was desperate to find out why it was taking so long to come up with a treatment plan. So I called first thing this morning and lucked into having one of the nurse navigators answer my call. She went right to work and clarified that I indeed had DCIS Stage 0 Grade 2 (4-6cm). The specialist team had apparently reviewed my case on Friday but my BS is now away for a week. Great. The nurse navigator called me back after speaking to another BS in the same practice and got permission to tell me the treatment recommendation. Short and sweet - Mastectomy and Sentinel Node Biopsy at the same time. So no other diagnostics required before surgery. I have an appointment with the returning surgeon on March 17th and will have all my questions ready. And I'm guessing from there I will wait for the call to tell me the OR booking date and time, and get Pre-op instructions and tests. The nurse told me that right now surgeries are booking the end of March so I am guessing that I will be on the table some time after Easter. Wow, even though it sounds like I have a lot of time to prepare it seems like it's all happening pretty fast now! Have to get the bookwork done for our farm year-end, and get the spring cleaning done early. I know I probably sound pretty confident and in control again but when this finally sinks in I am sure that I will be singing a different tune. I kinda want to get the surgery over with and find out the SNB results asap. THEN I will start the process of coming to terms with no ta-tas... definitely this is going to be so different this time... ",

      "Content": "Donna-Dew wrote: My first DCIS diagnosis in 2011/12 sent me straight to the BS for a lumpectomy, and then a simple mastectomy of my right breast because of unclear margins. At that time I was new to DCIS and my mind was spinning with research, appointments, treatment options etc. In the end I was so very grateful that no invasive cancer was found, but I had (and am still having) a difficult time adjusting emotionally to my single mastectomy. I opted for no reconstruction and thought that I would get used to having a single breast. I thought that the loss would not affect me as much as it obviously has. Now 3 years later, I was sent for a core biopsy of my left breast because of suspicious calcifications, I get the call last week that the results are positive for DCIS. I do not have my pathology report in hand yet, but was told to expect a phone call this week for an appointment or detailed discussion of results and treatment plan. From what my family physician told me, this DCIS in my left breast is of a different character, the calcifications are more sporadic and increasing around all parts of my breast (with my first case of DCIS they were confined to a small area). From the core samples that were taken there is no sign of invasion. I was told that the different cores had different grades of DCIS and that there is concern for the other untested areas of my breast, that invasive cancer cannot be ruled out yet. Needless to say I am very anxious and waiting impatiently. Right after getting this diagnosis I confidently told my family physician that my plan would be to get another mastectomy, that I had been preparing for this day ever since I lost my first breast. I just want to be done with all the followup mammograms and fearful waiting. My husband is supportive of this decision though he knows what grief I have been experiencing since the loss of my first breast. But we must wait to hear from the specialist team at the breast clinic. Sounds like more diagnostic testing may be in order before surgery ie. MRI, CAT scan, liver ultrasound etc. Last week I was in control and confident, and now my emotions are turning into anger and sadness, and at the same time I'm feeling very guilty... maybe this wouldn't be happening if I had made more of an effort to change after my first DCIS diagnosis, I know I need to be more physically active on a regular basis, I know I could be making some better food choices, and the big one - decrease stress. I know we are not supposed to blame ourselves but I cannot help but wonder. Thank you all for listening. I'll be here and looking forward to hearing your stories!

There are standards for acceptable wait times for the range of surgeries from elective surgeries to cancer surgeries. I will know more hopefully when I meet with the BS on Tuesday. I found it interesting when she said our diagnosis is not fully known until surgery. I mean it makes sense but I didn't really think about it in those terms. Our core biopies only tell us what it going on in those cores not our entire breast. Statistically with a large amount of DCIS ie. 6cm + and with a higher grade, there is a 20% chance of the diagnosis changing to IDC. But I will walk one step at a time for now. Thanks for getting me thru \"just diagnosed\"! It means so much, and I hope to do this for newbies too once I am on the other side of surgery :))) Take care girls!",
