I had them for 22 years, but had them removed because they just weren't comfortable anymore. That was about 3 years ago. Since then my mammograms looked ok, but they mentioned a lot of scar tissue each time.In Dec.2016 I saw my PCP for a routine physical,and she found a lump in my left breast. She sent me for a biopsy,and it is IDC grade 1.She said she could barely see it on the mammogram herself because of the scar tissue. She could have had a better look,but I can't have an MRI because I have a type of pacemaker, and you can't have an MRI with any kind of metal in your body. This makes things a little more complicated.She also says both breasts have massive amounts of scar tissue.So, I have opted to have a double mastectomy.Before I found all this out, I would have probably had just a lumpectomy and radiation. I really do think I've made the right decision. At leastI hope so.I still have to see a radiation oncologist.I really, really hope I don't have to get that too. My surgeon thinks I won't.I just felt like sharing this since it sounds so different than other stories I've read. Thanks for being there.",

All I can can think of is I wish it was over. 14 more days seems like forever. I have already known about the diagnosis for 5 weeks. I wish I felt like \"cooking up a storm\" like Vargadoll,or something. I'm thinking of going to a movie tomorrow. Maybe I'll go to one on Monday too. Just to pass the time.",
