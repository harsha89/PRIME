Then I went to naturopathic doc as a friend recommended him because she said I always ate like a bird, excercised regularly and was overweight. After 2 weeks of temp taking my temp measured between 96.4 to 96.9 and was put on thyroid meds by naturopathic doc. medicine only stimulates thryroid so person can go off it eventually. when I researched breast cancer I found that another common thread to getting BC was a low thyroid!!!! I had been on natural meds for a little over a year and my temp has gone up to 97.4 to occasionally up to 98.6 and also took meds to remove toxins so that I have lost 20 lbs in 3 months and have been eating 3 healthy meals a day now (use to skip lunch lots and barely ate supper) as I know I need to feed my body to stay healthy while going through chemo; also have been walking every day at least 1/2 hour and hope to eventually get back into intense belly dancing as I use to do this 5 hours week. The frustrating thing about a lower temp is that on my day 7-10 when I get a slight fever with sore throat, I was told that they don't recognize people with low temps and only would treat me if I reached the \"magical 100.4F protocol\" even when I was hot then cold and shivering and before I was diagnosed I could be sick with the flu at even 99 F!",
