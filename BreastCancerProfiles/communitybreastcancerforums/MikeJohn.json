My oncologist was not the one who told me this latest diagnosis (he was out of the country). The doctor who told me was very negative and treated me as a statistic.  She was very negative about my life expectancy with this condition.  The next day my local oncologist wsa more positive; however, I have had a very difficult time keeping her negative words from ruining each and every day.  She spent very little time with me discussing anything with me but seemed to indicate that the progression to the liver was just devastating.  How do you keep negative comments like this from destroying your hope? How do you keep it from ruining your time with your family?  How do you ever feel normal again? I request your prayers that my MD Anderson oncologist will be more positive and hopeful about a treatment, and for my mind to get some peace from these tormenting thoughts. Any optimistic thoughts or tips that you have would be very much appreciated.  Thank you.
