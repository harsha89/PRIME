I do hope you've been able to find support, both on this board and IRL.  I've been lucky to find help and understanding in the most unexpected places.  Coworkers I barely know have sat me down and told me all about their experiences.  A friend I don't know well had a survivor friend of hers email me.  A long-lost online friend showed up on Facebook one day, just coincidentally, to post about her fourth year being cancer-free, and she has been a wonderful source of information for me.  One day, I finally decided I would go get a massage for the first time, to address the stress I was feeling, and I mentioned to the therapist the source of my stress.  She too had a friend of hers contact me.  So you just never know.  But nothing beats having someone who's been there to ask questions of.  And since everyone's experience is a little different, I've found it really helpful to get the perspectives of multiple people. Of course you're nervous about your mastectomy!  I just had a lumpectomy and still might need a mastectomy in the end, and I'm nervous, too!  I just keep telling myself that all these other women have made it through, and so can we! And BTW, I agree with BarbaraA -- you look great bald!  Hugs and continued good wishes to you!",

I couldn't eat anything after midnight the day before surgery, so I stayed up and had a late, substantial dinner to tide me through the next day! On Friday I had to be at the hospital at 8:30 for the needle localization, with surgery scheduled for high noon.  I changed into a hospital gown and robe, and waited with DH for a while till I had to go for the needle loc procedure.  They squished me into a mammo machine, took pictures, inserted three different needles, and took pictures again.  Of course the mammo was slightly uncomfortable.  I experienced a sharp pain with one of the three needles, but thankfully it was brief.  I also experienced a little dizziness, which came as quite a surprise to me, but the two doctors and the tech were just great and told me to take my time.  I'd had a similar needle loc for my biopsy surgery and did not experience any dizziness at all.  I consider myself pretty darn healthy so this was weird for me.  They taped down the three wires sticking out of my breast, and then I went back to wait with DH until my surgery time -- which ended up being about an hour later than planned.  By this time I was getting hungry.  I asked DH to make sure that afterward, I got to eat something better than graham crackers and apple juice (which is what I got after the biopsy and what we experienced twice more in the past several weeks since then).  He promised me tapas, and that really cheered me up!  Oh, and at some point during all this a nurse inserted an IV in the back of my hand, which is I guess where the anesthesia would go at the time of surgery. Before going into the OR, I had to put on a \"hat\" -- one of those goofy blue bonnets.  They make me feel really weird, but I guess when you're going into surgery it's par for the course.  In the OR, I saw my surgeon all gussied up for the procedure.  Behind her blue bonnet and mask, I saw her friendly smile and twinkling eyes and I felt better.  They had me lie on the table.  They covered me with a high-tech-looking blanket that was like a heated version of an inflatable swimming pool raft, and they put one of those oxygen tube things in my nose (I forget what it's called).  They untied the back of my gown, and the surgeon took a look at the breast.  One thing that was kind of funny:  They were having trouble reaching the anesthesiologist.  They were paging her through some kind of voice recognition system, but the system wasn't recognizing the name.  The person calling her kept saying to the computer voice: \"No.\" And she'd have to keep repeating the name.  Everyone in the room was cracking up.  Although you might think it a little unsettling that they couldn't get the doctor, the laughter in the room did relieve my nervousness a little (and I didn't really think I was so nervous at the time).  Finally, as someone went out of the room to find the anesthesiologist, she actually walked in through another door!  They hooked up the anesthesia IV in my hand.  And that's about the last I remember until I woke up in the recovery room. It wasn't general anesthesia, but it was what they called \"twilight sleep.\"  When I had foot surgery many years ago, my doctor called it \"milk of amnesia.\"  You don't feel anything and you don't remember anything when you wake up. It was interesting to note a couple of differences between my biopsy surgery and this re-excision surgery, which were done by different doctors at different hospitals.  This just goes to show that different places do things different ways.  For my biopsy, the gown I was given was a large multilayered paper gown with a built-in heating feature.  I saw the doctor before going into the OR and talked with him briefly (and they had me sign my life away with a bunch of paperwork).  To go to the needle loc procedure, I was placed in a wheelchair, and to go to the OR, I was rolled in on a gurney.  I don't recall any fancy blanket like I had in the second surgery last week. For my re-excision, on the other hand, the hospital gave me a fabric tie-back gown and a robe to go over it. (These were well-worn, unlike the robes they've given me for other exams and procedures, which were really nice, new-looking seersucker.)  I signed the consent paperwork at the time the appointment was made, not the day of surgery when I was already under stress.  I didn't see the surgeon till I arrived at the OR (wish I could have seen her sooner, but oh, well).  To get to the needle loc and to get to the OR, I walked in my lovely hospital robe and socks.  The heated inflated blanket in the OR was definitely comforting. Anyway, after I recovered sufficiently, I got dressed.  I was really hungry, because it was now about 4 or 5 p.m. and I hadn't eaten all day.  I would have loved to have gone out for tapas -- but we ended up eating in the hospital cafeteria to wait out some rush hour traffic!  Haha!  Fortunately the food wasn't that bad.  I slept in the car, and thought I'd go home and go right to bed, but somehow I had a second wind and stayed up later than I planned.  The past few days, recovery has been good.  I took one Vicodin the first night, not because I was in pain, but because I didn't want to wake up in pain.  The second night I also took one around 2 a.m.; I was having a little trouble getting comfortable in bed.  Each successive day, the soreness has subsided significantly more, and I've felt less swelling under my arm from the lymph node incision.  I feel like I could go in to the office, but they are letting me work from home. I'm trying not to take too many days off work now, because I have a feeling I'll need them down the road! I have a follow-up with my surgeon 10 days from the surgery date to review the results and find out what comes next.  I still may need a mastectomy in the end, because of my particular situation (IDC plus DCIS found in the biopsy surgery, plus some DCIS found in post-biopsy mammo).  I'm fully expecting chemo, radiation, the works.  So we'll see.  Meanwhile, this weekend I hope to hold DH to his promise of tapas! I hope this helps.  Sorry it's so long.  It actually was helpful for me to record what happened, so thanks for giving me the impetus to do so!  Best wishes to you with your surgery and recovery!",

Starting a couple of weeks before the end of chemo, I began what I now view as a new round of side effects.  First of all, I get hot flashes many times a day; really annoying at work.  Then, just when I was so pleased to have not lost much of my eyebrows and eyelashes -- surprise!  The eyebrows are disappearing rapidly, and I fear the lashes are not far behind.  A friend who hadn't seen me asked if my wig had gotten lighter; I assume it was the eyebrows that were different.  I use an eyebrow pencil and my wig has bangs, and that's about all I can do about that.  Also, my nails are a mess.  It began with one tender little pink spot on the middle finger of my right hand.  Over a period of weeks my nails became painful; it hurt even to reach for something in my purse or file my nails.  Now they don't hurt, but most my nails are discolored to a greater or lesser degree.  That first nail now has a big dark brown spot the size of a pencil eraser, and another lighter brown spot almost as big.  The ring finger nail is about 1/3 brown.  The rest are mostly just lighter brown.  My oncologist pointed out that the new growth at the base of the nailbed looks good, though, so hopefully it's just a matter of waiting it out. In the meantime, it's particularly a pain because at work I sometimes have to do videos showing my hands in action.  I had to use dark red nail polish to cover the discoloration, whereas a simple clear polish is what we'd prefer to have on camera. I also have one toenail that turned completely purple and I can't tell if I will lose it.  That's in addition to a second toenail that I do expect to lose from running.  This situation is making me reluctant to get a pedicure, but I'd dearly love to get one! Since the initial chemo hair loss, I've had a head of mostly peach fuzz.  I have just a couple of random white hairs that have grown up to an inch long, but are more or less invisible.  I am not counting on any appreciable regrowth until late summer/early fall at best.  I'm wondering how long I'll tolerate the wig now that that weather is starting to get warmer!  I really want to get my wig cut, but I'm nervous about it, because of course it won't grow back!  Does anyone know how feasible it is to do?  (Maybe I should also post that question elsewhere....)",

Bdavis -- I too heard that some women get a growth of facial hair after chemo.  My onc said maybe someone was referring to the hair growth that can accompany menopause/chemopause. I'm holding my breath.  Wouldn't it be the icing on the cake to lose the eyebrow hair, and yet grow new hair below the brows?  Ugh! ScienceGirl - Hair growth!  Really?  Tell us more!  And I'd love to hear more about acupuncture.  What happens during a treatment?  How does it work?  Do you feel the results immediately?  Tsundermann - Congrats on being done with chemo!  So nice you had a big celebration.  I'd love to have one of those.  But then, the end of chemo was not such a big deal for me.  It may sound crazy, but I actually enjoyed going for my weekly treatment and having to do nothing but sit there while people took care of me.  I always said chemo day was the most relaxing day of the week -- such a change from the stress at work!  I'm sure I'd feel differently if the treatment and side effects had made me miserable! ProudMom_Wife - Oh, good point about the nose drips!  I haven't noticed them so much in the past few days...but then I've been away from work with implant exchange...  Also, the nosebleeds stopped pretty quickly after I ended Taxol.  Yay for that! JulieH - Your vacation plan sounds so great!  We're trying to make some plans for Memorial Day weekend.  We have an airfare certificate that expires soon.  Thinking of going to Toronto - we enjoy city sightseeing.  But sitting on a beach sure sounds nice! SherryhuttRS - I couldn't agree more about the hair loss.  It is the toughest part.  I have a decent wig but I'm still uncomfortable in it, sure that every breeze is blowing the hair up to reveal it for what it really is.   And as you said, who cares, but obviously, we do!!  I would really like to go to a support group...might try it this week while I'm recovering from implant exchange if I'm mobile enough.  The one at my hospital is in the middle of the day, so any other time, I'd have to take a day off of work.  But often when I think of going to one I feel like I want to cry... not sure really why....(and really, I am NOT a crier in my \"real,\" non-bc life!). Christine, I love the crown for last day of chemo!  Too cute!  And LOL about going to rehab after you no longer need sleeping meds. Julie, thank you for the vivid picture you painted of dreading another chemo.  I'm so sorry for you and everyone who had such a difficult time with it.  Sometimes I wish there was a way for other people to appreciate how rough this experience can be.  Even though I've been luckier with the chemo, I go to work and everything is sort of normal, and yet there's this whole side of my life that is anything but normal.  It's a strange way to live.    Bdavis, Christine - I have been going through a similar thought process lately.  I asked my onco if I'd be getting any scans or tests to see if there is any cancer remaining.  She said no, and my understanding is she said if you have symptoms, then you get screened.  Screening alone doesn't offer any appreciable benefits.  I also think I'm hearing we really don't know if we got it all, and there's no way to tell.  So I'm with you, how do you move on?  I guess you just do, because how can you keep dwelling on it, either?  Ugh! Lorenar - Gee, you've been through a lot.  Glad you found a doctor you are happy with, even if you can't yet go there full time. Mary Meg - So great to hear from you, but not great to hear how you're doing!  I love how you get through it all with humor.  Your posts always make me smile.  I hope you're able to get plenty of smiles into your own days, too.",

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2011 06:48PM - edited Nov 20, 2011 06:52PM by citykitty Hi, you all -- Wow, I've been away from this thread for so long.  It feels like old home week, seeing all the familar names and faces posting these days! I passed my anniversaries of my biopsy (Sep 2), diagnosis (Sep 8), and re-excision (Nov 4)...coming up on anniversary of my mastectomy, Dec. 1.  I like that as an anniversary date -- an easy date to remember and the day they got the rest cancer (although I feel I can never be 100% sure, even after chemo!). My hair is growing in thick and curly and a nice dark brown, pretty much as before.  It cracks me up when people tell me it's cute and it suits me, because I don't feel like myself at all in this 'do.  However, I'm happy to have hair at all!  It's definitely easier to take care of, and sometimes I do consider keeping it short, except it reminds me of having cancer, because if it weren't for cancer I wouldn't have the short hair.  I did lose my eyelashes a second time, but they're finally back, at least for now.  My nails still look awful to me, but I'm hoping as they grow out they'll get back to normal. Meanwhile, let's see.  I had my exchange surgery April 22 and was cleared to resume running at the beginning of June, at which time I promptly began marathon training.  In September we traveled to France, where I ran the Marathon du Medoc, which is more a 26.2-mile wine fest in costume than a marathon.  It was in my plan for the past two years to run Medoc as part of my year-long 50th b-day celebration, and no way was bc going to come between me and that race.  Despite taking a nasty fall toward the end of the race (not from alcohol consumption, but calf cramps), I had a fabulous time. Two weeks ago, on Nov. 6, I ran the NYC Marathon.  I had problems with my knee, stopped for medical aid three times, and ran with an ice pack on the knee from Mile 7 onward, but I finished!  That finish line symbolized for me the finish of a year of life with bc and its aftermath.  It felt like a real victory to complete the race. Last weekend, I had a work trip to Florida, where I worked crazy hours and also made my debut on a certain television home shopping network. Yesterday I had revision surgery, swapping out my implant on my mx side for a different implant that I hope will give me better symmetry in clothes.  My result was not bad before, but I'm hoping the change will make me little bit happier. I haven't made any Serious Life Changes -- yet.  I am thinking about looking for a new job, but that was something I contemplated even before bc.  I too have had my share of mental hiccups, and I don't know whether to attribute it to chemo, surgeries, Tamoxifen, or just old age (50!) -- but I've been afraid to mention it at work.  I don't want any potential new employer to even think I am not up to snuff.  Even if they don't hear it from my current employer, I fear somehow it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy if I even mention it to anyone!  In my current job I'm just very frustrated and stressed for many reasons.  Some days I tell myself hey, it's not bc, therefore I shouldn't sweat it.  But still, I pride myself on doing a great job, and I feel in my current situation I'm mostly set up for failure.  So I need to figure out what to do about that. My fantasies of Serious Life Changes don't end with a new job.  DH and I have talked (though not seriously, I THINK) about moving to France, or at least spending more time there.  Our two weeks there in September only whetted our appetites.  Two nights ago, I booked us another trip to Paris for a week in December!  (I needed a few thousand more miles to get Elite frequent flyer status, LOL!)  I also fantasize about roaming the country in an RV for a year or so.  We did a one-week RV trip in Arizona several years ago and had a blast (and managed to stay married!). OK, I am not intending to compete with MaryMeg for the Longest Thread Ever, so I'll end this for now.  Big hugs to all of you!  It's been so great to have a place to compare notes and share experiences with other people who understand what we're all going through!  Best wishes and health to everyone!",

Jcoutee, I'm on Taxol and Herceptin, weekly x 12 weeks.  Tomorrow is my #4.  You haven't had any hair loss?  I started losing hair the day after #3.  It's coming out in droves every day in the shower, but I still have enough hair to not look unusual.  My doc said it would likely be a gradual thinning, and that's what I'm experiencing.  Not sure how much longer this will go on before I give up and chop it off!  Those of you who have buzzed your heads look so wonderful!  I can only hope to look like you!  This gradual hair loss is like the death by a thousand cuts!  Yet I can't bring myself to cut it all off while I still have enough to look semi-normal!  This weekend we're going to visit dear friends out of town.  I can't tell how much hair I'm going to have left from one day to the next, so I guess I'll have to bring my wig along, just in case! Oh, and thanks for the tips on Gaila and FranceLuxe.  My Gaila headwrap arrived yesterday, within days of my request.  FranceLuxe apparently has a 4-6 week lead time, but that gives me something to look forward to! Other than the hair loss, my SEs have been relatively mild.  A week ago I had a raging case of steroid acne.  My face looked like it had been visited with the dermatological woes of an entire high school sophomore class.  Not to exaggerate, but it felt and looked pretty horrendous.  Thankfully, a visit to a dermatologist and a few days of prescription lotions and potions did wonders.  Now I just have dry skin (which is normally on the pretty oily side).  I also have two weird lesions, one each on my lower legs.  At first they looked like pimples or ingrown hairs, but they are not improving.  The dermatologist prescribed an antibiotic ointment for the first one (this was before the second one erupted).  As a runner, I'm nervous about anything going wrong with my legs.  I have visions of these things becoming infected and requiring surgery, but I'm sure it's nothing that extreme!  Tomorrow I'll have my onco take a look and then probably back to the dermatologist next week. I envy those of you who are taking time off work -- sort of.  I guess I'm lucky not to have SEs that require me to do so.  I technically could take the time, but I can't justify it to myself, feeling as well as I do most days and knowing I have freelancers who are picking up a good deal of my workload.  I am taking off Fridays for chemo, and so far I've taken off Mondays just because the first Monday I worked when I felt horrible, and I don't want a repeat of that.  So I guess taking off part-time is my compromise.  (But frankly it's a bit stressful to have to work out with my employer what my status will be each day -- disability?  FMLA?  time I will make up? -- especially when I have other doctor appointments that take me out for half-days on some of the remaining days when I would be working!) Otherwise things are mostly good.  I have occasional moments of feeling sad, but for the most part I try to make light of things (like losing the hair!).  I've been able to resume running and I did a half-marathon last weekend, albeit slowly. OK, it's past my bedtime.  Big day tomorrow.  Going to try to get in a little run if the roads aren't too icy, then off to onco and chemo! ",

JulieH - You had the guts to do what I have not done - gone red!  I was going to do the same as you, for the same reason.  I had already cut my hair, not super short, but much shorter than it was.  After going wig shopping, however, I began to wonder how smart that was of me.  My wig is likely to be longer than my short hair is now.  I'll look like I grew 6 inches of hair overnight!  Oh, well, I guess it's not like anyone who knows me doesn't already know what's going on!  My doc said I might not lose all my hair, so it will be an interesting time the next few weeks. Aimster - Ugh, I feel for you.  Glad they were able to hook you up with those anti-nausea meds. Islandmom - I've heard it takes 21 days to form a habit, but frankly, for exercise, I think it takes a bit longer!  I'm a dedicated runner now, but only became so a few years ago.  I had to find a way to make exercise fun for me.  Running with my iPod did the trick, and then as I built up distance and speed, I enjoyed seeing my improvements.  Before that, I used to work out on my stationary bike watching recorded episodes of Oprah.  In both cases, I committed to get up at a certain time, brush my teeth, and just put on my exercise clothes as part of the morning routine.  By the time I did that, I was starting to be awake enough to make myself move!  (I have since run a few marathons, and am hoping to complete a half-marathon next weekend, albeit at a slower pace than normal.)",

      "Content": "Feb 2, 2011 07:05PM - edited Feb 2, 2011 07:12PM by citykitty Hi, all - Sounds like there's a whole lotta buzzing going on!  Well, allow me to join you! It's been an interesting past few days!  My hair started thinning last Saturday, Jan. 22. By Friday the 28th, I had lost a LOT at the temples and the front.  The longer hair on top covered the bare spots, kind of like my late dad's bad combover, LOL.  Sat a.m. we took the train to Alexandria, Va., and I decided to wear the wig all day for its public debut, including our good friend's 60th b-day party. By that evening my scalp was sore, and not just from the wig. I was losing so much hair daily that cleaning it up doubled my time to get ready in the morning.  By Sun a.m. I was DYING to have my hair cut off.  I was really hoping for a buzzing party with our friends (like tideknott's), but that didn't work out.  On the train home, I wore a scarf on my head, which felt better than the wig at that point.  We got home at 10 p.m., and then, tired as we were, I had DH take a pair of scissors to my head and put me out of my misery!  It felt so good to be free of that mess! I had him leave it long enough -- about 2 inches -- so that it could be refined by a professional. The scalp was still quite red and tender.  I ended up going in to my stylist Monday, and he had it looking nicer but even shorter!  I planned to keep it that way for a couple of days and enjoy the novelty, but I had an appt to take my wig in Tuesday.  With the shorter cut, I didn't have much hair left to anchor the wig with the combs that were attached to it. The wig stylist said if he buzzed my hair, I could then anchor the wig with tape. I had thought I'd be doing that in a few more days, but in the end, I had it buzzed. So Tuesday's haircut lasted all of 24 hours. Oh, well -- plenty of time for short hair when it grows back in.  So for me, it was about a week from \"uh-oh, there goes the hair\" to \"take my hair, please!\"  Now, I'm pretty bald!  And we're not talking cute bald, we're talking patchy and pimply bald!  At least the soreness is a bit better today.  Oh, and yesterday we also went to a breast reconstruction class, and then I saw the dermatologist about my steroid acne and a couple of weird ulcerations on my legs that she (derm) thinks are caused by the chemo. Having cancer can be a full-time job, I'm tellin' ya!  (BTW, I think I too am on my way to the free Brazilian.  That was my first thought this a.m. when I got undressed to get in the shower and found a lot of hair in my undies!) Tomorrow I'll be going to work for the first time with my wig.  I think most people I work with are already prepared for it, so I don't expect a lot of people to be fooled.  But my wig even fooled my dermatologist!  She complimented me on the new 'do and was genuinely shocked to learn it was a wig! About my wig -- I went to at least three different places before I found something I felt I could live with.  The only one I thought looked at all natural on me and my somewhat big head was a human hair wig.  I have to say, the price was sky-high, but for me to feel confident, it was worth it.  I'm still holding my breath to see how much of it insurance will cover.  Yes, I know human hair is more work than a synthetic wig - but it's still less work than my own hair, or at least it should be.  I'm supposed to take it in to be washed and styled about once a month.  That's nothing in my book; it would take me at least 30 minutes a day to wash, comb, and blow-dry my hair, plus touch up the ends with a curling iron. As far as alcohol - the pamphlet from my hospital advises against it.  But when I asked my onco if I could at least have a glass of wine on my 50th birthday (one month from today!), she said yes.  And actually, at the weekend birthday party I had a few sips with the blessing of two MDs who were present!  I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try Opus One and Veuve Clicquot - I'm sure it will never happen again in my lifetime! This post is already way long....so stand by for the next one!",

I'm not drinking during chemo except for a couple of sips of a special wine a couple of weeks ago, and I'll have a glass for my 50th bday next month. After chemo, though, I plan to resume enjoying wine tasting, including a trip to Bordeaux in Sep.  ScienceGirl -- So funny you found you're not a wig girl. I'm the opposite. My wig makes me feel almost normal, although it's far from perfect. I shopped a lot to find one I could be comfortable in. It is actually thinner than my real hair was, and I don't like that. But wearing it, I feel like I look less cancer-patient-like and more like myself. I have a couple of scarves, but so far they're getting little use. At home I mainly go commando, even when sleeping.  UTMom - Ugh, sorry about your hospitalization!  I hope things get better for you.

I was told to \"practice extreme self-care.\" But I'm feeling too busy and stressed for that most of the time.  DancingMom, welcome!  Glad you found us. We're all helping each other get through this! Sherry, thanks for sharing the story of the survivor who reached out to you. Good to know she made you feel better. I hope we will also be able to pay it forward that way someday! Amyk -- (((hugs))) to you. Please don't feel like a wimp. I felt that way, and I'm on Taxol and Herceptin, which from what I'm reading here seems to generally have less severe SEs than some other treatments. Everyone is different. Hang in there. And I agree, see if you can't get some help for your SEs. BTW, you may already know this, but if you have a metallic taste when eating, I hear it helps if you switch to plastic utensils.  As for me -- Taxol + Herceptin wkly x12, then Herceptin every 3 wks x 9 months. Today I completed #6 of weekly Taxol + Herceptin.  My scalp is still itchy and sore two weeks after those symptoms began and I had my hair buzzed off. It's also covered with acne, ugh!  I've been using Head & Shoulders on the recommendation of moe0279. I'd love to try the jojoba oil or shea butter some of you have mentioned, but I'm afraid it would exacerbate the acne. I too have been using the lint tape roller on my head!  In the past few days my remaining hair has thinned visibly and I'm finally starting to get closer to the truly bald look.  My main SEs have been the acne and my two leg lesions. I've had occasional tingling and burning sensations in my hands starting around week 4. I've also had light nosebleeds most mornings starting around week 4. And, of course, there's the fatigue -- the feeling of my arms and legs being very weak. That happens mainly on day 3, but it happened two other days this past week on days when I expected to feel good. That really threw me, and now I feel my life is totally unpredictable.   My Decadron, which I get by IV before the chemo, has been reduced to almost nothing. Today at my request the Benadryl was cut in half -- yay!  I'm now officially halfway through the \"main\" part of my tx.  Here's to plugging along!",

Sorry it's difficult to do personal notes to all from my iphone. I can only echo what others have said: welcome to the newbies but sorry you have to be here. Thinking of everyone in NZ, especially our dear MaryMeg. Lots of hugs to those of you dealing with difficult SEs. A few random things from me... Last week I had my final tissue expansion. Now I live with this baseball on my chest for another 8-9 weeks, and stuff the other side of my bra, till exchange surgery near the end of April. Today I am sitting in tx #8 of 12 weekly Taxol & Herceptin -- after that, I'm 2/3 thru this phase of tx! Then I go to Herceptin every 3 wks x 9 mos + Tamoxifen x 5 yrs. SEs are fairly stable for me. A bit of steroid-induced acne persists. Nosebleeds in the a.m., which are now also occurring before I go to bed. Some neuropathy in fingertips and toes, and outer sides (pinky sides) of hands and feet. Fatigue is starting to have its cumulative effect, especially when I'm running (which is one of my big things in life). Some mornings I wake up very tired, but feel better after a few hours. No pain (thank goodness!), no nausea, no constipation or diarrhea. Oh, hair. It hasn't all fallen out, though it has thinned significantly, even after buzzing it a few weeks ago. I was sort of hoping to experience the completely bald look, because the Sluggo look doesn't do much for me. (Hope I'm not dating myself with the Sluggo reference -- the comic strip character who has about five hairs sticking out the top of his head, as best I recall.). I shave my legs mainly for doctor visits, but regrowth has been minimal since about week 2. Sadly, the eyelashes have thinned, but are not gone completely. My eyebrows have also thinned a little, but in my case that's not a bad thing. (Same can be said for hair elsewhere on my body; apparently I'm not quite headed for the full Brazilian, after all.) Not only are my brows not so dense now, but I haven't had to pluck in forever. I used to fight a daily battle against new eyebrow hairs. No more! :) Anyone else having mood swings or anything like that? I've had a couple of episodes where I just wasn't myself, and felt like I lost perspective and I got really upset and teary over something small. The last time I remember feeling this way is when I was about 14 years old and miserable! I don't know if this is related to menopause or chemo or both. I'm 49 (for a few more days), so right at menopause age anyway. I'm envious of those of you who are traveling. It's virtually out of the question for me with a weekly chemo schedule. I'm missing good trips for work! Bummer! However, I am going on a girls' weekend trip to a nearby ski area starting this evening. If I'm up to it tomorrow, I'll ski a little (taking care not to fall and damage my tissue expander). Otherwise I'll enjoy just hanging out. I registered for the Marathon du Medoc in September in the Bordeaux region of France. Have been planning this trip for two years, and now all chemo and surgery revolves around getting done ASAP so I can begin marathon training!",

My pre-meds are Decadron, Zantac, and Benadryl, all administered by IV right before the Taxol and Herceptin.  I lost most of my hair around day 15, but still have a few hairs lingering on my head.  My lashes and brows thinned, noticeable mostly only to me, I think.  Otherwise my main side effects have been acne and neuropathy.  The acne was attributed to the Decadron, and over the subsequent weeks my dose was reduced to, as the doc says, \"almost nothing.\"  (I went from 20 mg to 12 to 6 to 2mg.)  My skin has improved with the help of a dermatologist; now just trying to clear up some redness and the occasional pimple.  The peripheral neuropathy -- tingling in my fingertips and toes -- started around the third week, about the same time as I started losing my hair.  So far it's been only mildly distracting, not debilitating.  I was able to get my Benadryl dose cut in half, so I'm not totally zonked after chemo.  I even stayed awake the entire time the last two treatments!  I've had no nausea and no pain -- and I hope the same for all of you who are switching to Taxol! I'm targeting my exchange surgery for April 22; just waiting for the hospital and insurance to do their dance, which takes forever.  Will be really happy to get this baseball off my chest and not to have to stuff the other side of my bra to match.  After that, and 4-6 weeks off running, I'll be ready to start training for two marathons in the fall! This past Wednesday I celebrated my 50th birthday.  I wanted to do a milestone run, but 50 miles seemed rather out of the question!  In fact, even 15 was not seeming likely.  I decided I'd settle for 5, but in the end, I ran 10 miles, the longest I've run since my half-marathon the day after chemo #3!  I was really happy, because lately I've been starting to feel the cumulative fatigue of chemo and running has not been as easy for me.    Later that day, DH took me to a Broadway matinee performance of \"Billy Elliott.\"  Then we went out to a fantastic dinner at Babbo, where we did a full tasting menu with wine pairings -- one of the few times I've indulged in alcohol during chemo.  I received lots of flowers and cards -- in fact, apparently Shoebox makes about five different cards for 50th birthdays, and I received each of them in multiples, haha! Today I ran a 5K -- my first race in my new age group, and my first race with no hair under my hat!  The combination of a hilly course, rain, old age, and chemo should not have made for a good race, but I did much better than I expected to, so I'm very happy about that! To say everything is wonderful, however, would be painting a false picture.  In the midst of all this came a reminder that not everyone is so fortunate.  A relative (by marriage) was recently diagnosed with what I take to be colon cancer metastasized to her liver (not totally sure).  Her health deteriorated quite rapidly, and sadly, she died only a month or so after we first learned of her situation.  I didn't know her well, but she was younger than I, and clearly well loved by her family and members of her church.  I'm struggling with how to process her death while still dealing with my own cancer.  It was just one of those times when once again, I was reminded how suddenly things can change.  And once again, I can only think, \"There but for the grace of God go I,\" and remember to be grateful for every little thing. Not to end on a sad note, though, I wish everyone all the best as we continue to plow through chemo and surgery and whatever else they want to throw at us.  One of the many things I'm grateful for is this forum, where we can share, compare notes, and know we're not the only ones going through this!  Hugs to you all for being here!",

Taxol + Herceptin weekly x 12 weeks, week 10 I'm in the home stretch, with two more weekly Taxol + Herceptin treatments to go.  Then I switch to Herceptin every three weeks, and also will start Tamoxifen around the same time.  It sounds strange to say, but I think I'll miss my weekly chemo time.  I tell DH it's the most relaxing day of the week for me.  None of the stress from work.  All I have to do is show up and sit in a chair for a couple of hours -- nothing more is expected of me. I will be glad to see it end, though, because my SEs are starting to build.  I have more days when I'm more tired.  Today I didn't go to work because the fatigue was just too much.  It is still so frustrating and weird to feel wiped out one day and fine the next.  I feel like a wimp -- but I guess that's just how it is.  The neuropathy, which started around the third week and has been fine most of the time, is also starting to mount.  Now my feet feel the tingling/numbness along with my fingertips.  I've had days when I went for a run even though the entire bottoms of my feet felt numb.  I've also had a lot of twitching around my eyes, although my oncologist doesn't seem to associate that with chemo. DH and I are planning to go out of town next weekend, and I just hope I don't get there and then not feel OK!  An even harder call is the first weekend in April.  We are supposed to fly to Atlanta for a memorial service.  I'm nervous about committing to plane tickets, because what if I'm not up to it?  I just have no idea how I will be feeling two weeks after my final chemo treatment.  I might be fine -- but who knows?! Anyway, here's hoping you all are doing better and better as we get to the end of chemo! ",

On the MUGA scan -- pretty much what EmilyinOntario said.  They drew some of my blood out, mixed it with another substance, and re-injected it.  This \"other substance\" was radioactive and came in a lead box -- now, isn't that comforting, LOL?!  After a short waiting period (I forget, 20-40 minutes?), I was called back in and had to lie still for about 40 minutes while they maneuvered the scan machine into two different positions to get images of my heart.  Lying still is not a problem for me; I think I dozed off.  The whole process, start to finish, took maybe two hours. I am home from work AGAIN today.  I think this is the first time I've missed three days in a row just from chemo SEs.  I feel better than yesterday, and I struggled with whether to try to go in today.  The mental stress is as bad as the physical symptoms with this chemo thing sometimes!",

Thanks for the warnings about the SEs that can visit us AFTER chemo!  I had heard about neuropathy possibly increasing, but had not heard about possible increase in fatigue, loss of hair/lashes/brows, and other SEs after the completion of chemo.  Yikes -- seems like even when you think you have an idea of what to expect, every day is still a venture into the unknown! When my neuropathy crept from my feet to my shins and started interfering with my running, I called \"uncle.\"  My onco prescribed Lyrica, and after a week, my neuropathy decreased substantially.  I still have tingly fingertips; I can live with that.  I asked about glutamine and the nurse said it was OK to take, but since the Lyrica seems to be doing an adequate job, I haven't pursued the supplements. My lashes and brows have definitely thinned.  With fewer lashes on my lids, my eyeliner really stands out.  My brows were pretty thick before, so I didn't consider the thinning to be a bad thing, but I just recently realized they really are different.  I started experimenting with an eyebrow pencil the past few days to fill in what's missing, and it makes a difference.  Amen to getting away.  Last weekend DH and I ran (not literally) up to Boston and just hung out.  It was nice to get a little change of scenery and forget about bc for a short while.  Of course there are always reminders.  The bangs of my wig were blowing in the high winds and I'm sure looked somewhat unnatural...but what can you do?!  Eventually I put on a hat and that held the bangs in place. Tanning...I've never done it (except the occasional day actually outdoors, LOL), but would love to get a little color!  I tan fairly easily but am trying to avoid too many UV rays.  I've thought about trying the airbrush route -- has anyone done that?  Pros and cons?  Last summer, at the ripe old age of 49, I wore a bikini for the first time in my life (yes, I have body image issues!).  Needless to say, my torso is pure white as the driven snow, in contrast to the rest of my body.  I would love to even things out and wear that bikini again this summer...(with a new and I hope slightly improved post-surgery bustline -- not larger, just a different shape).  Any thoughts on tanning, airbrush, etc.?",

I'm 7 weeks past my final Taxol & Herceptin.  About two weeks ago (I think), I really started losing what was left of my eyebrows and eyelashes.  I had finally reached what I think of as that genuine space-alien look -- no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes.  And in answer to another post, yes, I lost more lashes on one side than the other!  No sooner did I lose those brows and lashes, however, than they started coming back with a vengeance!  I think my eyebrow pencil has just about seen its last use.  My brows are really getting dark, and with them came all the bajillion strays I used to pluck.  I was going to try getting them threaded, but I ran out of time and patience.  I picked up my tweezers last night for the first time in almost 4 months and went to town on the eyebrows!  My lower lashes are starting to make an appearance, so hopefully the upper lashes will follow soon.  And the hair on my head has gone from about 1/8 inch of almost invisible fuzz to about 1/4 inch of dark growth in the past 10 days!  Gee, I guess it's time to go check out that hair thread!

I was hoping it would diminish my appetite, but apparently not. After losing a few pounds the first four weeks on chemo, I'm now starting to see my weight creep back up. I knew it was too good to be true. I also have the morning nosebleeds. I think that's not unusual with Taxol (can't speak for other drugs). And I am also feeling a little sad this evening, which was not like me pre-bc. But these days who knows what's normal?! I'm not even sad about the bc, just other stuff in life. But I know this too shall pass. For Valentine's Day, I'm taking DH to a basketball game tomorrow night if I'm feeling ok. Isn't it crazy that we have to add that caveat to everything now?!

Good luck with your decision!!",

That was followed by a little drama when I learned some PSs at my hospital offer a wider range of implants than my PS does.  I like my PS and don't really want to switch, but I want to have all options available to me when it comes time to choose an implant.  They don't want you to switch PSs midstream, so for a moment there they had me scheduled to meet with a new PS the afternoon before my surgery!  I've heard some things about this PS's bedside manner that jacked my anxiety level way up. (Then I decided I wouldn't let hearsay bother me -- but I was still a little nervous.)  Also, my mom is planning to take a train halfway across the country to be here for my surgery, and now we weren't going to know till the day before the surgery if it would even still take place that day -- so she wouldn't know when to travel!  In the end, the hospital decided to proceed on schedule with my original PS, and possibly switch me to a different PS depending on my choice of implant.  Whew.  Now I can have the last few days before surgery a little more relaxed, and NOT filled with so much mental anguish!  I have a decision, I have a surgeon, and my mom can make her travel plans.  Did I say, \"Whew?!\"  I really feel this calmer mental state is going to help me get through the surgery better.  I have to go into the OR calm and sure of myself, not in a tizzy worrying about my choice or my surgeon or my mom or anything else!  Now I just have to get the house clean, pack a couple of things for the hospital, and work with DH to figure out if it's possible to fit both a Christmas tree and an inflatable bed for Mom in our tiny living room. Annie, having made my choice, I'm still a little envious of your decision (if one can be envious of the awful thing we all have to go through).  I wish I had the guts to do no reconstruction.  (I'd better be careful what I wish for!  Yikes, who knows, it could still happen someday!) Sohardbenme -- Wow, what a year you've had.  Lots of hugs and best wishes to you!! Mamabeth -- Welcome to the group.  You're the same day as me!  I'll be thinking of you Wednesday! Tammy -- I can so relate to the sudden tears out of nowhere!  I've had that quite a few times since my dx, even at times when I thought I was fine! OK, sorry this was so long!  Just wanted to share one funny thing.  I've spent a lot of time on the computer lately, pondering options, looking at pictures of reconstructions, and occasionally stumbling across things I wish I hadn't seen.  DH has started telling me, in the inimitable words of the Taco Bell chihuahua, to \"step away from the chalupa.\"  LOL!  So now I am stepping away from the chalupa (but I'll be back!).  Best wishes to all you December gals!",

All the doctors and nurses have been kind and patient -- which means so much when you are feeling so fragile and vulnerable.  The facilities are immaculate.  I actually look forward to going there; it's a respite from my normal life and I feel incredibly well cared for.  Yes, sometimes the waits are long, but I know that when it's my turn, the doctor will spend as much time as necessary.  This really amazes me, because the doctor who did my biopsy, at another hospital, was always a bit short on time, and didn't explain everything to me the way my doctors at MSK did.  And MSK is always sending me patient satisfaction surveys, so you hope that means someone does care about that. The one area I've not had a good experience with is the red tape.  Because my insurance is out of network, any time I need a new appointment, it takes forever for MSK and my insurance company to talk to each other.  My insurance is really great -- they've covered everything and respond fairly quickly once someone tells them what kind of appointment or treatment I need.  But the process at MSK is very murky in terms of who talks to my insurance and how.  My approval for mastectomy came in at the 11th hour because of delays at MSK.  Waiting for this dance to take place when I was awaiting surgery (three times), and again when I needed chemo, was the most excruciating, most agonizing part of my entire cancer experience. Even after an appointment has been approved by everyone, whenever I arrive for my appointment, the receptionist has to call down to patient financial services before I'm allowed to check in.  It make me feel almost like a criminal. But once I'm through that hurdle, I'm good.  I'm seeing wonderful doctors.  Because it's a world-class facility, I don't feel I have to second-guess my care.  I feel absolutely privileged to be at MSK.",

Tammy, what you heard was pretty much what I was told about the TE process and timing of exchange surgery.  I learned a little about the nipple recon on this board even before I met with the PS, so it wasn't such a shock when she told me (\"they tattoo your what?!\"  LOL!).  So funny because my DH abhors tattoos!  But I don't think he'll mind this one.  ;) So you had a PET scan.  How was it?  I would feel better if I had the rest of my body tested for cancer, but in the end my SNB (done at the time of my re-excision about a month ago) revealed my nodes are negative (YAY for that!!!), so I guess the chances are slim that I have cancer elsewhere. I took off work today, frantically tying up loose ends before tomorrow's surgery.  I haven't had time to cook and freeze food.  It's all I can do just to get the house somewhat straight.  But I did take time for a lovely run this morning.  Back in September I was training for a marathon when I was hit with a double whammy -- stress fracture in my right tibia, and breast cancer.  As a result, between the leg and two breast surgeries, I had to lay off running for about 10 weeks.  I just resumed running a couple of weeks ago, and haven't run longer than 5 miles since my marathon training came to a screeching halt, but today I did 10 miles at a pace that's pretty good for me!  It felt just wonderful!  And it's the last long run I'll get to do for a while now, so I feel very lucky and grateful that it was a good one!  All I can think about today is, this is my last day with both of my breasts!  What a weird feeling!",

This time last year, I think I expected I'd be done by end of 2011, but I guess I will not quite make that deadline.  (BTW, I'm pasting some of this post from my post to the Jan '11 chemo thread.) I passed my anniversaries of my biopsy (Sep 2), diagnosis (Sep 8), and re-excision (Nov 4)...coming up on anniversary of my mastectomy, Dec. 1. I like that as an anniversary date -- an easy date to remember and the day they got the rest of the cancer (although I feel I can never be 100% sure, even after chemo!). My hair is growing in thick and curly and a nice dark brown, pretty much as before. It cracks me up when people tell me it's cute and it suits me, because I don't feel like myself at all in this 'do. However, I'm happy to have hair at all! It's definitely easier to take care of, and sometimes I do consider keeping it short, except it reminds me of having cancer, because if it weren't for cancer I wouldn't have the short hair. I did lose my eyelashes a second time, but they're finally back, at least for now. My nails still look awful to me, but I'm hoping as they grow out they'll get back to normal. Meanwhile, let's see. I had my exchange surgery April 22 and was cleared to resume running at the beginning of June, at which time I promptly began marathon training. In September we traveled to France, where I ran the Marathon du Medoc, which is more a 26.2-mile wine fest in costume than a marathon. It was in my plan for the past two years to run Medoc as part of my year-long 50th b-day celebration, and no way was bc going to come between me and that race. Despite taking a nasty fall toward the end of the race (not from alcohol consumption, but calf cramps), I had a fabulous time. Two weeks ago, on Nov. 6, I ran the NYC Marathon. I had problems with my knee, stopped for medical aid three times, and ran with an ice pack on the knee from Mile 7 onward, but I finished! That finish line symbolized for me the finish of a year of life with bc and its aftermath. It felt like a real victory to complete the race. Last weekend, I had a work trip to Florida, where I worked crazy hours and also made my debut on a certain television home shopping network. Meanwhile, I had not been thrilled with my perceived lack of symmetry.  My natural side was augmented with the smallest implant possible, but still looked larger than my mx side.  So on Nov. 19 (Saturday!) I had revision surgery, swapping out my implant on my mx side for a different implant that I hope will give me better symmetry in clothes. My result was not bad before, but I'm hoping the change will make me little bit happier. If that goes well, then I have to wait 3 months to do the nipple.  I'm planning on nipple-sharing using part of the nipple on my other breast.  Not sure about whether to tattoo or graft the areola; it's a whole conversation I haven't yet been able to have with my PS. Interesting you all mention the emotional aspect of all this.  As soon as you hear a dx of bc, you think, \"emotional rollercoaster.\"  And yeah, I guess it has been that -- but not at all in the ways I expected.  I could write an essay on that subject alone, but I think for now I will just say THANK YOU to all of you for being here!  Lots of hugs and best wishes to everyone!  And if this post sounds disjointed, let's just blame in on the pain meds as I sit here recovering from my revision surgery!  :)",

Otherwise feeling much better.  Just trying to get the house in order before surgery and my mom's visit.  Best wishes to everyone!  I'm going back for the umpteenth time to the thread about things to do before surgery!",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2010 06:34PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 04:22AM by citykitty Hello all - I've been wanting to check in for more than a week now, but my mom came up for several days -- which was really nice, but made it difficult to break away to get online.  My uni mx with tissue expander was Dec. 1.  I've been amazed at how quickly I've been recovering.  My surgeon says some of that is attributable to my running. (I was training for my fourth marathon when I was struck with a double whammy of stress fracture in my leg and, oh by the way, breast cancer.) As a uni, I'm grateful to have use of one good arm to get through some of the daily matters of getting in and out of bed, washing up, and dressing!  Don't know how you BMXers manage!  I spent one night in the hospital and had a relatively good experience.  I was up most of the night with people coming in for this and that, and then a veritable parade of strange people in white coats starting around 4 a.m. to check out my apparently unusual T-shaped scar (long story).  The worst part, however, was not being able to pass the \"pee test\" to get released.  They had to insert a catheter (ugh!!!!) to drain my bladder, and I had to start from scratch.  It took hours of walking the halls and running cold water in the sink - and even using the Waterfall app on my iPhone (!) -- before I could \"go.\" Within a couple of days I was walking outside, and five days after, I put on a bulky sweater and walked a mile (slowly and carefully!) to an evening meeting of my running club.  No one can believe I just had a mastectomy.  I set my iPhone alarms to remind me of my arm exercises (5x/day) and medications.  On Wednesday I went to a \"Look Good, Feel Better\" makeup class (Google for your local class -- very cool).  Yesterday I got my drain out (only had one!), and the surgeon said on a scale of 1 to 10, my skin-sparing surgery result is an 11!  Woo-hoo!  There was more DCIS remaining from my previous two lumpectomies (no surprise) but they got it out with clear margins!  Third time was a charm for me!  As of today I'm wearing a sports bra with a \"fluff\" to pad out the surgical side.  With the drain out, I feel amazing!  It's all I can do not to go out and run a few miles (forbidden for several more weeks)!  Of course in reality I'm still fairly sore -- but optimistic!  At the end of next week I meet with the PS for my first expansion and my onco to find out about chemo (I'm assuming I will have it). It's good to be back and see how everyone is doing.  I know I'll miss a few folks here, but I'm thinking of all our December group! takeadeepbreath - That visual of all of us as skydivers is great and so apt!  I was so tempted to do all that pre-surgery shopping.  But I kept finding myself buying things that were NOT useful for surgery, like form-fitting tops!  LOL! laugh-addict - So glad you're keeping a smile on your face!  That's my approach, too!  I even had DH take pix of me in the hospital.  Must have been the drugs, because normally I'm vain enough to never have my picture taken if my face and hair aren't done!  And ditto to your comment that even if we feel pain, it just means we're alive! oconnor2450 - Welcome back, so glad it all went well.  Congratulations on your big fat zero!  Woo-hoo! Warrior67 - Thank you for the view from the future.  Good to know there is hope that things will go well. Anniemomofthree - What a wonderful way to get your tree!  Thinking of you today and tomorrow as you go in for surgery.  Can't say if the hospital will be restful for you.  For me it was restful mainly when I was under for surgery!  After that, not so much!  LOL! thrmine - Sorry for your delay. Hope you recover from the trial drug and move forward! lciscarroll - Best of wishes - I'm thinking of you and your GAP.  I'll be interested to hear how you make out!  And thanks for all the interesting articles and links you come up with. zogo - Welcome home!  Wow, long surgery for you!  OUCH to all those IV pokes - you poor thing!  donnasb - Sorry you're having such a tough time.  I don't have much advice because my surgery was much different than yours.  I hope your PS has good news for you on the 16th.  Maybe you can find some advice on the Oct and Nov mastectomy threads?  Those folks will be farther along this journey than those of us with December mastectomies. fire-dancer - So glad you're home and doing well!  Take it easy! BikerBabe1 - Your surgery is similar to mine - uni with TEs.  I had my SNB a month ago.  The injection was no big deal.  My needle localization (don't know if you're having that) was briefly painful but it passed quickly.  I think you'll be fine.  Best wishes to you! Annie62 - So glad to hear you're doing so well!  Good for you!  Best wishes for a continued speedy recovery! For our December women coming up - good luck and best wishes for a surgery and recovery that are as painless as possible and filled with love and hugs!",
