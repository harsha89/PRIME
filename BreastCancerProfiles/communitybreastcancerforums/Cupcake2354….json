I did go to see a doctor but she just felt around and told me not to be concerned that it's totally normal and sent me on my way, no antibiotics or anything. What I'm wondering is have any of you guys had a persistent swollen node with nothing to worry about? I'm very worried cus it doesn't seem to be going down and I'm not sure to get a second opinion Log in to post a reply",
