My onc gave me 'chemo light' - 4 treatments of A/C instead of 8. Then I had 33 rad treatments and now am on Arimidex.  My attitude is better safe than sorry - I wanted to make sure I did everything I could to minimize the chance of recurrence.  Whatever decision you make, just ask yourself how you think you will feel down the road if you bypass chemo and have a recurrence.  Will you regret your decision? If so, then go with the chemo.  If the worst thing happens, at least you will know you took advantage of everything out there to fight off this terrible disease. Good luck with your decision.",

It is likely that you don't have cancer but you should have the mammogram to make sure.  I had two surgeries for breast lumps - one when I was about 35 and the other when I was in my 40's. Both were benign lumps that were removed. So, not every lump means cancer. Unfortunately my third surgery was for breast cancer.  Don't panic but please don't put off getting the mammo as soon as you have the coverage. Let us know how things work out for you. Maureen",

I was stage I, no lymph node involvement, but had aggressive cells (grade 3).  I chose lumpectomy followed by 4 rounds of chemo and 33 radiation treatments. Now I'm on Arimidex daily.  Everyone has a different viewpoint on their health and lifestyle so you have to make your own decision. For me, it was important to do anything I could to minimize the chance of recurrence. Chemo was no fun, but it is doable and if I was faced with the same situation once more, I would make the same choices.  Good luck.",

It is usually located on the nipple or areola but can be next to it or nearby. It occurs in only 1% to 4% of breast cancers. The good news is that it is highly cureable (92% survival) if there is no accompanying lump. If there is a lump underneath it, the survival rates go down.  My sister was diagnosed this past May with DCIS that was found in multiple areas of her breast. So, because it was in multiple places she had to have a mastectomy. They say God works in strange ways and in her case if she had had a lumpectomy they may have never known about the Paget's cancer. Because the pathologist examined all of the tissue that was removed, he was able to find the Paget's disease. Not every mole is cancerous but please be cautious and have it checked out. Maureen",

However, like mammography, it is not fool proof and has a high rate of false positives, causing women to undergo further unnecessary testing. I wouldn't dismiss the benefit of mammography (even though it did not detect my breast cancer) but I would add that an MRI should be the standard supplement to a mammography.  We need both of them.  My recent mammography found an enlarged duct which they 'believe to be benign'.  My surgeon suggested an MRI but my insurance company denied it as 'medically unnecessary'.  I am going for another mammo next month and will once again try for an MRI.  If I am denied, I am going to wait until January when I will enroll in my company's Flexible Spending Account.  That way, even though I will have to pay for it, it will be with pre-tax dollars. It's a lot of money, but better safe than sorry.  The way I look at it, it may cost me $1500, which is about 1/2 of what it costs to take a 2 week vacation somewhere.  If I skip one vacation, hopefully it will mean that I'll be around for lot more because of better detection. In the meantime I will continue to fight my insurance company, QUALCARE, who really does not care.",
