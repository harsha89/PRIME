The reason they call mine luminal B is because of the high proliferation rate. My oncoscore score was estimated at 18-20. I was given the 4% bump number, too. One oncologist said no chemo, the other said chemo (...and the TailoRx preliminary results are not out yet). The third was going to do the oncotest and said \"You are in the intermediate group. Regardless of the oncotest results, If you choose not to do chemo and the cancer came back, would you have deep regrets?\" I'm older than you at 50, but I want to see my kids graduate from college and live their lives. I would have regretted not doing everything I could to fight the cancer. So for me, I choose to do the 4 sessions of TC, then radiation, then tamoxifen. I think you just joined our August chemo group and this post might be late, but since we always second guess ourselves, I wanted to throw my two cents in.",

The stylist also evened it out cutting off the long GREY ones that didn't fall out during chemo. I have always had VERY curly hair, so those of you new to curls need some tricks on how to tame them (unless you're getting gentle curls you want to encourage). For those of you with unruly curls 1/2 -2 inches long, when you get out of the shower, pat hair dry. Before the hair dries put in some pomade and smooth it flat with your hands. If it's longer than 2-3 inches, use a round brush and blow it dry by continually twirling the round brush back or under as you move toward the ends. Yes, it will make a big round curl, but you have to \"straighten\" all the frizzy before you can style it. Let it cool. Next, you can style it by moving it into place with fingers or (like me) use a GOOD straightening flat iron, or use a curling iron to curl it the direction you want it to got. YouTube has videos on how to straighten curly hair, too. loriekg - They stop falling out at 3. You got this now! Igay1ord - I see 'em! I kept those little stragglers and just trimmed everything to the same length yesterday. I'll try to post a pic later.",

Okay, let me help some of you ladies who are struggling with your new curls and want a more sleek style. I have always had curly hair, so I can give you tips! If your hair starts to get unruly, there are ways to tame it! You'll need 1) foaming wrap lotion (I used Motions, but any kind is good), 2) something to wrap it tight and flat in like a bandana, foam tape, or wrap strips (I like Wrap It strips), 3) scarf or velcro wrap cap to hold it in place. I'm ready in 30 min. My hair is really soft if I use this method. It's wirey if I let it dry naturally or blow it dry. I choose this!  This is what my hair is like if I don't tame it:  ...and the untamed back...  So, I'm washing with baby shampoo, conditioning with kerastase, and then wraping it to straighten it. You put 3-4 pumps of a foaming wrap lotion on clean conditioned hair. I used a foaming wrap lotion by Motions, but you can get some at any store in the multicultural hair products section. If you do have really dry hair, you might consider a leave in conditioner before the foam. Here's the picture when I slicked down my hair with the foam. Actually, I put more on and got it really straight. Flatten it so it's really straight.  Next, I used wrap strips. You can get a box of them for $5 or you can use a bandana or velcro wrap. You have to wrap it REALLY flat and snug to get it to dry flat.  Then, I put a scarf on to hold it (or a velcro wrap cap or satin cap). It takes my hair about 20 min to dry, so I go get dressed and put on eye make, whatever. Then, you remove the wraps and it's really slicked down.  I brush it with my finger tips to give it a little volume, add a little Crew pomade or Biosilk to make it shinny, add big earings. Done in 30 minutes. Tah dah!  ",

My blood count is fine and I feel good, but am I giving it enough time between chemo and radiation???? My MO said 3-4 weeks after last chemo, and the RO said, \"Monday will be 3 weeks, so lets start and you'll be done by Thanksgiving!\" Honestly, after chemo, I'm ready to get on with the next step! I had my CT scan for my dot placement today. I'm doing prone position (because the tumor bed is on my left side and I'm trying to protect my heart). The tech said it's normal procedure to do a CT prone, supine, and then one for the boost. I feel that I have had sooooo many CT scans, that I declined the CT in the supine position. So, I sure hope the physicists can get the correct angles. I've been reading what you all have been posting in addition to reading the \"what to do before radiation\" thread. Let's see if I have my list right: Over-sized bra, cami's for underneath bra and for goopy creams, cooling towel, CVS after sun aloe Blue gel with lidocaine OR \"recticare\" (normally a hemorroid product but has 5% lidocaine!),Spand-gel Hydrogel Sheets or Mepilex dressings, aquaphor, AVO or Eucerin, only Dove sensitive soap, Tom's Deod., no supplements, lots of water, and maybe an ibuprofen 1/2 hour before radiation. Anything else you recommend? You guys are too funny, but if it works, right?!! Naturally, I'll check with my MO before I buy any of this stuff and try to figure out what works best for my skin.",

People will talk about an infection, a seroma, etc, but I'm going to talk about truncal lymphedema. You had your lymph nodes radiated, and sometimes radiation (and surgery) can change the lymph system so the fluid doesn't drain easily...and the tissue swells up. If no one else responds here, try posting in the truncal lymphedema thread. I wear a sleeve for my arm for lymphedema, and some people wear a lymphedema bra during and after treatment for when the breast swells. If you ask people in that other thread about your symptoms, they are really helpful. My surgeon didn't want to admit that I had lymphedema, so I insisted on going to a lymphedema physical therapist. It sounds like your doctor's office is like that, too, so if it is lymphedema insist on a referral to a lymphedema physical therapist (PT). My PT was great and showed me what to buy, and how to gently move the lymph fluid out of the tissue. If you Google truncal lymphedema, don't be put off by the pictures because I learned that the worst looking pictures make it to the Internet and are pictures of people who go years and years without getting help. It's very manageable if that is what you have. Here is the link for reading more about it: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/side_effects... So, my advice is to read about it and ask some questions in the lymphedema forum on this site. Obviously, if you have a fever or other signs of infection you should go to the hospital. It may not be lymphedema, but it took me a long time to find out about the wierd pain in my arm, and the ladies in the lymphedema thread helped me. I don't want anyone else to be left in the dark. Good luck!",

Since your 2+ months out of rad treatment, the rash could be something else. If cortisone doesn't make the itching better, you could have a fungal infection in the skin. If you get hot flashes at night, the skin may get moist and develop a fungal rash. Ask your doc or try over the counter Lotrimin cream. It's about $7 at the store. My son was a wrestler, and the doc always said skin that gets moist should be watched. If a rash doesnt get better with cortisone, it's fungus and needs Lotrimin.",

I have to admit that I had to remove the aug chemo group thread from my favorites because it depressed me too much. Did that talk affect you like it did me? The lumpectomy lounge is a great support group, and so I need to hang out there more. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I hope you to get support wherever you can to deal with that fear because otherwise (as you know) it consumes you. My realization that I want to be done and that I can beat the recurrence fear happened during my boosts. I thought, \"I can do this! I'm tougher than this!\" Good luck. I'll be thinking about you.",

The others gave good advice; here's mine: 1) Totally agree with queenmamacat that you don't rush out and buy a bunch of stuff! I didn't use any of it! 2) Drink lots of water, and exercise!. I didn't have fatigue, and my doc said it's because of exercise. 3) I used Miaderm 4 times a day and once in the middle of the night since I was drinking so much water! It's expensive, but it worked for me. I'm just a little pink. 4) Boosts are nothing except electrons on the incision site. They are not as hard on your breast like the whole breast radiation. Don't fear them because they are called boosts! 5) My RO and techs said the #1 thing was to make sure you didn't have skin to skin contact under breast or in armpit. So, I always put a soft t-shirt UNDER my bra, and at night I slept with a rolled up piece of cloth under my breast. Worked wonderfully. When I started to get a little pink and sore was when I didn't have it under my breast and I exercised. Also, use cornstarch in a sock and pat it on so less friction (keeps u dry). Great for exercise. 6) I got a few little red dots on my breast on day 27. Normal. Some people get them earlier. Also, some people got nauseated. My doc always asked, but other docs deny it. My doc said to eat an hour or two before so you don't get sick with empty stomach. That was it for me! Oh, and if you had chemo, my hair started growing back, but is only really noticeable now (8 weeks after chemo). Good luck!",

My RO said that radiation affects the area around the nipple differently than the rest of the breast. I've just noticed the areola area having a different texture: hard. What happens next? What might be coming down the road on this? I'm on Day 13 of 30. Still nothing to report here (except the areola is changing texture). I'm using Miaderm 4x a day. That sounds like a lot, but I'm still waking up in the night --an old habit from my chemo days of having to drink a gallon of water a day -- and I put the Miaderm on in the night. I'm also sleeping bare-chested at night, which is very cooling. I'm keeping a rolled up piece of very soft t-shirt material under my treatment breast. I heard that skin-skin contact makes the breast burn and peel more, so I'm hoping this will help with that.",

I walk 4 miles a day, and this hasn't limited my life at all. You don't have your tumor characteristics posted in your signature, but it sounds like you might be stage 1 or 2 since you alluded to the fact that the cancer has not yet metastasized. I understand that you don't want radiation, but the stats assume that you are doing radiation if you have had a lumpectomy. I believe even the OncotestDX genetic test score assumes lumpectomy+radiation+ meds as standard treatment. So, make sure you talk to your doc about your specific tumor characteristics and stats. Then, decide if you would have any regrets either way. That helped me make my decision. Good luck.",

If your breast touches your chest or your other breast (like if you wear a sports bra) make sure you put a rolled up piece of SOFT t-shirt material between the skin. I've been using Miaderm. It's expensive, but so far has been working for me. The others say the candula or whatever work for them. I also walk 4 miles a day, and I have experienced no fatigue yet. My doc says since I've had no side effects so far, if I get any at all, this will be the week I notice them. Stay tuned. I was mapped today for the boosts. Interesting. I asked if the boosts will fry the skin, and the RO said that the boosts are the most gentle. Sometimes toward the end of radiation if the skin breaks down they will do the boosts and then go back to finish the rads so the skin has time to heal. Oh, and I also learned that the week after rads is where you see the cumulative effect of the radiation, and then you get better!",

I used Miadern 4-5 times a day, even in the middle of the night. I didn't want to post my nipple area, but it's good, too. I got the little red dots on day 28. Some people have a bad reaction, but I wanted to share a \"not so bad\" story. ",

While the swelling in my arm didn't go down for several days (which made me upset), it is down now with diligent use of the sleeve and glove. I noticed that when I wear my sleeve and glove all day --12+ hours-- that my arm feels like the sleeve has to come off! I feel like the sleeve is \"strangling\" my arm. Is it okay to take it off even if I have some computer work or busy work to do still, or will that just make the arm swell up at night? I also noticed on several of the LE threads that several of you talk about \"fist pumps\" and \"arm pumps\" like when on a plane flight. Is this to get the muscle pumps working to move lymph out of the arm? Do you do this with your sleeve on or off? Should you do them when you exercise? How many times a day? Oh, this is such a steep learning curve! ",

But, the nearest one is 2 1/2 hours away. I have a sleeve, a guantlet, and a glove. She said I was stage 0--things have changed now-- no noticeable swelling, but I had pain and stiffness. You ladies had me go in and she confirmed it was LE. Now, I've finished my 4th week of radiation. They are not radiating the nodes, so I didn't think the LE would get worse, but, it has. My arm is swelling, and now I have weird feelings in my wrist and hand. I have neuropathy from chemo, but I quit early for the SE. I thought the neuropathy was gone, but now I\"m not sure if it's the neuropathy or LE moving to my hand. Sooooooo, I figured I needed some help. First, I forgot, can I do the MLD with the sleeve on? I do it in the AM before putting on my sleeve, and then I do it several times a day. I wear my sleeve all day. Secondly, should I wear the gauntlet or glove right now if I feel the tingling in my hand? In the past, when my arm felt tingly from the sleeve after 8 hours or so, I would remove it. Well, tonight I removed it and measured my upper arm and it was swollen AND my hand felt weird. I figured I'd be up for a while, so I put the glove on hoping for damage control. Is it okay to wear it for only a few hours even if it is not swollen? should I start wearing it all the time for a while? Most importantly, will I always have to wear it or only when it starts to feel weird? Finally, what should I do if I have swelling and sometimes it goes down with the sleeve and sometimes it doesn't? It's 1-2 CM in my biceps and 1/2 cm in forearm. I've been wearing the sleeve each day. I have 2 more weeks of radiation, and I figured I needed to get this under control. I don't know how to wrap, so that Solaris Ready Wrap looked good to me! Will I need that, or should I just continue wearing my sleeve during the daytime? I will set up an appt with the PT, but since the closest one is so far away, I may not get in for a few weeks. I figured, actually I'm hoping, some of you can help me so things don't get worse. Any help would be appreciated! You guys are so incredibly kind to give advice to those of us who are new to all this. Thank you.",

I agree that LE is waaay more common than the docs say. I'm 7 mo post surgery, and it was the first time my surgeon didn't deny that I might have LE (despite my pain, slight swelling, and weird feelings in my arm). There's a study out there where 100% of the surgeons denied that any of their patients had LE, something the researchers pointed out was statistically impossible. I'm not sure if surgeons are under pressure to be perfect or whether they just don't listen, but I know for sure that no one is marking down on a chart that I have LE and showing the rate of LE among patients. All -I do MLD morning and night, and wear a sleeve when I exercise. I take my first plane flight next week and am worried. I wore my sleeve yesterday when I changed altitudes and drove to the theatre --Dirty Dancing, it was great-- and I always wait an hour before removing it. It also seems to be flat (smaller when measured) when I wear my sleeve for several hours. But, my arm always burns and aches for several days after changing altitudes. Any suggestions?",
