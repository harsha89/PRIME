For us, the initial trip to Atlanta (from Newnan) for the biopsy was no big deal, but it was better to have the oncologist nearby so that my mother didn't have to make repeated trips to Atlanta for treatment. Is your mother near Decatur?",

I took my 90 year old mother to her in May 2012 for a biopsy after a suspicious mammogram and ultrasound. Dr. Steinhaus performed the biopsy and then called me (at our request) with the results. My mother's cancer was \"high grade\" and \"very aggressive\" and she could see from the start that there was node involvement. If a lumpectomy could have resolved the problem, I would have wanted Dr. Steinhaus to do it, but after a PET scan it was discovered there was a large tumor in the liver so we ended up in the care of Dr. Assikis at Peachtree Oncology and Hematology. He and his staff were wonderful! Mother was stage IV from the start and her cancer was Her2 +++, a rarer form of BC. He offered her treatment with Herceptin and low dose chemo (Xeloda), but it was obvious at day 13 that the chemo was too much, so we decided she should stop. I would never do it again, but he was conflicted because she was in such amazing shape otherwise and wanted to live so that her 93 year old boyfriend wouldn't have to suffer her loss. She died in October, but I am comforted that we tried everything we could. My hope is that your mother's biopsy will be benign...if not, that it hasn't spread. But if it has, I would not recommend chemo. Please keep us posted.",
