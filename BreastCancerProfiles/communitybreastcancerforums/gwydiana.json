However, I've been finding that I'm more and more tired with no apparent reason lately. I've had fatigue for the past few years but this past month has been off the charts. I take a bath and I crawl back into bed completely exhausted from the chore of bathing myself. Am I the only one feeling this?

If you can, get valium, xanax or ANYTHING else to calm your nerves -- demand headphones and music for when you are in the MRI machine and if they can turn on the AC or a fan in the room, have them do so. I honestly thought I was going to throw up and suffocate. It was so uncomfortable, so loud and so painful for me :( Also, I have very dense breasts and had a cluster of liquid filled cysts in the right breast about 20 years ago. My dr back then just drained it with a needle. Now, in that exact same spot, is ILC and the tumor is approximately 7 cm big which is quite large. If you can push for a biopsy there, please do so ASAP. ",
