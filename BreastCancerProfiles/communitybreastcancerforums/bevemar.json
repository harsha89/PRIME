I felt ok while in the hospital and when I was home, I became very sad, crying, depressed and today is Friday, May 24th and am still feeling very depressed and sad, crying too. Is this \"normal\" to be feeling so depressed, down, sad and crying after a bilateral mastectomy? I am not having any reconstruction. Will be seeing my surgeon on Wed. May 29th, 2019 for possible drain removal and also to see an oncologist doctor as well. I had the Sentinel lymph nodes and 3 other lymph nodes removed during surgery, the tests results came back on Thursday, May 23, 2019 the nodes were negative for any cancer cells, yet I will need some treatment for the invasive ductal breast cancer I was diagnosed with after a mammogram and a breast biopsy. Sadly, my husband of 46 years has beginning dementia, Type 1 diabetes on 2 different insulins and has beginning Parkinson's, he is of little support and help to me. We have no family in the area where we live in Wisconsin. I appreciate any feedback if having the bilateral mastectomy very recently and my husband's health situations is why I am feeling so sad, depressed and crying often, I do not know what to do about feeling the way I do. Thank you..",
