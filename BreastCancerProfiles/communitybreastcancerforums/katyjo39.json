When I found a lump upon self exam I went straight to the oncologist I had with a previous and different cancer treatment. He discussed my options based on the pathology report from my biopsy and had me go see the surgeon to get all options. So I would recommend seeing both and getting all options and making a decision from there. I would also recommend that if surgery is the way you choose you should be aware that you can begin the process of reconstruction at the time the mastectomy is done. I did not know this and might have opted for it had I known. It would saved having to have a second surgery to have the expanders implanted later.",
