The course of treatment is such a personal decision, but I knew I wanted the BMX even before I met with the genetic counselor. I did do genetic testing and am still waiting on those results. I also had an MRI and MRI guided biopsy and I felt they were both a relatively easy procedure. All of the dr appointments and information is definitely overwhelming. Try to take a little time to relax and do some research to make an informed decision. I'm 4 days out from my BMX and feel good and I have a positive outlook on my diagnosis. Good luck.",

For those of you that have gone that route, are you happy with the results? I have larger breasts (36DD) and envision something a little smaller and perkier and being able to go without a bra at times when this is all said and done. If I do the nipple sparing BMX, will I have to worry about my \"headlights\" being on all the time? My husband thinks I will be happier with the nipple sparing surgery.

Since having 3 kids and breastfeeding, I've never really liked my breasts, so I don't feel that I have a huge connection to them right now. But I just don't know how I'm going to feel when they are actually gone. To be honest, I am looking forward to the end result of breasts with more lift (it makes me feel a little guilty to say that), so I just want to make the right decision about my nipples during this process.",

I'm guessing/hoping I get more info when I meet with her tomorrow. I'm 43 years old; my mom had breast cancer at 59. I had a clear mammo in March, but was referred to a breast clinic by my dr as I have extremely dense breast tissue. On April 4 I had a breast MRI just as a precaution because of my dense breasts. I almost cancelled the appt thinking there was no reason to go and spend $4000 on the test. I received a call 2 hours after the MRI to come back for an ultrasound on April 6. That led to a biopsy on April 8. So, here I am.....

My right breast was the side with cancer, but they injected the blue tracer dye in both breasts. The reasoning for this was that if they found any cancer on the left side during my BMX, the dye would already be there to follow to the sentinel node. All of my pre-surgery scans showed no lymph node involvement, but they did this just as a precaution. My surgeon only ended up taking two nodes on the cancerous side.",
