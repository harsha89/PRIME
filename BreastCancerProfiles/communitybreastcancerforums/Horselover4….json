Who knew?  I met with an oncologist last week and will need to do T/C once every 3 weeks for 4 rounds.  Now I'm sitting around waiting for the onc office to get it through their heads that they don't need approval from my insurance company (per Blue Cross).  Hurry up and wait.  I just want to hurry and get this going as I have a paid for cruise the middle of April to celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary, and I want as many weeks as possible between the end of treatment and the start of my cruise.  My whole family is going and it will now be a double celebration, the end of chemo and my wedding anniversary.  Yahoo!!  Who ever thought you would be in a hurry to punish your body?

Hmmm, I'm thinking..................still thinking.........oh who cares. I spent an incredible day at Disneyland yesterday with my 22 yr old daughter.  What a glorious day.  No lines longer than 15 minutes, weather in the low 70's and I even tried rides I'd never been brave enough to do before.  I decided it was time to really live. I look forward to checking in with every one on a regular basis.  Walk strong ladies. Janna ",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2009 03:55AM - edited Feb 8, 2009 03:56AM by Horselover44 Well, today was the big day, I had my hair shaved off tonight.  It started coming out alot on Wednesday so it was time.  When my hairdresser friend showed up at the door I cried for about 2 minutes and then got over myself.  I grabbed two fist fulls of hair and pulled them out just to show her and she said she had never seen that before.  Anyway, once she started buzzing off the hair it was no big deal.  I had her cut it into a mohawk and then had her take my picture, and then she shaved off the rest.  I just wanted the mohawk to post on my MySpace page.  My 22 yr old daughter thought it was hilarious.  Geez, you might as well have fun with it.  I think what surprised me was how cold my head is without hair.  I heard they had a meeting at my work on Friday and my boss told the entire staff (65 people) that I was losing my hair this weekend and for everyone to come in with scarves on Monday, to wear pink and to decorate my office all in pink.  How cool is that? I go for my 2nd tx of TC on Thursday.  My sis is flying in from Oregon to be with me during this tx.  I'm looking forward to the visit.  I just hope this go around is much easier then the first one. Good thoughts being sent your way ladies, you are all amazing women. Janna",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2009 03:41PM - edited Feb 1, 2009 03:42PM by Horselover44 Hey Ladies, I have been reading posts but not really writing many.  I am on day 10 after first tx of 4TC.  My first week was awful, including the horrible bone pain for 2 days from the Neulasta shot.  Boy howdy, that was some kind of fun.  Then followed that up with 5 days of intermittent nausea and diarrhea.  Friday I was feeling pretty good so went out and cleaned up the floor of the hay barn of all loose hay.  After I finished that up I was exhausted and came back in and got hit with the worst nausea yet. Geez.........  Yesterday was my best day so far so went out to lunch with DH and then hit the feed store.  It was a wonderful day!!! Anybody else having issues with super dry red spots on their face and hands?  They even hurt a bit.  What do you think and suggest for this? I hope everyone has a great day.  We are enjoying sunny 75 degree weather today, you can't go wrong with that.",
