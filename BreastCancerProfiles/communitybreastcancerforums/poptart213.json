The reason for the little bit of doubt..it is near the pectoralis muscle and hidden behind a heterogenously dense breast, so it does have white areas (which could be solid tissue and is not necessarily bad.)   This is all seeming benign, but to be sure, my doctor wants a second opinion from a breast surgeon on the 21st. I want to be informed, so I don't agree to do anything unnecessary that may cause more harm han good.    I was thinking if anything, MRI?  Because aspiration/biopsy for something that my body seems to have encapsulated sounds like a bad idea?   In the unlikely event that it is a rare cancer, couldn't that could seed it to spread?  Only recently learned of significant family history/ductal carcinoma.  Any thoughts?
