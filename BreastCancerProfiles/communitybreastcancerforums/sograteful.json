(And they absolutely charged me ðŸ˜‰) My only concern is that I have heard that an ultrasound won't pick up IBC or Paget's a lot of the time. The Doc did not want to do a mammogram because of my age and the fact the ultrasound came back negative was all he needed to tell me not to worry and use Cortisone cream. It's so frustrating. As for breast density, and I'm gonna get real scientific here; I guess I'd say they're normal. The change I've noticed is the right breast seems a lot \"squishier\" and bouncy than the left breast which is still \"squishy\" but it's just more firm and feels the slightest bit heavier. With my own hands I can feel how one is heavier than the other. This I noticed a few months ago.",

I'm scared senseless and I have shelled out so much money on different doctors that insist I'm fine without even listening to me. I'm 33. I've had this red almost purple bruise like spot on my left breast for almost a year now. My lymph nodes in my collar bone and underarm are sore as is my neck and shoulder. There is a general feeling of heaviness and density that is apparent in my left breast. It tends to itch more than the right. I have slight thickening of my left areola and one teeny tiny dimple the size of a follicle on the affected breast. I've been to a dermatologist, my primary and a beast cancer nurse practitioner and tried all their expensive creams and pills and have seen little or no change. It feels like the redness will lighten up sometimes but never really go away. I know I'm making myself crazy. I know I sound paranoid, but I don't know what to think when virtually everything I read says IBC or Paget's for my symptoms. What else can this be? Everyone says it's not IBC because my breast hasn't \"exploded' overnight like most cases. My symptoms have been here for a while and have looked the same or lightened up for the most part. Also my skin isn't thick on the left breast so I am not getting response from most of the physicians I've seen. What's worse is they treat me like I'm being silly. I just want to be healthy and to have my questions answered. It's so disheartening. I'm so scared ladies. I feel like no one cares. The lymph pain is freaking me out and this heaviness in my breast is doing the same. I'm trying not to go to the dark side every day, but it's so hard when everything I see is so negative and scary and I have no one to tell me what is happening. I've considered that it might be mastasis, but I don't have a fever nor have I ever had children or breastfed. Is it possible to have IBC or Paget's symptoms for almost a year or is it always overnight? Anything else besides cancer that my symptoms could be? What would cause this heaviness and lymph pain? I guess I'm just wondering if there are women or men that have felt symptoms like I have who found out they were benign. I need peace of mind because it has been a long stressful year of spending a lot of money and time to feel the exact same; without answers or hope. Thank you for your time (again) ðŸ˜³ Log in to post a reply",
