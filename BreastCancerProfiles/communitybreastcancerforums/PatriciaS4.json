I'm terrified because I've put this appointment off for so long. I saw him 8-9 months ago for a rash on my left breast and crazy itching. I got a cream and it helped the symptoms but did not go away. About a million reasons crossed my mind as to what this rash could be. In all this time I've never been able to get rid of it completely. I know I should have followed up. This past year has been difficult for me because I was also diagnosed with another illness and so fear has played a huge factor. Anyways, I've been having left sided breast pain off and on. Sometimes with cycle (only left side) sometimes not. The past week however has been different. I've been experiencing the itching, burning with the rash and also a more consistentc shaped pain around my breast and a heaviness in my armpit and the space between the breast and armpit. It doesn't feel muscle. I'm tender under the armpit and during my self examination I've felt a small pea size maybe even a bit smaller hard thing. I know I will see my doctor...but I have a tendency to downplay stuff. I should be worried right and make sure he investigates? I know this sounds silly but i guess maybe instead of overreacting I've undereacted? Log in to post a reply",

I saw my doctor today My doctor is concerned because it's only one breast but he's given me another stronger cream and am to go back in 2 weeks if a) it doesn't help and b) if the tenderness/pain and tiny lump doesn't go away. Does this sound reasonable?",
