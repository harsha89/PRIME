I just had my first CMF treatment yesterday. Felt lightheaded and nauseous on and off but did a pile of laundry so it wasn\u2019t that bad. Didn\u2019t sleep well, had a burst of energy this morning so went food shopping to stock up the fridge for the fam. Then crashed and slept for 3 hours. Now nauseous. I think nausea comes when I\u2019m hungry. Will have some chicken noodle soup. Craving only starches since yesterday, which someone said on this forum is related to the steroids. Kids just got home from school so I will go down and say hi and have my soup.",

When I discussed this with my oncologist, and after pressing her for her opinion, she said: \"I don't know how else to say this, except that the standard treatment in the US is 8 treatments; whatever you decide, you have my blessings and we will move forward together to the next step.\" In other words, she was not in a position to give me an opinion other than the standard treatment, but she also didn't oppose it or counter it. I am confident in the soundness of the science on which I based this decision. Here is the link to the study www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic... I am thrilled to be done",

I have my second treatment Thursday. It was 4 days of feeling like I had a stomach virus, then a few days of crushing fatigue. Basically a week, and since I've felt quite normal physically. Some days pretty tired though. It's very strange to go about my life as though everything is as usual, and this is the thing I struggle with most - finding the balance of keeping up with home and work and kids, wanting it to be as usual but also feeling very tired by all of it and not knowing what has to give, where to let go and loosen up. It's challenging emotionally. My sleep is very screwed up these last couple of days, waking up and not being able to get back to sleep. Anticipatory anxiety I guess for the next one, which is the day after tomorrow.",
