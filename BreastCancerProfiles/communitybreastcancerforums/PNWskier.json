I was originally going to have a mastectomy but the presurgery chemo (4 months) brought me into the lumpectomy range. I am fairly sore with trouble bending over and lifting my arm. I removed the ace wraps and showered last night. It looks pretty good, I don't see any large bruising or bleeding. The sports bra helps a lot. I finally took a narcotic pain pill since the pain woke me up last night but I generally don't mind being really sore if I can avoid the narcotics. The sentinel node was clear in surgery and I will get the pathology report in about a week and a half with my follow up appointment. I am also looking forward to seeing how much cancer is left in the tumor that was removed. Two other smaller tumors disappeared on MRI after 3 months of chemo so the surgeon took a \"generous\" lump to try to include that area as well. I may need oral chemo in addition to radiation if there are enough cancer cells remaining.",

I am a nurse too and work in a surgical setting so I see a lot of people in and out with breast cancer issues. I worked in ED for 33 years and I saw many people in extreme situations with their cancer diagnoses which was more difficult. It's hard waiting to put the pieces of the puzzle together for right now but I know it will come.",

It didn't see anything in the other breast. For some reason I was fairly emotional after the MRI. My hubby and youngest daughter waited with me and it was nice to know they were there. I went straight to work after the MRI and started with a break so I could get my day going! The path report is a triple neg tumor. I see the surgeon Monday. I have been reviewing a lot of information posted here. Thanks!",

It took a month of mammogram, then another mammogram with different views and ultrasound (which the radiologist could still not decide anything) and then a biopsy with another 3D mammogram. Each time I went in things got a little shakier for me. The path report is a little depressing and shocking, IDC with a high score. I still don't know what the lesion looks like, there is an MRI scheduled this week. They can't see where the lesion is right now, except for a little distortion-maybe as much as 4 cm. The radiologist says he would never have seen this whisper of an infiltration if I hadn't requested a 3D mammogram initially and I can't feel a lump or see a change in my breast. My immediate family knows the news and we are just waiting to see where this is going to go. (My youngest is 27) I have an appointment with a breast surgeon a few days after the MRI and I am hoping to start to get a feel for what I might be looking at and dealing with at that time. I'll be spending some time exploring what you have here and hoping that if I can't find something or I need to ask a silly question you can direct me. For now I am in the waiting mode and looking for ways to love the life I have. Thank you for being here!
