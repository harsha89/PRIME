Now I have shoulder length black and white thin hair. You can see the scalp looking pink around the part line, but I am fortunate that is about the only place the scalp shows, so not VERY thin hair. I need to get a job to pay all these medical bills and have been told, at 50, I probably should dye it. What is safe on post chemo hair? Is there something you can use that will color the white but leave the black, so it looks like there are highlights and lowlights? I hated having just brown hair, so would get highlights put in when I got it colored, but I'm worried that would be WAY too harsh now. Oh, and I have some sort of rash around the nape of my hair. I think it might be from the night sweats tamoxifen is giving me. BTW have always had very sensative skin and scalp.",

My eye doctor said I needed lubricating drops, that the eyes were dry from the chemo, hence over producing, he recomended Systane. I didn't ever get them, as it was the least of my symptom concerns, and I always would forget to purchase them. Personally, I'd wait for chemo to be over before having a stint put in, but as you can see, I didn't even get the drops, so obviously I wasn't going to do anything more. BTW - I stopped chemo, TCHP on October 29th. I'm not sure when my eyes and nose stopped running, but they don't anymore. Also, they both just seemed to be running 'water', the dried tissues were never 'crusty' like when you have a cold. My MO said for my eyes, any saline (not 'get the red out') eye drops would work and for my nose my MO said to buy Simply Saline MIST in the metal can, not the plastic squirt bottle. Doesn't have to be that brand, but get the mist not the spay, much nicer. It will run out of your nose, so have a tissue ready, but this helps moisturize higher up, so the nose doesn't do it. You will run less for a bit afterwards.  ",

Also, I'm a 90 year old woman (actually 49) from the Herceptin, I'm not on anything else yet. So it might be the AI or Herceptin. This 'after' time does suck... I was very optimistic during the entire treatment and surgery, but now find myself falling into a type of mild depression. I find the Herceptin arthritis, might be part of it, as well as the constant ear ringing. I guess I thought all would be normal... except in my case, with tissue expander boobs... Also hearing my husband say all is normal and I'm better just irks me. I guess it is comforting to him to think that, but I'm still recovering. I still need help, I still can't open child proof caps... Cooling pillow - I have this one from Costco. One side normal, the other cooling. It doesn't make any noise. It has a 'new' smell when you get it. I opened it and let it air out for a few days before using it. My daughter (age 11) loves it and bought the contouring one with her allowance. If you have surgery coming up, get the contouring one, it is lighter. For me, I go to sleep on the non cooling side and flip when I need to the cooling. I also sleep in a sleep cap (little to no hair from chemo also) and a sleep eye mask. It helps to keep the cap on my head and I find I'm still sensitive to stimulation, so I also wear ear plugs, and it helps to keep them in too. http://www.costco.com/Comfort-Revolution-Hydraluxe%E2%84%A2-Gel-Memory-Foam-Blue-Waves-Bed-Pillow.product.100012596.html",

Also, the whole staging thing when you have pre surgery chemo confuses me. I was greater than 2cm but less than 3cm when diagnosed, but due to pre surgery chemo and targeted therapy, had no cancer left when they took the breast... so what would I be staged at??? Originally Stage 2, now... no cancer so, what stage is that??? I emailed the question to my nurse navigator and haven't gotten an answer. Call your BS and ask if you need to keep the area taped. I did recon, so saw the PS 3 days post surgery and they took the tape that was coming off, off completely. For my port it all fell off and my surgeon said, go buy more steri strips and put it back on, but forget about the gauze and 'cover' tape. So, call the emergency number for your surgeon and ask. Also, when you talk to them ask about this itching, as it sounds like you think part might be dry skin (am I correct?). You might be able to put lotion in some areas and not others.",

Also, as I'm getting 'reduced' with my BMx, my incicion will be an inverted T, so an incision under the boob. Any bra, including cami shelf bra, would be on the incision. But ask your PS what they want you in. Cotton Faded Glory Cami's, Walmart, mine were on a shelf, between the dressing rooms, bras and the ladies clothes. They had ones out in the ladies clothes section, but they were LEI, and primarily polyester. OK - I modified this, as I continued to think about a 'marsupial's pouch'. I had some panties I had only worn once but didn't feel comfy. So, cut out the crotch and cut along the side seams. Sewed the sides, 'crotch', and other side, to the cami, with the cami stretched about 2 \" at the waistband of the panties. Guess what, a marsupial's pouch. OK so it looks odd, I'll try to send a photo, but... if it works, who is going to see??? Drain belt - a friend just emailed that it was uncomfortable. What she did was take some zippered hoodies, and cut holes from the inside to the pockets. Then she just put them through the holds so they would fit in the pockets. I've seen that some have pockets on the insides, but I have never seen them in the stores. Also, I'm thinking of taking some soft T-shirts I was going to give to Goodwill tomorrow and cutting them up for fabric. Then sew them to the front of these camis, and cut a hole inside, so the drains could come forward. I'm thinking big enough for the tubing, not the whole drain. This way, it would be on the outside and I could check on it. Pockets - someone just told me, wear the sweat jacket inside out, then the pockets are where you need them... Also some say put them in your pants pockets, some say don't as you will forget, pull your pants down and STOP, because you feel the tug. YIKES CassieCat, hope we can provide insight also, as a pre-surgeryTCHP gal myself, I'm surprised that the neuropathy and muscle fatigue continue to get worse, even though my last chemo was 10/29. For some reason, I thought the side effects lasted 3 weeks, then anything more was from the next chemo. Once you stop, you realize it just keeps happening. I'm sure sometime soon, I will go round the bend, and it will start improving.",

Not sure if it helped with the pain, or if I just didn't care, as I would nod off in the middle of a sentence, but either way, I felt better. Pathology report \"NO RESIDUAL INVASIVE CARCINOMA AFTER PRESURGICAL (NEOADJUVANT) THERAPY.\" So a complete response and my nodes were clear, so no more chemo and no radiation. As to post surgery, still sore but can do much more daily. Will see PS today, to get more drain out, so I'll be down to only 1 on each side. Pain, a girlfriend told me for my c-section you want to be between an 8-10 and you will get pain meds. She also said they are normally PRN (as in YOU must ask for them). So, ask the nurse what drugs are PRN. Chances are, there are drugs there you son't even know about. Keep a chart and set an alarm for when you need them. Stay in front of the pain.",

I was 'filled' on the table and had an additional 60 cc's on the 17th. Did not fill on the 31st, as fluid build up under arms. (drains between alloderm and TEs were still producing 60 - 80 cc's a day, but they 'had to come out at 3 weeks) Left side's scar looks healed, the right is still dark red scabby looking, but not feeling. I'm only taking 1 Flexeril and 2 Aleve every 8 hours and don't wake up for one, so normally just 2 times a day. It hurts like the dickens when I bend over, the left side a pull that feels like it is in the chest wall, the right just a dull pain unless I'm bending and reaching, then it feels like an internal stick is tearing. If I bend over at all I must hold my left breast. If I bend more, I must hold both of them. This reduces the discomfort/pain, but does not totally stop it. Hummm..... is this normal???",

I loved my pouch cami that I concocted, the nurses thought it was great too, but I have improved upon it. I have added a mens tank top under it. My drains are coming out of 3 holes under my arms, on each side,so the tubing was making me itch. HUMMMM\u2026. I had a man's tank undershirt. Cut the sideseam to go down to where they are slightly below the tubes. Put on Tank, thread drains through, put on pouch cami, thread drains into pouch! To strip, take out of pouch, but keep tank top on. bring sleep mask and ear plug!!!!!!! twolumps - you are a warrior!

The advantage was, when I moved, they didn't pull. As to cami, I just had cheap ones from Walmart and cut the armpits to accommodate the drains. Soon this will all be a monent in history to us, but right now, YUCK! Oh, btw, the nurse at the PS said, don't be surprised if LOTS of drain stuff comes out of the holes, since these two were still producing 60cc's a day. YIKES!",

I had and Rx for 30 xanex, which have been wonderful since the diagnosis last June. I'd take one the night before chemo, or surgery. Towards the end of chemo, I'd start taking them Friday night in prep for chemo on Wed. Chemo was awful, but... it was no where near as bad as I thought it would be. The fear factor makes it worse than it is I think. As to returning to work, I think most doctors say this is 6 weeks recovery, don't they? As to still having 2 drains, my PS said they had to come out at three weeks, because they now posed more of a risk of infection than good. You are on 5 weeks. My guess is, they will come out this week. AGAIN this is another one of those things where every PS is different.",

Pink and I were part of the July one, and I'm on so many topics now, with so many of you, others may have as well. We both were HER2+, so were on Taxetere, Carboplatin as our chemo drugs and Herceptin and Perjeta as the antibody drugs specific to HER2. We were at our chemo centers every 3 weeks for about the whole day. I know our chemo group helped me bunches, as we would all share what our MO's were telling us on how to deal with the symptoms. Tell them EVERYTHING, down to a twitch in your nose and there might be a remedy for it. I say remedy, because not all the solutions were meds, some were saline for the nose, Biotene toothpaste... I think both Pink and I will agree that chemo was yucky, to the point after the first one you question if you will do cycle 2, but honestly, in a bat of an eye, it is over. Also, some things were worse than I thought, but the overall experience was NOT worse than I thought it would be. Oh, and both my husband and I thought we would be in a room with people throwing up the whole time (that was our thought on chemo) but... I have never seen anyone throw up in the chemo room. One thing someone wrote that I almost keep as a mantra is: Breast Cancer is not a race, it is a marathon. Somewhere in the middle of chemo, I resigned myself that the next year to year and a half, I had to dedicate to healing myself of cancer. If my kids had to eat sandwiches for dinner one night, they would not starve. You know what, somehow, dinner was always made, but knowing that they would live with just sandwiches, took a lot of pressure off me. BTW - the port is odd. I still have issues when I take a shower and put my hand over it. Just feels wrong and was uncomfortable for about the first month, but such a nice thing to have. They pop something into it and you are 'hooked up'. They take blood from it, then hook the chemo lines into it and you never know. So easy to walk around the chemo room, to and from the bathroom (I would drink about 60 oz of water while there so tons of to and from the bathroom. None of that odd feeling of an iv in your arm, but remember, they will haved to access it, so don't wear a turtleneck and a crew necked top. I had to go to the bathroom and remove the turtleneck shirt. Yep... silly me... Mecsmomma - Welcome - I've added you to the 'header' post. You sound like you are doing great. Oh, and you can't put your arms down normally, as there are TEs under them... the joys... So sorry you are in the 'holding pattern' waiting for tests, doctors and tumor boards. I'm 5 1/2 weeks out and still hurt. I didn't start driving until the kids went back to school on Monday. YIKES getting the seat belt... pull, bite with teeth, pull, bite, pull, click. That is my solution. Pink - I stopped narcotics sometime around Christmas, because I wanted to get my lower GI track back and working. Oh, I know you have heard that from me before, probably every cycle of chemo I would complain... smiles to the memories. I take my Flexeril when I wake up and 8 hours later. I no longer take it during the night. I have just started to sleep on my side some. Yes it is uncomfortable, but I hated sleeping propped on my back, then on my back. I wonder if some of the pain you have at night is you are trying to roll to your side and that is causing it. I also wonder if maybe something other than vallium for the muscles might help. My PS first had me on robaxin 750mg every 6 hours, but I can't take big pills so switched me to Flexeril 10mg every 8. I wonder if a change would help you? ",

Peeing, drink more, fever, call doctor, no bm's call doctor, shortness of breath call doctor. Although these next few months will feel like an eternity, when you look back, it actually isn't that long an amount of time. About the same amount of time as a semester of high school. What can you do for her, when you have some time, think about what she does around the house that you do't think of, and do them for her before she asks, as asking is very hard. Pick up things that fall on the floor, empty waste paper / recyceling / trash cans. Constantly wipe down the island counters and top of stove. For some reason, when we are ill, we see and feel every last salt crystal, bread crumb or single splatter of grease. Run the dishwasher and empty it before she can see, this way she won't tell you that you aren't doing it right. Same thing for the laundry. Look for cobwebs on the ceiling and walls and 'get them', wipe down finger prints from walls and door jams, clorox wipe all handles, knobs and toilet flushers, germs are BAD, clean the toilets and sinks if you see anything, or even if you don't. This way, at home, she can truly rest, and not see things to do. OK, she will still find things, but there will be less for her to find. She has a good one in you, that you are here asking.",

If no one can come, make sure they do something so you have the call nurse button. Small bottel of water, I couldn't hold my 24oz, it was too heavy, the nurse then brought me a 16iz Styrofoam, still too heavy, finally settled on a coffee cup size with a bendy top. Ask for 3 or 4 at a time, so you will have them. I couldn't reach mine, as I was in too much pain to move. Warn others, the blue die turns things blue, so vomit, urine, etc will have a blue green tint to it. Make sure they train whoever will be stripping your drains, nurse can do 1st 3, then whoever will be doing it at home,can do it and the nurse can give them pointers. I'm sure there is more, but I'm wonky from Rx's so going back to bed. GooD LUCK LADIES! When I'm less dopey ,I'll add the new people.",

I feel sorry for my poor kids, but do know the carpool line with the barf bag, or running to the bathroom while making sandwiches. Lucky Girl - I don't know why chemo might hurt your DEIP. I think the bigger issue is radiation post reconstruction, but I did my chemo first, so I may be wrong.  Merry Christmas - Happy Hanukkah - To my December Surgery Sisters.

Thank you for letting me join!!!!!! I loved and still love my July2014 chemo sisters, but we have all forgotten a lot of these things and there may be some side effect 'cures' that are new, so I'm glad to have this group to hang with. I'll be on Taxol and Carboplatin every two weeks, is anyone doing that? kyz - you say you are on TC, what is that? Taxol and Carboplatin? Dex - yep chemo is cumulative when it comes to fatigue, it really hits you about the 5th cycle, but you learn how to deal with it. Hey, at least your baby is sleeping through the night. Back in 2014, we had a lady in the group that was pregnant and then had a newborn for the last 2 cycles, as well as a toddler. You are a mother, somehow, we have the ability to do what is necessary for our kids. Mouth issues - my MO had me do 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt to 1 qt water. I bought 1qt water or soda that was on sale and dumped it out. this gave me unbreakable 1 qt containers, for under $1. I 'lived' primarily in my bedroom or the family room, so I kept one in my bathroom and one at the kitchen sink. Whenever I would pass them, I would pour a swig and swish. I did get some sores but very few. IF you get bad ones, call your MO, there is a Rx mouthwash, which has a painkiller in it to help. I also used a soft toothbrush and Biotene toothpaste. Oh, I am not looking forward to chemo again, nor are my kids who are 15 year old boy girl twins and an 11 year old boy. They are used to their stay at home mom running them all over, and I think those days will be over for a bit.",

Start your 1st day. If your nose isn't dripping, as in you don't know it until clear snot hits your boobs, it is coming. Be your grandmother and tuck a tissue in your sleeve, you will need it. Once the nose hairs go, there is nothing to slow it down, or to give you the sensation it is coming. Go get Saline Spray, if you belong to costco, go get the 2 pack. Use it fairly reguarly, to 're-hydrate' your nose. This will reduce the 'blood' in your drips. JAG - see how this goes. If she needs fluids daily or even more than one infusion, ask if she can get it at home. Last time we had one lady who did. They left her port 'open' and she could then do it herself (in her case her mom did). A visiting nurse will come to your house to train you on it. As to food, my BC support group, almost every lady says they can do a few bites of French Toast. No idea why, my child had a bad egg allergy, so we didn't have eggs in our house, so I never did it. Also - food/liquid my oncologist said he didn't care what I ate as long as it had salt so I would want to drink. Some say Gatorade, but I hate it, so he said potato chips, Doritos, oodles of noodles, what ever, and then drink and drink non carbonated things. I found the 'taste thing' made drinking hard, but I knew I needed to do it. Someone suggested I make a 1/2 gallon batch of Green Iced Tea, while steeping add tons of ginger. I'd use a mortar and pestal with thinly sliced ginger and sugar. I do between 2 and 6 Tbs of Ginger. Then once steeped add juice of 2 lemons and 1/2 can of frozen cranberry juice concentrate. If you can't find that then just add cranberry juice. Something about all this takes the icky taste in your mouth away some. On this group or another is a pharmacist. She says this 'metal taste' occurs with other medicines and they tell patients to eat some canned peaches first. I haven't tried it, so I don't know, but I went out and bought some. Also, odd foods, if she craves something, get it. This is like pregnancy in a way so it might be odd. I haven't eaten liverwurst since I was a kid, but I wanted it during chemo, another friend didn't eat balogna, but wanted it during chemo. Today I went and bought bagels, garden cream cheese, trisucts, stoned ground wheat thins, garlic hummus and roasted red pepper hummus, bacon and horseradish dip, french bread, brie, we have oodles of noodles and a big pack of jello cups. Oh, we also have cheap boxed mac and cheese. Last chemo I found if I didn't smell it cooking, I actually could do some rather crazy flavors in salty food. As to water, I would put rubber bands around my water bottle, enough to represent each bottle I had to drink to get to my oncologist's desired amount of liquid. When I would refill the bottle I'd take one off and put on the drawer pull next to my fridge (filtered water in the freezer door). This let me know I was doing what I needed to. I also kept water bottles in both of the bathrooms I use the most, in ziplock bags, to stay germ free. If I had diarrhea or threw up, I would drink one extra. I start tomorrow, so who knows if I will eat all that 'crap' or if I will have a super happy teenage boy.",

I wonder if they need to litteraly be in a can, or if being in a jar is OK. Also, they are a 'p' fruit, what Gerber told me, when I had babies, were the fruits you wanted if constipated. Prunes, pears and peaches, they said.",

Take it from someone who is doing it for the second time, for a second primary cancer. With that said, OMG day 2 is kicking my butt! I'm about to call the doctor to see which of these anti nausea meds I can double up on. I'm on Sancuso patch and 8mg Zofran which helped for the first 4 hours, but not anymore. Any options for non acidic liquids to mix my L-Glutamine powder in. I probably should have thought of that before now... oops.",
