I am with you, and I believe in being open and honest. I dont hide the fact that I have cancer, as I believe that it is a part of life. It would be the same if I had diabetes or high cholesterol. By open communication, I think other people become more aware and alert. I know some people dont want to discuss it, but I think, well how else can we learn off each other??? To me, it is part of life and if I can help anyone by what I have said, then I am happy. I also think that sometimes when you keep things to yourself, then it builds up inside of you and that can become very stressful for that person. I always try to be objective and assertive and believe that we are our best advocates. I have had a couple of misdiagnoses and I have given those medical practioners objective and constructive feedback, after all they are all human and cannot be right 100 percent of the time.  ",

LM can be diagnosed anywhere around the brain in the lining as well as the spinal fluid, so I guess that we each have to travel a different journey with different treatment options. The only thing that I can add is that LM is more treatable now. Let us know how you go. hugs xxxxx. ",

So far, so good and no problematic side effects, although I have aches and pains in my joints, now probably from Aromasin, but it is more a bit of a nuisance and I am not taking any painkillers yet, as it doesnt bother me yet, just letting me know that things are happening, lol. I have a couple of mouth ulcers, but that is all, and the mouth ulcers are also just a nuisance rather than painful, so I am very happy so far. I am due for my blood test next week as well, but I think that the oncologist will wait another month or so for scans. I had a cold last month and obviously, my lungs were letting me know that they were not functioning at full mast, and I brought up a lot of phlegm and my breathing sounded like i was playing the banjo, but I had no fever and I just kept plodding along.

Just a quick note about my journey with LM. I was diagnosed with LM back in November 2012 (I was diagnosed with 3 different types of mets in my brain, one of them being LM) I was also diagnosed with numerous mets to my liver and lungs at the same time and I have had bone mets since May 2012. When I was diagnosed with LM I was given possibly weeks to live. I was put onto Xeloda straight away, and when I had my scans 6 weeks later, there was a reduction in all of my mets, including LM except for the bones. I was scanned every 3 months for about 18 months when I became NED in the brain , and also NED in the lungs and reduction of mets in my liver. I am still successfully on Xeloda (I think the success rate of X is only about 20% ). Technology has come a long way even since November 2012, so when Xeloda stops working and LM returns (as there are still little molecules there according to my oncologist) I know that there is more treatment available that was not there a couple of years ago. I know of a couple of people who are still going after 4.5 years with LM diagnoses. Please do not give up. Fingers crossed that you keep going Smiley. Warm hugs Mandy",

The final bit of bad news was that one of the mets was LM.....I tried to research on the net, but most of the information was outdated.  I did confront my oncologist a couple of weeks ago to tell him that I am feeling quite anxious about the statistics concerning LM and he gave me more faith by telling me that he had a couple of patients who are still going after 4 and 5 years!!!!! So technology has certainly impoved lately. Thank you for your input on how you deal with LM and this wretched cancer. I agree, I believe that if you can keep mentally healthy and happy, then your physical health also stays healthy. Wishing you all the best in your journey and yay for technology. xox",

I hope the radiation has done its job and that it is resolved. I have not had radiation yet, only Xeloda and the MRI shows that the mets are shrinking. I am also fortunate that I never had any symptoms, so possibly early stages yet. Have you consulted with your oncologist about Xeloda, as that appears to be the chemotherapy drug that can get through the blood brain barrier. I am not sure if there are any other chemo drugs that can do this.  EnglishMajo, I had a look at your article about Valerie Harper, and appreciate the link as it is very informative. I believe knowledge is power and the more we know the more control we can have over our treatments and care. As I have said before, there are some posts about LM but most are very vague and I believe that these mets will pop up more and more as people are living longer with cancer, and most of the information on the net are before Xeloda.  Cheers Mandy ",

Agreed, there is not much positive information about LM on the internet, however, I believe that there are some new chemo drugs that will cross the blood brain barrier. One of them is Xeloda, and I have been on Xeloda since diagnosed with LM in November 2012. (My scan last month showed LM not visible, so at the moment Xeloda is kicking butt for me and the side effects are do-able) My onc has said that he has a couple of patients that are still going strong after 4.5 years. Valerie Harper (the actress/comedian) also has been diagnosed with LM for a couple of years and if you google her name, you will learn some more positive news about LM. There are different variations of LM as well, so, each of us react different to treatment etc. My thoughts are with you and please let us know how you get on.  Warm Hugs Mandy  ",

And with some others, they have had to have different treatment which worked for them, so we are all just so very different. Like Breast Cancer has so many different types of breast cancer and different grades and stages, I think that LM also is different for everyone else as well with what type or what grade it is and where it is located. That seems to be my only answer, but I am only guessing. I am not sure exactly where the Leptomeninges are. I know that they are in the lining surrounding the brain, but which lining? there are probably two or three different linings surrounding the brain, and then it goes along the brain stem and also in the spinal fluid. So I think that where you have your LM plays an important part but also the grade etc. Mine was in the right parietal area of my brain. I had another one in the lining above my left eye which was not LM and another met in the lining right at the top of the brain at the front that separates the two halves if that makes sense. Just to put your mind in a positive frame of mind, I was diagnosed with LM in November 2012 and my prognosis then was dismal, with prognosis of weeks maybe months, but I was put onto Xeloda straight away. I also had mets in the liver and lungs as well as bones at at the same time. Fast forward 9 weeks later and CT scan and MRI scan showed regression in the organs but not the bones and I was NED in all the organs about 15 months later. I hope that Xeloda keeps working and hopefully that it was not LM, however if it is then at least Xeloda may keep it at bay. hugs Mandy xxxxx ",

It is comforting to know that I and others have benefitted from this thread, but there are a couple of other similar threads. One is spelt Lepromenngeal. This is a terrible met to have, but believe me that besides me, I know of one other person still going strong. We both have had different treatments obviously because our mets were probably different and so are our bodies. I hope that this gives you both hope. My thoughts are with you.

My tumour markers were going up every month by about 50 until November 2012 when they were around the 500 mark and I was complaining of shortness of breath in ER. Diagnosis immediately was Pleural effusion and I stayed in hospital for 11 days having my lung drained,  and of course they did a lot of tests as well. I was also complaining of headaches. CT scan showed mets to bones, liver and lungs as well as brain. MRI to brain, showed 3 different types of mets in the lining of the brain and in different areas of the skull, one of them was in the meninges in the right temporal area. I had never heard of LM before neither, and I was then told of poor prognosis. I went off the Aromasin and straight onto Xeloda. Tumour markers still kept going up for the first 6 weeks (blood tests every 3 weeks) and then they started to go down slowly. The next 6 to 12 months were pretty weird, as I was aware that I could not plan for anything anymore, and this might be my last Mothers Day, Birthday, Christmas as well as celebrating my family's birthdays.  There are now drugs that cross the blood brain barrier, and they have not been around for that long, so the prognosis is getting better. Being ER+ and PR+ gives us a better chance as well.  Have you checked out the Brain Mets Thread as well? How was it diagnosed? Did you have any symptoms? I hope that you stay strong through this and I know that it is very hard for the family, but give them the positive details and do not look at the research details on the internet as they are outdated and we have newer drugs that are becoming more effective in tackling LM. Like I said, before that up until a few years ago, no drugs were around that crossed the blood brain barrier, but there are now.  Warm Hugs mandy ",

Or it has only just surfaced and is rapidly progressing. Did they give you any cortisone for the headaches (and possible swelling in brain region)? That helped when I had the initial LM symptoms. I would call the doctor today and tell them what is happening. ((hugs)).  I was also NED for 5 years until May 2012 when mets were diagnosed in my skull, spine, ribs and left hip and right shoulder. The largest met is in L5 area, but I have had no treatment yet as I have a high tolerance for pain and take tramadol every now and again.  Do you know in what region you have LM? My thoughts are with you and I hope that you get some good treatment very soon that will kick LM's butt.  Warn hugs Mandy ",

I then went on to Afinitor Aromasin combo for another 18 months as this treatment worked will on my lung mets, except my bone mets were still slowly progressing. Early this year I went back on to Xeloda as my lung mets again returned as well as some abdominal ascites. Xeloda worked for about 6 months and I am now on Fulvestrant as my lung mets have returned again. Progression is slow thank goodness and I will find out in another month whether the treatment is effective. I will go on an immunotherapy trial next and I am hoping that will be after Christmas as I have too many things to do before Christmas.",

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2018 08:02AM - edited Sep 22, 2018 08:03AM by mandymoo Raven4 and Grannax2, I ended up in hospital on my first or second round of X (14 day on and 7 day off) as I was on maximum dose, 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening. My feet had huge blisters on them and they were red and sore, so I stopped my daily walks and I kept them elevated as much as possible. I initially was nauseous and I had a lot of explosive diarrhea and gas. I was passing red blood in my stools and that is why I ended up in hospital. It was just a burst blood vessel from all the explosive D. So my dose was gradually reduced over the next few rounds until I was on 2 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets in the evening and that seemed to be doable for me. I persevered with the cracked feet and I took gastro stop for explosive D and when scans showed regression in my brain, and liver after 3 rounds, I just kept going. Just over a year later, I was NEAD in all the organs except the bones, and I have had some radiotherapy to particular areas of my bones when they get too painful or to slow progression in that area. I have taken the odd extra week off after the first 9 months or so,and that was my choice, but gee that helped me mentally. Each round of X, you have different side effects, which really intrigued me. Yes, fatigue, nausea especially the first few months, red and cracked feet and numb fingertips were the main side effects, but your body will get used to it. I was a Breast Cancer naturopath and nutritionist early on after I started taking X, and she told me to eat more protein. No stone fruits which I loved but more berries. Multi B vitamins, Curcumin (which I didn't take). I also had to stay away from lactose and that was very hard for me. Almond milk, Rice milk but no Soy milk as I am ER positive. I ended up with DVT in my right leg after a couple of months probably from lack of exercise so I have been on blood thinners since then. I also have Lymphedema in my right arm, chest and shoulder blade which may have been exacerbated when I had radiotherapy to my right shoulder, and some mild lymphedema in my right leg. When I went on to Afinitor Aromasin combo after my 44 month ride with X, I found that I had completely different side effects on that treatment and I also found them difficult, but what is the alternative? I wish you all the very best of luck with Xeloda, Don't forget that we are usually put on a high dose so that it gets rid of as many of those suckers as possible, and then the dose will be reduced so that you can manage the severity of the side effects and the chemo still does its job. I have heard of one lady who was on Xeloda for 8 years. Hugs Mandy",

I have found so much information through this support group already, and I look forward to each communication. I know that there will be times, when I won't want to communicate, and that will be the same with most of the others.
