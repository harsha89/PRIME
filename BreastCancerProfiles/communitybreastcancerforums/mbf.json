Linda-n3 - Thanks so much for the info.  I'm still having the same feeling in those three fingers in both my hands, but my oncologist didn't seem at all concerned.  I can deal with it, and considering all the rest of the \"stuff\" I'm feeling due to tamoxifen, etc., I guess I just figure it's minor in comparison.  Is it wrong to assume that since it seems minor, it will eventually lessen and go away?",
