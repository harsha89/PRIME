It is scary since I feel the liver and bone mets are growing and the pain is worst. I need to get a second opinion. Any thoughts on hormone blocker working with mets in liver so big? what do you think ladies? Have a wonderful labor day weekend. >",

My uncologist pushes more for ixempra. I don't know why it is harder on the body than halavan. I am so grateful for this chat room i don't feel alone anymore. My tumors in the liver are 12 cm in the left lobe and 10 cm in the right lobe, have no clue how my liver is still functioning but very grateful. Marybe what is SSDI? Hope it's all well, I had good results with zeloda and the side effects are manageable with Vit B6 and L Lycine. I will keep reading on. Good luck everyone.",

And have you heard of LDN? He researched it and wants me to go on it. The alternative doctors like it, but my oncologist says he does not know if it helps or not. you should talk to your oncologist about B6 and L Lycine.",

May be your oncologist knows. it is used in low dose up to 4.5 for Cancer, Chron's and MS. God knows but I try to get as much info as possible out side chemo options so far chemo did not help me, but i will not give up. My son takes it for Chron's and it is helping him. I don't know and wish they would study more these inexpensive therapies more. I copied and pasted from the link, LDN helps:",
