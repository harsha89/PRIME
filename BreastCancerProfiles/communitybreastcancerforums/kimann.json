My RAD doc did not recommend the shorter treatment becasue of the lack of long term study data.  I did some research also.  The boost for me-I am told-is focused on the incision: tumor removal site, rather than on the entire breatst. My boost starts in 2 days and I will have 5 treatments then I am finished! Take care of you-Good Luck.",
