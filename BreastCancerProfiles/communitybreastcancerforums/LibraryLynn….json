This is an exceptionally supportive group of people. The only surefire way to rule out cancer its to do a biopsy. If that is not done, the question remains. Odds are in your favor as 80% of biopsies are benign. I received my news the following day but that varies by provider. There is nothing the radiologist can tel you for certain without the biopsy. Go for your biopsy and do the best that you can to breathe and take care of yourself. Don't research Dr. Google because you will just scare yourself. Talk to a friend or close family member and acknowledgethat you are scared. This is, by far, the most difficult nerve-wracking time. I told everyone; that is counter to what a lot of people do but I needed the support. Do not hesitate to private message me or come to the board with your questions our feelings.

This time around, I was not able to afford to see a provider, so I did the next best thing. I found an audio that I would like to now recommend to anyone who is having any type of surgery. I obtained my copy on Audible.com. I don't know if it's available elsewhere.  It is called Preparing for Surgery: Hypnosis for Comfort and Healing. The narrator and author is an EMT named Maggie Staiger. It is about 15 minutes long. At first, I didn't know how I felt about her voice, but I quickly found comfort in it. I listened to it every night for the past two weeks as I was drifting off to sleep. I often fell asleep before it was half over, but that doesn't matter with hypnosis. In fact, I think it works better that way. I also listened to it at the hospital today to calm myself.  If anyone has any questions about it, feel free to PM me. I really think it helped me a great deal! Gentle hugs and healing white light to all.

I was absolutely terrified of the sentinel prep and wire location. I had the kindest most wonderful radiologist (a woman), and I didn't feel a poke or pinch! I had such a bad biopsy experience that I was very frightened, but it went like clockwork. My surgery was delayed due to a bit of a back-up with the surgeon, and I won't lie...the lengthy wait was hard on me. I went in at 2:15 and was eating jello by 5:00! And I hate Jello! :) My node was clear! Those were the words the surgeon said as I came out of anesthesia, and they were the best words ever.  I want to say thank you to everyone here for being so amazing and getting me through this part of the journey.
