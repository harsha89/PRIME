And because it was weird; like hard and almost like attached to the chest wall; and I had to move my fingers in a certain motion and way in order to feel it; and it didn't hurt at all; and because I am the avoiding any emotional confrontation or drama type personality I basically decided to ignore it and avoid thinking about it; fast for are four years; maybe n more honestly; I rrecently was just thinking about breast cancer and such and remembered the lump; I didn't forget it; and kept trade off iit every so often; was even told by my GP that it was a normal lump Ann's would go away with my period (that was without actually feeling it however) Anywway; yesterday I decided. To check it out again after about 9 months of avoiding it as now; it's easy to feel; I miss don't need to move my fingers around to feel it so it has obviously grown in size and now iff I touch it and put pressure on it it hurts for quite a long. Time; it's about the size of a large pea or small marble; at the 11pm position on my left breast; not at the top though; sort of in the mid section; not the areole and not the ridge top ; it's hard; sort of oblong shaped immovable and there is some barely visible dimpling right above it; so basically; ion now concerned enough to go to the doctor; I hope; my father died of cancer; my mother has had ovarian cancer and hypoglycemmia; all four of my grandparents died of cancer both grandmas had breast cancer and four of six aunties have breast cancer and/or other cancers; so it definitely runs in my family; I am 29; 30 in March; and for the last year or so just feel ... I'll... Like tired all the time; my bones/muscles ache constantly; I feel dizzy for no reason often and my lymph nodes him my neck have had large lumps (indicating infection) in them foot about a year; I don't heal very fast; sometimes a simple pimple will take two months nine fore healing completely.... I just need to know some experienced opinions on my situation.... I don't have a family doctor so I will have to go into a walk in clinic in order to get this checked.... I've never had a mammogram before.... Thanks all! Log in to post a reply",
