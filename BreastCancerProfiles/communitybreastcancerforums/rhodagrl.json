Not too bad at all. Though she only took one sample. Results next day are stromal fibrosis. B9. I ask for a copy of the reports.  I look up all the words and decide I need a second opinion. I go to a breast center in a large city with a good rep. The doctor is a oncologist/surgeon. She said I was right to come in. The mass hasn't gotten larger 1.6cm), but it has changed shape. It has angular margins and is hypoechoic w/internal echoes. She said it needed to come out which is what we are doing tomorrow. Can someone tell me about the wire thing? I will be under for the excis. but not the wire insert and it is making me a little freaky now. I try not to think about and just get informed so I will know what they are talking about, but I need some help. Forgive the misspellings. These words are still new to me. Thanks for your help.

The wire locater did hurt a bit when the Dr. had to move the wire around to get it the right position, but alls well that ends well. I found out yesterday that it was benign. Am very happy about that. I did ask for a copy of the report so I could read all the info myself. Thanks for the well wishes too. Rhodagrl",
