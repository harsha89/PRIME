I made sure I put makeup on and earrings -anyway, I noticed that other women gave me such strange looks .. it was annoying... I was at a mall so it wasn't women I knew but some looked at my head and quickly looked away.. as I passed some women in the ladies room, I smiled but not one smiled back.. honestly I felt sad about their reactions - I thought with it being Breast Cancer Awareness month maybe they'd figure out why I had the short hair but I guess I needed a t-shirt saying \"I got my hair-do from Chemo\".. Tomorrow I'll be wearing my wig again as I can't face this reaction at work yet..",

I have 7 treatments left and so far so good - the area is pinky brown but doesn't hurt and isn't burned..The center did tell me if I needed anything stronger, they would give it to me but so far this is great! one night I thought it was itchy, and I read here someone mixed cortisone with the aquaphor and I did that and the itch was gone. I know people use different cream, lotions and oils - whatever works for you is good.",
