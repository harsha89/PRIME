I tell them, \"Have you FORGOTTEN what I've already been through?? I can't possibly be any stronger than what I already am! Yesterday I got my written pathology report from the biopsy, all it says is this.....invasive adenocarcinoma with focal cribiform pattern. ER/PR stains pending.   They had my biopsy sample for 2 weeks and one day and that's all they can tell me? I was expecting to see a specific type (ductal, lobular), and a decription how how the cells appeared under microscope (low-grade, intermediate, high-grade).  So I'm kind of disappointed with that.. I am scheduled for a right-sided mastectomy on Wednesday. I say, why take the chance? Take it...I can always have reconstruction. And although I thought I wanted a Sentinel Node Biopsy, I think I will opt for taking all the lymph nodes...again, why take the chance of leaving something behind. But apparantely, the surgery could change depending on the findings of a bone scan and chest x-ray, but I'm hoping for good results!",

I saw my surgeon yesterday, but I made my doctor do the referral the day I had my biopsy. That's why I was able to get in quickly. My doctor says Sentinel Biopsy is accurate 90% of the time. So my thinking was if I could have all the auxillary nodes removed, it would be 100%. At least one less place for the cancer to be...she says you have a 20% chance of developing Lymphadema.....20% vs.10%.....Lymphadema won't kill me, but cancer cells can. That is my reasoning, but then again, I'm new at this, and don't really know what I'm talking about anyway, lol. Is it that ugly and debilitating when you just have just the auxillary nodes removed too?",

I think it means (and please forgive me people if I'm wrong, I'm new to all this) that the cancer is no longer considered \"curable\", but treatable. Once you have mets you are classified as stage 4 (I think). I had an abdominal scan and liver function tests done last week...they are clean....YAY!  Bone scan and chest x-ray today....keeping my fingers (and toes) crossed.",
