I agree with Susan that it is hard to ask for and accept help.  This may be the one thing I learned from this whole cancer experience.  People want to help and it's ok to let them help you.  Sometimes I think part of being strong is knowing when you need help.  I am blessed to have the most wonderful neighbors and friends.  I had meals brought to me, people driving me to appointments when I needed a driver and neighbors taking care of my lawn and shoveling snow.  There's no way I could have done it myself. ",

For the AC I was given a prescription for Emend to take before chemo and for 2 days after.  It prevents nausea and works really well (it's really expensive though).  I always ate before chemo and never got sick.  After your first chemo you'll figure out what works best for you.  Don't eat your favorite meal - if you get sick, you might not ever want it again.  There is no reason for you to get nausea, they have drugs that will prevent it. The day after chemo I was given a shot of Neulasta.  The Neulasta made my bones and muscles sore beginning the day after the shot and lasted for 2-3 days.  I sailed through the AC without any problems, only the pain from the Neulasta.  They cut the Neulasta dose way back because my blood counts would get too high (that's what was causing the pain in my bones).  I got a stomach ache after my first chemo and they put me on Prilosec for the duration of chemo.  The only other thing was the steroids.  I would get very flushed and my vision would be blurry for a couple days. The Taxotere was not much fun, but doable.  My nails became stained and spotted and lifted in places, though I never lost a nail.  I had some neuropathy in my fingers and toes but it has since gone away.  I got very tired with the Taxotere.    My last chemo was Jan. 17th. My fingernails are almost all grown out and look normal again (toenails will take much longer).  My hair started to grow back halfway through the Taxotere and is now about 1 1/4\" long.  If any symptoms come up, whether or not you think they're a side effect, be sure to let your ONC know.  They've seen it all and can help you out.  Be gentle with yourself and know that you can get through it. Take care, Pam",
