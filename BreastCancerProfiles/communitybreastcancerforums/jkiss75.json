I am in the process of getting a 2nd opinion from them but it is in another state from me so it would be a very huge task to get to them every other week. So I am curious if anyone has been there and can tell me if it would be worth the effort.

I have been lurking but it is really hard keeping up with you ladies and this thread especially when I have a computer savvy almost 2yr who wants to play her game the minute I sit at the computer. Anyway first treatment went fine had a bit of reaction to the Taxotere, but just needed a bit more steroids and voila!  The hair is just starting to lightly fall out, I am not ready for the buzz cut...I guess I am not brave enough. Through this I am realizing what it means to have married a man who is emotionally detatched, this is not a surprise to me, but I never thought I would need more from him then he is capable of giving. I was wrong. This year has been shit. We bought more of house then we could afford and you all know what the economy is doing and the husbands job is construction, so you can do the math. We had to put our beloved dog down that we had had since a puppy and I haven't taken a moment to realize that pain, the daughter has been chronically sick and the cancer rounded out the end of the year events. I MISS my boob I want it back, I want my dog back...I need some love and emotional support. I have hardley even cried since the diagnosis and didn't cry durning the masectomy...I am having chemo nightmares...I am just a wreak and it is hard to breathe with a 22 month old wanting every moment of your time and a husband who has checked into the Pabst Motel. I don't mean to bring the positive vibe down but I know you babes are the only ones who will even understand how I am feeling.  I know I just need to cry, cry and cry. Thanks for being here. ",

I can see there has been loads of activity here. I was supposed to start treatment on Jan 3rd but didn't. I now have a new Onc and the decision has been made: Taxotere/Carboplatinum (edited-oops typed the wrong drug) 4 x3wks with Herceptin 1wk for a year and treatment is starting Jan 25th. I am feeling down today because he really is pushing getting a port, I don't want to but I also really dont have a very good vein in my good arm. The port procedure is scheduled for the 23rd only 2 days before treatment. I am looking for port experiences from you beautiful jewels was it bad getting it put in? Should I try without it? Thanks, Jenny ",

Made it through the 2nd treatment and had an even worse reaction to the taxotere, but overall it was much easier this time around.   Glad to see you guys are as chatty as ever...and it is seriously hard to get through all the posts...that is some fantastic support. Just some info to pass along, I take 8 gms x2 daily of L-glutamine to help protect against the neroapathy, it seems to be working for me, but I am also not doing the AC T treatment. Kimberly--I am always amazed by your shout outs to everyone...how do you do that??? Keep it up, hope you are feeling better soon.  Anyway glad you jewels are here! XOXOXOX Jenny ",

What is everyones choice for covering the baldness??? Just curious, I have been knitting hats for myself not into the wig thing. Vettegal--We are doing the exact same treatment on the same days. I will think of you tomorrow while I sit there taking in the drugs. Good Luck!!!",

      "Content": "Feb 23, 2008 03:43PM - edited Feb 23, 2008 03:48PM by jkiss75 Hi All, My reaction happens the second the saline is out of the tubing and I get the first drip of T. It starts with this weird nausea feeling in my stomach and then it moves right up my chest (lost of pressure), then to my throat and this time I seriously thought my head was going to explode, the skin on my cheeks was so tight they were going to split right open. I can breathe but feel like I need to work to keep breathing. It is kind of that feeling just before you pass out but you are concious and lastly I turn extremely bright red.  It doesn't really hurt but it is uncontrollable all I can do is sit it out until is slowly recedes. I also have been getting intravenouse IV infusions of Vit C 30-50 grams, mixed with B vitamins and Magnesium, which I think helped me kick that terrible cold that has been going around. I just stop all supplements 2 days prior to treatment and don't start until 3 days after, so the chemo has time to do its thing. KathyL--I have also been getting eye twitching thing as well and was wondering the same thing but I have just been waiting to see my ND next week to get the IV infusion because the Magnesium will help with the twitch. I will ask him what he thinks and report back. Jenny ",
