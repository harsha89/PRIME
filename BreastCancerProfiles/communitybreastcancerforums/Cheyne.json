It is very hard and deep within my breast, in the bottom right side of my left breast, running from nearly the bottom of the breast to just under the areola (I have very small breasts). If I get a hold of it between my fingers - not easy as it seems attached to a dense mass- possibly the rest of the mammary - I can move it up and down, but the rest of the breast moves with it - i.e. it is rooted firmly in the breast but not to the bone/chest wall. It is painful and if I accidentally lean on a table edge or someone hugs me it hurts terribly and I become aware of the hardness of it. The whole of the breast is firm, hard, dense and painful - especially the outer edge - but this widespread tenderness and density may be related to my newly diagnosed pregnancy (I conceived two weeks ago). I have been aware of this lump and this pain for 3-4 weeks. In August and October last year I went to the doctor with symptoms of pain, a small lump, and localised red, raised rash on the breast above where the lump is now. I am 32. I've never been on the pill. I have not breast fed for 12 years. My breasts are small, I am not overweight and I have had no trauma to the breast, breast surgery or previous cancer. If they give me an ultrasound is there a risk that it will not show up/see a lump that is so deep within the breast?  Please help!!!? xxx   Log in to post a reply",
