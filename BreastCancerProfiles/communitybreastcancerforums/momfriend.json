      "Content": "momfriend wrote: I'm 43 years old; no family history of breast cancer until my mom was diagnosed 8 years ago (she's doing great now). Her sister, my aunt, was diagnosed with a different kind of breast cancer in April, so she's the second woman in the family to get it. Since last August I've been mildly concerned about some aching and occasional shooting pains in my right breast, but I read that breast pain is usually not an indicator of cancer so I tried to put it out of my mind. This spring, around the time of my aunt's diagnosis, I noticed a thickening in the tissue within the right half of my right breast. The area is also tender to the touch. I was worried until I felt a similar thickening in my other breast, and started to wonder if maybe that's just the normal landscape of my breast that somehow I'd never noticed before. I also noticed an indentation on my right areola, just under the nipple, about 1/2 inch long, but it's only visible when I lie down. I had a routine mammogram last August that didn't show anything suspicious, but my aunt's cancer was missed on a diagnostic mammogram last November. She had gone to the doctor for a similar indentation and thickening. It wasn't until five months later (this past April) that she went back because the indentation had become more pronounced, and they found a 5cm tumor through ultrasound. She and I have similar symptoms and similarly dense breasts, which I know can obscure things on a mammogram. I finally saw my doctor yesterday, and he's concerned enough to send me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I'm currently waiting for those to be scheduled. I can't talk to my mom or aunt about this, because they'll be terrified, and my aunt is currently undergoing her own ordeal. Part of the reason I hesitated to see a doctor is that I kept asking myself, what are the chances that both my aunt and I would have the same cancer at the same time? Then a few weeks ago I happened to speak to a woman recently diagnosed with stage 3a cancer (the first in her family) who asked her sisters to get screened for cancer, and sure enough her little sister (who happens to be my age) has it, and required an immediate double mastectomy. (!) So all of these thoughts and worries are swirling around in my head, and I have nobody to talk to. I'm single, and although my sons are technically grown I could never burden them with this worry. I know I need to stay away from Dr. Google, but it's hard. I just needed to getthis off my chest I guess - no pun intended. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2017 10:59AM - edited Jul 8, 2017 11:00AM by momfriend Final update (sorry for the delay): The diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were done on July 3. Everything looked fine, so I'm not scheduled for any follow ups aside from a yearly mammogram. I can't help feeling a little embarrassed about this false alarm, and I have a weird sense of guilt for turning out to be cancer free on a forum filled with beautiful souls who have been drawn into battle with this evil disease. But I want to leave this update for any not-diagnosed-but-worried women who might find this thread through a Google search of their symptoms, so that they can know that even in some cases such as mine when there are multiple worrying symptoms, your tests may actually come out negative. So try to relax (easier said than done), and continue to lean on the amazing women and men on these forums. I owe special thanks to one particular member who was a great comfort to me through private messages. L, I wish you the best in your journey. x",

I think this is a new symptom but I can't be totally sure -- I've just never paid enough attention. I'm really mad at myself, for a number of reasons. First, that I'm about 50 pounds overweight and don't exercise regularly or have a healthy diet, so I feel like I brought this on myself. Second, that I didn't pursue my concerns about breast pain last year. Third, that I never did regular self-exams, and don't have a strong familiarity with the landscape of my breasts. And fourth, that I spent all of last weekend in bed feeling scared and depressed, instead of spending time with my aunt who is undergoing chemo for stage 3b breast cancer and lives less than two miles from me. I think part of why I'm avoiding her is that I don't want to risk breaking down and telling her -- she would not handle it well. I remember the look of terror in her eyes when I asked her after her diagnosis to describe the \"thickening\" she had felt in her breast. I asked because I was also feeling a thickening in mine, and she immediately intuited that. I basically had to lie and say I wasn't feeling anything weird in my breasts at all. I finally called my brother and told him about my symptoms and upcoming tests. I needed to talk to someone. He's been wonderful. Really supportive. When I told him how weak I feel in the face of uncertainty compared to the pillars of strength that my mom and aunt were/are in the face of their very real breast cancer diagnoses, he said that I'm allowed to feel human. He said, \"Curl up for a while and then come back fighting,\" and I like that. I've been doing better since the work week started. Work has helped keep my mind off of things. But I still haven't torn myself away from Google, like I know I should. I've been doing a lot of research on bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction, because every bit of me wants these breasts gone gone GONE, and has wanted that since my mom's diagnosis eight years ago. When my aunt was diagnosed in April, my mind screamed \"Get these off of me!\" I mean, I'm reeeeally done with them. I haven't nursed a baby in 18 years. I haven't dated in over a decade, and I'm not interested in dating in future (my trick whenever I feel lonely is to peruse the personals ads -- then all I feel is gratitude for being on my own). And I've frankly never been fond of these things. They're not remotely conventionally attractive. I've always been embarrassed by them. They get in the way. I loathe the discomfort of bras. And the worst thing is, they feel like ticking time bombs. I told my brother about my desire to go flat (I've been learning the lingo), and he was 100% supportive. Even if I get the all-clear after next week's scans, I'm glad I've had the opportunity to think this through, so that if I ever do get a diagnosis I'll know for certain what I want to do: get rid of these breastsand not look back.",
