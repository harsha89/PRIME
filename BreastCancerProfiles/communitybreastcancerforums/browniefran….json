      "Content": "May 8, 2011 05:49PM - edited May 8, 2011 05:58PM by browniefranks Core needle biopsies sample different areas of the tumor and while one section may appear be DCIS, another may appear benign and another may be grade 2. It depends on how the tumor is progressing, and where the radiologist samples. The best approach is MRI with contrast followed by excisional biopsies.  I am sorry they put you through all this before you were finally diagnosed but breast cancer can be anywhere there is breast tissue including armpits. BTW I remember when I was nursing my first child and I had milk squirt out of my armpits, I was shocked. Maybe484 Grade 2 is good! Thank goodness it was diagnosed at a treatable stage. No nodes involvement is great. Now your focus is to treat it and get to a new type of normal. Good luck and feel free to vent any time.  My cancer was closer to my chest wall/muscle and the surgery left me very weak on that side. It's likely that you may have residual pain from armpit surgery, but you should talk to your doctors about minimizing nerve damage during surgery as well as your concerns. Speak up to them! Good luck with treatment.",

It's frustrating when Doctors act like the gate keepers to access to proper health instead of partners in our health care. My radiologist did want to do a biopsy even after myself and my primary care physician insisted on it, he gave me the option to return in a week for the biopsy or watch till next physical (1 year), since according to him \"it was likely nothing.\" Fortunately, I came back in a week and did not wait. When will these people stop lying to women that they can tell what a lump is without a biopsy? Only a pathology report can 100% diagnose cancer. MRI, Mammogram, ultrasound, BSE are all detection tools. When a woman walks into the room and she knows there is a lump there, she wants to know what it is, not be patronized or dismissed.  Maybe484, all my fingers and toes are crossed for a positive outcome... ",
