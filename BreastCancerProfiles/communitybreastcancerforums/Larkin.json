The reality is my blood work isn\u2019t always fine and I\u2019m definitely lower energy than I use to be. One day I was at the cancer center and the nurse navigator was talking to me. I was bragging about how well I\u2019m doing and she said to me, \u201cThat will change.\u201d It felt as if she had punched me in the gut. I know barring a cure, she is right but damn I like my Ibrance commercial style life right now. That is the reality of our disease though, it will progress. For most of us, within three years, maybe five. Yes, there are those that live well for years but we can\u2019t expect that to last forever. It\u2019s frustrating when commercials present MBC as some simple disease like high cholesterol where one can take a pill and go on their merry way. Sure, maybe for a time, but not endlessly. Here\u2019s to all of us living well and doing well for as long as possible and here\u2019s to our daughters and granddaughters having a real and true cure someday. Those us us afflicted now can only hope for more time of living well",

Your mom's RO might not mean to be negative but it might be that he understands that radiation side effects might be too harsh for your mom.

Last week, I found out for sure that I am now stage 4 with mets to the lymph nodes in my upper posterior neck. PET looks clean on the rest of me but I'm not convinced as my original cancer didn't show either. Tumor markers were useless and stayed in the normal range they have been for years. No symptoms, just one hard lymph node I could feel (turns out there was a chain of cancerous ones, they took out 3.) From August 1st at my check up, it took a month of 1. ultrasound (inconclusive), 2. PET (inconclusive) 3. ultrasound biopsy (yep, inconclusive) and finally last Monday, surgical removal of nodes. Tomorrow, they present me to the tumor board and I see the surgeon and MO for treatment plans. Tentatively, looks like switching from Femara that I've done all these years (I'm 48 now) to a shot instead (Armidex I think, as you can understand I'm in a zone these days!) Probably radiation to my neck and when that's done, Ibrance. We'll see.

Nine years of Fermara was not fun! I'm really sitting on thinking about who I want to tell and who I don't what to tell...that's a whole thread! We want to radiate the neck since the mets aren't yet showing anywhere else and we all feel like it's an opportunity we don't want to miss since we know active cells are right there.
