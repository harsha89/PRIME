Tumor size, oncotype score, age of the patient, family history can all factor into an oncologists decision. Nevertheless, get a second or even third opinion.  I had a 2 cm, mixed grade I and II IDC in my right breast.  Four rounds of AC were recommended and I chose to follow that recommendation because I wanted to know that I had done everything I possibly could to guarantee my survival.    Other women with my diagnosis may have decided to forgo chemo. Arm yourself with as much information that you can.  Make sure you feel comfortable with your oncologist's skill and personality.  Make your decision and don't second guess yourself. The best of luck to you! ",

I had my sister-in-law drop me off/pick me up for my first chemo.  They gave me Ativan which made me pretty spacy.  For subsequent sessions I walked the mile to/from my brother's house to the hospital and said no to Ativan. I found the nurses to be warm, solicitous and found the time passed pretty quickly looking at magazines and watching a movie on my portable DVD player. The chemo infusion is no big deal.  The effects of chemo afterwards varies from person to person but I found myself able to drive the 3.5 hours back to my house the morning after the infusion without difficulty. Good luck with chemo.  Don't feel guilty about expressing your needs.  If you would feel better having someone with you, then do that. ",

I have recently met a woman who is wearing her compression sleeve (but not glove) but not doing MLD, breathwork or wrapping at night.  I think it is because she finds the whole experience so overwhelming.  I would like to help make the whole process a little easier on her. Any help you can offer would be appreciated as the closest LANA certified therapist is 70 minutes away and it is impractcal for this individual to travel that far. Casey    Log in to post a reply",

I am a physical therapist trained but not certified in manual lymphatic drainage. As you may already know, MLD is quite superficial and quite effective. Conventional massage (let alone deep tissue) would simply mash the damaged lymphatic system.  Having said that, the rest of your lymphatic system is functioning well (The principle behind manual lymphatic drainage is to reroute the lymphatic fluid to functioning channels) and can tolerate both Swedish and deep tissue massage. I hope this info is helpful.",
