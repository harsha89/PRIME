It was uneventful, just like the 1st one. My hair is still hanging in there. I figured it would be much worse by now. The nurses were surprised how much hair I still have. I am definitely shedding a lot, but no real clumps. I am prepared with a wig, but mentally not so prepared. I had a few minor side effects the first time around. Burning tongue, some diarrhea, but pretty minor compared to what some of you ladies have been dealing with. I had one scare. A fever of 102.4...turns out I had a skin infection on my left side. Somewhere between the chest muscle being stretched by the TE and my skin. It was all red, swollen and hot to the touch. It cleared up pretty quickly with antibiotics and I was cleared for treatment yesterday. Thank you all for being here and sharing. It has really been a blessing for me to have found this place :) Jen",

If it comes out with the exchange, then I have to deal with \"finding a good vein\" for the remainder of the Herceptin infusions. If I keep it in until after Herceptin, then I have to deal with another surgery and a new scar to get the port out. I really like the convenience of the port. I see so many people having problems in the chemo room without one. Anyone else have to make this decision? Not sure what to do. Thanks.
