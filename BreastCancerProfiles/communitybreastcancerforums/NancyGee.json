      "Content": "NancyGee wrote: Like many in this forum, I never thought I would be in this situation. Based on my second more detailed mammogram and ultrasound (9/20), I was listed as a B-5. I've already met with the breast surgeon (9/24) and had my biopsy (9/27). My followup is scheduled for 10/8. My surgeon said that 90% of B-5's are cancerous. I expect to hear from them by phone this week with those results. I'm hoping sooner rather than later. Another test will be done on those results, if in fact they are cancerous. I'm confused about this estrogen/progesterone and positive and negative test that will follow. Can anyone elaborate? Also, when I get the biopsy results will it only show negative or positive for cancer? If it is cancer, will it say what type of cancer it is then or when and how is that determined? Thank you in advance for any information you can offer! Log in to post a reply",
