I have an appointment with a breast surgeon for a consult on Monday.  Completely stressing out and time is going by so very slow....",

I'm so confused reading all the material on-line.  Has anyone had a complex cyst that turned out to be malignant?  And how is what i have a cyst if no fluid came out? Oh...and I'm getting married in 2 weeks and I just consumed a bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups from the stress.  Damn Halloween candy!  Never buy it early! Log in to post a reply",
