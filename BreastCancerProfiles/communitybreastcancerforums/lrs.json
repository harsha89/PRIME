I am on femera and agreed to be on the LISA program, I have lost the 30lbs I put on and another 20lbs so far. Feeling great. The one thing for sure on the LISA program they promote healthy eating, low fat lifestyle is the key so far. Since fat produces estrogen and if you are ER+ it can't hurt. Moderate exercise is at least walking 15 to 30min a day. That is all I have done and It has worked. Don't be down on yourself if you gain, keep healthy during treatment. Good luck. LRS",

L.I.S.A stands for Lifstyle intervertion study in adjuvant treatment of Early Breast Cancer, The lifestyle balance program is designed to help make lifestyle changes that will promote weith loss. \"Lifestyle Balance\" is to help me reach a balance between two parts of my lifestyle one is food I eat and the other is physical activity. The hormone inhibitor drugs can cause many aches and pains and they found that the more/any exercise you do it helps manage that. Also loosing weight can't hurt either.Since fat produces estrogen and I am (ER/PR and Her2+) Â One of the things that they also are trying to show that you can loose weight while on the drugs. So far so good. Its a two year programe once it is all said and done and I am on the part that has a coach that helps me. They talk about good choices and bad, encourage me all the time, not to beat myself up if i slip up. Teachs you how to read the lablels on foods, about good fat's and bad that kind of thing. I do know my oncologist said at this time the study is for people on Femera, and it has not been offered to people on tamoxifin or other drugs so far as I know, I am also in Canada, I know that they told me people in Austrailia were also doing the trial. Don't know about the US. When I started the trial I was 210, 5:4, that was July last year All I had to do to loose 10% of my body weight by christmas was to reduce my fat intake and lower my calories. They said stay under 1600 calories and 38grams of fat. I lost the 20 pounds by end of september and by christmas I had lost another 20. Since then I am down another 10. The only thing that has changed is when I went down to 170 they advise that if I wanted to continue to loose weight gradualy was to lower my calories to 1500 and fat to 33. I walk for 1 hour twice a week and I go to an exercise class 3 times a week. I spoke to my coach at the begining every week, now it is once a month. The time gets spread out more and more so that I am not dependant on them. If you want to know how much fat/calories somthing has and it is not on the packaging. go to www.calorieking.com great source of info. for stuff like sushi. Hope that explains it a bit. sorry for not being here sooner. I hope before I have my ooph in june that I am down another 10 if not thats ok to, I feel great. lrs",
