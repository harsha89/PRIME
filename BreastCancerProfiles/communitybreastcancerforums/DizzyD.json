I am from England where the Oncotype DX isnt covered by our National Health so had to pay £2,500 to have it sent over to America. After an agonising decision as to whether or not to go for it we decided it would give me a chance not to do the chemo. After 2 weeks the test has come back but unfortunately due to my Oncologist being very busy he cant see me till monday 13th Feb, nearly two weeks after they have come back.  Luckily my Onco nurse has told me that my score had come back at 22 (low intermediate) and with all the research i have been doing and my worries about my cancer being a grade 3 and my lump being 1.8cm, it wasnt the low score that i had wanted. Have now spent many sleepless nights thinking about what to do. I dont want to take any risks and being only 47 with 3 children i am  definately leaning towards the chemo, but so scared as to what it will do to me that i cant quite make that decision yet.  I hope all went well for you today and that you have been able to get to a final decision cos this 'GREY' area really stinks!!!!!",

After so much waiting i thought this appointment was the last one on the waiting list. Brilliant I was node negative and they had got clear magins on my tumour which was 1.8cm at its largest point.  But unfortunately we were then told that the tumour was a grade 3 and not a grade 2 , which was their first assumption.  We were in shock, we thought we were going to be told this is what it is and this is what you have to do, but this was not the case. We were told about a test in America, oncotype dx, which could help us with our decision whether to have chemo or not, but it would cost £2,500. After a week of do i, dont i we decided to get out our savings and go for it. Now over two weeks down the line my tests are back!!! Although i cant see my oncoloigist for over a week due to them being very busy, they have told me i have a score of 22 which is low intermediate. I have been doing alot of research and i am still sitting on the fence as to what to do. Chemo, no Chemo, Chemo, no Chemo. I dont want to take any risks so my gut is telling me to go with it but ............ God i dont know.  Any advice out there would be really welcome as we dont have any kind of info over here or chat forums with other peoples experiences.  Many thanks if you have taken time to read my rantings. x Dx 11/23/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I dont seem to be able to put down in words what i am thinking or feeling. Everyone else seems to be so fluent in the BC thing!!!  It has helped me in reaching my decision as to whether to have chemo or not though. I went to see my oncologist today and have made the decision to go ahead with chemotherapy. I dont want to have any regrets in the future if this horrible thing does come back and beig a grade 3 scared the life out of me as it may have decided to go on walk about!! My Onco was so kind and even though he was happy for me not to do it he reassured me there was not right or wrong answer with the onco score i had.  I wont be starting mine until April as i am just about to start radiotherapy, which we wanted to kick start while waiting for my results to come back from America, so doing it all a bit back to front but am assured that this will not have a detrimental affect on my treatment. Unfortunately they cant give you any answers to whether it is going to come back or not long term but at least i will have done everything i can.",
