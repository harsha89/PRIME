I lost my hair In 16 days. First I cut it in half, then it just started falling it out very fast so I had to shave it as hair was everywhere. I got 4 cheap wigs totally 388.00 from this place in Michigan. They have highlights so they look pretty real. My problem is I tend to be hot a lot anyway so I don't like to walk around in the heat. Chemo is chemo. Trying to endure. There are about 4 days where I just need to sit and shut the world off. Just look at it as a means to an end. You will get thru It. I hope you have lots of friends and family support Keep in touch",

I am also headed towards Armidex for 5 years..Anyone taking that and what kind of side effects are you having?  There are so many different pills I wonder why they pick that over another?  I am still working out, eating pretty healthy, and staying positive but such a long journey and lots of alone time",

I am stage 1 no lymph nodes but did a double and so glad I did as they found early cancer cells right side.  I had a 1.5 cm tumor left.  I finished my third chemo Monday, three to go.. I am ER positive HER2 +++ so have to get Herceptin for 6 months more after chemo then a pill after that for 5 years.  Trying to change diet, water supply putting reverse osmosis on our home.  Drinking from BPA containers.  Eating more fruit and veggies and exercising more than ever. The first few months is the worst, finding out, trying to decide what doctors to use, making the decision on lump vs taking them off.  Waiting for the results from the surgery and then sitting for 3 weeks with drain tubes not able to do much.  But every day it gets better.. The most important thing is eating right, getting lots of rest and STAYING POSITIVE!  And Praying",
