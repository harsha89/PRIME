I had 8 lymph nodes removed and that's where I'm having pain. I'm actually 11 days post op and was feeling pretty good till yesterday. Woke up with a lot more pain in my arm pit and, then, started running a fever in the early evening. It didn't go to over 100 but I have to say, it scared me! The doctor said everything looks really good. This is just all so new and scary for someone who only ever went to the doctor for routine exams over my lifetime.",
