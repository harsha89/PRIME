In mid-October, a random pulsating burning sensation had me going for a Mammo and U/S in an abundance of being overly cautious. My OB/GYN thought it would be nothing. And it was. It ended up being a cyst that had burst. However, it just so happened that my Mammo showed a Radial Scar, as did my U/S. One thing led to another, the suspected 'radial scar' was biopsied and confirmed to be just that and in addition to the Radial Scar they also found ADH there. During this month long ordeal, my mother went for her yearly mammo (they had always been normal) and low and behold, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. My Moms sister (my Aunt) got BC at 49. So here I was now with ADH, which is a high risk issue, a Radial Scar (which can hide cancer) and a strong family history. Add to that other risk factors of having a child after 30 and extremely dense breast tissue and well, it put my risk for getting BC between 50-70% according to the Surgeons. I immediately knew that I was going to opt for a Mastectomy and thats what Im doing. On Dec 20th , I will be having a Bilateral Mastectomy w/Nipple Sparing Recon. I am 100% sure that this is what I want to do. Besides the hard #'s that show my high risk, I also have a very strong intuitive gut feeling that BC is on its way to me, its just a matter of time. So I am going to beat it to the punch. It was a no brainer for me. Im a single Mom and only parent to a 6 yr old and there is no way I would take any chances.",
