But thank you so much for posting the specifics of your results. They look so confusing. If my results are not benign I am sure I am going to have to do lots of research.  Clarice and Karen- keep us posted.  Hoping for all of us! So I am a teacher as well- boy the first week of school is a perfect time to have to wait for biopsy results- I have been so busy/distracted- until time to sleep that is.",
