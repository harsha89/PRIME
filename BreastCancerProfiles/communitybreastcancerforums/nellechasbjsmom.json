I kind of pushed it to the back of my mind since we had company visiting and so much going on. It has been nagging at me, and I have finally got an appointment with the doctor on Thursday the 19th . I have felt calm through all this and have been trying to stay positive , but now I'm getting really nervous and scared. I have not shared this with anybody, not even my husband, I don't want to worry my family. I have only had one family member with BC, my cousin on my dads side of the family,she was 35 when diagnosed, and lost her battle 18 motnhs later.  I have done so much searching on the net, and everything seems to come back to BC.  The lump feels hard and in mobile and painless , but if I push on it hard it feels kind of soft in the middle, and is starting to feel sore I guess from messing with it. There are no lymph nodes swollen or lumps any where else. Has anybody had a lump on their collarbone, could this be a lymph node? I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, but I am starting to  freak out, and had to get this out. I don't want to tell my family anything until I know something..  Log in to post a reply",
