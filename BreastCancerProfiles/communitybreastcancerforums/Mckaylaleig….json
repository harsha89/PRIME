Out of habit, I even ordered a new one over the holidays totally spacing that I wouldn't 'be able to wear it in a few months. I am planning on getting some prosthetics (Is that what you ladies call forms?), so I am hoping to make them work some how.  Probably a pipe dream though :P To add, after reading this thread and replying, I went a searched the boards a little. I found this thread and ladies said they make bean bags and put them in their bras. I still have to do more research and it may not look as good as a prosthetic, but I may be willing to try it at least around the house so I def will be keeping my bras, for now anyway! https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/82/topics/767671 ",

      "Content": "Apr 26, 2016 06:27PM - edited Apr 26, 2016 08:59PM by Mckaylaleigh This is my concern. I had surgery on base, was told it would be sent off to a lab.  The day after my surgery my BS told me they were sent off.  After three weeks and no results, I asked my BS. She told me they weren't sent off and they often aren't with DCIS which was NOT what she originally told me, TWICE.  I looked at my surgery report and it said they were to be sent of within 48 hours.  My concern is that the \"quick look\" they did while I was in surgery said \"no DCIS seen and no biopsy clip seen.\"  Well, I had 7+cm of DCIS and obviously the biopsy clip was there.  My BS (who is a general surgeon) assured me that all is well, that my breasts are gone and I shouldn't worry.  How can I not worry if all they did was a quick look and didn't even see what we KNOW was there? How can they say without certaintly that it wasn't invasive if they didn't even see the DCIS that was there? I don't know if this was an error on their part or not but I have been pretty upset about it.",

I am not sure what approach to take at this point, part of me just wants to let it go but I find myself on the verge of tears daily and having a hard time with it emotionally. I read of other women going to BC specialists and centers and I was forced to go on base where I have questioned things the whole time. My results are also really bad, I can't even bare to look in the mirror. I wanted to go off base and I tried, I should have fought harder and went with my instincts but everyone who had surgery on base (not breasts) always said they had good experiences.  I did feel kind of bullied by my BS when I questioned why my pathology wasn't sent off.  They have always acted like this all was no big deal and when I was authorized to get my 2nd opinion off base with a great BS, she took things much more seriously.   I hate that I have to deal with all this and I believe I may go to the patient advocate!!",

I will do it differently from now on. I had all new military members all probably under 23 (some probably barely 18) taking care of me in the hospital and my care was lacking. The RN I had (and oldest person) for my night care in the hospital spent the night (at 12:30 at night) complaining about her boyfriend and his Mom and showing me a couch she wants to buy. My husband has even considered filing a complaint. I only saw my surgeon at discharge for about two minutes,  I haven't had any phone calls to check on me and certainly haven't had any nurse care. Not that I think I need it, I am handling everything ok, but I really feel like I was just thrown to the wolves to figure things out on my own.  Thank God for you ladies!",
