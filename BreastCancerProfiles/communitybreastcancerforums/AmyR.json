I dread the possibility of a result that may mean big changes to my health and daily living, but I will cope with whatever results come through. I've been through some pretty rough times and while I sometimes think of myself as fragile, I will make it through this if I have to. I guess I needed to spend a few days having an internal \"emotional barf-o-ramma\" as I call it. I go for my biopsies at 7:50 in the morning. I'm letting a friend take me this time instead of going alone. I couldn't get in touch with the ordering physician of test because I had no idea who it was. Finally had a nurse look it up and I've never met this person. I think a HUGE part of my anxiety has come from not being able to talk to a doctor about all of this. I lost insurance 8 months ago because my cobra ran out and I'm waiting for disability to kick in. I decided to call my gp that I'd seen for 17 years prior to this and she has been on vacation. I requested all of my images and reports be sent to her. She is back from vacation tomorrow so I'm hoping she will call me tomorrow after my biopsy to tell me what she thinks. I've had both lumps and calcifications. They are scary in different ways. When I've had lumps, I've known they were there and could see them etc. The weird calcifications are so abstract and they are like some weird thing I can only try to imagine. I really thought that this mammogram was going to be totally fine because the last one had been. Finding the report on my own was about the worst way I could have found out because it left my mind open to imagine the very worst things ever. I had myself in surgery on a ventilator (due to side effects from my neuromuscular disease and surgery), my kids were living with my abusive ex, they were ready to flip out, my breasts were looped off crudely, and somehow despite the respirator, I was throwing up profusely, while I sported six scraggly long hairs from my head. Not a pretty site, huh? Lol Oh the places our heads can take us!",

I think it is so helpful that you show people here that breast cancer like my 33yo friend's is rare. Boards like this are typically where people are struggling hang out. So often people do encounter the freak exceptions and I think you are really great about pointing out that those are so incredibly unlikely. The truth is that I may or may not have breast cancer. I find out tomorrow, but I'm so incredibly relieved that I have come to the point where I don't feel like if it is, it is a death sentence or the worst possible thing that could happen. I have a lot of significant health problems that could complicate a diagnosis so I was freaking about that too.

The thing that has me winged out this time is that in addition to the suspicious 9mm leasion, the lymph nodes near it look abnormal. I have a cluster of whatever shaped microcalcifications and in the middle of it is the 9mm thing... I have a more detailed mammogram and ultrasound on Monday, but as soon as I read the results of the mammo, my stomach sank. I have a horrible state insurance and my doctor didn't even call to tell me any of this. I read the test result's in the hospital's Mychart page when I was looking for something else. It told me to call to schedule the follow-up tests. I hate not being able to see my regular doctors. My doc would have NEVER left it for me to read by chance...or wait to have a letter mailed to me weeks later. I feel so alone in all of this. I am a 43yo single mom of two teenagers. They've been through so much the past two and a half years I can't imagine having to tell them anymore bad news. A little over two years ago I was diagnosed with a neuro-muscular disease and then about 8 months later I fell on the ice and fractured my back. I've had to quit the teaching career I loved passionately. My neuro-muscular disease drains all of my energy so I can't even fathom taking on chemotherapy etc. One of my biggest fears though is that if I have to have any major surgery, I could wind up on a ventilator at least for a while. The anesthesia makes the muscles in a MG patient's lungs weak and shut down. The stress of surgery itself is asking for a HUGE flare. I didn't sleep for about 4 days straight once I found out. I tried to Google very scary statistics about breast cancer the next couple and then a couple of days ago, I forced myself to do life. I then was able to sleep at least some. Now I'm waiting until Monday to have the tests so I can wait until the radiologist posts the results so I probably schedule a biopsy after that. I wish they'd just do the biopsy and get it over with!

Well, shocking to both of us, I got pregnant despite really low odds. I had to wait until my baby was a few months old to have an MRI of my head. They found a .9 cm military microadenoma. When the nurse called me at school (while I was teaching) to tell me not to worry that I just had a small b9 tumor in my head, I about fell apart. My sister had died of a brain tumor and I was almost indignant that she was so certain it was b9. The doc and pretty much all I have read says that they really are. Most of the time, the only big problems are fertility and that in only rare instances they can press on an optic nerve and require surgery. I'd start by looking to see if there is a free medical clinic in your area. They should be able to help you find resources if they can't help you. First off, I'd ask them to run a blood test for Prolaxtin level. If it is high, it basically means your body is playing a mean trick on you to act like a nursing mom. For a while they just monitored mine with yearly MRI's and labwork. I haven't had any problems or symptoms for a number of years now. Deep breath! The unknown is always scares.",

I am thinking if I did lumpectomy, I'd constantly be worries because there are so many places they are watching. The thought of chemo and repeatedly poking is more daunting than the pain of a surgery. I threw up daily and was in and out of the hospital my who pregnancy with my son. I felt like I'd die.",

I'm thinking I won't tell them about anything until I have the biopsy and the results come back. I have q lot of other health problems and they've been through a lot. I do know that they are sensing my stress despite my best efforts to keep day to day things the same. I know they will be BIG TIME angry with me if they accidentally. The last biopsy, I told them about, but it was so different because it was just for calcifications. This really looks like the big C. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "AmyR wrote: Does the location of the lump or whatever the malignant thing is make a big difference as far as treatment? It just seems like in some instances it would make a huge difference. Because I can't feel these, I hadn't really considered that they were going to biopsy an area that was pretty much against my chest wall. I was reading my own results because I couldn't get a real live doctor to tell me what was going on . Sorry about letting my anger show through again. Anyway, it seems pretty likely that IF this is malignant, they will want to take the whole thing? The doc said that there are two clusters of calcifications. They look big on the magnified mammo, but I think they are around 1cm each more or less. I also don't think I can have radiation due to all of my autoimmune problems so that might impact things. I am REALLY glad that I only have to wait two more days to know what happens next in my life. Log in to post a reply",
