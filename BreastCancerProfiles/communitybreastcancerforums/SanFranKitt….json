Breast cancer runs on my moms side so i had double mastectomy and double reconstrction with round smooth saline implants. There is a thicker part of implant where they add the saline after they put them in. Anyway I think they have rotated a bit. For a long time my nerve damage kept me from feeling anything. But now I can feel and I have some pain on both sides, especially behind the side where the nipple almost fell off during the healing process. I have wondered if the valve is stuck behind there or something. Some days it's not so bad. Other days it hurts all day. my 6 month appointment is in 2 weeks.",
