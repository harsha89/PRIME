My husband and I had a great weekend reading the Dr. Loves Breast Book and oddly enough, Breast Cancer for Dummies.  We both wrote alot of questions down and I just got off the phone with my surgeon and she answered them all.  I met with a surgeon two days after my mammo/ultra sound was done.  I absolutely love her and her office staff.  My mast. is scheduled for 1/14.  They are doing the SNB right then also.  She'll scoot over (her words) to path with them and if they are pos, take some more, if not, leave those buggers in.  But the ta-ta is leaving.  Just the left, (so the left will leave as my daughter so lovingly has said).  I haven't cried yet. I'm sure it will come.  Just trying to get everything ready.  I'm in my early 40's with two teenage daughters who are so helpful.  My husband has been great, I only wish his company was more understanding about taking time off.  We're working on that now.  Here's a hug for you and I know its scary.  I have known now for 5 days and it still hasn't set in.  Love to you and your family - kim",

I would like him with me with we go to the onc. on 2/1, so he needs to take that day off.  I will get someone to drive me for my post-op, I'm ok there, but the first night is still the question. I'm still up in the air about my mother-in-law.  I do love her, but since I told her, she has called 3 times a day, which I know is great because she cares, but she is telling me to stop reading about \"it\", stop researching \"it\", just wait and see what happens, your looking ahead too much...  Its kind of driving me crazy.  For my sake I need to take control of this and know what can happen before it happens so I can ask the surgeon. I'm sure she means well, and I'm happy she feels so comfortable with me telling me this, but I don't know.  Maybe I'm just tired finally, and everything is starting to boil up.  Thanks for listening - Kim XO",

I had a nice talk with my husband and we worked out what will work best for us the first few days.  He is taking off the first two days then his mother will come during the day to help after that for a few days.  I have a list of questions for the surgeon and have things here at home ready.  I already had a feeling a recliner would work best.  I had so many biopsies done before the dx and I remember how more comfortable it was to sleep semi-reclined than flat.  (I'm a roller).  Great idea on getting the bathroom ready for sponge bath.  My one daughter was critically ill a few years back and when she finally came home from the hospital she was unable to walk on her own, so I have all those things somewhere.  I have a craft apron, kind of like the carpenter one, that has pockets on it.  I use it in class all the time, so I have that for the drains.  My good friend lives a few minutes away and she is a home health nurse, so if we run into a problem with drains, she said she will pop over right away.  And the acutally I got a call from my husbands mom last night, asking if we need anything and out of the blue she apologiezed if she was comign on strong or pestering.  She said she felt bad I didn't have a mom to talk to about it, but realized that I do have a great family with brothers and sisters, great friends and co-workers and that she might be smothering me.  (God is good and answers our prayers)  So - all worked out and def. my strong faith has helped.  I am just such a planner, and an A type, that maybe this is His way of telling me, let you and let people help for once.   (Plus I have you and all these great women on the board to help me) - thansk for everything - K ",

Laurel - is your 2nd treatment today - hope it went well.  I'm curious about the coffee too, gotta have my tea or coffee.   Nolana -how are you feeling today.I called the Dr. yesterday and I will not be taking steriods before my TC, only during, not sure after will find out tomorrow.  Its so interesting that each dr. has their own way of doing things.  I am only getting 4 treatments, so that might be why................ Patricia - YIKES on the PET scan.  I have to have mine scheduled still.  Insurance approved it, now I have to wait for the confirmation number.  What a great gift from your friend - I love the boxing gloves!  I hope the friend who is waiting for her score to come back has good news.  She is lucky to have you to help guide her and give her advice.  My score, when I finally got the right one-grrrr- was 22. Its a nerve racking wait. I hope hers comes back quickly.  I think poor Otter is still waiting, not sure. Krista good luck with your second treatment tomorrow.  I'll be thinking of you, as I get my first hook-up going. Bridget, I loved the feeling of freedom I had when my drains were out after my mastecomy.  I have yet to find a \"boobie\" I like, so around the house, I'm just hanging easy.  Have to go to the \"Boobie\" store still to find a fitter who can help me.  I have been wearing a cami with a support in it when I go out and wear lots of layers so no one can notice too much.      Well, I hope I did not forget anyone, I think I might have, but never on purpose.  I am forgetting everything lately, I forgot my poor daughter at school yesterday, Thank goodness for cell phones.  Hugs - K",

I would be having my 4th Chemo the week after we are back.  Any thoughts.........I am having really minimual s/e, only been 10 days out of my first treatment, but overall I've been really lucky.  Another qeustion  - hair.  I have super thick hair.  It is just now starting to thin alittle.  Did everyone lose their hair, or just go super, super thin.  It was 20 years ago, but my mom had Chemo for ovarian cancer and went for about 10 tx, she never lost hers completely, just really thinned out so she cut it into a short pixie cut.  I don't remember what her \"cocktail\" was though, maybe A/C.  I really don't care about losing it, just want to have an idea of what to expect, can't take the planner out of me.  This week is my PET/CT scan, looking forward to getting that over with.  I've been reading and catching up with all your posts.  You all make me smile.  Running in to say hi to work today, so I'm going to get ready - be well - Kim",

The only complaint I had yesterday is I couldn't sleep, I know how important it is to rest, but those darn steriods had me up till 2 in the morning.  Had to get up early at 6:00 went for my shot and then did some food shopping for Easter.  We are all set. Yesterday was a good day overall, my 17 year old received two acceptances from colleges, and my treatment went well.  Hopefully the s/e will be mini. like last time. Hope everyone's day is filled with joy, peace and good friends/family.  Be well everyone - Kim",
