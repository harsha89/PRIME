Unless your cancer is so aggressive that the dr is concerned about your health, please take a moment to gather your thoughts and information and perhaps even get a second opinion. If you decide to go forward with the mast, you will need time to set up your support group, as you will need some help afterwards while you recover. The decisions regarding immediate reconstruction are very personal and take time to consider as well. All my best to you...xoxÂ ",
