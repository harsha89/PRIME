I went to clinic to have my left breast looked at, as there has been an ongoing non-urgent issue with it since breastfeeding my daughter 8 yrs ago. I was never able to breast feed my son from my left breast. My right breast I thought was issue free. Never felt a lump or anything. But my left breast was why I was there, It has always caused a little discomfort, but other than that I dealt with it, I went to see what was causing it (yesterday). She examined my left breast , which was okay, but then she examined my right breast as well, and felt a lump. I thought that was odd. She says \"here is a lump.\" I said   \"oh, no I mean I was having issues with the left, not the right,.\" She says, \"no I mean you have one in your right.\"  So here I am for my left and walk out with issues on my right. I'm optimistic, Just waiting for the ultrasound and mammo. But sure enough I get home and felt for myself, I never imagined lumps. But I'm not overly concerned but I know its still good to get checked. I have known a dozen women my age with BC, so Its always good to be safe. I'll keep yous posted on my appts. Are cancerous lumps always noticable? Nice meeting all of yous! justme1979 Log in to post a reply",

I had 2 close friends my age with breast cancer and at least 9 other acquaintances that have had it too. I know there is many different kinds I think that is why I am being optimistic. I've had a 7 yr history with my left breast. During breastfeeding with oldest daughter (8 now) i kept feeling like a Small pea sized lump that would want to come shooting out from my nipple. (sorry,only way to describe it ) It pinched an burned so bad. I never ever then at that time thought about breast cancer, I just wanted them to make the burning, pea sized thing go away.  So months later they removed a small sac of fluid. But I was breastfeeding at the time anyways. then yrs go by and I became pregnant with my son. I thought maybe I had scar tissue or something form when they removed the \"sac of fluid\" because my breast became engorged with milk after his birth (like 5 days e-whenever the milk comes in) and my left breast stopped working. It hurt of course, back to hospital. the nurses and emerg, couldn't get any milk out. So I got rx to fix a blocked duct.(so they thought)  No milk ever came out, and We don't know why. I wasn't able to breastfeed my son off it (the left one) that was 2 yrs ago.Smart health care, no u/s or mammo.( I should've asked) Its never really been looked into, so thats why I went for appt last week, as my left breast is burning again-maybe scar tissue. But then last week, she found 2 lumps in my right. Nothing negative with my left besides the past history, milk . Thanks so much for responding and sharing. You just never know, and its always good to get checked.-I liked the lady I seen. Because after she felt the lumps, She said you should get those checked, and set me up. Rather then me having to ask. So that was good! I hear of so many women that actually verbally ask their Doctors for u/s or mammos and they say \"nope, we'll just wait, doens't look serious.\" How can a dr feel it its serious or not!? Do they have special xrated vision or something to see in your breast? So its good when health care providers actually say \"lets book you\". Thanks again, I'll keep you posted ",

I'm 32 and had a total ceramic hip replacement at age 29, (only 3 yrs ago) I had osteoarthrtitis in my right hip. (I'm going to be in Arthritis Today issue sept/oct, talking about my experience.) Maybe you have arthritis, and its nothing to do with your breats.-and arthritis hurts-bad-Try not think too much into anything right now, alot of things cause bloody discharge. Postive thoughts, your  a busy mama! I have 2, and I'm busy so I could imagine you! keep us posted!((HUGS))",
