      "Content": "maxwell677 wrote: Hi girls, So.....I have headaches. They are dull headaches that seem to be on the left side of my skull to the front of my skull. The headaches have been lasting for a couple of days now, off and on. I DON'T have double vision, confusion, or severe pain that are general red flags for brain tumors. However, I know that those symptoms aren't completely indicative of not having brain mets.  I had severe headaches last January before I was diagnosed with mets. During that time I had an MRI of my brain and all was clear. I was diagnosed with mets to lung and liver in May. Just recently (two weeks ago), I met with my onco to go over my very first bone scan. Everything looked good, but scan report stated \"increased activity\" on the occiput and frontal aspect of the skull bone. I, of course, flipped my shit and started crying. My onco told me not to worry about it since he wasn't 100% sure that it was mets and that it doesn't affect how my treatment is going now. Thus far, I've been treated successfully with Ixempra, refer to my stats.  I'm scared. Terrified actually. I, of course, will be contacting my onco on Monday to discuss further. What do you think? Anyone with brain mets or mets to the skull have similar symptoms, red flag symptoms, or no symptoms at all?  Please give me the dets.  xoxo and thanks, Alicia Alicia Dx 5/15/2010, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 1, 4/19 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
