She just can't bring herself to get the fluids she needs. IV again today. I'm not angry, or blaming her or saying her reasons for not drinking more aren't valid, I just want her to get what her body needs into her. the treatment nurses just keep saying \"come in if you feel bad\" \"let us fix you up\" but its very temporary if she can't get the fluids/nutrition she needs on her own.  Maybe this will get better. I sure hope so. she's looking pretty down and exhausted. *worried husband*",

She is still lagging pretty hard. the Day after was rough and we went in for fluids and nausea meds. I kind of thought she would have bounced back a little better by now but maybe there just isn't a bouncing back towards any normalcy between treatments. Do you recover? she is at work today but i know she's still tired. I hate to see her just sit because that can't be good for her either. Thoughts?",
