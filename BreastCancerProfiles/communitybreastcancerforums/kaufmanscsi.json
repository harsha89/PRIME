I have been feeling crappy but that is likely due to the lymph nodes pressing on a GI nerve and/or the fact that I got Y90 embolization about a month ago to the liver met. I am not happy about having to switch off of Herceptin Perjeta. I hope for few side effects.",

Mets basically disappeared with Herceptin, Perjeta and Taxotere and Faslodex.  One met grew slightly in January which prompted the Y90. I was going to stay on the H, P, and T indefinitely, but then they noticed these lymph nodes. I am just exhausted and my GI system is all messed up. I have trouble eating various things (high fat, spicy, fibrous veggies). I am working and functional, but just don't feel good. I can't figure out what is causing all of this. I am going to see GI doc in a week so hopefully he will have some ideas. I am also hoping that once the Kadcyla kicks in the lymph nodes will shrink and that might cause some relief. ",
