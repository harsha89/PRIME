I started chemo on 10/11 (DD AC/T) and I've had 2 cycles. I'm glad to see most are able to deal with their side effects very well and many of you are still working. I have been trying to work through the chemo but I think I might have to take disability. I have tried everything for nausea (I'm a pharmacist so I push my onc to try every possiblity) but I can't hold food down for at least 5 days after each treatment. The first treatment I couldn't hold fluids down either but we found that a cocktail of Aloxi, dex, Sancuso, and Marinol work for me to at least keep some liquid down. I just started losing my hair, but I shaved it about a week after my first treatment. Now, I'm severely neutropenic (even with Neulasta) and I spiked a fever today. My job requires me to be around sick people all the time, hence the idea to go back on disability. Did anyone have to do fertility preservation before chemo? I'm 35 and I don't have kids yet. We have been trying since 2008, but we were only pregnant once and it didn't last long. My fertility specialist thinks that the cancer may have suppressed my ability to get pregnant (thank God - triple positive - pregnancy could have been very bad). Anyway, we were able to get 5 embryos and they are on ice for now. We like to say we have the coolest kids Good luck to all of you having treatment this week. I hope I can get to know all of you a little better here.",
