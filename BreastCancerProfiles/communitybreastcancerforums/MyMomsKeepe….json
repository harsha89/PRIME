I wish a pain free journey for you and I hope all your family rallies around you and spoils you rotten. I wish I could hug you. Please don't be afraid to ask for whatever you want! If you want a Root Beer Float for breakfast-- then dangit .. you ask for it. :) My mom is drinking Ensure -- and it was provided by Hospice! Its 270 calories and my mom really likes it. (Chocolate) Praying for you every day. AND MAKE SURE you are taking the laxative stuff they give you -- the Lactalose and the Sienna -- you need those to feel good -- especially since you are taking pain meds. My mom was feeling queasy because she was constipated-- also she drinks Ginger Ale if she is feeling some nausea and it seems to help. Much Love to you!",
