    "Content": "Brittie88 wrote: In march of this year I found a lump in my right breast at about 10 o'clock (top armpit side of breast) got it checked out and the doctor wasnt too concerned since I'm only 24 (and possibly other reasons? He couldnt even feel it during a breast exam i had to show him) but referred me to a specialist in the city for an ultra sound. Months later my ultrasound is in 20 days. Now as of yesterday I have a hard, painful lump that appeared out of no where in my LEFT armpit. It's not an abscess or an ingrown hair and it does feel like a swollen gland (it's quite common for my to have swollen glands on my neck and it feels like the same type of pain just a little more painful to touch). We dont have a history of breast cancer in our family but my mom and I do get a lot of cysts. My mom had a cyst in her breast before as well as her armpit that she got removed. However she didn't have them at the same time like I have both lumps right now. The past few months flew by and now I know these next 20 days are going to go by sloooow! What do you think? I actually wasn't concerned about my breast lump until I discovered this armpit lump. Log in to post a reply",
