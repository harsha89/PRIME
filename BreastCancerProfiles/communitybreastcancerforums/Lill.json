I had an MRI prior to chemo.  After chemo (4 AC, 4 Taxol), the MRI couldn't find the tumor.  Pretty amazing, and a very responsive result.  The cells were still there, but didn't show up.  After surgery, they only found a small core still remaining, and micro cells in 4 lymphs.  If I didn't have neo-adjuvant, I would not be able to have reconstruction.  My surgeon specializes in breast cancer surgery, and stated that they are doing this more frequently, as they can see if there is a good response to chemo or not. I'm glad you're getting a second opinion.  Knowledge is power.  I wish you the best!  Live long and prosper.... Nancy  (Grade 2-3, and IBC, too) ",

I know some other ladies who are interested in it. I had my CT scan for measurements yesterday, with three little tattoos.  Not bad at all.  Will start actual treatment within 2 weeks for 6 weeks. Does anyone think that aloe is better than Aquaphor, or the other way around?  I have an expander in, and my PS told me to start using something ASAP, even prior to the rads.  Thanks in advance for your answers. Hey Donna, I'm a garden girl too!    Nancy ",
