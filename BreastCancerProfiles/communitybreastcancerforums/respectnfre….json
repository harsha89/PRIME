I'm downplaying the whole thing a bit but compared to the mastectomy + chemotherapy + radiation + hormone therapy + lymphodema + the 6 month prognosis that its taken me 6 years to overcome psychologically + depression, and no reconstruction due to the ongoing treatments, I would encourage anyone to avoid all that and go for the early mastectomy. Best wishes xx",
