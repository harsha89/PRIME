With my MRI's I laid face down, its kind of like a massage table with opening for your face and your boobs to hang through. I was happy I wasnt on my back rolled into that tube, I find that slightly claustrophobic. I found it to be comfortable on my tummy, warm blankets, just laid there. They gave me earplugs so the MRI noise is muffled. They do the MRI for a while then come on and say \"good job\" or \"here we go for another 4 min\" or \" are you doing ok\" or something every so often to break it up. I swear it never felt like 30 to 45 minutes. Worst case if you freaked out at 20 minutes in they would probably give you a break and start again ... I really dont know. I hope visualizing laying there all comfy in blankets is helpful I really only disliked getting the IV the entire other part was no big deal to me since it was non invasive and I'm tired of invasive as you must be after those core biopsies.

I had BMX on 10/7 without recon or lymph nodes so much different than yours. You sound like youre doing well for all you've had done. Ive had prior lymph node surgery so I know that it is difficult and for me it is ongoing. It's interesting you mention your other side bothering you. My non node side this time has been terrible in the armpit, it burned really badly. At first I was worried they'd found something bad in surgery and actually done node surgery there (the dark places our brain goes) or as you said maybe nerve damage. Yesterday when I had the drains removed I was complaining to the Dr about it and he said dont be surprised if it gets better from the drain removal. Something about the way the drains press on nerves. This morning is 75% better! Hopefully yours will ease up after the drains come out. Rest and take those meds if needed. I dont like that knocked out feeling either but I took it before bed for a few days and slept better. Range of motion shouldnt be very good right now, dont lift those arms. My doc said picture having tyrannosaurus arms, use that much motion.",

Not painful, just 4 drains to manage and soreness. They offered a nerve block which turned out to be great, zero pain when I woke up. If your hospital offers it I'd consider it, or maybe its standard I dont know. Have only taken a few pain pills since. Pain has not been over a 2 or 3. ",

If by tubes you mean the drains I had 2 of my 4 drains removed today. I'd describe it as uncomfortable, a little pinchy (they have to snip stitches) but not terribly painful for me. The worst was when the doctor said something like oh gee this one is really stuck up in there .... yikes. Hope that helps and that yours go smoothly. ",

Over the steri strips were some padded bandages and I think they had me remove those bandages after the second day. That was it. I wore a soft cotton post mastectomy camisole. Interestingly I had a lumpectomy the month before and was sent home in a compression bra. Is the thinking that the compression garment helps with swelling or something else?",
