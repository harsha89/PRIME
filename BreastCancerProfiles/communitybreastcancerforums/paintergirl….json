I was alarmed to find a not at all small or subtle lump in my breast which seemed to have come from out of nowhere.  I visited Planned Parenthood where they confirmed it was cause for concern, about 3 x 4 cm and irregular. And while the Dr. characterized it as mobile, it does not seem to move at all for me- no matter how I poke or push at at it, it stubbornly sits on the lower right side of my breast. They referred me to see a breast specialist, and I am trying but it is kind of slow going- I do not have insurance and have to be financially rated before they will even let me schedule an appointment, and I can't get an appointment to be rated until the end of December. All very disconcerting. I contacted another hospital and I am hoping their rating system is faster. I guess my question is, does anyone have experience with an irregular shaped lump that turned out to be benign? Mine almost feels like a collection of lumps tied together in one one firm lump. Since the initial moment when I found it and it was tender, it goes back and forth from aching to no pain at all with no discernable pattern. I am trying to be optimistic, but it is difficult, and my anxiety over this destroying my finances- I am uninsured (self employed) but not poor enough to qualify for most assistance- is not helping me.

I know all the statistics and everything, and I know everyone is different and all lumps are different, but it is somehow comforting to hear someone say that they have something like this and it turned out okay (if not perfect). I was just about to apply for insurance- I had been waiting because the policy I was going to apply for looks back ten years for previous conditions and I had some cervical issues about 9.5 years ago. I was concerned  that problems might reoccur there, and a short wait was no big deal to avoid a preexisting condition, as otherwise I generally am in good health.  A lump in my breast never even occurred to me. Frustrating. Diabetic at 41, yikes, its definitely a good thing you have insurance! I guess we never really know what is around the bend, do we?",
