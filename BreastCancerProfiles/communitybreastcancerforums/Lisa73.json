As a bit of background, I did 12 months of Taxotere (which held me stable), followed by 2 months of Tamoxifen up to this point.  So now I am on to the next chemo and just wondering what to expect.  I had very little naseau with the Taxotere, and not sure what to expect from this one.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Lisa Dx 2/24/2009, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Enjoy the wedding and Disneyland and I am hoping you have very few side effects from Taxotere.  Lisa",

Here is my story in brief: I was diagnosed 14 months ago at age 36 and started at Stage IV (bones and liver).  I have done 15 doses of Taxotere over the last 12 months and my cancer is stable so I am currently on Tamoxifen.  I have had difficulty walking on my right side and the right hip area has been swollen for months.  A recent MRI (April 8) revealed that a tiny portion of my bone has splintered away and is sticking into the muscle - so that has what has been giving me so much difficulty walking.  My oncologist has referred me to an orthopedic surgeon at Sunnybrook (Toronto).  She said he may or may not be able to help me. So my question is, has anyone had orthopedic surgery for bone mets?  Was it successful?  I am kind of worried about going through surgery, but would give anything to be able to walk properly again.  If anyone had any experiences to share or advice to give, it would be greatly appreciated.  Lisa Dx 2/24/2009, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
