I went in for the results for a benign tumor only to find out it was stage 1 cancer again. What a shock. I didn't do any treatment other than tomaxafin for 5 years. I thought since I had a bilateral mastomocy I would never have breast cancer again. I started chemo in June and finished my 6treatments the first part of Oct. I am still on herseption until June 2015.",
