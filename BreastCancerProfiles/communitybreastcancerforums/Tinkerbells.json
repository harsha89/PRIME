Authors Background In published radiotherapy trials, the failure rate in the control arm among patients with one to three positive nodes is high compared with that seen with modern adjuvant treatments. Therefore, the generalizability of the results has been questioned. The aim of the present study was to compare relative survival in breast cancer patients between two Swedish regions with screening mammography programs and adjuvant treatment guidelines similar with the exception of the indication of radiotherapy for patients with one to three positive nodes. Patients and methods Between 1989 and 2006, breast cancer patients were managed very similarly in the west and southeast regions, except for indication for postoperative radiotherapy. In patients with one to three positive nodes, postmastectomy radiotherapy was generally given in the southeast region (89% of all cases) and generally not given in the west region (15% of all cases). For patients with one to three positive nodes who underwent breast-conserving surgery, patients in the west region had breast radiotherapy only, while patients in the southeast region had both breast and lymph nodes irradiated. Results The 10-year relative survival for patients with one to three positive lymph nodes was 78% in the west region and 77% in the southeast region (P = 0.12). Separate analyses depending on type of surgery, as well as number of examined nodes, also revealed similar relative survival. Conclusion Locoregional postoperative radiotherapy has well-known side-effects, but in this population-based study, there was little or no influence of this type of radiotherapy on survival when one to three lymph nodes were involved.",

I have genetic testing later this month- but I doubt it's brca. It's probably an unknown mutation for me. I was also surrounded by secondhand smoke most of my childhood/ teen years, which did not help. I, too, feel Ike screaming when surrounded by the healthy masses. If only they knew. I feel like I'm the only one, a space alien landed here. Scream away brigadoon , ever! Was also in the chair today, st Louis! 2 more to go! Next week I'm off treatment for a week to enjoy the beach! I'm really apprehensive about chemo ending. What then? I'm comforted by my year of herceptin/perjeta. I'm certain it will be hard for me when that ends. Glad to see so many posts- I hope we all continue to post from time to time to keep up with each other. I have spoken to my onc about future trials of neratinib, vaccines , etc . Not surprisingly she seemed to downplay them. I will investigate them anyway. I think I learn more on these boards than anywhere else. Sandra",

My father had kidney, lung and larynx and my mother had stomach . Â We will see. At least my kids will have some info to refer back to down the road. Body aches? Oh yeah!!! My lower back has joined the party in a big way. Puffiness? Of course! It's hard to look at photos of me- my face is definitely puffy. Hoping that's one of the first things to go! Who's still finishing up? Footballnut - you done? Jamieh- last one Friday! Brigadoon- you know we are in your pocket every time you go. My chemo brain won't allow me to remember who else is lined up- please refresh my terrible memory? I have 2 more to go- Thursday and Tuesday 9/2- I stacked them closely as I want to start the school year chemo free!!! I'm also not counting herceptin and perjeta.Â  Looking forward- implant exchange mid October. Trying to decide round versus natural shape gummies- really conflicted.
