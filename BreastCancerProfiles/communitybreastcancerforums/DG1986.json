It really set me back. Now I have a huge hole in my chest. I drive 40 miles to a Wound Care Specialist. They say approximately a month and a half to heal. Everything has stopped for now. I have to wait till I am healed to receive chemo. I am really upset because when I talked to my Cancer Doc the other day, he said he was going to start me back up on Perjeta along with my Herceptin. (I am suppose to finish Herceptin in March). I asked him why he was adding the Perjeta and he said that was part of the plan all along. No one has told me this! The recipe was 6 doses of chemo, surgery, radiation and the pill. I am thinking about a second opinion. Have any of you had this happen? What do you think? Thanks",
