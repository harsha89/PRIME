Also had to consult specialist as well and he said he thought everything was probably o.kay, although he said to come back in 3-6 months as he wanted to re-check and do another mammo as breast tissue in left side of breast felt different to breast tissue in right side.Didn't worry about going back to see specialist because he died before my next appt was due.  In 2013, just recently felt a lump when having my arm compressed up against my breast whilst I was doing something, so off I go again to GP and he orders another Mammo and this shows clusters of microcalfications in same breast again and also glandular breast tissue of clinical concern. I went back to my GP and said don't worry about it because your microcalfications were benign two years ago. Log in to post a reply",

The first biopsy I had two years ago was done by a big machine where they line it up and the machine goes in and takes the tissue out. Do you know what they call this biospy? What kind of biospy did you have? Cheers",

(Surgeon died before my next consult).  April 2013 mammo showed cluster of indeterminate microcalcifications again and ultrasound noted glandular tissue of clinical concern. GP said nothing to worry about, so I changed to another GP and she referred me to another general surgeon who said it is nothing to worry about, as it will be the same microcalcifications and could not find a lump that I was concerned about. Mammo and ultrasounds all started because I felt that I could feel a lump in left breast, certain ways I moved and rolling on my left side, I can feel it and its was annoying me and making me aware that it was there, so then I would start to worry again about whether I should continue investigating this. Just last week the lump or what ever it is was really annoying me and my left breast was giving me throbbing like pain and in my armpit as well. I had some swelling on outside of my armpit like gland swelling. so went to GP and he said he could feel lumps and noted swelling without me telling him about it and so he sent me for ultrasound again and it was noted that I have a few tiny cysts in left and right breast and noted area of dense glandular breast tissue , no lesions or malignancy noted at this point. Does this mean I should expect this to change or what? I was also told that I have a lot of dense glandular breast tissue for my age (43yrs). Should I keep an eye on this or should I stop worrying? Having dense glandular breast tissue, should I be having an MRI? Please help? Log in to post a reply",
