If I have borderline low platelets, could I have bad bleeding? what can I do to minimize chances of a hematoma? Please share experiences and give me advice- I have two young kids and am a single mom so need to line up help if I will need it. Thanks so much- you guys are wonderful! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "lynnapin wrote: I had a sterotactic biopsy for clustered linear calcifications in the right breast two weeks ago. Results were benign- \"fibrocystic changes.\" They said come back in a year for a mammogram. But my question is: isn't it odd to have these calcifications at such a young age (36)? does having them raise my lifetime breast cancer risk? Thanks so much for any advice and thoughts!
