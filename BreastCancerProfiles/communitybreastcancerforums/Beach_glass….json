So, focusing on the hussel of shopping for gifts. I have 3 kids or should I say adult kids, I haven't mentioned a word to them. I figure that there's enough worrying going on between me & my husband. I feel guilty when I talk to other people about my worries but that's the way I want it for now. So, is no news really good news?",

My breast screening turned into another mammogram & ultra sound then my biopsy in November. So, today a week has gone by. They say that no news is good news - I sure hope so :)",
