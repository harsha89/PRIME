I have a few questions....  I live at sea level, I mean a mile from the beach; we went camping at an altitude of about 4500 ft. then I noticed my arm feeling tight... could that have caused it?  I haven't flown in a plane since surgery so now am worried about that.  We also have a sauna and I recall being warned about extreme heat and cold, I have used it very little but just did a couple of weeks ago.  Maybe the combination within a couple of weeks?  I was at my oncologists for my first year check up on Tuesday and she thought my arm was a little larger and had me get a sleeve.  The lady in the cancer center fit it on me, it was ready made nothing custom, if there is such a thing.  I've been wearing it during the day, doing some arm massage.  She said once this starts it doesn't go away..... reading some of the posts here it sounds like your arm can swell, go down and then have another flare up later.   Honestly, there is so much to read about lymphedema on BC.ORG.  I was trying to put cancer out of my mind and get on with my life, I got so tired of reading about chemo, radiation, etc. etc.  I want to do all I can to control this.  Thanks for any advise!

All of the answers I have read are so hopeful. I did go to the LE therapist that I saw once after surgery. She had done some bench mark measurements incase there were some future concerns. Actually, my measurements were the same. I feel the things I had read on here that I had started doing were helpful. I had never heard of the hand pumping while raising the arm. Deep breathing. We also just lost our poor old dog after many happy years. The last two weeks have been so stressful, I felt she had to take that last trip to the vet but my husband just wasn't ready (he's a real sweetie) ..... so we had a lot of stress and tears. I am sure that added to my concern about LE. I also want to mention a natural healing site Earthclinic.com that I have gone to for many years they have quite a section on LE http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/lymphedema.html I did drink the green tea daily, lots of water and wrapping with cabbage leaves was to be next on my list! :) But I had to really think about that one but it sounds like it can be helpful. Bless you all!",
