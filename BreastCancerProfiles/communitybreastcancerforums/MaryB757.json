      "Content": "MaryB757 wrote: I just found these boards and am glad I did.  Such great information and support.  I'm a 54 year old post-menopausal woman.  I had a 3.5 cm benign lump removed from my right breast after finding the lump and undergoing a fine needle biopsy -- that was in 1995.  In 2007, I had an abnormal mammogram and underwent another fine needle biopsy on my left breast -- turned out to be a cyst that collapsed when the needle hit it.  It was also benign.   This brings us to the present.  I lost my job in January 2011 and along with that, lost my health insurance.  Being a single mother of a college student, I couldn't afford COBRA and picked an individual health plan that I could afford on unemployment.  In August of 2011, I had my yearly mammogram and 7.7mm nodule was found in my right breast.  I immediately made an appointment for a cone compression mammogram as well as an ultrasound.  However, my insurance plan is a Preventative Care plan meaning that followup care is not covered.  I was still unemployed and could not afford to pay out of pocket for this care.   I called the financial office of the hospital but got very little assistant.  In mid September, I got a short term contract job and still couldn't afford the care I needed.  When that position ended right before Christmas, I once again reached out to the hospital and was told that I would have to pay a $574 'facility fee' just to schedule my followup appointment.  I searched around and finally found a California state program -- Cancer Detection Program -- that provides pap smears and breast exams for low income women over 40 who have no insurance or are underinsured.  I called right away and found I qualified for the program. I was sent the paperwork about a week later and called to schedule my first appointment with the county medical center.  This was in January and the first appointment for a clinical breast exam was 3/15.  I explained my situation and I was able to get an appointment on 3/1.   I picked up my last 3 years worth of mammograms from my hospital and brought those with me to my first appointment.  The doctor read the reports and did a breast exam.  I was told to schedule an appointment for a mammogram and ultrasound.  My appointment for that was on 3/15.   On the day of the mammogram, I had the normal vertical and horizontal images taken of both breasts (I had found a lump in my left breast in January)  and then after the doctor reviewed them, I had another image of each breast.  I then was taken to the ultrasound area.  While waiting for that, the doctor ordered magnified images of my right breast.  Once I was in the ultrasound room, the newly discovered lump in my left breast was no where to be found.  After talking with the doctor, we determined it was probably due to caffeine consumption.  However, the nodule in my right breast had grown since my mammogram in August and she found a smaller area with calcifications.  She told me she wasn't worried about the smaller area but was worried about the nodule.   A cone biospy was ordered and I had that this past Tuesday.  This doctor could not find the small calcification area but did take 3 samples from the nodule.   I am now waiting for the results in the next day or two.  Part of me is thinking that I've been down this road before and it's always turned out OK.  And then part of me is thinking that I can't possibly be lucky enough to have it be nothing for a 3rd time.   I did have some pain for a few days after the biopsy and am now just bruised.  However, I have noticed that there is now a lump about the size of a small gumball where the nodule is located.  I'm not sure if this is normal or not. Thanks for listening... Mary  Log in to post a reply",
