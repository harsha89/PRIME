The adrenaline dump nearly made me cry and I ended up exhausted in the afternoon. I have not hit depression (yet?), and may not as I am usually a glass half full kind of person, but the exhaustion, for sure. It's not just the incident itself, it the underlying constant strain of wondering, thinking and worry. That all adds up and takes a toll. Be nice to yourself, do what you need to in order to get past this. Big hugs to you and congrats on the good news!!",

When mine was done, I had \"twilight\" sedation, but apparently I got combative so they ended up tubing me. I don't remember a thing. My port is also not uncomfortable and I'm super glad to have it as I think it's probably better for my chemo. Hope things look up for you!",
