Since I don't have a family history and I'm a year shy of my 40th, insurance has dragged their feet. It also didn't help that my doctor's office let my report sit for a week while someone was on vacation. I did get the authorization to go forward finally! Now I'm just waiting to get my period. It's almost comical the amount of hurrying up to wait that I've been doing lately. I have to find a way to deal with it, so I'm choosing to just laugh. Honestly, I never knew I was a control freak until I had my kids. Lol Having to wait for them to do things \"all by myself\" can have me screaming on the inside at times. This past month has given me a little clarity. There are just some things that are out of my control. Playing the blame game, getting frustrated, angry, weapy, none of that helps me or makes the wait go any quicker. This situation just has to play itself out. I just have to take a breath & have faith. I'm slowing myself down and I'm actually liking myself a little better for it. No jumping to conclusions and no overanalyzing! Yes, I'd like things to move faster. Yes, I'd like to get some actual results in my hands so I can exhale, but I'm not in control right now. I'm just going to enjoy every \"all by myself\" moment I have with my kids right now & accept that it's ok to not control it all! I will be certain to keep you updated once I get my test scheduled. Thanks for giving me a place to reflect. xo Log in to post a reply",
