Otherwise Im not sure how I would have managed Like one of you i dont remember anything or how i got to my room after surgery so weird i had already finished my chemo and because lymphs were involved most likely will need radiation.. anyone else in that boat?? Im feeling ok 9 days out most discomfort is under my right arm were apparently alot of stuff lit up do dr said he took it all not quite sure what that meant? Will find out tomorrow .. Its just all so overwhelming , and seems ongoing with radiation pending ,then arimidex pills etc in my future I have peeked down my vise like surgical bra and have some idea of my now non existant boobs so Im hoping Ill be ok with it..I just want to recuperate and be well again so glad all of you are doing well ...

Then will take taxotere? Or are you doing combo together? I did adrmycin (red devil) and cyclophosphamide 4 rounds combo then only 3 of 4 of paxitaxel ( started causing neuropathy Most oncogists are hemotogists as well.. im surprised yours isnt? As the bloodwork needs to be closely monitored which he obviously did as he accessed your previous records.. Best wishes for continued ease of symptoms.. I see radiologist next week to discuss my next tortureous adventure",

I may take you up on water aerobics if I can find a class, I live in florida as well but dont have a pool, perhaps if I stay at a hotel a few days here and there thru radiation they will have pool.. I will have a 3 hr round trip commute each day , so I am exploring my options.. I just got a rebounder , its supposed to help with activating the lymph system , hey its worth a try !! as its so buggy and humid outside down here in the keys , makes outdoor activity in summer tough And troyryans, just a bummer your employer isnt understanding.. and yes I am extremely fortunate to have my job benefits.. perhaps they will allow you partime for awhile? Perhaps try a walk or stretch ... find a quiet place to breathe deeply and meditate for 10 min during your lunch break but make sureto eat!! hang in there ..

And 3 of the 29 nodes removed were still positive. So they all agree radiation a must with arimidex pills for 5 years. But another surprise was a tiny tumor starting in left breast that was as yet undetectable to scans. So i made the right choice I also have opted for no recon .. so as long as I keep these buggers from travelling elsewhere Im ok with it all I still have my drains in till monday which will be 16 days im looking forward to that.

I requested copies of plan and what exacyly they are doing.. Hopefully will get them next week ...anyway she said another patient chopped a little piece of the inside gooey part of aloe plant put in blender with a little water and drank it it helped sooth the irritation in her throat There are some how to's online but you need to use real aloe. Not the gel I havent tried it yet Good for inflamation ",

In NY got into miami at 10.in time for my rad appt at 11:30 And the drs office called , minutes after getting off plane. to say they thought I was getting treatment elsewhere and tossed my stuff!! I was really steamed!! I had spoken to my RO and emailed with her several times while I was gone and she said she wouldnt send them anything till I got an appt , which never happened so We spoke about my coming back as soon as my house had power ... Anyway I also spoke to the techs and set up todays appt she called dr and got me on schedule. So why they got rid of my body forms is beyond me. So tomorrow i have to get re simulated... I have 8 to go It was surreal coming back into keys.. very sad. But hopefully we recover sooner than later.. so thankful our house is ok Well girls seems monkey wrenches pop up everywhere Illemae ! You get a bravery award!! Wow hope the rest goes quickly for you .",

My mentor warned me its very scary at the end of active treatment.. especially when everyone(family, friends ) think its totally over.. and we dont really feel like celebrating. But its been such an emotional roller coaster so allow yourself time to regroup.. my center also has the survivor program .. I have an appt at end of month when I see my MO again.. I live 2 hrs away ( and the everyday for rads is exhausting) so I figured Id just do it then rather than make another trip I should be done rads on friday! Well all the best! Im starting with arimidex so we will most likely be on different threads going forward Mamaoz",

Ive had a few dizzy spells but that might not be related and just before I wake up Im a little crampy in my lower abdomen so maybe that's me drying up from lack of estrogen lol. Im 63 so I am definately menopausal my joints are a little stiff in morning but its only been 8 days Mamaoz",
