My hair began its return trip aboutÂ 3 months ago. I'd heard the chemo needed to work its way out of the system before the hair would return. Now I have a nice, thick head of straight, white hair coming in (it was white when it left, too). It started with some light fuzz. Now its serious, about an inch, which is a lot of hair when you've been bald. I'm seriously considering keeping my hair very short. I've already had it trimmed twice. I don't think Herceptin has slowed the hair growth at all. Unfortunately, I'm back to shaving my legs and underarms.",
