I am 21, almost 22 and this past summer, almost 4 months ago I guess, I found a knot in my left breast. I went to the doctor who then sent me to have an ultrasound. It was also found to be a fibroadenoma and they told me it would most likely go away on its own and reduce in size. They told me that if it did not reduce in size to come back. Seeing as it's been 4 months and feels to have grown (and at times painful) I've decided to go back to get it re-checked. BC does not run in my family, but my mother had cervical cancer which was extracted when she was much younger and 20 years later has not had any issues with it. Anyway, I'm really starting to get worried about it, but I hear stress can make it bigger. I do not have big breasts (A cup) so it really bothers me at times b/c I can feel it when I move around. Depending on what they say about the ultrasound next Thursday, i may or may not choose to have it removed. Any advice or insight for me? Thanks! I hope you are well!",
