I had put a sports bra on to go running and walking past a mirror realised that one breast was misshaped. One quick feel later and I realised it was because there was a very large lump pushing my boob up. Jump forward one week and I was sat infront of a GP asking for her help. The female GP was very blunt - she felt the lump, commented that it was very big and had only one question for me - had anyone in my family had breast cancer. I replied no and she said she would refer me immediatley to the 2 week wait pathway (for anyone overseas - in the UK if you are suspected of having cancer, you have to be seen and assessed by a specialist within 2 weeks). I asked her if she had any ideas what it could be but she could only say it did not feel like a cyst to her. She wished me luck. To describe how the lump felt is difficult. It was big (turns out it was 3.5cm x 3cm), movable, painless (unless I touched it too much then it became a little tender) but it felt solid and firm. It had a very strange shape (ovalish but it felt like it had ridges, or tiers) I also felt bumps on it too. I looked at this website most days trying to self diagnose and while the movement implied fibroadenoma or cyst - my doctor had ruled one of those out so I imagined the worst. Yesterday I went to the breast clinic and saw a lovely doctor who said in his opinion, I had a cyst or fibroadenoma. He sent me next door for an ultrasound scan and the radiologist within seconds had diagnosed it. Two cysts together (twins!) with a few more dotted throughout my breast for good measure. She asked me if I wanted the big one removed which I happily replied yes and a nurse was brought in to drain it there and then (the service and staff in the NHS is beyond brilliant!). Within one hour of arriving, I was walking back out of the hospital discharged, with my boobs back to normal! It took a while for it all to sink in. So why am I writing? Well thats easy. I wanted to give someone else a little hope while they are waiting. I spent hours on this site looking at other peoples stories and finding hope and courage in them all - and I promised myself I would give back when I knew what my outcome was. If I help one woman survive the waiting for diagnosis (which is brutal) - I will be glad I took the time to write. Log in to post a reply",
