I just had a bilateral mastectomy in Nov 2014 and have the expanders with saline in and reconstruction is set for April 2015 and noticed that smell soon after the surgery. I just thought it might be the expanders that for some weird way I could smell. Its kind of hard to describe the smell but it sort of smells like a new kids doll plastic kind of smell. It doesn't smell bad but its too weird. I had chemo from June to September 2014 and am currently on herceptin and perjetta. Was googling all over the place trying to find an answer to this and I found your post. I hope I can finally solve this mystery. Have a great day!",

Funny thing is the smell can be really strong some days but it is always there...its not a sinus infection either. I was on tamoxifen in 2013 but just on herceptin/perjetta right now. Is the smell sort of the way I described it? It is hard to describe but to me it is like a new plastic doll smell. Weird. Take care.",
