I showed doc who gave me cream but it didn't work. \u2022 Right breast bigger than left. \u2022 Right breast pink/red. \u2022 Right breast has a purple bruise mark about 2 inches long. Kind of looks like a few spots but very bruise looking. I haven't been able to get to the doctor cos there's either been no appointments or I've been working full time. does anyone have any advice? Thanks. I'm only 22. X Log in to post a reply",
