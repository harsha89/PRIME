I have had inverted nipples since little on both breasts. I am a 40 yo woman with no family history of BC. However in last month I lost 15 lbs (note that I've never been able to lose weight for no reason) and was having body aches, very very fatigued and shortness of breath, so I went to dr who is looking at pulmonolgy issues.  However last week I noticed a red bump on left breast about the width of a pea. It's not raised, just red, which prompted me to do a breast exam. When standing and raising arms I noticed a large dimple (I would almost call it a pit), that I never noticed before. It's just below my areola and about 1/2 inch deep and an inch+wide.  I can see it when raising arms but it become very pronounced when I lift my sagging skin slightly.  I also noticed golf ball type divits under nipple and onto lower breast.  I do have some tenderness but not a lot.  I have a few small of these same divits on left breast although not nearly as many so I thought it might be fat.  So I guess my question is, is there anyone out there who knows if having an inverted nipple would cause you to have a large dimple in the breast? It looks a lot like the pictures of large dimples you see in examples.  I have pictures if anyone is interested in seeing what it looks like cuz I figured if it turns out to be something, then I want to be able to document it for others.  I appreciate any help!! and I wish you all the best and lots of love and prayers!
