Funny enough, the printouts my MO's office gave me re: TC were directly from chemocare.com. Anxiety running a bit high this weekend. Not really worried about anything specific, just ready to get this done and over with. Spending the weekend and most of this week getting the house cleaned up and doing all. the. laundry. so I will have less to worry about while I recover from round one. I hope you all have a lovely weekend <3",

Probably because it was the first appt and they had a lot to explain as they went along. Things started with the NP where she double checked I had all my at-home prescriptions ready. They did lab work by finger prick (which is now the most inconvenient part because they had to try two fingers to get enough blood and now they feel sore like they have a splinter), then did height and weight before taking me over to the treatment room. The nurses were amazing, they talked me through every step. Got my IV connected, ordered my TC from the pharmacy, and started pushing the other stuff while we waited - steroid, anti-nausea, and pepcid. Once the prescribed treatment arrived, she connected the bag of Taxotere and explained all the potential immediate side effects they would be watching for. Thankfully I did not have any of those issues, and it went by fairly uneventfully. I did chew on a little bit of ice, but that was it for the Taxotere. Next was the Cytoxan, which would take the longest. She did say it would be easier and they wouldn't have to watch for reactions like they did with the Taxotere. I was warned that it may cause a sinus headache if I was susceptible to that, which I am. It was probably the last 5 minutes of the bag when that happened, and I am still dealing with a killer headache this morning. I was told I could take ibuprofen & claritin-d, which I have and it seems to be helping now. The only other thing was the crazy fast onset of dry mouth, probably about an hour after I was done. So I have been hydrating with lots of water, and I've used biotene mouth spray to help a little bit. And that's about it for now. I feel a smidge queasy, but not fully nauseas or sick to my stomach, and I've taken my first dose of meds for the day while I eat a light breakfast. Hopefully it will kick in soon. Otherwise, I just feel a bit sleepy and generally \"off\" from normal but nothing serious or severe at the moment. We will see how the rest of the weekend goes. I hope you all have a great weekend! xoxo",

I have no idea how to contact them to ask... I start TC this afternoon. I'm a bundle of nerves, not worrying about how it will go but just wanting it over with. I did not get a port, my MO said they would try IV delivery first since I only go every 3 weeks and will only consider a port if I have any complications during the first round. She didn't seem to think it was necessary for me, and I agreed. We'll see how it goes, though. Have a great day everyone! I'll try to jump back in once I'm home & settled to share how it went today.",

I start TC on May 31st, so I'll hop in with the June group too, if that's ok. I've been recommended 4 rounds, 1 every 3 weeks. I appreciate the plethora of information found in past threads, it's been a huge help in navigating my diagnosis & treatment. Strength in numbers, we'll get through this! xoxo",

Little waves of queasiness and sleepiness off and on, but not much else. My husband joined me for a walk yesterday afternoon. It wiped me out for a little bit, but it felt good to get out of the house and enjoy the beautiful weather. I slept great most of the night, but was awake for about an hour or so around 1am. Don't know what was up with that, but I managed to fall back asleep at some point. And for the last side effect so far, I did wind up taking a dose of miralax this morning to help things move along - they warned me that I might need it, and boy do I... In regards to hair stuff - I've always had really long, stick straight hair. It's all the way down my back currently. The NP (and some other friends of mine who have unfortunately also been through this) recommended I cut it short, at least shoulder length for starters. I think I will likely do that this week... The NP said that with the dose I'm on, my hair is more likely to thin out over the next few weeks rather than falling out in clumps. I figure once it gets too thin, i will just buzz the rest off and start wearing scarves and/or beanies. I have an Rx for a wig, but I've heard they can get itchy and hot and those are the two things I already dislike about my own hair in summer, so I will skip it and try to keep things simple and cool. I hope you all have a lovely day! xoxo",
