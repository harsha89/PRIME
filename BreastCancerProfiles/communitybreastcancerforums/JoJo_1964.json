Not sure yet which type of radiation will be recommended, external or brachytherapy, and which one I will choose assuming patient-choice is always an option. I know I shouldn't worry beforehand but I am concerned about the skin side-effects. I burn really easily & have sensitive skin (blistered bad with that surgical tape). The surgical wound is healing better than the blister ones. :( I've just started to read this thread and already have some good advice .. cortisone cream, aloe & lanolin, Miaderm cream?? Thank you so much for taking the time to post your journeys!",

Seeing you were not a big fan of it, perhaps I will wait & see what RO recommends. I see we have Aquaphor (Eucerin) available at Shoppers which appears to be popular as well. If I get desperate for this Miaderm, my daughter's fiancee is an American so I will have it delivered to his place. I just ordered a cool towel so thank you for that tip!",

Ingerp, that is so funny about the dots just adding to your other freckles/moles/what-nots. I too have all those as well. Wonder if I can request a colour to go with these existing ones! Blue would definitely introduce a new hue. Oh forgot the breast is still all blue from the sentinel lymph node dye. Yea I'm still looking like Mystique from Xmen. Juniper, I didn't know some places offer you a different position if BC on left side!! Lucky you! My BC is left side and I am super worried about rad affecting lung and heart which is main reason I want to know more about brachytherapy. Has anyone had brachytherapy vs external rad?",

This clinic felt very cold and impersonal lacking that sympathetic and caring touch compared to the other hospital where I had my diagnosis & surgery. Maybe I should not take these late appointments in the day as staff are probably fatigued. I was also disappointed that this system took it upon themselves that since 'external radiation was the norm' they did not offer me brachytherapy. Told the doctor I wanted to discuss all my options and make the decision. She agreed with me that I was a good candidate for brachytherapy but her expertise was external rad so I would have to wait to get another appointment to discuss internal rad therapy with another doctor who specializes in that field. WTF! For the first time since diagnosis, it felt like I was in the dark ages where doctors had all the power to decide what was best. To answer your question whether Canadian experience is different. My peer coach from a community Breast Cancer Association told me she had 21 rad treatments and they were done very efficiently taking 15-20 min total time (including the undress & dress). She did however go to a different much smaller hospital in the city than the huge teaching-hospital I went to today.",
