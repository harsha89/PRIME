I chose not to wear mens t-shirts due to their bulk and my preference for soft, loose, feminine undergarments. I have several $20-25 polyester/rayon tanks and camisoles that I sacrificed for the sake of comfort and coverage during radiation that I assumed would be thrown out after treatment. I soaked them in a tub of Dawn dish detergent and hot water for several hours today and washed with a load of towels. They are now spotless, soft again and look like new! This forum has been an invaluable resource, full of a vast variety of tips for daily living that should be provided routinely by our treatment centers! It's the little things in life that can make all the difference. I'm now considering what I can do with the money I would have spent on replacing my undergarments...LOL KateB79 So happy to hear how well you are doing and such perfect timing coinciding with the beginning of Spring, renewal and awakening!",

I am wishing you strong healing powers! I've finished 25 of 26 whole prone, 7 boosts to follow supine. I feel great! Mild itching with redness. No sign of blistering. Still use aqaphor in AM and miaderm in PM. Added 100% pure aloe as needed for itching. Still keeping up with all activities. As for systemic medications and supplements, my RO and techs told me that I didn't have to stop anything. They said their concern is only that I stick to recommended topicals in the radiation field. I started taking Allegra for seasonal allergies with their blessing and it has the benefit of reducing the itching I have at my collarbone. I was told by my MO and BS to start Tamoxifem the day after radiation ends. They said it had no impact on outcome of radiation... Best wishes to all for mild SEs. In my mind all the perspiring I do with nightly cycling pushes out the toxins. Tell yourselves what you need to in order to get through this. Never forget the power of positive thinking. You are all amazingly strong determined survivors! Happy St. Patrick's Day!",

Mary, I have to commend and thank you for the detailed attention you have given to this forum. You haven't left anyone out or let our comments hang in the breeze. You have responded with compassion to all which is evidence of your commitment to helping all of us through our unique experiences. You have a rare gift...you are a blessing...I hope that you have felt the love returned to you! I have three boosts left out of 33 treatments and still have minimal side effects: redness, mild itching. My day to day life is entirely unaffected except for the added hour. Those starting, I recommend buying 2 tubes of miaderm, 1 bottle of pure unscented aloe and 1 jar of aquaphor advanced therapy healing ointment ( I purchased all through Amazon). Also, 3-4 loose fitting, SOFT polyester tank tops to wear under everything (I used jockey elance and Cuddl Dud tanks because I found that cotton, especially ribbed, stuck to my topical creams and ointments and felt heavier on my skin), Go braless if you can, eat well, hydrate, exercise in some way to increase your endurance and stick to a routine. Give yourselves a gift daily, weekly or at the end. Prior to starting I filled a jar with 33 Hershey's dark chocolate with almond nuggets and I ate one after each treatment, it's a visual and small treat to mark my progress and of course chocolate has healing powers of its own Regarding protein, it is vital for wound healing. Be careful how much you eat and the source. A diet too high in protein can damage your kidneys and at the very least cause severe constipation. Before adding a significant amount of protein, speak to your physician. http://woundcareadvisor.com/how-dietary-protein-intake-promotes-wound-healing-vol2-no6/ I wish you all a week that goes by quickly. I truly believe we will all reach the finish line stronger and braver than we were at the starting line. Hugs to ALL!",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2016 11:06AM - edited Feb 14, 2016 11:23AM by SeekingSerenity16 Congratulations to those who have finished or are close to it! I can't thank you enough for sharing your personal experiences and advice and I wish you the best as you move on to the next phase of treatment. I suspect that many of us would not have anyone who \"gets it\" to share our day to day highs and lows with if this board didn't exist. I have my DH to talk to; but, otherwise, do not want to drive anyone else crazy. I have not told my family that I have cancer. I do not see what good could come of it, especially since we have lost too many to cancer already and my father and brother are living with it. I do not want to be treated differently, cause my diagnosis to affect my family's day to day choices and plans or put fear in their hearts. This group has nourished my heart and soul, has given me strength when I have been fearful and had moments of weakness. I am grateful for your honesty and encouragement! TallnTerrific and anyone else interested: When I was first diagnosed I was told this is curable; but, I challenged my BS, MO and RO to tell me how they can prove I'm cured...what will be the determining evidence and when? Will there be a test that proves I'm cured? I felt frustrated that the word was used so lightly though in my research had not seen how \"cure\" is determined...Finally, the best and most honest answer I received was from my MO who said: \"we will know in retrospect\". So in other words, if I'm still here 10+ years from now without recurrence, chances are I was cured with today's treatments. That is so not fair. They should not use the word curable if it is measured in decades of waiting to learn the answer. We have to face the fact that cancer is our chronic disease that may or may not result in a shorter lifespan for us, just like heart and lung diseases and even diabetes...eventually we are all faced with something. So, like you, I doubt I will feel relieved when radiation is over, especially since I fear and dread the possible side effects of tamoxifen more than those of radiation. The gift here is knowing, way too soon in many of our cases, that life is delicate and precious. We are learning that the toxic parts of our lives, both physically and emotionally, need to be cut out. Treat the cancer aggressively; but, also cut out the stress, the negative energy, the drama that is imposed on us from family, friends and most especially from our work environments and strangers in passing. Once we can find an inner peace and acceptance of our disease, we can begin to live life fully again. Put the disease on the back burner for longer and longer each day...then for days at a time. Smile and laugh more and find joy in every day... To update on treatments: Day 5 of rads passed without any side effects. Anxious to get on with it...trying not to wish my life away with the rads! HappyHammer so true! mdoc524 I think we would all give up Valentine's gifts for a cure! Love it! Happy Valentine's day! ",

I am very pale also and am wondering if you used any creams to help you through? At my set up the other day the technician told me to avoid deodorants with aluminum, PG (propylene glycol) and parabens and to get approval before using any creams. She then gave me a baggie with small tubes of Aquaphor and Udderly Smooth Body Cream samples. When I researched the Udderly Smooth Body Cream I found that it has parabens and PG! I printed out the ingredients from the company's website and will show her tomorrow. The only reason I can think of for this is that perhaps this samples are made for radiation centers without those ingredients; but, the labeling does not suggest this. Something this small is enough to shake my confidence right now.",

It really is a mind game in a way: You know it's painless; but, the outcome of each treatment is a mystery...am I going to swell, or shrink, or burn and when? Or will I be just fine? Will treatments be successful? Being in the radiation suite is a confirmation that the cancer is real even though there are spans of time I don't even think about it because, I feel normal, I am strong, I work long hours, I exercise 7 days a week, have a full life and I feel happy; but, I have cancer and now the treatment may make me feel terrible, sick even...or going through with it may make me stronger than ever in ways that I never knew possible... I was fine until I got on the table this morning and all I wanted to do was bolt. The technicians barely said a word to me...they were all business and oblivious to the swarm of thoughts in my head. Before I knew it and without any instruction they headed for the door and said your treatment is coming...no guidance on what I would experience and for how long. I lay there forcing myself not to get up and run, wondered if I was moving too much or breathing too deeply. First panic, next telling myself to get a grip and think happy thoughts. Where this fear came from is beyond me; but, I realized I can control it rather than let it control me. I imagined I had left my body and was watching myself on the table as this machine moved around me. I willed myself to be calm because nothing horrible was happening to me and I was well cared for by a team of experts. I've probably had worse pain and damage to my body from an afternoon at the beach than I ever will from 33 treatments of radiation...on the contrary, radiation may add years to my life and yours...You can do this and now I know I can too. You don't need happy cheerful technicians and pretty pictures to look at. I was face down, the only pictures I had were the ones in my head and I have control over them...so do you. Tonight I can see how silly I was to allow fear to overtake me. Tomorrow I will walk in with a smile and go through the motions and know that I am safe and in control. I will sleep soundly tonight and wish that for you. I will be thinking of you and willing you to know that you are strong and in control. When you feel alone or fearful, know that all of us here are sending positive energy your way. We have our hands on your shoulder keeping you warm and comforting you from afar. When calculated, 33 treatments total less than 8 hours out of my life...put it into perspective...just a blip of time out of our lifetime! Hugs to you and all who join us on this rollercoaster!",

Have candy and Dunkin Donut gift cards ready for the technicians, going out to dinner with DH tonight. When I look back to that first day it seems so long ago; but, time has flown by. Over the past week, since starting boosts, my skin has stopped itching and the redness has turned to a normal tan. The boosts have added more redness to my stretch marks around the surgical site; but, I do not feel any discomfort or itching. The boosts actually take twice as long because the radiation head moves to 4 different positions instead of the 2 when I was in the prone position during whole breast rads. For those who are starting and asked, I used Aquaphor from day 1 immediately after treatment in the early morning. Before bed I showered and put on Miaderm, mostly because it is water soluble and in the morning my treatment area was soft and clean and I didn't have to shower again. As time passed I simply added pure aloe to help with mild itching a couple of times a day on top of the aquaphor or Miaderm. I haven't worn a bra since December; but, for work I wear several layers and loose clothing and no one would know!",

I've just read five pages of posts and am sorry to hear of the problems some of you are having regarding nausea, pain, tightness, anxiety, fatigue and privacy issues. I know I am unique in this forum because I did not have a MX or chemotherapy and cannot possibly imagine the toll those treatments have taken physically and emotionally. None the less, the prospect of radiation was very frightening for me and like some of you had mentioned, I cried after my first session, probably due to fear of the unknown and seemingly a cold reception from the techs...I slathered on aquaphor immediately afterward and awaited terrible side effects. For those of you who are just starting I want you to know that I have completed 15 of 26 whole breast rads (with 7 boosts planned to follow) and so far I have not had any side effects except for an increased appetite for protein and extremely mild nipple sensitivity, hardly worth mentioning. Daily Routine: I awake at 5:30 AM, dress and make my post-rad smoothie to go: banana, PB powder, almond milk, walnuts, Kefir, benefiber, and ice. I get rads at 7AM, use aquaphor afterwards, drink my smoothie on the way to work, work until 6:30. When I get home I bike for at least an hour on my stationary (approximately 16 miles). I shower and apply miaderm (without lidocaine), then eat dinner (protein packed: turkey burger, egg whites, almond milk, cottage cheese, and green smoothie) read and go to bed around 10:30. I wear only soft camisoles since surgery 2 months ago. My radiation plan is 6080cGY total. If any of you are experiencing pre-rad or early rad anxiety, please know that the experience is not horrible for everyone. I expect things to get worse; but, it goes quickly. Try to keep positive and stick to a routine as much as possible. This too shall pass... My favorite prayer: God grant me the SERENITY to accept the things I cannot change, the COURAGE to change the things I can and the WISDOM to know the difference. When I pray, I pray for all of us to gain these attributes! Hope you all have a wonderful weekend...Spring is near!",

If you read my post from my first day of radiation you would see how quickly fear set in for me and if I could prevent that from happening to everyone else my prayers would be answered. On weeknights I read novels by authors such as Marie Boswick, Nancy Thayer and Mary Alice Monroe. Their stories are about places I've been or hope to visit and they take me away. Overnight I sometimes dream of the characters and I usually think about them when I am having rads. I do not come to this site during the week. I give cancer 1 hour each weekday morning and then catch up with all that is going on here for a limited time on the weekends. I am offering cancer a minor and temporary role in my life. The mind is a very powerful weapon and we should use it to our advantage! Moondust Thanks for the welcome! I see that our diagnosis are the same, I will be starting on Tamoxifen when I am finished with rads. I also see that you exercise which to me is like a drug because I am addicted, makes me feel strong and healthy, I imagine you feel the same. Every morning I pack three drinks for the day including a 25 oz bottle of ice water in a Hydracentials bottle from Amazon, a Thermos Container with a hot drink and my Nutri Ninja Smoothie. I place all three side by side in a Sachi insulated lunch tote I bought a while ago on QVC and they keep each other upright. I zip up the top as far as it goes, have never has a spill. It's cold here so at 6:30-7:30 in the morning everything stays cold in the car. I haven't needed to add an ice pack; but, I could if necessary. KateB79 Sorry to hear you are sick. My RO gave me his home phone # and told me to call with any and all concerns. I suggest you call the Radiation Clinic and give your information to the answering service; otherwise, call your MO or PCP. That way if any treatment, such as an antibiotic is in order you can get started. I would call immediately, do not wait it out. Pamper yourself today and drink drink drink!",
