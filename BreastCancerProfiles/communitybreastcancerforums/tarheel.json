    "Content": "tarheel wrote: I am a graduate student at UNC-Chapel Hill and am working on a news story about sentinel node biopsies and axillary node dissections. This is an assignment for a medical journalism class and hope that the story will also be published. I plan to interview two surgeons for the story, but am here in search of a patient who has had SNB and axillary node dissection. In particular, I would like to hear about your experiences with the procedures and find out if the SNB and dissection were done during the same operation, or as a subsequent operation. Some surgeons request that a pathologist examine fresh frozen sections of sentinel nodes while the patient is still anesthetized, in the operating room. They then decide whether or not to immediately proceed with the axillary node dissection based upon the results. If you had this option available to you, versus completing the SNB and waiting for the pathology report with the possibility of needing to return for another operation to complete the axillary node dissection, which would you prefer and why? Did you have a SNB and axillary node dissection during the same operation? Did you find out afterwards, from the pathology report, that you didn't need the axillary node dissection? If you are interested and willing to talk more about your experience and feelings about this, please contact me - petersen at unc dot edu. My deadline is Nov 19, so if you are able to contact me before then, that would be great. Thanks, Dustin Log in to post a reply",
