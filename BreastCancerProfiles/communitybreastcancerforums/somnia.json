Right now I have some hair but it doesn't look pretty. :) I take it positive though... more reasons for shopping! I ordered some pretty hats today on-line. Never was a hat person because my head is pretty big :) and I had lots of hair too. Now it's time to try different hats and scarfs.",

First one was pretty easy, almost no side effects. I started loosing hair on day 14. My second cycle chemo day was tough. I vomited a few times and had to call a home nurse to get an injection. 3 days later I feel fine. Side effects ... blurry vision and pain in both knees. I had an appointment with my family doctor. He sends me to a blood test to check my sugar and patassium levels. Are there any Canadian girls? Where do you order your head covers? I ordered a few from US sites... and some of them were too tight. :( I also had to pay custom dutes.",
