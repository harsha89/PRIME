My biggest concern is that I worried the titanium marker will realse something that is harmful to the baby. If it's truely atypia then probably I will finally end up with the excision, it would be necessary, but if it's nothing there and I will carry the marker for my whole life, won't be necessary. The question is they ask to put a mark before they know what it is...",

At first it's a nurse for the breast imaging center calling me to tell me the MRI result and say that I have a 7mm area looked suspicous, but she cannot explain more details, so I ask to speak with the doctor. The doctor actually is a radiologist who used to do sonograms for me and she is the one who suggested me to have the MRI because it can give a more clear perspection.  I asked what is in that area, is it a tumor or a mess. She said in MRI it looked different with sonogram, not a tumor or a mess, it's just an area looked active and maybe it's atypia. Usually they won't think it highly suspicious but I had the ADH history so they will have the biopsy for me. But last year when I had the sonogram she said it looked fine on the sonogram but since I had a result and suggestion from another radiologist who gave me the BIRADS score 4-5 so she went ahead and give me the biopsy, and it turned out to be ADH. We are all surprised, I don't have the marker that time because I told her I don't have children, but I end up with the excision anyway. Thank you very much for your suggestion and advice. I have already update the \"titanium markers\" in my post but I don't know how to edit the topic title, but I don't know if I still have time to see the OB/GYN before the biopsy.",

But the last year that little thing in my left breast was diagnosed as ADH and I ended up with another excision. At the same time I was diagnosed with another two tumors, both are very small, one in each of my breast.  This year, I had the sonogram for those two and the results showed no size or shape change, it's good, but the doctor suggestted me to have a MRI to confirm the result. Then after three months I had the MRI, I was surprised by the result again! Those two are totally fine, but they found another 7mm area in the right center that need a biopgy. I hope it will be nothing otherwise I cannot imaging how many surprise I will have in the rest of my life. I think there might be a reason that I kept growing breast tumor, such as food. I used to eat a lot of meat, chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, seafood, soymilk, tofu... then I read something on the internet, it seems the meat such as chicken and pork, farm rasied fish and shrimp may contain a certain level of hormones that will contribute to breast disease, and soy contains estrogen, not good also. I started to change my diet since the sencond excision, the ADH one. I eat a lot of green and only fish (most time wild caught), beef sometimes, no chicken or pork, and I stopped to drink soymilk and eat tofu(god I love them!). I think it worked to some extent. At least the sonogram showed I don't have a new one and the other two remains the same, even slightly smaller. Then after this sonogram I became a little reluctant to my strict schedule. I felt I was wrong, I'm hoping it better not be atypia...",

But I will try to figure out things and I'm hoping to find some non-medical, alternative methods to improve this condition. I even thought maybe it's the radiation from the improvement of the technology, like the cell phones, computers, or it's the genetic modified food. I also see people talking about how much sunshine you get daily will affect. My oncologies suggestted me to try vitamine D because I didn't want to take the medicine, which is for five years. I want to have children in the next five years. I also see there are people talking about some research showed Vitamine D have some effects on this, maybe it's related to sunshine?? I think it worth to try. Or it might be genetic mutation? I saw Angelina Jolie has revealed her decision today, I think she is very brave and heronic.  Thank you for sharing this info with me anyway. I understand how hard it is for you and us. It's a long way to fight with the breast disease. Let do it together!",
