It only hurt a little but I did not care I just wanted them out. Today is day after drain removal, had to drive 1 1/2 hours there and then back. I  am so tired and sore today. Another thing I did which was stupid is the past 2 days I did not take any of the pain meds. Not a very smart idea but my stomach was getting upset despite drinking tons of water and taking stool softeners, so now i am trying to stay ahead of pain. I will wait a few more days and try again. I still am having issues looking in mirror, I am doing delayed reconstruction. Does any one else have trouble looking?",

Went to work the next day (Friday) felt fine laid low Sat and Sun and felt ok and went back to work on Monday. Tired like I have never known. Have had a minor headache off and on. I also had Neulesta shot the day after chemo and yesterday I was getting spasms in my back and legs. Has that happened to anyone. They are manageable with tylenol. Also noticed today one side of my head is tender. This must be the beginning of the hair loss. I asked my 16 year old if he wanted to have some fun and buzz my hair. He came to my first chemo. He really wanted to see what it entailed . My oldest is away at school in Florida. I am tying to keep life as normal as possible but today which is 9 days after treatment was kind of weepy. Anyway thanks to everyone who writes here , so helpful and love having a place to learn, vent , advise",

In July 11 I had lumpectomy (2) No lymph involvement, followed by 4 chemo treatments then 30 days radiation. I finished all in March and went for my mammogram in July and she found what she described as stage 0 insitu. So once again am home recovering anxious to get the 4 drains out. I do not even like looking at myself. I know a lot of it is black and blue, stitches , drains. Extra skin is left so I can have reconstruction at a later date. She wants me to lose weight ( Need to any way) so she can use belly fat and I would get a tummy tuck in process. That makes motivated to lose the weight. My question is I know there are a lot of products out there in bras Cami's etc, but just curious how you make yourself feel pretty. I know some women whether breast cancer or not have such a flair for accessorizing . I am not one of them. When i go back to work I work in an elementary public school  with special needs children. I don't have to be very dressy but have to look professional. Also waiting for results so that is weighing on me. Love this website and all of you Dx 7/23/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 2 Log in to post a reply",

How was the recovery Thank you, Karen ",

The kids were so excited, dumping water on coach, running the field. It was like they won the Super Bowl.  I will be starting chemo on Thursday so this lifted everyones spirits.
