My oncologist is highly recommending that I go ahead with chemo, which isn't surprising to me considering the risk of lawsuit if it were to come back and knowing they didn't do everything possible. Also, chemo treatments are expensive - so that probably weighs on the recommendation. I am leaning towards not doing chemo because the 5% greater recurrence rate by not having chemo (11% tam only vs. 6% tam+chemo) doesn't seem like a significant difference to me. I am also afraid chemo could \"stir something up\", and am not comfortable with the powerful chemo drugs in my body. If any of my other tests had turned up that the cancer had spread beyond the tumor, or my OncoType DX test was a bit higher, my decision to proceed with chemo would be much more clear. I consider myself very lucky at this point. Is there anything else I should consider before declining chemo, or would you do the same? Thank you in advance.",
