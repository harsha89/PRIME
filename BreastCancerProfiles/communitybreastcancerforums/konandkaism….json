I, too, am triple negative. They have chosed to do chemo first, surgery, then radiation. I started losing my hair on Friday, so that night my hairdresser came to my house and shaved my head. We shaved a San Diego Charger bolt on one side (Just for my son, he is a Raiders fan). I am not very good with the jargin of the meds I am on. My anti-nausea meds seemed to work. My chemo meds are: Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Cyclophosphamide. For nausea I gave myself a shot everyotherday- I do not have the name of that one, then Decadron every other day, and zofran as needed. I was only sick just after the port was put in just prior to chemo that day. I had a few feelings of nausea. I did have one bad bout with diarrhea for a full day that was very painful... it felt like acid coming out (TMI). I have my second go round on Sept 16th.  I hope round two for you is better!  Off to work. ",
