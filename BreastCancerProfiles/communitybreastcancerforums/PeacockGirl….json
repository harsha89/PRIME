Today was session #3. Really it's nothing so far. Two 15 or 20 second zaps on each side of the table and I am out of there. The staff is very nice. I have one male and one female on my machine. They have 2 machines at my center. They have a massage therapist in the back patient waiting area every Wednesday, she was very sweet yesterday. They gave me 100% aloe trial size bottle to use 2-3x daily. So far everything is fine. I found a larger bottle at the local health and beauty aid place today. \"fruit of the earth\" 100% clear aloe. I will see my RO every Monday after treatment to check my skin. if I stay healthy and nothing gets in the way of the schedule I will be done with active treatment on February 27th. Wahooo. If my skin holds up really this is NOTHING compared to chemo. The 22 mile one way drive is the thing that is already bugging me. The nurse said I might get fatigue and that it will worsen. Gees bring it on, chemo messed with my ability to sleep so bad I really welcome a daily long nap I tell ya! ~Nichole",

No brain mets no bone mets no organ mets. Looking at clinical trial at Providence in Portland, it's a phase II with option of oral zeloda chemo (one week on one week off) or weekly taxol and immunotherapy drug called \"Pembrolizumab\" via IV every 3 weeks, which hopefully means I can avoid a port ( do not want one again). Feel like I've been living with a ghost. Had I not gotten stung, I will still be blissfully unaware.",

My story is so convoluted and complicated right now. I guess I just need to vent and I'm scared. I was taken off a Pembrolizumab trial yesterday with 7/7 xeloda that I've been on since December 2016 in Portland Oregon. This last month has been a nightmare. The beginning of the month I had a follow up PET that showed new lymph nodes lighting up and ones from 3 months ago gone. But also new tiny bilateral pleural effusions and fluid in the belly (ascites). This has been the case since December, we play \"whack a mole\" with all the lymph nodes in my body. I still don't show a speck of cancer in bones, brain or organs. They have mostly resolved around my head and neck, (where this started) and mainly I have chest and mesentery nodes that have been wreaking havoc for months with pain and pressure on stuff where they sit and inflame. Was to have Immunotherapy infusion #13 yesterday but had CT first. Trial doc declared ascites and pleural effusions \"progression\" and ended trial for me. That is okay as I was ready to be done anyway because the side effects have just gotten intolerable (hives, fevers, crushing fatigue) but she refused to entertain the idea that the fluids *might* be an inflammatory response to the pembro, which my local oncologist believes they might be. My local oncologist suggested higher dose of steroids and for a longer period to see if fluid would resolve and tap and check for malignancy if it did not. I will not be seeing trial doctor anymore. She was terrible anyway. So here I sit. I can't breathe very well, have pretty significant pressure in belly which makes me unable to pee very well. I have a weird unidentified bumpy rash on my neck. I'm sick of the LE in my left arm and hand. Have very little appetite or thirst but am eating a little again and trying to sip liquids and believe it or not, I do feel a little better on higher steroid dose than I did last week...when I thought I was starting to shut down and die. I soldiered thru the weekend while 25 people camped on our 5 acres for the eclipse on Monday (we were .5 miles from exact center of totality) and by Tuesday I was ready to be admitted to the hospital. I was ready to have a port put back in and go traditional chemo, I was NEVER this sick on AC-T 4 years ago and that is sad and scary. I'm feeling a little sorry for myself and cry at the drop of a hat. My local oncologist (who is amazing by the way and gave me her personal phone number a month ago and we actually TEXT, I say that just to tell you how nice and caring she is to me) will see me this coming week and if I am not better we will do thorocentesis. (sp?). I need this little pause and I just want to feel better so I can have a clear head to figure out where to go next.",

I'm sorry that Houston is so messed up right now and that you probably won't get into the MD Anderson for a while. There are many chemo treatments for stage 4 that are not as toxic and much more manageable some you won't even lose your hair with and some that can keep you stable for a very long time without any protection or even with some tumors suppression. Don't lose hope you got time",

Mine is for now and i am on xeloda and a pembrolizumab immunotherapy trial. i chose the particular trial (phase 2) because there was no fear of placebo and I could take xeloda in pill form and avoid having a port put back in. I'm almost 5 months into treatment and although the most recent CT shows great promise with no progression and many nodes reduced in size i'm dealing with pretty sucky side effects from a jacked up immune response (hives, facial swelling, severe gut lymph node pain, fever)",
