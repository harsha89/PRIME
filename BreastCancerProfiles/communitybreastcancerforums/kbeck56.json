Then on my very first radiation treatment it came back that evening. The radiologist said it was not a side effect because the treatment was for my breast and not near the throat area. I beg to differ because of when it started. I finished my 35 treatments on Oct. 14th and still have the lump in my throat. At this point I think it is caused more from stress than anything else. Just because I'm wondering if it is serious!",
