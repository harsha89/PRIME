Like the veins on my left breast are very visable while the ones on the right not as much. and the areola is larger on the left side and kinda oval and not round like the one on the right..... these are the things that are making me crazy right now. are those things i should have noticed before? are they of concern now?.........will i have any indication when i go have this done tomorrow if something is wrong or doesnt look right?",

I'm trying to stay calm but it's hard I have no one at home to talk to about this... Will post again after the biopsy.. Will he be able to tell anything from what he sees while doin it. Is there something I should look for. Will I be able to go back to work right after the procedure?",
