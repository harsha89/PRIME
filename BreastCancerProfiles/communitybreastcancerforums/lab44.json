I do not regret my decision at all, just dealing w/the loss of sensation (which truly sucks!). My BMX was June 30th, had TE's, and had my exchange surgery on Oct. 24th. Will have nipple reconstruction sometime in Jan 2011. I was not able to do nss due to the location of DCIS in my right breast and opted to do the same on my left breast, esp. since there could still be a risk of cancer. I met w/3 PS and the one I choose had the best results based on the pics my husband & I looked at and had a decent amount of younger patients (I'm 41 & wanted to see people younger than 60 in photos). My new breast are symmetrical and look good for almost 2 weeks post exchange - so I can't complain about that.",

I know there are many other feminine attributes about me to embrace as I contunie thru my bc journey. But it really sucks not feeling a darn thing! I'm about a week post my exchange, so far happy w/my reconstructions (decided to go smaller from a very large D to about a lg B/small C) and anxiously waiting to see what they will look like in the next couple of months as they begin to settle into place. I feel fortunate that I'm cancer free and my husband is very loving (would not have gotten thru all this w/o him ). But it's hard to wrap my head around not having any sensation in my breasts. I'm sure in time, this will get easier.",
