I sympathize for your friend and hopefully the side effects are behind him/her as well. Thank you Meadow for bringing it up to Traveltext, I appreciate the hand. I have managed to see my doctor today who seemed to be slightly concerned about what he saw but probably doesn't suspect what's going on to be breast cancer. I've shown him the vein marks on my chest and the thickening and described the kind of pain after which he did a rapid breast exam and decided to send me for an x-ray (I asked about performing an ultrasound but to his words \"it wouldn't show much\") and some bloodwork to rule out Myeloma, HIV and a couple of STDs ( I've had 2 sexual partners all my life so I doubt that these will result positive, but everything is possible). I also requested to be tested for Hashimoto's after a Celiac friend recommended screening and a complete blood count to see if anything is out of the norm there. As for me, the burning and needle sensation seems to be getting slightly worse day after day, Tylenol seems to numb it down for an hour but then it just comes back. It radiates between the collarbone and the first ribs from the top, mostly on the thickening side slightly less on the other side and physical exertion does not seem to make it worse. I have to say that I'm glad to hear from Traveltext that IBC is unlikely and the lower part of my breast does not seem to be involved in what's going on, no change in nipple texture, direction or discharge. The burning is mostly between hours 11 and 1 of my chest. I guess I wait for news now, hopefully good ones. Thank you for the consideration.",

      "Content": "Alessio wrote: Hello everyone, My name is Alessio, I'm a 25 year old male who's been having a bad year. I've used Chantix to quit smoking in July 2016 and suffered some intense psichological side-effects (which took around 2 months to overcome) and unfortunately have gone back to smoking since. I'm also a recently diagnosed Celiac, following other 3 months in and out of the hospital for intense abdominal pains. A month after my diagnosis my mother decided to get screened and resulted positive for Celiac as well. In the last 2 months things have gotten weird. The first thing to happen was a sore throat, it came on suddenly around the beginning of March (2 months ago) and is still persisting ( Mono and Strep resulted negative). Around the beginning of April (1 month ago) the joints between my breasts and my shoulders suddenly became inflamed, for 3 straight days , I would wake up with it and go to bed with it. The fourth morning the inflammation disappeared and the soreness came on, a lot of soreness in the same spots which still persists. Worried about the inflammation I decided to visit my GP which decided to run some tests including Rheumatoid Factor and ANA count, RF was negative, ANA were positive to a titer of 1:80 with a speckled pattern. The same day my GP asked to check my heart and my lungs, lungs were fine. When listening to my heart,he noticed that when listening to the beat on my right breast, the heart beat resulted to be stronger (as if the heart was working \"louder\") and decided to refer me to a cardiologist which I will see at the end of the month. A couple of days later the top part of my breasts started feeling mildly inflamed and sore. When this was going on I noticed what I can only describe as a thickening of the tissue surrounding one of my ribs on my right breast (top part). I can feel the difference between the right and left side of my breast, it's not a big difference, but the sensation when I press on it feels different between the 2 sides. On my left side I clearly feel touching my rib, on the right side it doesn't feel the same. In the next days the inflammation sort of spread out between the top of my breasts, my shoulder, my armpits and the lower part of my neck. It's on and off, usually gets worse in the evening. 2 weeks ago I started noticing little red veins and minor dimpling on the surface of my breasts spreading out to my shoulders, they're quite subtle but very visible under the light. I've never been a very hairy man, so in my chest I've had a little patch of hair in the middle of the sternum for the last 7/8 years, it has never changed, always the same. Now little hairs are growing right where I feel the skin thickening and stinging. I wouldn't consider it weird if it wasn't for what else has been going on in my chest. Most days my chest stings multiple times in a couple of spots, it feels like needles are being driven in for a couple of seconds and then it disappears. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 3 months, totally unwanted and I cannot seem to regain them. My original weight was 180 , I'm 5'9\" tall so I've always considered that to be my ideal weight at least in the last 4/5 years. The last 3 days I've been waking up exhausted, I can still do day to day tasks but for someone my age it shouldn't take so much effort, it's weird. I'm writing here because both my mother and her mother have had breast cancer and they have won their battles, I'm starting to be a little bit worried and I think I'm mostly writing to see if anybody has experienced anything similar or for possible steps I can take from here (apart from asking my doctor to run a mammography I assume). I know that I'm young and that I'm a male, which reduce possibilities by a lot but family history and chronic pain are not helping right now. Thanks for reading, hopefully it's nothing.
