I first had a lumpectomy 2/1/11 and one of the margins wasn't clear went back in on 2/16/11 had further margins and one node, all came back clear.  Had an MRI before that which showed nothing (maybe it was too close to the chest or deep I don't know, the Dr. was surprised).  Before I was set to start RAD the Oncologist sent me for another mamo which showed deeper calc. he wanted them out, so I had another sugery this past Tues., just got the call that there was more malignancy another lumpectomy and 1/3\" of invasion.  This coming week I am going in again (4th time) to have those margins removed to hopefully have everything come back clear so I can begin RAD, anyone have anything similar to this?",
