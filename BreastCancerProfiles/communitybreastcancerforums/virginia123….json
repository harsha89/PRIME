Katja and MoonDust - my fellow lumpectomy patients, I too have good range of movement, but my BS used a new technology and inserted a \"Biocoil\" in my space where the tumor was excised. The purpose of it is to help direct the radiation with a lesser benefit being that it fills the hole and helps with aesthetics and gives the new tissue growth something to hold on to. All sounds good, but the darn thing hurts! I hope this doesn't slow my recovery. I feel a lot of pain around it and also down my arm. I know its nerve related as the skin feels hyper-sensitive. Sounds a little different than your pain Katja. Hopefully just two more weeks until I can play tennis again - my salvation and my sanity restored :) I will quit complaining now because I am truly blessed. I have finally gotten a definitive answer on my HER2 and I am negative. It was the last piece of my BC puzzle and now that it is in place, it is definitive I will not need chemo. Radiation for me starting 3/23 and ending 5/6. The Susan G Komen 5K will be held in Richmond on May 7th and I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT DAY!!!!!",

What a good reminder to all of us who are trying so hard to get back to normal activity. We have had major surgery and need to be careful! I had surgery \"glue\" put over both of my incisions, and two weeks later it is still there and I am trying not to peel it off. It will start to come off soon, but I will be sure to let it stay as long as possible. Blue Heron - Nice to hear you may not need radiation. That seems to be the only silver lining for those of you who had to endure mastectomies, so I am glad you get your silver lining. I am dreading the every day trip for 6 1/2 weeks, but it is a small complaint since I am not having to do chemo. Mominator - S'more is adorable. Dogs are such a comfort all the time, but especially when we are not feeling well. I have a poo-chon named Griffin and he gets upset and licks my face when I cry, but I think I am done crying :) Moondust and others with gray area OncoType scores - why aren't you asking for MammaPrint? There is no middle ground with that test. You are either low risk or high risk, nothing else.",

I am starting range of motion exercises with a personal trainer on Monday. I don't want to counter your doctor's instructions, but certainly you can start walking and stretching a little bit.

Gemma12 - I am super happy with a touch of envy that you got clear margins and clean nodes. That's all I think about right now! Also, I am fascinated that you all are mentioning the Oncotype test and that you are waiting for your results post-surgery. There is a newer generation gene assay test on the market now called MammaPrint. Most BS in this area are using it and it can be ordered using your biopsy sample! Mine has already come back and I am LOW RISK, one of the pieces of good news I have so far. The only problem is that the MammaPrint is not yet considered a standard of care and most insurance won't cover it. The cool part is that the manufacturer is trying to get it out there, so they sent a letter telling me to contact them when I get my bill and they will file an appeal to my insurance company on my behalf, and if that doesn't work they promise not to charge more than $500. I am happy to pay that since it gave me good news :) My distress comes from the fact that my HER2 came back equivocal on two separate tests, and they are going to order another one after surgery using a larger tissue sample. So I am not quite home free yet. Just need all this post-surgery pathology to come back in my favor and I too will escape chemo!",

Do the best you can given your circumstances, rely on your experience and expertise, and just go get it done. You should not be expecting to close deals right now, so if it goes your way it will be a pleasant surprise. And if it doesn't there will be many more proposals for you to pitch when you are back on your feet. So do NOT worry about it, please! And come home and sleep 12 hours when you get home :) Question for the lumpectomy ladies - did anyone else get a Biocoil/Biozorb placed during surgery? I did and it HURTS and no medicine is touching the pain. If you didn't get one, are you still having pain at the lumpectomy site or not?",
