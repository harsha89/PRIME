One of the reasons I didn't want to go the lumectomy route was that I would have to have 6 wks of daily rads - so I would love to hear about anyone's experience with that. thanks for everyone's input!",

The main reason my PS thinks I should have an lx is because of my diabetes.  He says the least amount of surgery is the best in my case.. The neo chemo has been very successful - my tumor started out at 1.8 centimeters (it could be felt and measured) and now my MO can't even hardly feel it.  So I'm pretty sure the lx would be successful...I'm just not sure that's the route I want to go yet.... Nyama - I about choked when the BS said rads would be daily for 6 wks....and then I can't have my beautiful new breasts finished for up to a year....Where do you go for rads?  I assumed I would go to St. Vinny's, but not really sure.",
