I had a mammogram in September and was immediately called back for additional imaging the next morning. No problem, I thought - that's common. New doctor, new state - they want a baseline. Magnified views showed tight cluster of microcalcifications and a core biopsy was recommended and performed in October after they did an ultrasound of the right breast. The core biopsy was done and the results came back as Flat Epithelial Atypia. Since that can be found concurrently alongside higher risk lesions, they scheduled an appointment with the surgeon for an excisional biopsy. She ordered an MRI which resulted in 2 places on the left breast that had 'medium uptake with mixed washout kinetics' and one that had rapid uptake - one BIRAD 4, the other BIRAD 3. Watch and wait for 6 months. Neat. The surgery for the calcifications was done the day before Thanksgiving - no additional time off work needed and enough family and turkey to keep me distracted until the results were due back last week. No joke - they still don't have them back. They said it's been sent to another lab for additional staining and as so many of us here know - STAY OFF THE INTERNET if you hope to maintain any semblance of a normal life while waiting for results. It's absolutely awful. I have felt like a lab rat for 2 solid months now. My follow up appointment has been rescheduled from tomorrow to Thursday in the hopes the results are back in by then. My birth mom just had a lumpectomy and starts radiation this week and my adoptive mom actually just finished chemo, radiation, lumpectomy, whole nine yards. It's been very hard to feel like \"It's all precautionary\" applies here when I have been surrounded by cancer for the last year. I try to keep my spirits up, but it's hard some days. Like today. I love the idea of supporting each other through the worries and possible diagnoses. Peace and love to all of you - there is strength in numbers, ladies. Let's meditate this crap out! XO",

I can imagine the stress you're under and it sounds like there was very little time to wrap your mind around this being a cold, virus, etc. to cancer. I am adopted and my adoptive mother had cancer in 2016, my birth mom got it in 2017 and this year I have it. I guess what I've learned from the ridiculous amount of stress over the past few years is that no amount of worrying on my end will make anyone's diagnosis go away, including my own. All you can do is take it one day at a time, taking nothing for granted. Be present for your mom, she's likely scared as well. Huddle together with your support system and let people know when you need them around and when you need to be alone to process all of this. Make self care your top priority and I'm not talking about just lighting some candles with a bubble bath. :) I mean, allow yourself the emotional room to laugh like a crazy person, cry, talk about it, stay silent about it, whatever you need in that moment. Feel free to PM me if you need to vent, cry, etc. You can do this. SOunds like you have a really special mom. I'd imagine she feels the same about her daughter :) XOXO",

I do find them painful, but as others have also done, here's what I found helpful after learning the hard way the first time: Take your time getting situated on the table. Move the face plate around to where you can breathe as comfortably as possible. If you have the ability to have one valium or something to calm down ahead of time, that eases the process also. I had an MRI last week and really wish I'd have had a pillow under my lower tummy. I found the positioning to put tremendous strain on my lower back and I think a pillow would have helped. Ask the techs for whatever you need to be comfortable. Sending you love from Pennsylvania.",

You know yourself best and while I don't think it's wise to freak out over everything seen on imaging, and while we know that roughly 80%+ of \"probably benign\" things are just that, it's not worth extra stress in your life if you don't feel comfortable waiting.

I did not need radiation (because I had a double mx) so I can't speak specifically to that. I have known several people first hand who've had it and the size of their breasts remained the same. It seems like as unique as all of us women are, so are our body's responses to all of this. Wishing you love, peace and comfort. Cancer is scary regardless of the stage. Allow yourself those emotions. :) XOXO Kim",

I have been reading about benign tumors and growth and that's what brought me to you. I had flat epithelial atypia with atypical ductal hyperplasia removed from my right breast last November after an abnormal mammogram. Prior to the surgery, they did an MRI to rule out anything else before they moved forward. This led to one little spot on the left that they wanted to monitor - oval and circumscribed, about 6x4x5mm but with interesting kinetics. My 6 month follow up left me with reassurance as nothing had really changed on either side. I just had my 12 month follow up and this little booby bean is now 10x6x7mm with rapid uptake and washout kinetics. I have an MRI biopsy scheduled for November 29. I have tried to find all kind of articles about benign tumors or lumps that can grow and the 'what ifs' are enough to drive you absolutely crazy. Of course everything we read points toward an unfavorable outcome so it's hard to rule out the possibility that some of us will end up in that small % bracket where it does end up being malignant. Best of luck to you moving forward :) I hope you're feeling much better now that a bit of time has passed. Wishing you peace.",

I think we ALL understand the hair pulling associated with waiting. Last year, I had calcifications biopsied which ended up being ADH. Most biopsies DO end up being benign and I keep telling myself that as I approach this next biopsy. I don't have golden words of wisdom for how to pass the time except for stay the heck away from Google if researching doesn't provide you comfort. I have times where knowledge is power. Then I have times where knowledge is terror - it all depends on your perception. Do try to realize the odds are in your favor. Most importantly, don't forget to breathe.

There are two places found during MRI that we are now 'watching' - they present with cancer like kinetics but are smooth. My next MRI is this Thursday. The last 6 month follow up, it had enlarged some. Honestly, I was/am a terrible waiter. I googled anything and everything, highlighted areas of my report to look up and try to understand, etc. My birth mother was diagnosed with BC last year and my paternal grandmother died of it in her 40's. Oddly, my adoptive mom was diagnosed with stage 3 BC the same time as my birth mom. So with everyone having BC all around me, I was convinced it wasn't going to end well. What did I do? I began meditating. At least for those 5 or 10 minutes, I was focusing on breathing, allowing thoughts to come in and out, focusing on body sensations, etc. and it was effective for distraction even if only for a few minutes. That would be my suggestion - try to just breathe. I think there's not really any full way to relax until you have an answer - any answer - in front of you. Sending you peace. I know it's hard.",
