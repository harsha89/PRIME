Luckily we are staying at a favorite very comfortable resort for the duration (grateful to DH for suggesting it) and sleeping on 2 pillows is keeping the breast comfortable at night. Only resorted to pain meds before bed the 1st 2 nights. Will use Tylenol from here on out if I\u2019m uncomfortable. The twice daily scans and the radiation treatments have been comfortable and uneventful. Not feeling any side effects, nor do I expect to. Maybe a little fatigue at the end of the final sessions they said? I am not looking forward to removal of the device but thanks to suggestions from some of you, I plan to take a pain pill before that session and also to wear dark clothing in case of renewed fluid/blood draining. We have to drive 2 hours to get home after the final treatment. You have all been wonderful.",

      "Content": "Jun 1, 2018 11:00PM PatsyKB wrote: Hi Tampa59 - I just finished SAVI on Wednesday so I'll weigh in but of course, I can speak only for myself. PAIN - I really didn't have much. Insertion of the device wasn't the most fun I've ever had, but it wasn't that bad. My BS numbed the area, so I really didn't feel anything until later, by which time I had some pain pills in hand and took one the first night before bed and one the second night. Other than that, tylenol and then nothing. For the duration (in my case 8 days because of the 3 day weekend), sometimes the device was a little uncomfortable (usually a matter of how the dressing had been changed and arranged - everything's held in tightly by the bra they provided). I slept on an extra pillow and arranged myself so that there was no strain on the bra/dressings/device - slept pretty soundly. The radiation process itself caused absolutely NO PAIN at all. It's really nothing at all except feeling small vibrations as the radiation pellet makes its rounds into and out of each catheter. It's really an amazing technology. The advantage of the SAVI is that it conforms so well to the breast cavity and is evidently much more able to be calibrated for maximum treatment where needed; minimum where appropriate. Extraction of the device was much easier than I'd expected - As a precaution, I took a pain pill an hour prior to that treatment and it took the edge off. The RO who removed the device is an expert, calmly talking me through it and having me \"count down\" then, zip, it was out. I'd equate the pain with a bandage being taken off quickly. Tylenol or a pain pill that night might be called for. CHOICE OF RADIATION - My tumor was small - 5mm, clean nodes, clean margins, IDC, Grade 1A. I trusted that my RO suggested SAVI Brachytherapy because it was appropriate for my cancer/tumor/pathology. Here's a link to the website of the radiation oncology practice I went to - it describes the selection criteria. I fit perfectly so it seemed like a no brainer. My RO was very positive that this was the right choice. http://www.arizona-breast-cancer-specialists.com/brachytherapy/patient-eligibility.html You might ask your RO why he is less inclined to do brachytherapy - perhaps it's something in the pathology report? It's not for everyone and if there had been any question about the suitability of SAVI for me, I would definitely have just done external beam even if it would have meant weeks of daily treatments at a different facility closer to home. SCHEDULE - You will have treatment for 5 days, twice a day. Most of the time women are scheduled for insertion (in my case by my BS) on one day, then the next day the 2x daily treatments start (each treatment session is about 6 hours apart and includes a scan and then the treatment). Quite often treatment days are interrupted by a weekend which is actually great - two days (or 3 if it's a holiday weekend) of \"Normal\" is really nice. As far as working - I'm retired, but I'll tell you, you don't have a lot of time in between treatments. Depending on your job and location it might work (no lifting obviously). We would have breakfast, go to morning treatment which took about an hour altogether, then go do something or read or run errands, have lunch, and awhile later go to afternoon treatment. Then poof, it's late afternoon and the day's just about over. STAYING CLEAN - Go to REI or a camping store and pick up a couple of packs of camping body wipes. Those, a washcloth and towel, and some intimate area wipes will do the trick. I scheduled a salon shampoo and blow out twice - it was HEAVEN!! And it's true, no shower or bath from the day of insertion until once the scab forms on the wound (it's left open in order to drain and scab naturally). My last session was Wednesday and today is Friday. I have BARELY a spot of fluid on my dressing today and the wound is closing nicely. Tomorrow I'll re-dress it and on Sunday, I WILL SHOWER! OTHER STUFF & AFTER CARE - My RO prescribed a Z-pack (antibiotics) to start the night before treatment. I feel great - no infection. I kept the oxycodone from my lumpectomy (never used more than one or two for that surgery recovery) just in case and I did use a couple for this week when necessary. No lifting over 10 lbs or any free weights or strenuous exercise (not even yoga) for 6 weeks. Walking is encouraged, so I walk a few miles every day. Lots of other instructions which I will follow to the letter. Personally, I am happy I did this. My RO and the RO who removed my device pioneered the device in our area and were expert in its use. I feel confident in my choice - as my husband says, \"creeping doubt\" isn't helpful. ALSO AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - this is just one part of treatment. I will see my MO next week and get my prescription for whichever aromatase inhibitor he recommends. I will also find out the results of my Oncotype test. It may be that chemo is necessary (I hope not). In any case, SAVI Brachytherapy took care of the immediate area of the tumor without damaging other tissue. Now, we start cleaning up the rest of me and blocking the estrogen in order to prevent recurrence. Not to sound too Pollyanna-ish, but I do feel good about all of this, even knowing what kinds of side effects I could be in for. I'll be having regular screenings and checkups, MRI, Mammo, etc., and plan on staying as healthy as I started out (I'm really healthy). Good luck, Tampa59 - whatever you decide to do, have confidence in it and ask lots of questions. Also, let us know how you're doing! ",

Tampa - I had my SAVI during the same week as huntingal and like her (and everyone else) was so sad to read about your disappointing experience. I remember that when I went in the first day for my \"scan & plan\" after having the device inserted, I was cautioned that if the device moved or shifted too much overnight before we began treatments it could result in having to withdraw it and start all over. So I guess it happens. But it sucks big time. Hope you are able to start again without incident sooner rather than later. (I was fortunate - my SAVI experience was pretty smooth going and my little scar is healing well, my other incisions healing well, my breast less sore every day, and my RO has given me permission to resume upper body exercises within reason and starting lightly; the big caution is 6 weeks of no bouncing/jouncing of the breasts - no problem; and wearing a supportive bra - no problem). p.s. Post-SAVI-Brachy - I finished 11 days ago and I have to remind my friends that no, I am NOT \"done\" with breast cancer (one never is, right? It can come back to bite us in the butt later on). I'm in the \"what's next\" stage. Because I am ER+99%, I require endocrine therapy for 5-10 years. Saw my MO last week for the results of my OncotypeDX test and his recommendations. Unfortunately, my OncotypeDX # is 24 - at the high end of intermediate; it falls at the top of the chemo-not-necessarily-required range (clarified by the TAILORx study). Because my tumor was very small and I had no node involvement and clean margins and we caught this sucker early my MO intimated without \"telling me what to do\" that going directly to Letrozole (his AI of choice for the first drug to try) and foregoing chemo would be the prudent choice. Still wrestling with it a bit but I am inclined to do just that. I cannot start the drug until fully recovered from the SAVI which, according to the MO, will be June 20.",

I wouldn't worry if I were you but DEFINITELY discuss with your RO or whoever your primary doctor is in order to put your mind at rest. Customarily, the radiation oncology staff, the doctor and the physicist (or some combination thereof) are watching and monitoring carefully. ",

Hope your SAVI stays in place! I'm a little more than halfway through my 5 days of treatment. Amazing. After the long weekend, I have 2 more days of treatment on Tuesday and Wednesday. Those sessions had to be scheduled for a sister facility due to staffing so unfortunately that means I won\u2019t see my own radiation oncologist but rather one of the docs on staff across town. I\u2019ll see my RO at follow up (she is terrific and pioneered the use of the SAVI in the Phoenix area). The only side effect i am experiencing is that I am suddenly feeling more tired than usual and even napped today, something I never do. DH was schooled in dressing change and wound care today so that he can play Florence Nightingale over the weekend. We picked up additional supplies at CVS. It\u2019s not as though we packed things like hydrogen peroxide when we came down here for he week. Trying to keep the non-treatment times filled with good things even if that's just walking or reading. So tomorrow\u2019s visit to the Pompeii exhibit at the science center will be a highlight. Irishgirl711 we DID have a lovely anniversary dinner on Wednesday (thanks for asking) and in fact have been eating well and healthily all week, easy to do in the Phoenix area. Almost a vacation. But not quite. Today's highlight: a salon appointment for a shampoo and blow out. Simple but heavenly. I feel much cleaner! Since it didn't break the bank I scheduled another session for next week since I won't be able to shower until the scab forms, 2-3 days after the device is pulled. So another week or so. I recommend the pampering, Huntingal, and there are oodles of good hair places downtown walking distance from st. pat's. Again, you are all such a comfort. Have to go...time for a little DH time. ",

My post-radiation instructions were very specific and dictated NO SHOWER or bathing until the wound had fully closed, so for me it was about 3 days after the last treatment. Yes, the washcloth/camping-body-wipes version of bathing wasn't much fun, but I did schedule a haircut & shampoo which took care of my head anyway. I did not want to risk doing anything to compromise healing or, god forbid, possibly risk an infection. It's interesting how every radiation practice has different instructions. Mine said NO salves or ointments or anything, but rather to leave it alone and just pat it dry once it scabs and I was bathing again, My docs (who pioneered the SAVI in Arizona), feel that putting anything on the wound interferes with the healing. Once the scab fell off, then I was free to use vitamin E oil or fragrance/dye/non-allergenic lotion. Now my already-scarred and divot-dented right breast has new additions: the lumpectomy scar, the SAVI insertion scar, some other random puncture scar, and of course the lymph removal scar. As my husband says, it's a roadmap of my health. My advice in all cases like this? Call your radiation oncologist's office and ask their recommendations. Don't ignore restrictions on activity - the tissues around the SAVI device where radiation was directed are very prone to damage. It makes me crazy, because I FEEL GREAT, but I am staying away from yoga (body-weight-supported poses are too risky), upper-body work, and carrying anything over 10 lbs - doc's orders. I walk and walk and walk and walk and do stretches and easy crunches and core work (Carefully) for now. My RO did give me permission to start carefully lifting 5 lb weights, so I do that and I feel much better for it. But DON'T overdo! Time will pass. And you'll be fine.",

I had some aches in my shoulder and arm, too, and I'm guessing it was because it was raised for so long during the pre-radiation scans and then during the radiation period. It'll all be over before you know it! If I'm counting right, you'll finish on Friday, is that correct? Woo-hoo! If not, then enjoy the treatment-free weekend. (I had a 3 day weekend - memorial day weekend) in the midst of my treatment and believe me, that weekend seemed endless! Keep us posted.",

It meant a longer time with the SAVI and a longer no-bathing time so maybe see if you can schedule a shampoo/dry/style. It's not medically called for but boy, you'll feel bwtter!",

All the \"negative\" means is that at that particular moment there's nothing harmful or they don't have the technology to see it. Ultimately, life and cancer are crapshoots, right? (As I say frequently these days, I've dodged this particular bullet for 43 years since my first biopsy in 1975.) Good luck with your surgery, SLL101984 - it sounds like you're making the wise decision to wait on final choices until the rest of the testing is done. That's where I am too - doing the lumpectomy largely because, after discussion with my surgeon about my cancer particulars, there is no overriding reason to have a mastectomy (single or double). The less surgery I have to recover from the better, as long as the long-term outcome (survival rate) is equal. (Lumpectomy+radiation vs mastectomy, understanding that recurrence chances are a little higher with lumpectomy.) We shall see...

Turns out that my radiation oncology team - the two senior members - are the Arizona pioneers of the SAVI device so I feel like I really lucked out there. Removal went smoothly, as did my whole treatment week. While we did bring the device home with us mostly because I wasn't certain I wanted it as a \"souvenir,\" this morning when I went to do a little more cleanup, I decided \"Nope.\" Had my husband take a look-see and then we tossed it. I feel deeply grateful to have qualified for this treatment. Also happy that my tumor was small and I could have the smallest device. Can't wait for my first shower - have to wait for that all-important scab to form, so probably no shower until Saturday. Although I have a long period of doctor-imposed-rules and restrictions like only walking and light stretching for 6 weeks; no lifting over 10 lbs and absolutely no free weights for 6 weeks; have to take my temp a couple of times a day for 3 weeks...etc., at least I'm done with this part. Yay! Next week I'll have my radiation followup. PLUS, more daunting, my second MO meeting. My MO will then tell me what drug therapy he's recommending, likely an aromatase inhibitor (I'm ER+/PR-/HER2- and post-menopausal). He'll tell me, too, what the OncotypeDX test says. Fingers crossed. So maybe chemo, maybe no chemo. Congratulations, Huntingal and everyone else who's getting through this!",

When I got the call from my doctor with the news that I had IDC, aside from a little sinking-of-the-stomach, my overall internal reaction was \"Huh...how about that. Finally.\" (Background - I've had 5 previous biopsies, dating back to 1975. I kind of feel like I've been dodging this bullet for 43 years.) My focus since then has been learning as much as I can about whatever the facts of MY cancer happen to be and going from there. It's step by step. I try not to project or worry in advance. Oh, there may have been some obscenity-muttering in there somewhere, too. I kind of swear like a sailor. Friends say I have a great attitude or that I'm \"brave\" but honestly, I'm just \"Dealing With It\" if you know what I mean. What's the alternative? I tend to be pragmatic and, with the exception of a few low moments (we all have them), my approach has been learn, deal, do what I have to do, and then get on with whatever else I'm doing. Life goes on. I'm grateful that my daughter and my husband have been similar in attitude with a healthy dose of supporting me. I have no idea where my cancer story will lead, but all I can do is to stay proactive and work with my medical team and hope that I am around as long as possible. In the meantime, there's stuff to do. By the way, knowing that I COULD have some really low times, while gathering names of oncologists and surgeons and doing my research, I also gathered the names of and researched a couple of good local licensed counselors. Just in case. There's no right way to react and no wrong way to react. You be you. I'll be me! Onward!",
