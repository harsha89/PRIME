I wear Spanx camisoles but they don't really provide much compression on my upper torso.  Yummi Tummi is another shapewear that I've tried but even their small is roomy and I found the UA boy's compression tops (found them in hockey shops carrying boy's clothing) were designed for boys with broader shoulders than mine.  This week I tried a bra by Wacoal that I've been wearing at night and during workouts.  Size 32 is snug and feels like it gives some compression that might help.  Wacoal smooth bralette",
