Skin mets are hard to treat, as you know.  I have read they come and go, and never really go away for good.  If they are bothering you, I would recommend the radiation.  Although my radiation oncologist really wanted to burn the skin bad to get through the layers of skin and it was...um.....painful.....but worked.  Good Luck Oz.
