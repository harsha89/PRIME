I wear a lot of headbands these days!  I feel 100% back to normal.  I juice almost everyday and work out for 45 minutes to 1 hour and I swear it helps.  ",

I am so anxious to start chemo; I just want to get it over with, so I am hoping to start later that week or early the next week. I have two little girls ages 6 & 4 that I need to have energy for so I hope for minimal side effects. I am a school teacher too, so if this cancer had to come , I guess this is the best time since I am not teaching in the summer. Make sure to touch base back on here when you begin chemo round #1. Good luck to you.",

I started a blog to share this journey.  Like most of you, I am sure you get overwhelmed with trying to keep friends and family posted, so I decided to start blogging.  I am actually finding it cathardic.  Here is my website if any of you are interested:  nicholesbumpintheroad.blogspot.com (link on my signature, too). I had my port placed early evening last night, and it wasn't so bad.  I have taken two Vicidin since then and a little bit of a sore throat (from whetever anesteologist put down there from procedure), but overall pretty good.  Took my 6 and 4 year old on a playdate to a friend's house today. Tommorrow, I have my pre-chemo meeting with nurse oncologist, and then my 1st chemo treatment will be this Friday at 12:30.  I am ready to get this show on the road!  Decided against the cold caps last minute-my hubby had everything ready to go with Frank and the cold capping crew.  All he had to do was to submit payment last night to get here by Thursday morning.  I chickened out.  Went with my mom to our first wig shop and realized that I can do this wig thing.  My biggest fear is me up teaching my 12 and 13 year olds, and the darn thing falling off my head! Good luck to everyone starting chemo soon and those who are going through it now.  The first board I would check out in the past weeks was the HER2+ board, but I have found myself coming here more now. :)  Strength and courage to you all.  We can do this, and beat the crap out of cancer!!!!",

I honestly do not know what I would have done without this support forum; it has been a Godsend for me. Even though this officially marks my first post, I have been on the site navigating around multiple times a day, everyday since May 24, 2013, the day the changed my life forever. I find myself Triple Positive. I had my bi-lateral mastectomy one week ago and will be going in for a re-excision to get cleaner margins tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. As my username states, I am 32 years old. I am a middle school English teacher, wife (been married 8 years to a wonderful man) and mom to two little girls , ages 6 and 4. If cancer had to come into my life, I wish it would have come when I was 42, 52, or 62, when my girls were older, but I plan to treat this cancer aggressively and beat the crap out of this disease. I am looking forward to connecting with others who find themselves on this incredible journey; I will be here every step of the way.",

Thanks, ladies!",
