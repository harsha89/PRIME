I think it helps sticking to a routine. But they have been flexible if I had to change or get a scan, etc. I go to a small local hospital which may not be as busy. Hope everyone who is starting this week is doing well.  It's an adjustment at the beginning trying to find what works and what doesn't.  Give yourself lots of compassion this week.",

Just wanted to offer some things that I thought might help. Get some disposable rubber gloves - in the first aid section at Rite Aid or CVS.  I wish I had gotten them sooner.  The creams and Aquaphor are hard to wash off and the gloves are a life saver. I also would recommend Men's white undershirt t's in a larger size than you wear.  The creams and Aquaphor are greasy and I didn't want to get them on my cloths or bedding.  I got a couple of the 3 packs.  V-necks worked best for me - I actually ended up cutting them a little further down the front and then could open them if they were irritating and could put them on first and open them to apply the creams, etc. I also found a bra extender to be the most helpful thing.  I really tried to wear my underwire bra at first but after awhile I found a non-underwire that worked but the extender made a huge difference. As far as Docs saying no creams at the beginning I really think that they know how to treat things once they occur rather than prevent them from occuring. I asked about a few things I heard of on this board and that's the way it seemed to me.  They can't really prevent SE only treat them once they happen.  I think the creams and aloe, etc. just feel good when you put them on.  It feels good to slather cool creamy things just like when you have a sunburn.  I even try to show some love to my non-rads side. If I think of anything else I will try to add but these few things would have helped me at the beginning. Good luck and Happy New Year! Hi jo1955!",

I was tired from the beginning but it added time to already packed day. If I had a dollar for all the minutes spent searching for the right bra... I never thought of just taking the underwire out of the bras I already have! Genius!

You might also be able to get the labs run closer to home - they can call it in to another lab or send you a slip for them or skip them until next time if you've had good labs for a few years as well.  Ask them if these are test you REALLY need now or can you wait until next time. I really rely on my BS for follow-ups - haven't seen my RAD ONC since RADS were over since I haven't really had a problem so far. I agree that it's too many DR's to see (I have another med issue and have been on the the every six month plan with that for 10 years.) I now see my BS every six months and I'm comfortable with that. I agree that it's hard to go to the Cancer Center for appt's - I try to remind myself to take it as a time to be very grateful that my treatment is over and I am okay now. If you paid the amount of money we pay for treatment for any other kind of service you would try to get better service  - if you aren't happy you can try to switch Doc's - also a giant pain in the a#@ but might be worth it in the long run.  Good Luck!  and you are not alone in how you feel.",

A study of SEER data looking at women with early stage breast cancer provides an answer. This analysis by Dr. Gold et al concludes that a delay in starting radiation therapy of 12 or more weeks after surgery of 8 or more weeks after chemotherapy was associated with a much higher rate of a local recurrence/relapse.\"",
