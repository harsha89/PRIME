(My mom died of breast CA 8 years ago). To say I am freaked out is an understatement. I understand your fear and anxiety. If I can help in anyway, even if it's just to vent, I'd be happy to! Good luck on your tests!!!",

First, I want to say great job for getting it checked out! Especially without a family history. A lot of women tend to brush it off, so way to be proactive! I'm not sure about the ultrasound colors. I know when I had my ultrasound those colors showed up too, but they were unable to find the lump on US. Or on my mammogram for that matter. The little bugger could only be felt, not seen. I understand your worry. Are they doing a needle biopsy or excisional biopsy? I've been told by the AMAZING women on this site that over 80% of breast biopsies are negative, if that makes you feel any better. Good luck with everything! If I can help in anyway, please let me know!",
