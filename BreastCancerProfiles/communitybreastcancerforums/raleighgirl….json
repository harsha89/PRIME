I am 11 months pfc and today was the first day I have loved my hair since I lost it to chemo. I had almost waist length hair my entire life and I have had many days of tears, wishing it was back. Now, I am so happy to have enough that I can pin it back in clips on the sides. It actually is growing on me!(haha pun intended). I never post pictures(I don't even have a Facebook account) but I figured this might give someone hope that has just started their journey. ",

But I still have to wear two hair clips to pin it back or wear a headband. I definitely can't go without a hair accessory yet. I did buy a mini flat iron but haven't tried it yet. Have you gotten one of those?",

It looks like a short bob now that I kept the back short. I finished herceptin at the end of December. My hair has transformed so much in the last two months! You will see the same thing happen",
