Before entering they thought they were looking at a small 2cm mass...turns out it was little over 10cm. I had already made up my mind that I was going to get a mastectomy (family history blah blah). They removed 3 nodes and all were negative. My HER2 is negative and my MI is only a 1. Oh, and my margins were all negative as well. I figured I was done with it...they (onc) are now recommending I undergo radiation and hormone femara treatment. They said if the tumor had of been a little smaller I would be finished. Now, since I have spent the last three weeks on my couch I have researched. With results such as mine I am not undergoing radiation, and I am still not sold on the idea of the hormone therapy either. Predictors show no cancer spread to the nodes and clear chest wall and clear margins, very slow growing with little chance of spreading. I can not quite wrap my head around needing the same treatment as positive nodes etc. Is seems they are putting everyone is little boxes.....argggggggg Boy I feel better.
