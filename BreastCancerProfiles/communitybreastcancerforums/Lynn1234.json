The first one I felt very sad and mopey because i did not have the stamina, felt sick and was sure it would be my last one. The second was better. This year it's been a lot easier because I have more energy. I've put every decoration I have up, made 4different cookie doughs(to bake later-waaaay easier and less tiring), bought or made presents, all in advance to make things less stressful and overwhelming so I can hopefully enjoy the holidays. However-I do all this because in the back of my mind I still feel it may be my last Christmas and if so, then I feel that I need it to be the best one ever. I put so much pressure on myself to make sure my husband and kids have all of our usual traditions, so they'll remember the fun we've had at the holidays. I wish I could lighten up a little, but I have a lump in my other breast that has to be checked out on 12/22. Maybe this frenzy of The holidays is keeing my mind occupied in the meantime ðŸ˜•",

The rate for false negative on 3D is still high. See below from Radiopaedia.org for Radiology professionals: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an imaging technique that allows a volumetric reconstruction of the whole breast from a finite number of low-dose two-dimensional projections obtained by different X-ray tube angles, with a geometric principle very similar to that applied in stratigraphic technique. Despite direct digital mammography (FFDM - Full Field Digital Mammography) has improved the sensitivity of the method, especially in dense breasts, the number of false negatives (FN) is still high, largely due to the presence of dense tissue that may affect lesions conspicuity:",

I don't mean to scare you but, it's better to be safe than sorry to use an old cliche. I really wish that I would have checked it out more thoroughly when they said \"just a cyst.\" May have been caught before it was stage 4. Take care, Lynn ",

Remember there is always one doctor who graduated last in his class!!! Make sure he's not yours. Many breast cancer patients have both blastic and lytic lesions. Bones scans show mainly blastic and CT show lytic. MRI's show both. Not sure about pet scans, never had one.

Try not to think about it in the days and hours before the MRI. Keep busy. Divert your thoughts to something else. 2. A thick wash cloth over the eyes helps a lot! 3. Bring a CD of music you can sing or hum to. (No moving or shaking though) ie....Beatles, Motown, a musical, etc. The tech should be able to play it for you during the scan. 4. Once the scan begins, try to meditate, sleep or concentrate on something other than the scan. I planned my daughter's entire wedding during that long one! 5. Get a prescription from your doctor for Ativan. I take two about 45 min before the scan. By the time I get on the table, I am pretty sleepy and usually fall asleep during the scan. Be sure to tell the tech you are going to take it -when you arrive for the scan. Hope this helps!!!",

Of course besides the Cancer there are the money issues that go along with it, so no vacation for us or remodeled rooms. I'm not looking forward to our coffees like I used to, sadly. My local Stage 4 support group is on the same wavelength fortunately, so we can let it all out and listen and help each other through this stuff. highly suggest joining a stage 4 group.
