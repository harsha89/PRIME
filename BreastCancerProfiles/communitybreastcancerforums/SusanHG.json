Rita:  My breast feels very swollen and hard and starting to redden, but it is better in the morning and really recovers on the weekend.   My nipple isn't as sensitive as it was but does still hurt.  I put calendula cream on my nipple and under my breast, Aquaphor on the rest.  Aloe as needed.

As far as organs being hit during radiation, they do hit a piece of the lung-it can't be avoided, but supposedly we can live without this piece of our lung (at least that's wha they explained to me).  Since my left breast is the problem, I am doing a special Breath-hold technique so that my heart is not in the radiation beam.  I actually chose my local cancer hospital just because they had this technique there.  Any one else doing the breath-hold rads?  Kind of like playing a video game.  I wear special goggles and watch as the bar on the screen goes up as I breath in.  the radiation only comes out if my breath is held within the blue area on the screen.

Get as many opinions as you can so that you feel comfortable with your decsion. I went to three different surgeons and 3 oncos myself.  There is also a program for patients online called Cancer Math which I found to be very accurate and agreed with the onco's numbers.  Take care and research and let us know what you decide.  The best of luck to you!

For those ladies who had rads on the left, did your oncs discuss the heart issue with you before hand?  I had a special breath technique during rads-I held my breath while there were giving me the dose and the machine would shut off if I exhaled even slightly.  My doc explained that problems with the heart could occur 15 years down the road.  It's possible that they were avoiding the heart in some way without you knowing it.  There are many techniques out there to avoid it, from what I understand.  The study was covering years up until 2004 I believe, before they knew about the problems.",

Yippee for me!  7 and a half weeks sure went by fast.  I'm glad to be done but it sure is weird to finally be back to normal life.  I go back for a followup in 3 weeks.  When I asked if there will be a follow up after that, the PA said I can come in as much as I want if it makes me feel more comfortable.  My mammogram isn't until November, so this makes me feel better that someone will be checking my boobs on a regular basis. Gotta love cancer doctors!  suebek--great, great news!  I know the feeling.  I thought I needed chemo, then found out I didn't after all.  The biggest relief of my life!",
