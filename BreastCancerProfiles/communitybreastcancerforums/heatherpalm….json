Drs have prescribed pain meds for celluitis, dental work, ans the pains that i took before like candy, made me feel so terrible that i would much rather deal with any pain than feel sick. for me and i know it sounds crazy. i will do alot of mind therapy. like when i had celluitis, i went to hawaii, also i got busy crafting, it seem to help, oh yes another thing i did a lot of deep breathing exercises. so far since ive been on taxotere my pain has totally subsided. i feel very lucky. i hope this helps, heather",

She was 60 years of age. Yes It is to young. My mother lived about 45 min away from me. I think the hardest time for me was when I got my first phone bill and seeing the last long distant phone call to her and realized that I would not be able to hear your voice again.  There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of her. Thank God for all the beautiful memories we shared. I will cherish them for as long as I live. I continue to share those memories to my children. I hope that you can find some peace in this time of sadness. I realize that this is hard to hear but with time the pain seems to lessen. I know that my mother is with me in spirit. There has been some crazy little things happen to me. When I start to feel sad or something may not be going the way I want I'll hear one of the two favorite songs that she loved. It's like i am being told that everything is and will be okay. Also one thing I have to say I hope that you feel you can't keep in touch. You have been a strong force for all of us and as I have learned there are alot of women and men that have alot of great advice and great  support. I truly hope the best for you. Just know that you are in my prayers. God Bless Heather ",

He was a little shocked that I did it.  But it did become a conversation piece for the evening. the men got a kick out of feeling a fake boob and didn't realize how heavy they were.

I felt this was going to work.  So they started me on premeds. Plenty of steroids, benydril, lots of liquids and they allways have administered it very slow at the beginning.  I  have this  3wks on 1 wk off  and zometa 1x a month. Treatment has gone very well for me. I do drink alot of water,tea and fresh lemon. so far all blood work is great and even better on some. Thursdays are usually my tired day and I like to take naps. When I get my Zometa is when I get a little aching. But have found if I keep moving I'm not as stiff and sore. Eileen I also have scleroderma, just a suggestion, with your joints bothering you.  Have you had an ANA test done. On one of the other threads we talked about how many breast cancer patients had autoimmune diseases. I hope the very best for you and that your pain goes away soon. Heather ",

I have seen to many young women under forty that are getting breast cancer and being dx with stage 4 at the time of original dx. Ins companies need to be more informed and allow more early mammos/us. Went to chemo yesterday and mentioned something similar to my nurse. She did tell me that if you are in the high risk for breast cancer, ins will pay for it. Also learned that Christina Applegate was just dx'd with breast cancer. they caught it very early do to her proactive approach. Her mom was a cancer patient, if I remember that article correctly her mother passed away do to breast cancer. Christina would have her mammo once a year then 6 months later have a US. I truly hope the best for her and that she does well with her treatment. I have talk to several women in our area that have had these gene test and have come back positive for the the gene. The have optided for breast removal and reconsrtuction. I know it was a very personal choice. At least they do get a choice unlike so many women in the past.  Women with very dense breast, They have been doing a breast MRI with a dye in our area. Seems to be finding if there are any problems.  ",

AND NO ONE IS IMMUNE FROM THIS DISEASE AND WERE TIRED OF LOSING OUR FRIENDS!!!! Well I just vented, sorry. talk to you later, heather",

I say lets stand united and go to the newspapers any one who will listen, one of my drs colleges is on the senate for the state of Oregon Dr Bates. Hes also my dads Dr. My father has talk to him about other issues. Oh yes also Dennis Richard is also in senate for Oregon his law firm is who ihave used many years ago. they were good. From all the comments I have read on this site and bcmets.org there is life after stage 4. I hope I will be one of these wonderful ladies who will strive for NED. for a very long time. just like you and so many others. Alice as far as annoying because im sure I have been annoying too. but as I saw Luann write I believe in a comment to you is how we express ourselves and we have different opinions. shes right. thats the beauty of all this we do have opinions and sometimes we agree, sometimes we dont. and sometimes we just have to agree not to agree. but i feel if were all learning something from all this its all good. if that makes sense???? gtg time to het ready to drive over the hill for chemo. have a wonderful day. hugs from Heather",

I saw the scans I pretty much looked like a did a year ago. I called my onc office this morning. They returned my call this early afternoon.  After trying to get the information and appts sorted out. I told her that all the appts scattered out was enough anxiety to kill me not the cancer. So we got it resolved. I will have muga scan 9:00am Monday morning at the hospital then we'll go over to the onc office and my port accessed blood work then at 1:00 pm talk to Onc If MUGA scan says OK I will start Adrimyicin. Right now I won't know how long I guess muga will determine this.  So thats it in a nutshell.  THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT Heather   ",

So if someone comes earlier to post it, It would be great. I guess I could try to copy and paste. hear i go i'll try to paste article. This is too good to just post the link--Musa April 26, 2010 The New York Times 17 Years Later, Stage 4 Survivor Is Savoring a Life Well Lived By KATHERINE RUSSELL RICH Each year on a day in January � the 15th, to be precise � I go to a Web site and post a message to hundreds of women I�ve never met, saying, essentially, �I�m still here.� Within days, a thunderous chorus comes back, 200 voices, 300. A few of them ask, �How can this be?� Sometimes they begin, �I�m crying.� Many answer in kind: �I�m here, too. It�s now three years.� �Five years.� �Three months.� �Seven.� What we�re doing, in a way, is checking for lights in the darkness. Now there probably aren�t a lot of Web sites where the announcement that you�re around and breathing would cause anyone to take notice, let alone respond. But this is a site for people with Stage 4 breast cancer, something I�ve had for 17 years. The average life expectancy with the diagnosis is 30 months, so this is a little like saying I�m 172 years old: seemingly impossible. But it�s not. I first found I had the illness in 1988, and it was rediagnosed as Stage 4 in 1993. That�s 22 years all together, which is the reason I post each year on the anniversary of the day I learned my cancer was back: to let women know that it happens, that people do live with this for years. I tell them that when the cancer returned, it came on so fast, spread so quickly, that I was given a year or two to live. Within months, the disease turned vicious. It started breaking bones from within, and was coming close to severing my spinal cord. Nothing was working, till a doctor tried a hormone treatment no one used much anymore, and the cancer turned and retreated, snarling. It remains sluggish but active. Every so often, it rears its head; when it does, we switch treatments and it slides back down. In that way, I stay alive. I tell them: you just don�t know. Two and a half years after the Stage 4 diagnosis, I confessed to my mother that the doctors had said I had two years to live, tops. I�d kept this information to myself because if you say it, it�s true. I told her this laughing, as if we were trading preposterous stories. �Well, I guess you�re going to have to hold your breath if you�re going to make that deadline,� she replied, in her slow Southern drawl when I gave my previously stated expiration date. I spent the next five years holding my breath, then did the same for another five. I enacted every New Year�s resolution, past and future, all at once. Quit work that had grown stale and became a writer. Wrote a book. Went to India on assignment, fell in love with the language that was swirling around me, went back to live for a year and learn Hindi. Didn�t realize the reason I�d come to dislike that hyperbolically overachieving Lance Armstrong was that his behavior was too familiar. Take a nap, Lance! I�d think to myself, though in truth I couldn�t either. But if I was verging on radical levels of life consumption, I had a reason: No one had told me I wasn�t going to die soon. About 12 years out, my doctor finally did. There�s a small subcategory of people with Stage 4 breast cancer, it turned out, who live for years and years. �Twenty. Thirty,� said my doctor, George Raptis. This group constitutes about 2 percent of all cases. Doctors can�t predict who will fall into this category. They can�t say you�re in it till you�re in it � till you�ve racked up the necessary miles. The reason they can�t is that for all the pink-ribbon hoopla, despite the hundreds of millions that have been poured into breast cancer research, hardly anyone has looked into the why of long-distance survival; not one doctor has specialized in this field. Here�s pretty much the sum of collective knowledge: People in this group tend to have disease that has spread to the bone (as opposed to lung or liver, say) and feeds on estrogen. They tend to do well on hormone treatments. End of commonly known story. But as Dr. Gabriel N. Hortobagyi at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston told me, you can also find women whose breast cancer spread to organs other than bone, for whom hormone therapy did exactly nothing, who had their lesions surgically excised and who have been free of cancer for 30 years. None of these women could have expected to live. You just don�t know, and neither, unfortunately, does the medical field. One reason, as the breast surgeon Dr. Susan Love told me, is that �many clinical trials are funded by the drug companies to run for five years,� obviously not enough if you�re investigating long-term survivors. But through her institute, the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation, she has begun to conduct research. Dr. Love said she was inspired by a colleague who told her that in World War II, aviation experts focused on planes that went down until someone said, �Why aren�t we studying the planes that stay up in the air?� By no means a reflexive optimist, she thinks there�s hope we�ll find a cure. On the Web site, I tell the women how deeply I believe there�s no such thing as false hope: all hope is valid, even for people like us, even when hope would no longer appear to be sensible. Life itself isn�t sensible, I say. No one can say with ultimate authority what will happen � with cancer, with a job that appears shaky, with all reversed fortunes � so you may as well seize all glimmers that appear. I write to them (to myself) that of course this is tough: the waiting to see if the shadows are multiplying, the physical pain, the bouts with terrible blackness. �But there can be joy in this life, too,� I say, �and that�s so important to remember. This disease does not invalidate us. This past year, I�ve had the joy of falling in love with my sister�s kids, who live states away and whom I hadn�t had the chance to know. I�ve had a second book come out, one I worked on for eight years, about going to live in India with Stage 4 cancer. I�ve had so many moments of joy this year, but when I�m in blackness, I forget about those.� Then I ask them to write and tell me about theirs, and lights begin to flash. �Had a pajama party with my oldest friend, laughing through the night in matching pajamas about old times.� �Came in second in a bridge tournament.� �I went on a wonderful camping trip with my family.� �Seeing my older daughter grow taller than me. She�s now 5-9.� One thing I don�t ever think to say: When I was told I had a year or two, I didn�t want anything one might expect: no blow-out trip to the Galápagos, no perfect meal at Alain Ducasse, no defiant red Maserati. All I wanted was ordinary life back, for ordinary life, it became utterly clear, is more valuable than anything else. I don�t think to say it, and I never will. The women on the site already know that.

Then I tell them they treat us chronically.  I had two people at my work made these comments about something dieing, not realizing what they had said untill they said it.

A special PM just checking in to see how I'm doing.  I have friends and co-workers stick by me and encourage me and admire the fact that I am a fighter. Call me crazy but it makes me want to fight this damn disease even harder. Maybe it's different because I have already out lived a fatal disease of Scleroderma HMM now almost 12 years and you know what I take pride in that.  I get irritated with people who are just plain ignorant and try to give advice or support and are just plain mean about it, only because they don't know what there talking about. So with that being said I help educate them.  Knowledge is Power.  I say to them I will except your questions. I will answer the best to my knowledge, If i'm wrong I will say so, If I don't know I will try to find the correct answer. But what ever the conversation is spread the word we stage 4 are alive and living the best we know how. Awareness is good but we need the cure.  Ok now this is becoming a vent session. Heather",

They are completely spoiled to the core. Mckenzie brings maddi to my bedroom every night to visit me for kisses and a little massage. Its like she expects it. because when Mckenzie stays with a friend maddi comes trotting to the bedroom jumps on the bed and lays on my tummy and wont move entil she gets her kisses and a massage. Thats what I call Spoiled. Oh yes she has a Hot pink ski jacket. So when we figure out how to get pictures mckenzie would like to share her miss maddi, jack and colby with you. thanks for all the pictures, Heather and Mckenzie. ",

I think i have mentioned this before. about two little boys with ther dad in Big lots. I was in there with my manual wheel chair going around the isles. When I came to the sheet section. I was looking for somethings.Dad was very busy looking for sheets. I notice these two well behaved boys. They would glance at me, a little ansy, I just knew they were wanting to ask questions. So I took it upon my self to ask them if they wanted to ask me any questions. They said oh no, but I still could tell they were very interested in me and this wheel chair. So I asked them \"If you were to ask me any question what would they want to ask me?   thier faces lit up. Dad was listening to the conversation. He looked and smiled. The two boys really opened up and asked very honest questions, They were intriged. I have seen them on several occasions. Once I was at the grocery store they saw me and asked to help with my groceries. They come into my store periodically and say hi. Things like that make up for anything that might be bad.  The two boys will be great young men one day. I thanked thier dad for raising such great boys. Even though theycame from a divorced family the two parents have remained friends and have made the boys thier priority. kudos to mom and dad",

I suggest any one in the hospital use a sharpie and write a little note on your arm you can't use this one, wake me up before taking blood!!! also I would encourage getting a port especially for those that have lymph issues in both arms. there great.

I showed  up for appts at 6:00 am in the morning to be seen. but it has been so worth it. When I had my treatment of taxotere I fell into the 2% of allergic reaction. My ONC said he didn't know if I would be able to cont. my treatment. I said NO it would work we just needed to find a way. Lots of premeds steroids and treatment is administered slowly.

I actually as of today got some corp wheels spinning about that. Lets see how far it will go. Anyways. When talking to people when we do our fundraising. I share my stories then I hear other people start to talk. I hold nothing back, I go into the horrificness of it all. I allways say the bottom line is stats are nothing to me. 1 person with cancer is to many.  when my daughter was selling rootbeer floats, she would have me come down from floral to help. it was quite interesting for her to hear me talk and realised it was okay to share my stories. it actually brought more monies in. It was reaaly good for my daughter to hear this because she allways get a little frustrated about people knowing our business, So I say if you feel comfortable doing it I say go for it. Also If you would like to get involved with fundraising call yoyr local SW, vons and  several more that are related to safeways and ask to set up some kind of volunteer booth. I'm sure they would love it. I sat Just go for it. It is so rewarding to me.  LuAnn I said that a time or two  \"I'm cured\"  Well what a surprise to find I know have mets in stable to Ned mode. I do like that she is turning a bad situation into good. I to would like to hear more about how ugly cancer is not just the physical part but the expense of it all and not just the medicals,  the cost of gas and travel to get to treatments etc, HUGS Heather",

The nice thing is that Ashley is getting ready to start the procedures for the Air national guard. She has to have some special test to show she only has allergies and not asthma. She is so excited about that. She wants to be just like her dad. Plus they pay for alot of schooling. Which has been a blessing do to all the financial stuff these past 11 years. I sure wish i had a sewing machine thats one thing i miss doing.

What away to be woke up that early in the morning. Well come to find out. It is over a boy, Oh what to do??? My eldest started to date a young man, who has a phsyco ex GF. After last night we got a taste of her brattiness,  kids these days are quite braison about what they write on texts.  Come to find out her dad is a local cop and has been throwing that into other girls faces that she will beat them up if they come close to her BF. \"This poor boy can't even get away from her.\"  she also tells the girls that her dad is a cop no one can do anything to her. sounds like she needs a little whoop a*##.  It sounds like one of those teeneage stories on lifetime \"CRAZY\"...... I'll keep pushing what my mother allways told me as a child and into adulthood, Kill them with kindness. LuAnn, I remember those days, My hair was so thick that if  I put it into a pony and up after a shower My hair would still be wet at the end of the day. Thats how my girls hair is now. It was so funny, \"Well I have to laugh\", My oldest daughters  hair was about down to her waist. Her hair is so thick that when she played soccer she was ask to tuck it up because she would hurt people with her tail. when she found out that i was going to have chemo. she went down and had it cut just below her ears, \"Really cute\" I must say\" She was so excited she thought she would be able to have a wig made for me. We were excited for her, she had done something so sweet. Then we find out I wasnt losing my hair, just thinning. you should of seen the look on her face. She would have like to have held me down and shaved my head.  We still laugh about that one. I told her just to hang on to it. maybe we  could give it to love for locks.  Oh Yes got a bit sidetracked, The girls did enjoy themselves. Ashley's guy friend showed up with his mom at the dinner house gave both my daughters roses and bought their dinners, now that was really sweet. thanks fo all the support, Heather ",

I have dealt with some of the stuff your going through. relaxation: I reccomend a nice champagne or tea bubble bath. place candles around the bathroom and tub. Put on some good music. turn down the lights relax and sip away. (for some really good bubbles use MR. BUBBLE) constipation: Hurts like hell, plain and simple. There was a time when I was so packed with poo. My husband would hold on to me because i couldn't sit on the toilet because of all the open wounds on my butt (from scleroderma). It was like giving birth with no repreave, no rewards. We tried the supositories only for them to fly back at my husband. I was to embarrased to go to the ER so my husband put on the ole rubber gloves  and lots of vaseline and began to extract these things you could have used to make a brick house. Wouldn't reccomend that but it was releif at the time. relief: when i feel that i maybe getting a little constipated I make up whole oats oatmeal, cream of wheat, snack on prunes, lots of water with lemon and tea If It gets to bad Drinking a glass of epson salt and water Just be by a toilet 45 min from the time you swallow your last swallow. driving: does your town have a senior and disabilty program?? our transit service does, they have free or minimul charge  where they come to your house and pick up and take you to your appts or grocery shopping. It worked really great when I needed it. nausea: does your onc give you anything for that? I know my onc did even if i felt i didn't need it. they just wanted to be sure I didn't go through that. venting; vent away, vent away, vent away!!! It's ok we are here to listen. Janis yes I agree with you about screaming. I used to do that with my girls when i was really sick with the scleroderma. Boy was it invigorating and empowering. So I say scream away.  Cheryl sending you many gentle hugs, Heather",

At my favorite place in Eagle Point, Oregon.  \"Antonio's\" I have crawled into bed responding to all of you beautiful ladies. Watching the Bachelor and eating a ice cream drumstick. I will put on my hockey gear and continue this journey with a great fight. \"SO here to the little cancer bugs\" DIE YOU LITTLE BUGGERS\" May you hit the journey down the \"OLE PORCELAIN GODDESS\" Is that how we get rid of them?? through our POO AND PEE??? If not its a good thought. MISS ELIZABETH, You may not have the the experience of Xeloda, but never say useless, you are such a sweet ladie with so many kind thoughts that truly come from the heart. Just like the rest of you most awesome beautiful ladies on these boards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank you for all your wisdom and support. I wish I could personally meet and hug each one of you. Many gentle hugs to you all. Heather",

Believe you me I look at at past pictures (very few) I looked like  I had one foot in the grave and one dangling close by. I made a descision at that time that I wasn't ready to die, I just didn't feel it. I even had one dr tell my husband I wasn't going home. PROVED HIM WRONG!!! I Fired him. I decided that I still had alot of life. I wanted my kids to know if I did die. I wasn't going down with out a fight. I wanted them to be aware of these diseases. But mostly I wasn't going to let this disease take my attitude, my spunk or my determination. It just would not take me down that way. I try to live my life to the best I can. I do have melt downs. Thats okay. I just know that I will continue to go on. try to make a differnce in someone elses life. I saw that you are triple neg.

Or when you have a treatment plan that has been working and all of a sudden they say it isnt a medical necessity. That happened to me a few years back. because of my scleroderma (contractures, stiffness the gammit of the disease) I religously went to physical therapy then this lovely little guy with the title \"MD\" sent me a letter stating i was not to have physical therapy that is was not deemed a (medical necessity) Well we got even. My Drs and PTS wrote letters. One of the ladies at my husband work (Vernice) The head Colonels wrote letters just that one file was about two inches thick with all the support. Then the real clincher was Vernice had my husband take pictures of me practically naked. Oh my lord I must of scared the living daylights right of that man Mr MD.  It wasnt long before I had a letter aplogizing for the misunderstang.  Not only that we found out the man that wrote the letter was not a (MD - Medical Doctor) He was only a medical director. I think thats what really ticked me off. He probably had no idea what this disease was really about. So its been over ten years and im still going to physical therapy. I also now have medicare even at the age of 42 I pay for it through my social security disability. Which has been a good thing.  Deb, In regards to your question I havent had to deal with that because I have medicare and tricare remote(military) but i will check with my Onc billing dept and hospital see what i can find out.

There was one lady I remember she came up to me and ask if she could pray for me. \"I said yes\" she could\" So she did, she kissed me on the forhead and told me I was angel and that I was not going to die anytime soon and that I had a purpose on this earth. Well let me tell you, the feeling that over came my body is something that I will never forget. Whats quite amazing according to all medical records I should have died. So the power of prayer lots of great attitude with alot spunk goes along ways in my book. So here good thoughts and a prayer for you that your treatment plan will bring you to stable or even ned Hugs Heather ",

I would have loved to have gone to the CTCA. But like I said When I called them the first thing out of their mouths were what kind of INS i had. (Which they did not except)and then I needed to have 200,000.00 in a bank account for them. And during this whole time I'm sobbing and trying to catch my breath because I had just been diagnosed stage 4. did the they have any empathy. Hell no. So yes It makes me a little upset especially when their commercials sound so appealing and very hopeful. I am happy that you have ins that will pay for this and you continue to have successful treatments and that you become NED. That is what all of us want.

I don't want anyone to go through what we have or have been. I just want them to find that damn cure. \"sooner than later.\"  I will say that I enjoy What safeway does with there fund raising and  asking customers to donate their change.  With doing research allot of that money goes strictly in finding a cure for this beast.  Not just the  awareness part of it.  When I'm finished I will post various web sites where you can see where that money goes to finding a cure.  Patti i guess i see it so differently only because I have been dealing with a terminal illness for such a long time. So for me I say \"I'm a breast cancer survivor surviving mets\".  About keeping things normal.  We keep it as much as possible. My daughters sometimes ask if things would be different if I hadn't got sick from scleroderma. I sad yes I would be that very mean strict mother that wouldn't let anything slide at all.  \"oh MOM\" They say.  Yes it has sucked big time at times, We have found so much ro appreciate.  One question that my youngest daughter had ask was \"how come you have to tell everyone about our life\" referring to my two diseases.  I said because people want to hear especially after being in the newspaper several times.  I was doing a fund raiser at Safeway.   My youngest daughter was with me and several other people. I was standing there talking to people.  I had a man and two sons come up and talk to me about his wife and cancer. What she was going through and how difficult it was. He wanted to know how I was dealing with it. We talked about so much. It was so neat because my daughter had seen how I had helped this man and two sons.  \"she said mom now i know why you talk about your illnesses.\" I also told her how it reallu helped me.  It was such a light bulb moment for her.  Patti I also feel support is a personal comfort and how ever one chosen to do so. that is up to that person. Thats why I get on here because the support is so GREAT.  I also love working at Safeway. I have so many customers that come in to bless me, hug me and just to check on me to see how I'm doing. It gives me more strength, a feeling to fight like no other.  sorry so long winded Heather ",

There should be documention by your Drs establishing this.  Do you have an attorney? Because I could see the other side saying that cancer takes about 10 years to be detected and all those issues are the cause of your pain. Insurance companies try not having to pay anything. they are in this busines to make money and are very reluctant to pay out.  I hope some of this is helpful. Heather",

As far as the procedure being done LuAnn gives great detail on how its all done. Although I had mine in the t11-t12 area and still did not feel pain. one thing i came out of it very hungry because they didnt want me to eat 12 hours before and i go to bed at 9pm and then the procedure was delayed about 2 hrs. When I was ready to eat they did bring me a nice plate of food. salmon, rice pilaf, steamed fresh veggies,  I hope and pray that all the test come out b9. Heather",

Sometimes I wish our Onc would do the same and really listen and see what goes on with these boards. I really think they could learn a few things from all of us. As far as the cursing I think at some point we all have used it, just out of plain frustration. VATS surgery sounds very interesting. I have not heard of that.

Yes it sucks to use a wheel chair i have used a manual and electric wheelchair and boy howdy I can give you some stories. But first I will give you some pointers. Some of these have been mentioned but i want suggest them again, Occupational therapy and physical therapy has been a big part of my life. Even when i was enduring pain that i did with my disease. i continued PT. For me it was a good pain because I knew it was going to go away and i believed in my heart it was doing me good and eventually it got  me out of the chair. several years later but it did. With occupational therapy they came into my house and did an evaluation of everything i needed to better my life. it was amazing what things there are.   They can but these hand rail bars in every position to aid you to go to the bathroom, shower, shower chairs. when my strength was better I used a walker. also the raised toilet seat, one other thing i didn't have to use but was reccomended was they can have this thing installed from your bedroom ceiling that you can hold onto and its helps you get to your chair. now that i'm talking about this i really suggest Occupational Therapy, They were really helpful. Luckywife, I want you to remember this you are a fighter you have proven this to me. I would love to send you the articles they did on me about the scleroderma. if you are interested please send your address. It will show the pain I endured and how so many postive people came into my life and how postive prayer, thoughts can get us through anything. That being said I am sending you a great big virtual hug and lots of postive thoughts and prayers your way. Heather",

But i have with the scleroderma, its a very scary feeling to be choking I dont do it near as much as I used to but when i was at sickest, my esophogus was so week and so very sore i really couldnt swallow. I would choke when I tried to eat. My family would make me something to eat, they would cut whatever into very tiny bites and my two little girls at the time would say \"momma you can do this\" what helped was having a big glass of liquid to help swallow the food down. that sure made it easier. Something else I would do that helped to keep nutrients in my body, just because i wasnt eating the portions i surely needed. My husband and kids would make 5000 calorie shakes, smoothies, I used a straw for those, then i could get it far enough to the back of my throat and it was easier to swallow.  I hope maybe that could help your mom untill you can get into the Dr. I hope the best for you and mom Heather",

Actually when I was first dx with BC I was really sick with scleroderma 88lbs They thought the tx would kill me (they later told me) But it did do amazing things. My scleroderma actually got better.  I got fat and sassy.  My ONC is going to watch me very very closely and I will be going back to my rheumatoligist Progression is in the bones, nodes. Thank god it wasn't in the lungs. He is worried how fast and hard it game back.  I'm thinking to have my receptors check again. just to make sure something hasn't changed. luvtotravel. I was on taxotere it did put me in ned statis.  He would of put me back on it if it hadn't been so soon to return.  I am a little sore from the Femara.

I must say for me it hasn't happened to much. But it does. I had a mother, daughter and boyfriend come into Safeway looking for flowers, she was kinda arrogant anyways. She treated me like I didn't know a darn thing.  I went into the cooler to get something for her and  as I was walking out I saw that she was mocking me how I walked. I was so stunned and lost for words. Her daughter was so embarresed, which she should have been. (I charged her for every little thing that there was to be charged for, things that she thought she would get for free).  For the most part I confront them, \"do you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to help answer any that you may have\" It also helps that I work in such a public place \"Safeway\" I also have other issues I have contractures in my fingers really bad. So it really surprise people that I can even design.  I had a teeneage young man. Very sweet ask me what was wrong with my fingers and how did I manage to make flower arrangements. I explained to him, he was totally amazed.   \"I always tell that person thank you for being honest and never be afraid to ask questions.  He has been a great customer ever since.  What I love most \"Is how children can be so honest in asking there questions\" ",

Now that I have been Dx'd with bone and liver mets, I go 3x a week, I use the treadmill(walking mode .50miles),arm bike(1.5miles),leg bike(1.5miles) many strengthening exercises and then The PT will gently work on me with freezy bio stuff and then the egg beater. I Have to say and I contribute this to PT I have not had any swelling (anywhere) do to the steroids. Also my energy level has gotten better.  Even though there maybe a day I don't want to go, I push myself and I'm thankful I do. Not only does it help physically but it helps mentally. Heather",

I have found that being on here is a great support system, It really is, I promise, I have been on here since Jan/Feb 08. I have seen things happy,sad,funny,very angry,even pissed off people.  I have seen ladies make magic happen when our sisters were in need of something. It really is a kinship that i will cherish, take with me and carry that with my daughters. Ladies correct me if I'm wrong.  But it seems when we have lost our dear sweet angels or we see the women that we have come to love by sharing thier most intimate feelings about what they are experiencing in this journey of the cancer world. The emotions on the boards can be quite testy. \"In my opinion\" From what I have seen It is something we just go through.",

You are going through rough patch, I know you will get through this. you are strong and with all of us we will see you through!!! LuAnn, When my health was such despare, I was 88lbs and bed ridden, couldn't go to the bathroom, take showers, my husband carried me everywhere,shower, S#%T, & shine, I couldn't even wipe my BUTT,I really had to rely on my kids and husband. then after 4 years of this I came up with ways to use back scratchers. As far as trying to eat and keep my strength I know truly this did help. We tried a lot of things. What we found that, what worked best for me to maintain my weight was a weight building product from albertson's, I would buy chocolate and vanilla flavors (easier to mix fun stuff into) the mix was like 5000 calorie to start. Then my kids would add, varies fruits, ice cream, wheatgerm, at the age of 6 and ten they had so much fun. Even if i couldn't drink it all I knew I was getting sustainable calories. This was something very important to. Yes it hurt, It hurt like hella bad. My philosophy was no pain no gain. I kept in my mind that the pain I was induring while they were working on me was a good pain, because that pain was going to make the bad pain feel like it wasn't so bad. I know this is totally different from what your going through, I share this with you, so you know there are various options and physical theripst are trained to help people individually. Also do you have any aids to help you, a walker, shower chair, toilet chair, wheel chair. these are things that can be borrowed from various orginizations, walmart or costco has these items at reasonable prices. Sending you a very TL virtual hugs Heather ",

It began with fatique, losing all my hair. going form 156lbs to 88lbs in less than four months, into the hospital with fibrosis of the lungs you could literaly push on my chest and i sounded like the little plastic bubbles we like to pop.  I had a open door at the emergency room. with needing antibotics for celluitis. The calinosis was so bad that it would literaly explode.even though i was ridden for almost 4 years with my husband carrying me where ever i needed to be. when a dr told me I needed to go home and get my affairs in order that gave me more determination to live. We lived our lives as best we new we could. never giving up. even though i was in the most escruciating pain i continue to go to physical therapy. it was a good pain it went away. with my family dr she supported me in any decision or idea that we had. we tried chealation, the hyperbaric chamber. alot of these things worked and with out trying them we would not have known. so with that \"try any and everything\". to make long story short.  Then i was dx with breast cancer. because i was already so sick i just really went with the flow. but the chemo i belive put me in a better spot at that time. I began to get stronger, eating foods with flavor. it allowed me to get enough strength to get a electric wheel chair and boy was i the cats meow. it gave me a new sense of indendence.. fall of 2006 went to floral design school and now im working at safeway floral. sorry Ill have to return its time to take my daughter to school. if any of you have questions please ask im an open book hugs and prayers Heather",

When My 41/2 month granddaughter starts giggling because I talk in a silly voice like the Simpsons My PT tells me the funniest joke The funny and sweet stories, that my boss tells me about her family. when I act crazy or silly with my kids. Or I tease my husband and kids when I am in a store. \"HELP ME PLEASE HELP\" I can't get to the bathroom I'm going to wet myself. I need you help!!! help!! Or when I FART so loud in a store \"I so kindly excuse myself as my daughters walking off and laughing her head off. Or that I can honestly say I look like ET and laugh about it. So I think I have a pretty good idea what having laughter and a sense of humor in my life, is all about. By the way the list could go on.  ASK any one that knows me.",

The insulation was not the best. I was so cold that we could see our breath. We would lay there clattering our teeth. We came up with ideaa to pass the time before we went to sleep. We would start  to fake laugh and always ended up laughing so hard you would hear my mother and father call up the stairs. \"keep it down\" We would keep snickering and giggling because we could not stop laughing. \"evenually we would either get into more trouble or fall asleep.

I wish for it to be better news. but i do believe in miracles and you give hope for that. I truly understand the running to the bathroom (I would imagine I could run)  and not being able to get there. the outcome really sucks. I would try to schedule myself when to drink my liquids so i could pee when my husband was home. Needless to say that didnt allways work. especially when little miss diariah would show up. \"now that was just dandy\" Luckywife, When I was 88lbs at my worst. my 2 daughters were 9 and 6. we got them involved with trying to get me better. They loved it. and it really helped all of us especially me with my wieght and strength . they made these major muscle shakes. they started at 5000 calories. then they would and yogart, icecream, fruit just to see how many more calories they could get to make it higher. its funny they still talk about it. I respect your decision for hospice. this is definately a personal choice but I will say one thing there is a lady they talk about on bcmets. that has brought in hospice many times only to have them to leave. I think her name is Irma????? I'll call her the little energizer bunny. her story is quite amazing. well I hope the best for you. I will send you lots of positive thoughts and prayer. Heather",

We were think about gastric bypass for him and went to several of their support group. Met with dieticians.  The key way of thinking for us was using a good source of protien,  grilled chicken, lean meats (all with out Hormones or added antibiotics) Using less salt. vegitables and fruit and then very little carbs.  I know that it doesn't sound like alot but when we started to eat less food with out all the crap we were feeling very full and we didn't have to eat as much. It has been so much healthier for me too.  Also I will drink alot of water and tea with lemon. makes you feel so much fuller.  I will also make a snack of smoked gouda cheese with apple and various other stuff. I make things very simple. Excercise has been good.

S I'm just wondering If It had really done it's job.  What is zolodex and how does it work? Then how does Femara play into that?? Also, If you take out the ovaries would that make you a triple negative status? Is Femara also pill form?? LuAnn this is what scaring me I have been off chemo since Aug  18th, even though the weekly travel was putting us into a finacial bind. Part of me is thinking I should stay on Taxotere just because it was working so well with hardly any side effects.  How long can one stay on a chemo???  So many questions running through my head. It's really hard to focas. Thank you LuAnn",

I had been over to Medford visiting my family in Medford, OR about 97 miles away from Klamath falls. My youngest daughter kept calling me. \"mom Danielle(her friend) and I want to go camping\"  I was so very reluctic to go, I was very tired from the trip and because They wanted to tent camp. I was wondering how I would get to the ground and get back up. she had it figured out we bought a stand up twin air mattress I really didn't want  to go. I told her if they had everything ready to go and I didn't have to lift a finger I would go. Well the little stinker had the truck ready as we spoke. She and her friend had all the makings for a very interesting dinner and breakfast. she even had  a beer waiting for me. they took my walker and found the fire wood. Needless to say these two girls had the biggest fire than anyone in the park. This is truly a memory that i will not ever forget, Iam so glad that we went. Heather  ",

Living with a chronic illness has become the norm for them. When they were younger we all went to counciling more so for my oldest she had alot of anger issues. we have come along ways. They saw a young mother who was very active, volunteered at school, camping, going to the coast, water skiing, hiking we used to play in the yard. then they saw their mother deteriate so fast allmost to nothing. we dealt with the closeness of death for so long about four years before i was dx with breast cancer. i managed to get through chemo. I felt like it had saved my life. It was amazing I started to gain weight again, I started to get my taste back. One day I woke up and didnt have to take pain meds.What was the most amazing thing was before I was dx with breast cancer. our local paper did a article about me and scleroderma. I went into safeway all i was going to get was a roasted chicken. It literally took me over two hours to get out of there. I had so many people stop to talk, pray, hug me I had the the most bizarre experience happen to me. there was a lady she ask if she could hug me said a little prayer kissed me on the forhead and said you are an angel you will be all right. The feeling that over came me took over my whole body. it was the most awesome feeling. So i truly believe i have made it this far by the grace of God.    I have been somewhat open to my kids about this dx only because my oldest is a SR and has so much on her plate. they know I have cancer but Mack notice i was on the computer reading a comment .about the 3 day walk. She was exited to see it. macks aunt and all hear friends are planning to walk in seattle  summer of 2009 they will be 16 then.  she notice stage 4 she wanted to know what stage I was I told her. she looked surprised. I said it was okay. Many women live with stage 4.  It was going to be like living with scleroderma and remember the dr told us i was going to die ten years ago. Why im going through chemo is to put it back into remission. its called dancing with NED. She laughed and said okay. So when are we going shopping? Thats teenage girls for you.  Pearl I hope the best for you Hugs and prayers  Heather",

Hi Deb C, Irina mentioned this and I have seen other women mention this. Maybe going to the chemo company and see if they have an assistant program. Some companies offer that. Maybe your ONC could help with finding that information. It just sickens me that ins companies do this. Ther'yre smart. It just boils down to them making a profit. Maybe we need to get our congressmen, senate people involved. Heather",

We had a dog named Oudi, he was a pitbull bluehealer, he looked like a beagle on steroids. My husband got him just before we got married. Oudi helped us raise two little girls, what this sweet dog went through. our family grew to love him very much. we had him 12 years. When we had to make the decision to let him go. I called the school to have the kids excused for the day. I told the secretary why.  They were  so understanding. So we put Oudi in the little blazer, loaded the family and off to the humane society we went. they were so wonderful. We explained to the girls why and what we had to do. We got to say our Good byes we stayed for 1/2 all was good until we got back into the truck. We all looked at each other and bald. My husband and I later talked about our emotions. We didn't realized how attached we were to him.  while we had Oudi we acquired a Jack Russell named Colby Jo. We love them so much After 10 years we have a total of four generations, Colby, Jack, Maddi Jo and now Yeager who is a our spoiled rotten bratt. This little dog throws fits like a 2 year old child. NO Kidding...When he's tired and ready to go to bed he throws a fit, when he's told to get in his bed he goes but he slowly creeps out. He's just a little stinker,  But we still love him dearly.  Heather",

What I like about all of this is is that we all are different in so many ways, we have so many opinions and ideas,(\"and this is a good thing\") but one thing we all have in common  is breast cancer. The advantage that i see in this journey is  that we all are very strong, we take nothing for granite and we love life to its fullest. As i have been on this computer for many wee hours of the morning just reading your comments laughing, crying, learning. I must say that all of you ladies are the wind beneath my wings. also i must not forget there are a quite a few ladies who are on here just to be supportive to their loved ones but i also have seen their passion to help us out also. I admire their dedication. All of you ROCK!!!!!!  sending big HUGS  to all of you.  also here is a long distance hug to all  Please put your right hand on your left shoulder keeping it there. then you put your left hand on your right shoulder so your arms are crossed and squeeeeeze realy tight.

It really is great to be a part of this. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HARD WORK Angela and her family will surely have a great time. I'll be at work the next two days but I'll check in on lunch time and after work. Randi thats awesome about the duplex.  I'll still check into time share also i'll check military maybe donating a room they have something real close to disneyworld. *******Also, just learned that with airmiles, you can be bumped or fly seperately from other family members, so if we are able to get enough airmiles we need to make sure airlines are very aware of their circumstances and they have to be together. My sister-in-law had told me this. Heather ",

      "Content": "Sep 10, 2008 01:31PM - edited Sep 10, 2008 01:33PM by heatherpalmerton My youngest daughter asked me today if I was going to the volleyball game that one of the seniors in the past had started as a senior project. It was to recognize breast cancer awareness and one of our local support groups(which i supported in the past because when I was first dx'd in 2002 they were there bringing me a sweet little care package, they brought me bras and prosthesis?MS(FAKE BOOBS) This was very nice of them.  I went last year and all it was about was how they beat breast cancer and they were survivors. I thought this was great. BUT Now that I have been dx'd stage 4 It's like they don't want me in thier little group. I made a phone call to this little group. I kept getting a answering machine, finally got a phone call. I asked alot of question. at that point I really wanted to talk to someone who was stage 4. She told me someone from another county would call me back. NEVER got a phone call. I also was told where they were going to have a support meeting, went to show up and guess what?? no one was there. No phone call to say it was cancelled, nothing. I see all the fundraising they do in our communitee I see in there tight little shirts with BIG BOOBS so firmly sticking out there. I so badly wanted to lift up my shirt and show them my scar from the mastectomy.  Set up to let people know about thier group. I felt it was quite clickesh. This is only my opinion. I'm sure not everyone is like that in this group. So I said to my daughter I would love to go but I wanted to get a shirt that said \"I'm a stage 4 breast cancer patient\" and yes I'm SURVIVING\"  I may just go down to our local shirt shop and get one.

I want your family to know how much courage and strength you have given by your grace and dignity you shared with us. You will be missed so. I will think of you and your precious family often. Dan I am so sorry for your loss. (((((Your precious children))))) I will say a prayer for you, your family and friends. Many gentle hugs being sent your way. Heather",
