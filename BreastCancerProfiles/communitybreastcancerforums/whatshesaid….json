I had some kind of virus last week (headache-naseau that comes and goes) and called in sick on April 2, and haven't been back for last 2 boosters. Its against medical advice and I will consider going back next week to finish. I guess my attitude is a bit flip and I'm feeling a bit onery about the rads. Its a gamble all around. On the bright side, I have a colonoscopy to look forward to next week LOL. I have been offered Tamoxifen but have -so far- decided against pharmacology. I don't know what is more intimidating...Stage 0 DCIS or longterm SEs of radiation and powerful drugs. I will likely explore alternatives and haved located a Natuotropathic Oncologist (official title may not be exact). There are 3 in CT. One REALLY helpful thing I got from the rad nurse today is a gel pad that protects the skin where its blistered and peeling. I dont know why she didnt offer it sooner. Its the kind of thing that chips away at my confidence in conventional treatment. The gel pad does need to be held in place...but its so much thicker and larger (circular) than the gauze nonstick pads...that I could wear a bra without any discomfort. In her pitch to get me to finish treatment, the nurse estimated I am about 2/3 completed with fullcourse. Not sure how rad math works, but I'm interested to hear more from anyone who can speak on topic. Best wishes and quick recovery to all you other spring rad ladies. And, as they say in Panem, \"May the odds be ever in your favor.\"",

Its called Kendall Aquaflo hydrogel wound dressing.  I can't post a pic here, but you can just google it and find it easily. It immediately improved the blister situation considerably. amazingly. wish I had gotten it sooner. One big mistake that I made last weekend was to try and temporarily cover one of the blisters while using the prescribed cream (nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide cream) where some skin had peeled away, using a guaze bandage with adhesive. Even though the adhesive made contact with skin that looked perfectly fine and was not sore, it caused that skin to blister and peel anyway.  I highly recommend the gel pad.  The nurse said some people store also it in the fridge between use so that it cools the skin more when applied. The gel pad is reusable. Just wash and store.  I believe she recommended wearing it for 3-4 hours, though I don't know if there are prohibitions against wearing it longer. I know that if you use any creams that are not water-based, it can cause the skin to burn more, so I followed advice on using prescribed RadiaGel Hydrogel. between full-time work, 2 grad classes, treatment, and going into radiation with extremely low ferriten level/15 (stored iron, ideal range is between 40-60 ng/ml), I have felt fatigue (a much deeper form of tired) but am able to rest often since I work from a home office. I've had two job interviews during this time too - one near beginning and one just this week. Can't plan when these offers come along... Thankfully, I'm usually pretty healthy, but I did deal with a virus symptoms for about a week and developed a beautiful cold sore cluster that likely heralds upcoming PMS and period. haha. so there's that ...but that's pretty standard when I'm run down. When I do get run-down or sick, its usually a perfect storm of \"virus, cold sore and period\" all at once. Just listing symptoms, no complaints here. on the bright side, I've had some really productive days lately too, when I feel a lot more like myself. Focusing on diet and hydration right now because for several weeks I really had no appetite and knew I was not drinking enough water, so didn't do myself a favor letting those essentials slip.  Once I overcome fatigue and clear the fogginess that sometimes settles in my brain, I may feel more inspired to research and make upcoming decisions. For now, just doing the best I can, and that is ok by me. following up with oncologist next week. haven't done BRCA testing yet.",
