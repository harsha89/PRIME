In July I had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. They found two lumps (one in each breast) that they thought were fibroadenomas. The radiologist explained that I would go to a breast surgeon who would order a biopsy on the largest one - and if it was benign, we could assume the others were also fibroadenomas and we would monitor them. When I visited the breast surgeon, she ordered core needle biopsies of the largest masses in BOTH breasts. The results came back as fibroadenoma in one breast and fibroadenoma with focal atypical lobular hyperplasia in the other. The surgeon recommended that I have that mass removed. I obtained the radiology and pathology reports, and the radiology report said that the mass that the surgeon wanted to remove was no longer visible on imaging. Which she didn't mention. Does that mean it's gone? I felt uneasy about just agreeing to have the surgery. So I am getting a second opinion at Brigham and Womens in Boston. I had to send everything over, including the pathology slides. The patient coordinator from Brigham and Womens called me this morning saying that the radiologist had reviewed my images and they want me to come in and have another bilateral ultrasound. When I asked why, she said something vague about shadowing. Now I am confused! I was feeling fine, now I am terrified! Would it be unreasonable to ask to talk to a clinician there to find out more? I have 2 weeks before my appt. Has anyone had a similar experience with second opinions? Log in to post a reply",
