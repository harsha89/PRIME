My skin has been holding out quite well, and I will keep fingers crossed that the 7-10 day 'peak reaction after last treatment' is on the calm side - the tech mentioned after checking, that the SNB scar might open up. Happy to report that the rib tenderness that I experienced about halfway through has almost completely resolved, and that my Houdini straight jacket compression bra really helped :). Had all my questions answered well with reassurance from MO on going ahead with the Arimidex, so day 5 on that down (opted for brand name vs generic with hopes of less SE). I'm another fortunate person in our big range of experiences here who overall did very well through this treatment with minimal problems - we are all so different. Congrats to all those finishing up with me and courage and support to those in the midst or about to start treatment. This group has been so helpful and supportive all the way through - hugs and prayers to all. Deb",

The routine and starting to see familiar faces has taken some of the rough edges out of the process, and I'm just glad to be on the track going forward, and appreciating every day of feeling fine. I had an hour wait for a very short check/Q & A appt with a stand in RO, who advised me that they do NOT recommend Aloe Vera gel due to risk of more irritation and to just stick with the glaxal cream as often as I can or have need to apply it. I am trying to pick up the exercise and improve my diet (a real challenge in this season!) to assist this process and hopefully reduce recent chronic insomnia. All the best to Peachy2, justmaximom, creativevin for better days ahead - and warm thoughts to every one of you. Deb",

No music, but did find the little monitor with visual cues for breath holding interesting and distracting. Techs were efficient and I found all the moving of the machine to be the only (slightly) intimidating part. Chatted with a very positive woman (much like those here) about her treatment which had a great calming effect. Thank you all for your sharing help! Now finished work for the rads period, and have been given my complete apptschedule, so on we go. Will finally have initial MO consult Jan 8 (10 days before end of rads) and keeping fingers crossed no surprises there. Better, hydrated days ahead for you Bjsmiller, and hope you are feeling good PattyMeg! Wishing you all a good day ahead, Deb  ",

Overall, skin doing very well so far and earlier rib/side tenderness has been relieved with use of compression type bra (lucky my skin has held out this far to allow me continued wear!). Doing well with minimal fatigue (despite regular insomnia) which may be in part to managing a 60-90 min walk daily at a good clip, which has kept 18 mth old Portuguese Water Dog very happy :) Our mild winter so far has been a blessing - timing is everything! I have really tried and done well in maintaining my usual positive attitude throughout treatment despite some pretty unsatisfactory and frustrating admin glitches and lack of information on this leg of the journey. After having my long overdue MO consult on Friday, I had my first emotional meltdown yesterday since initial diagnosis after reading and researching the hormonal therapy and possible SE that I will be moving on to. I had looked at this whole event as an obstacle to tackle and then get on with life. I think that I am only just starting to realize the impact that this event will have in my future for a very long time, and the idea of 'the new normal' starting to sink in. I do count my blessings, and know that things will get better, but this has been one of my more difficult stops along the way. My apologies for the lengthy post - I have an abundance of supportive friends and a wonderful SO, but it is only those here that can really understand. Wishing you all a good start to the week and some kind and happy moments to help along the way.",

Sorry for the horrible vision - I am creaming the bedevil out of the area! Marijen - I am large busted and had a fair bit of swelling & rib pain on the treated side, so the RO strongly encouraged me to get a major compression type of bra to hold everything in very tightly, reduce any pulling, and make the inflammation easier to bear. As Miss OCD had saved the tag, what I picked up (on the 5th store search) was a 'Nike Pro Rival' high support bra at a big sports store for $75 CDN. It was a learning curve to get in and out of, but I found it immensely helpful - I found that absolutely nothing moved when I wore it, so no rubbing/chafing in addition to everything being held in place - and I can wear it down the road too! Congrats Happy Hammer and upcoming to you PattyMeg - way to go! For those of you struggling through - we're all with you, and I sure do remember some dark moments along the way. Hugs to all, Deb",
