What a scary thing. Married 18 years this past June, have 4 amazing children. I guess I'm in for a real fight. Nice to have a place to vent with People who actually know what your going through, sorry you are all here though. My thoughts go out to all of you. Keep hanging in there, you all seem to have positive spirits. I'm working on staying positive too through this hell.",
