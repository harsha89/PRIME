      "Content": "joanie63 wrote: I was diagnosed with IDC in the left breast. It doesn't appear to be in the lymph nodes but won't know until the surgery. I was considering the lumpectomy then found out I was ER-/PR-. Still waiting on the HER2. My surgery date is set already for May 27th. My surgeon said the decision's up to me; a lumpectomy with radiation or a mastectomy. I'd prefer a lumpectomy, but not if the chance of recurrence is much greater. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
