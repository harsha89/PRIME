It never showed up as cancer on mammogram or ultrasound, even though I was having mamograms every six months to monitor calcifications.  I was lucky they caught it early.  If I had it to do over I would have insisted it be removed when I first discovered it.  The watching and waiting in my case may have led to an invasive cancer.  So ladies trust your instincts.  If you are worried about it be your own advocate, no one else will.  Good luck, the chances are you will be fine.

My main problem now is pain from the Neulasta.  I never in my life have felt my fibula hurt! I have been taking Advil 400 mg every 8 hours and that helps lots.  Anyone have suggestions for dealing with fatigue? I have been on my back for three days.  It's snowy here or I would go for a walk to see if exercise helps.  I am amazed how this much rest doesn't seem to help, at the end of the day I can't wait to go to sleep at 9:30.  Take care everyone, wishing you all bright happy thoughts.
