I'm 53, recently married (2009!) and am the wicked step mother to a 21 year old daughter attending university in Vermont. I am the VP of Human Resources for an Internet company in NYC but currently on partial disability - working about 15 hours a week until they replace me. I joined the BC ranks in 2006 at Stage 2B and thought I had it beat until last January when I couldn't breathe and discovered I was now Stage IV: liver and pleura and a few assorted lymph nodes around collar bone. Ironically, I had just completed a manuscript for my book, \"Breast Left Unsaid\" when I was thrown back into the world I thought I had escaped. I published my book in October (or Boobtober as I like to call it) and I guess I'm a writer now. Which I think suits me better. I've been doing live readings and getting excellent feedback - so its a nice way to spend my time instead of stressing about corporate nonsense. I'm on oral chemo (Affinitor) and Aromasin and doing great except I can't really eat decent portions of anything. I am planning several trips this year: London & South Africa - and planning a big party for friends and family on Memorial Day. Ups and downs for sure, but SO GLAD to know I can always come here and find friends who just know. I love you all.  http://breastleftunsaid.com Jude",

This week the breathing issues worsened and I'm going in for a CT scan tomorrow; looks like the right lung is not expanding properly (last year was the left - pleural effusion). Anyway - I'm tired of having to be the general contractor for this disease and pull all the data together myself. Has anyone ever had any luck at one of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America? Or some other cancer center that treats the whole person and not just the cancer? I have been to MD Anderson in the past and they are awesome, but I live in Connecticut, so it's not convenient. Any insights? thanks and I hope your day is the best it can be.

LuvRVing - I've been to Sloan although not since Stage IV and honestly, they didn't really have a treatment plan that included anything other than chemo. there was no \"integrative\" approach. I could try them again, but I'd be inclined to try Dana Farber this time. I just feel like cancer doctors focus solely on the cancer and ignore the rest of you and what keeps you well. Onward!",
