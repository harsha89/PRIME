This topic went straight to my heart.. not only because of the tunnel vision you get looking back, but also when I imagine any soul that must now face what we have journeyed thru.. My advice, as I now sit looking back at myself on the phone two years ago, listening to the words.. \"yes the tests came back positive for\" Ok, first please believe, really believe in your strength to face this. Believe it for you and for those that love you. Your body might be under attack but your mind and soul are the warrior part of you, with an incredible power... Do not let your imagination take a hold, or your fears of what might be.. take your new life, the one that has the Big C staring at you, take it on one minute, one day at a time, lower your horns and know you have the strength to take this on. When it got too scary, it helped me to understand that there are always others that have gone thru harder times.. I found a hero or two in unlikely places and tried to keep it all in perspective.. kids that battle cancer with a smile on their face.. I found a few kids that made my heart swell at their courage.. when I started to feel so sorry for myself I would go look for them and they gave me such strength.. if these little babies that should be running around playing with their friends, but are facing cancer with a smile on their face under their little bald heads, well heck I can suck it up a little! :) Advice also: Believe that in the science of Breast Cancer,this science has come such a long way, and dialed it in so well; your treatment will be the best this medical age has to offer, it was not always this way, but they now know this disease inside and out.. Jbockland, Wintersocks and Warrior Woman, hugs to you all for your bravery and your battle, I love the idea of the time capsule reading, I did this on a different forum will have to look it up to remember, yes one thing I think may be a blessing in disguise is acute memory can be a little hazy now.. so I really don't remember too much pain and anguish. more the love and support of my friends and family :) XXOO ANGIE  ",
