NatL12, I too am having a very rough time of it with the side effects from 1st AC - severe nausea and vomiting (am now trying my 7th drug change in as many days), fierce headaches, and horrific Stephen King-style nightmares that border on night terrors. Everyone is right about asking ONC re: muscle twitching, but it sounds like what I have, which is a form of restless limb syndrome, often induced by mitigating drugs like Claritin and Benadryl - bad feeling too. On the other hand, I still have my hair! It's a party in here. Where's the Rusty Nail crew? (THAT was a funny rant.) I am also feeling encouraged that I am managing to keep down my nursery school breakfast of one cracker plus two sips of apple juice. I wish you all all possible ease today. I don't know how some of you are coping with your particular set of burdens.",

Cyano, I'm right there with you babe, neutropenia, white cell count down among the wines and spirits. I lucked out with being treated at home: hope you did ay, too, because the damned thing is cumulative! Life, I am lighting a green candle for you as soon as I log off (I really am, I have one right here). What can I say? I live in CA and some beleive in the power of the green candle to gather up all the energies of avocation. May you find the bucks and the studio! Eagles, say WHAT???? Just when you need a little random pick-me-up, kerBASH!!! Not fair. So glad you aren't hurt. As for hair, I am now bald as the day I was born. My scalp is very tender, so it's hard to wear the wig I bought, even with the little undercap thingie, so I'm going with scarves and buffs instead. Mine fell out in its entirety on day 10 after my first infusion. Very tired, as are we all, working to keep a positive attitude, may your rest be blessed.",

I wound up in the hosptal with pneumonia the day before I was supposed to have my first Taxol, had to put it off for a week. Since my treatment, I have had disabling bone and joint pain, it really surprised me as it started prior to neupogen injections. Sat in the bathtub and cried last night. On a better note, I keep having these wonderful visions of us, one by one, flying or striding or walking down through the finish line as we each complete our treatments. Beautiful images.",

I had my labs checked yesterday and everything had plummeted. Doc says that is likely why I felt so perfectly hideous. She told me she has a nausea cocktail she believes will tame the beast when I have my 2nd infusion on Friday, and I feel weak and shaky, but so very grateful for the respite, and for the fact that #2 may not feel so bad. Invisible, and everyone else going through the jungle, I wish you the same respite. I found that on days when I could tolerate food, sorbets were very light and gentle on the tummy (but avoid lemon sorbet, lots of acid.) I also felt much better when I avoided any form of meat. Hair drama: I got out a box with all my old hiking stuff and found my buffs. For folks who might not know, these are very soft, and it's quite easy to deploy them in various styles; as others have said, they come in pretty colors and patterns. For me, they are totally worth the money. I'm kind of in between with the hair loss right now, and I've had a lot of itching. My pharmacist recommended a little witch hazel on a cotton ball for spot-soothing, and it's helped. SusanHG, it's great to know you know what I'm going through, and it pisses me off that you are having to go through it too with the hallucinating/nightmares. Does the little fox show up in subsequent dreams? I found, to my bemusement, that certain creatures are making cameo appearances as special guest stars on an ongoing basis! A peaceful goodnight to you all, and minimal SEs.",

I have stayed away recently because I didn't want to bring my down energy here and spread it around, but I see now that isn't an issue. I keep getting thrush too. It's disgusting. After Diflucan finally cured me, my whole mouth was so sore that when I went to brush my toofs, my mouth just burned as though I'd swished with acid. It took several minutes to recede, and I found myself crying on the bathroom floor. Also conjuctivitis (sp?), makes your eyes burn and sting and produce gunk. Yup yup, I have the weird smell thingie too. I bought some Pier 7 room spray, and that seems to help. Also, for when your pillows gross you out, Aura Cacia Pillow Potion (available on Amazon) helped me. I also am aboard the emotional roller coaster to hell. My husband died on new year's eve of 2009. I miss him terribly, and the loving arms that are no longer here with me, and i am so fu$/ing angry at the damned clot that crashed into his 52 year old brain. My heart just aches and aches, and I don't know what to do with all the pain. Because he's gone, I'm dealing with cancer all alone. . . Except for you guys. Susan, I can't even begin to fathom how angry YOU must feel about that total shit head. Sorry, I don't want to bleep myself in this instance, because that's what he is. Thank you, each of you, for the honesty of your feelings and your words. Oh, and tommorow is AC number 3 for me. I wonder what festive surprises it has in store! Peace to all, and I'll pay for the dry cleaning because I got tears on all your shirt shoulders.",

I had my port placed today, and am surprised to find it sharply painful, as Doc told me no one had ever had pain that wasn't immediately dismissed by OTC meds. But I didn't really come to whine, although I might, I have a PET CT in the morning, because of positive nodes discovered during my Lumpectomy. Then my teaching appt. with the chemo nurse, and starting chemo next week. I'm just flat terrified. I was nervous about my surgery, but having poison sent to my heart area through my chest port and then knowing it's sliding throughout my body. . .That's a different order of magnitude. And everone is so brave!! I will try to summon up my own courage. There are so many great people here, and so much wonderful information to be found.
