I'm with you when you greet each day And while the sun shines bright, I'm there to share the sunsets, too ... I'm with you every night. I'm with you when the times are good, To share a laugh or two, And if a tear should start to fall ... I'll still be there for you. And when that day arrives That we no longer are apart, I'll smile and hold you close to me ... Forever in my heart. A Poem I found that I thought fit very well. ",

I put it on a memory board for her and I know she would have loved it. She would have also wanted to say thank you for the support everyone here gave her. A place to go and talk. So Thank You. She will be greatly missed. ",
