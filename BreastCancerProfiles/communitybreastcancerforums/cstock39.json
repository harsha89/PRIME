Lumpectomy was my first choice. My plan has changed serveral times. 1st: I was doing lumpectomy with sential node removal then 5 weeks of radiation. Now we have received the path report from surgery and now I need chemo & radiation. I meet with onc doctor tomorrow. I was dx with ICD 5.3cm stage IIIa grade 3, 1/3nodes and er-/pr- her2-. I said the same thing to my doctor if you need to do it do it now (re:mastectomy) but he told me that until the path report comes back he would not do anything radical. My sential node came back clear. So when I received that dx I was in shock-and then to be told that I had to go through chemo was another big shock. But I know it is everyones personal choice- but if you trust and respect your doctor then I would go with his advise.  You need to make the decision based on your feelings. My best support has been my family & friends. Trust your gut feelings and remember there is a bunch of us on this same rollercoaster of confusion. Good  luck you will know what is best for you!! ",
