I go to sleep fine (around 9:00 or 10:00). By 1:30 I'm wide awake as if it's morning. I usually can go back to sleep around 5:00 am for a bit, but not for long. In the past, I've had trouble sleeping for a few days, but not weeks on end. Lunesta is not working, Ambien is not working, muscle relaxers and pain killers are not working (they usually make me sleepy). Doc has prescribed Restoril now, but I'm afraid to take it since it's addictive. I'm also not sure it will help. Take Magnesium and Melatonin every night, along with hot baths. Lavender in my diffuser. Nothing is working! If you have experienced something similar, any success stories? Does it go away after chemo?

The bone pain is awful, and I'm not sure I want to go through it just to reduce risk of infection I can manage other ways. I don't want to delay my cycle, so maybe would be more willing to take it after round 3, but really thinking about not after round 4. And maybe not round 3. I am taking Claritin and Tylenol, but still having the pain.

Removing my back issue (which I will get to in a minute), I would feel pretty good right now. My incisions are healed, by breast achiness is mostly gone, the tightness is getting better each day, and my energy is somewhat coming back. BUT, the big issue is my back. I had lat flap done on the left side, and the pain is not getting one bit better. In fact, it's either getting worse or I'm getting less patient with it. Here's what it feels like...... It's in my mid/lower back on the left side. It feels like a muscle that should be flat and outstretched has contracted and tightened up to a \"baseball\" and that everything attached to it is being pulled into the contraction. It doesn't spasm, it doesn't contract and un-contract, etc. It just feels like it's tightened up to the baseball and won't activate, won't stretch, won't release. I am currently not doing any exercises or PT, and it will probably be December 3rd before I start (due to Thanksgiving and then chemo on the 27th). I really, really hope that I'm not causing a greater/longer recovery by not having anything targeted to it now. I know that it is trying to heal from the \"damage\" and am concerned that it's learning something chronically painful that is going to be very difficult to \"untrain\" in a few weeks. The longer it's knotted up, the harder I'm afraid it will be to release. Not sure anyone will have any insight, but would very much welcome it if you do.

      "Content": "JennieKeaton wrote: Hi Everyone! I had a DMX on 10.24 with tissue expanders. Had four nodes removed from right arm at that time. Currently undergoing 4 cycles of TC chemo. After my second cycle last week, my right arm feels a bit \"off\". It's almost like a tiny bit of a pinched nerve. I have no swelling, and the feeling of \"off\" comes and goes. I'm not sure if I'm feeling an early lymphodema, effects of the neulasta (bone pain) or just SE of the chemo (neuropathy). I'm also not sure how to watch/monitor. I'm hopeful that with only four nodes remove, it's unlikely to be LE, but don' t know how to know for sure.....
