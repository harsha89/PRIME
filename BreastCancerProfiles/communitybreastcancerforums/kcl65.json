An MRI saw something suspicous in my right breast that would require a second biopsy.  I decided to go with a blm and immediate reconstruction DIEP flap on June 9th. My oncotype came back that I did not require chemo but I am on Tamoxifen. This past year has been tumultuous, but here's to an awesome 2010! Kelly :)",
