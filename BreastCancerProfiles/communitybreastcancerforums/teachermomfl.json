      "Content": "teachermomfl wrote: Hi everyone! I believe I posted in here a few years ago when I had a lump. That lump turned out to be just one of several cysts I've had aspirated over the past three years. That being said, call backs after screening mammograms have become the norm for me. Since I have a history of call backs, I decided to go with 3D this time around. I was called back for compression mammogram and ultrasound on right breast for partially obscured masses (I have very dense breasts) and a magnification mammogram due to microcalcifications on my left. I went today, and was there for two hours. Tons of pictures of the left breast and then the ultrasound. Afterwards, the radiologist came to speak with me in an office(that has never happened before). He said the good news is there are just cysts in my right breast, but the not so good news is the calcifications behind my left nipple \"don't look good at all\". I'm scheduled for a stereotactic biopsy next Wednesday. I wanted to wait until after Christmas so I don't have to take off work, but he insisted I take the first available slot. I've read up, so I know the majority of calcifications are benign, but this dude scared me. Has anyone ever had microcalcs behind the nipple before? I did not get a copy of my report. I should be able to access it online Sunday or Monday. Diagnosis: ADH-12/26/17 Log in to post a reply",

I have only been diagnosed with ADH(per stereo biopsy), thank goodness. Given that I don't have an actual cancer diagnosis,does that mean they will not have to test any nodes? Just curious. I didn't think to ask my surgeon about when we last talked. Diagnosis: ADH-12/26/17 Log in to post a reply",

We were trying to shoot for Jan. 19, but it\u2019s too close to MRI date, and surgeon wanted to wait. I will have a Savi Scout seed implanted the week before biopsy. I guess this takes the place of the wired which are typically used. Has anyone had this done before? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any discomfort from the seed.
