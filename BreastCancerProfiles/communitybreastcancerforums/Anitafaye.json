My surgeon was great...3 surgical sites healed well and you can't even see the port. She is amazing.  I have my second TC treatment on the 5th.  I get Chemo at the hospital I work at, as oppsoed at the Cancer center aross the street. My insurance decided that it would be considered out of network. The nurses that give me the treatments are very competent, at least 1 of them is a bc survivor. I had nausea after the first treatment, the my perpetual new seat in the restroom for about 5 days. I am finally feeling like I can eat something other than yogurt and chicken noodle soup, however, EVERYTHING tastes salty. Even water.  My energy level was phenomenal on the steroids for 2 days..... then I crashed. Starting to feel \"normal\" just in time for #2. My waist length hair is thinning... time for the Halle Berry cut this weekend. I will probably cry, but at least a friend will be doing the deed. My weakness is that I never let others know how this is affecting me. I have a really strong personality and get really ticked when I have a low moment. Everyone tells me how well I am doing and how positive I am.... there really isn't much of a choice.... you either get through it or you don't. I just wish they wouldn't say \" you don't look like you have cancer\"...... how exactly am I supposed to look? Thanks for listening or reading my post.... I will do better with practice... I promise. Good luck to everyone with treatments tomorrow!",
