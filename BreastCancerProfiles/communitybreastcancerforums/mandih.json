I am very religious about self exams and any changes in my body for that matter. Previous to this I had noticed my right breast was noticeably larger than the other and mentioned this to my OBGYN at my yearly appointment in Feb. She said it\u2019s normal and not concerned. She also said my breasts are lumpy. I\u2019m 33 So fast forward to this week. I notice the lump in the left breast, see my PCP 2 days later, she feels the lump and writes an order for mammogram and ultrasound and does a referral to a surgeon just in case. I was able to get in the same day, thankfully. I hate waiting. The left breast came back normal but there were 2 suspicious spots on right. I was surprised. They went ahead and ordered an US of the right breast and also did the ultrasound of the palpable area on the left. The ultrasoun matched the mammogram. As of now it says birads 3- probably benign. I see the surgeon this upcoming Wednesday. Does anyone have a similar experience like this? If so what happened? I have the disc of images from the mammogram and ultrasound and have compared them on google. One looks possibly like a cyst and the other a fibeoadenoma. This could explain the larger breast size on the right which steadily gets larger. Log in to post a reply",

I accurately diagnosed a brain tumor a couple of years ago- I had a good idea based on my symptoms but once I received the scans, I was sure. So by the time I had a consult with the neurosurgeon, I knew exactly what it was and which surgery I wanted. Googling has helped me advocate for myself. I definitely hope what I\u2019ve seen in this instance is correct but I am also worried that it\u2019s more",

It was not picked up on the mammogram and I'm fairly certain the ultrasound tech didn't check that spot as she only checked where the little sticker was The surgeon says they look benign, a cyst and fibroadenomas. I'm hoping the biopsies confirm this.",

I am definitely relieved to receive this report. I have a follow up in 6 months. I do have 1 question if anyone can answer it- I will also send a message to the doctor it. One of the specimens on the report says \"adequate for evaluation but limited by scant cellularity\" Is that ok? Should I follow up on that or just wait the 6 months? There are also other words in the descriptions that I don't understand but the dr didn't seem concerned.",
