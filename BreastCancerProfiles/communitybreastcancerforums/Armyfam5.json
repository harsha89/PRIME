I hope that is correct and I am going with it :",

      "Content": "Armyfam5 wrote: I am new here and trying not to worry so I thought that I would just share and maybe I would get more reassurance here than I would get from reading on the Internet. I have been lurking for about a week though... ;) I am 46 and went in for a routine mammogram June 24, which came back birads 0 - need additional imaging. Due to : small clustered microcalcifications within the right superior breast. It also said that the breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue. It also says that \"there are benign appearing lymph nodes within the axilla\" and the next line says, \"the axilla contain a few benign lymph nodes.\" I had not seen any notes previously about b9 lymph nodes on other mammograms. I got the call to have a diagnostic mammogram the day I was leaving on a 2week vacation, so I didn't schedule the next mammogram until the Tuesday after I got back (July 13). I didn't hear anything from the tech while I was there, I asked and she showed me what it looked like and said she would have to wait until the radiologist read the report. I didn't hear until Friday and they called and asked what surgeon I wanted to see? WHAT? That was my first response and the nurse who called me said that she thought that the dr had already called me, which she hadn't. She backed up and told me that I needed to have a biopsy done by a breast surgeon and she gave me the name of 2 and told me to go to the one who took my insurance and could get me in the soonest. I couldn't get in until August 8th (3weeks) so I called another one that she didn't refer me to (but was in my insurance network ). The first two asked me bring in all reports and films when I came in for the appointment, but the one I called on my own asked me to have my gyn fax over the report and then they would call me and tell me when I could get in. I am waiting to see if they will get me in sooner. I am not sure my dr was happy that I called someone that she was not familiar with, but stated that if I could get in sooner it was fine. I just got the report this morning and hoping it is better? This is what it said...spot magnification views demonstrate a cluster of somewhat amorphous microcalcifications in the upper outer right breast approximately 4.5cm from the nipple not clearly layering/teacup in configuration. These are new when compared to the last exam. Impression: cluster of microcalcifications in the upper outer right breast, indeterminate. Stereotactic biopsy recommended Birads 4: suspicious abnormality Okay so that is it...lol...thanks for listening! Any input? Log in to post a reply",

I am thinking that since I didn't have to come in right away, things are okay in their mind and I shouldn't worry. I am going with the theory that they prioritize and so I didn't need to be seen immediately? My report recommendation is for a stereotactic biopsy, but maybe they will do an ultrasound and see everything is okay and I will not have to have that done? I read on another thread that that happened to someone...and I am not looking forward to having a biopsy. My gut is that the grouped of microcalcifications are where an old cyst used to be and that is what I am praying for.",

I am now scheduled for an ultrasound to make sure some of the cysts have changed at all and then a biopsy (in case they feel like they need to change the plan). I tried to get a feeling for what she thought. She really wouldn't tell me anything but I had a 50/50 chance of it being anything. She said it could be ADH or DCIS, but if they found anything at all it would most likely be very small and taken care of easily no matter what it is. I am hoping for the 50 percent that is nothing at all. Now I have more waiting :/ wait for ultrasound and then biopsy. On to the waiting game! Again",
