I was enrolled in the Targit study which uses the Zeiss Intrabeam system. What I can tell you is that I was extremely happy with my choice and the result. No SE's other then a day or two of fatigue the following week. My insurance did pay for this. I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have (you can PM me). Best of luck in the enrollment process!  ",
