I think you should see if there is something powerful that they can give you to give you some relief.  I am so sorry for you! I also have been busy with the last weeks of school.  My son came home from college yesterday, it is so great to see him.  My daughter has finals this coming week then everyone is off until January 5th.  My kids will both be home to watch me go through chemo #3 of 6, so I hope it wond't be to hard on them or me.  I am not use to all the activity, usually the house is quiet.  We will just have to take one day at a time.  I also will be pretty bad for Christmas, but atleast the house is decorated.  I think even though it is a lot of work to put them up, it brings me joy. Hang in there everyone!  Kristi",

I think I would call your oncologist and see if he couldn't do something else to help you.  Don't worry about the kids, they are probably really happy.  Mine too are sitting around a ton watching TV.   They will be OK. Just take care of yourself.  We are here for you!  I hope you are better. Kristi ",

The whole thing took about 3 hours because they wanted to explain things to us, I slept the 45 minutes back to our house where I took a 2 hour nap.  The nurse was great, got me with one prick of the needle piece of cake.  I expect to hit the wall tomorrow, hopefully just a little wall.   Jill when I went in for my MRI it initially showed that that I had things in both breasts, but after an MRI biopsy a week later it showed only in one breast. So don't get worried until after all ALL your results are in.  I only had a single mastectomy which was really OK, it just takes a while to find that place where your mind can rest a bit. Deb, good luck tomorrow, hopefully yours will be as uneventful as mine was, at least so far. Let me know how yours goes.  What drugs are they giving you.   My bathroom looks like I am a drug addict (7 prescriptions). Kathi, Thank you for all your thoughts, how has the hair thing been going?  I am expecting to loose mine before Thanksgiving. What a drag. Peace to all - sleep well....Kristi ",
