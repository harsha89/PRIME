Three weeks ago I had some discomfort in my left breast towards armpit. Assumed underwire malfunction. Few days pass and having achy heavy feeling of discomfort. Self exam revealed small lump. With family history opted to see a doc. Referred for US then mammo if necessary. US ruled out cysts. Mammo discovered two lumps, radiologist review resulted in additional scans. Due to age and lack of comparison was told to return in 6mos for new scan but to confer with my doc prior to scheduling. Doc referred to breast specialist. Unable to get in until August (strangle reassuring as I feel if it was emergent they'd see me right away??) Pain had tapered but has returned 3 weeks later full force. I'm unable to raise my arm without discomfort. Hurts to be pressed on. Self exam has me anxious as I feel it's grown and found another lump underside of breast vs close to armpit. Anyone have any recommendations? Am I overthinking. Should I push to be seen sooner? I don't want to be a spaz. Anyone know how easily identified a fibroadenoma is vs cancerous lump on scans? **ive been asked about my cycle multiple times and unfortunately had complications during a pregnancy resulting in a hysterectomy at age 27.
