      "Content": "janie-r wrote: Hi all - Had Mastectomy of left side June 5.  Was told not to raise my arm above should level until last visit on June 26.  Arm is very stiff and sore tendon that goes from the armpit all the way down to the wrist.  I have a tendon that sticks out in the armpit and this was extremely sore until last week and it calmed down a bit.  Doctors nurse said they've never heard about cording and told me to work on my exercises to stretch this tendon out. How do I know if I have cording??  Will the stretching exercises help even though this arm is really stiff especially in the forearm?? There is no therapists in my area that know about massage to relieve this.  Also, am really freaked out about getting lymphedema.  Once I heal more I would like to help the husband out with the wood we burn every year.  Could hauling and stacking wood cause lymphedema.??  Will I ever be able to resume all the stuff I like to do outside??  Can y'all help me out???

Thanks again and I will let you know how it goes. ",
