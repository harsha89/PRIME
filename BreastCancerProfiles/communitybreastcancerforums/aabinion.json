I think mainly he was ok with it because of my family history. He was sad that I was gonna mess up his good lumpectomy that he did. He really did do a great job so, I am hoping he does just as well the second time around!",

I had lumpectomy chemo and radiation.  Swimangel72 - I am going to have bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction on November 16th. I decided I would feel better and not worry so much if I just got the \"girls\" removed. I wish I had done it in the beginning but it was too much at the time!! ",
