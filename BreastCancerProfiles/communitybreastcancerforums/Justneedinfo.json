I find it funny but not really that I was told I'm too young at 35 but there's a link for honoring our young mbrs and it's for anyone dx under 35 so I not sure now if I'm that young. But just wanted to say hi and if anyone has any tips for me. Single mom daughter is 2 and I'm a full time bartender....was planning going back to school so I can have a better job for my future and ironically I was going to finish up sonography so I guess I got a crash course in reading my own. Not sure how I'm supposed to work or go to school anymore while taking care of her. Any thoughts from those who've been doing this? Dx 6/9/2014, IDC, 1cm, Stage I Log in to post a reply",
