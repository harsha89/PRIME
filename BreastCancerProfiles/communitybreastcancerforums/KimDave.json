My diognostic mammogram ended up being a birad 4b so here I am waiting for biopsy results which will take 7 to 10 days. Hate waiting but hoping all is benign. They took 9 samples and it was a cluster of calcifications. I have a strong history of breast cancer in my family but it still could be benign. I cam here for comfort and am feel it when I see people going through the same thing. Best of luck to anyone waiting for results.",
