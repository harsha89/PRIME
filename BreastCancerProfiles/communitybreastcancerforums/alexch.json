It was like it grew overnight. I never really knew if I had any cancer on my nodes b/c my BS said my treatment would not change due to the fact that I had a 7-8 cm tumour so she did not biopsy under my arm. I also had DCIS in the same breast too. I had a uni mx, full axillary dissection was my surgery, I was in a clinical study for LABC I did FEC, docetaxel and Rads.. I am doing the DIEP surgery on Feb 7. I am hoping everything goes well. Nice to meet you all! Alexch Diagnosis: Aug, 2009, IDC, 7cm-8cm, 0/15, Grade 3 ER+/PR+ HER+",
