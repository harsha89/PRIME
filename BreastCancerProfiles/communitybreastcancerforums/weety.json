Anyways, back to reality now.  It's not looking so hip and trendy anymore, so now the ears are getting covered as well as the forehead and, well, you all know how it goes. I am now about 3 weeks PFC and I can't really see much growth, but I have noticed my old sparse hair is starting to \"stick up\" and I can't get it to lay down anymore.  It's hard to see, but I think I have a very fine, short \"underlayer\" growing in that is almost translucent.  I think that is what is making the other stuff stick up.  I haven't decided what to do about the hair that is still there.  On one hand , it makes me have hope that it will help hide my scalp earlier (and at least the old part is still dark brown as opposed to this new, clear stuff)  and maybe it will help with the bang growth since I still have about an inch of sparse hair there, but on the other hand it makes it hard to see the regrowth and willl eventually look ridiculous since it will be a different length than the new stuff, it will need to be evened out once the other starts coming in better.  I think I'm going to let it be for as long as I'm still wearing the scarves, because what's the difference--no one outside of my family can see it anyways. Well, sorry for the long post.  I just needed to get my thoughts out.  No one else understands what we really go through.  Thanks for listening (well, really reading!)",

Things always have 2 sides anyways, because in all my research about chemo and anemia, I also came across lots of info about cancer cells thriving in hypoxia environments (low oxygen due to low red blood cells)  Some of the research even indicated that in these hypoxic environments the cancer cells even had the ability to \"turn on\" protective mechanisms that would protect them from the chemo!!!  LOL , like I said before, I should just stop the researching because it just makes my worries worse!",

Edited to add:  The radiologist that saw me thought it was \"low suspicion for malignancy\" and even posted this in my exam notes,  but luckily she had me do a biopsy \"just to be absolutely certain.\"  I am so grateful for her being proactive.  Again, a different radiologist might have had me telling a different story, because I would have just walked out and gone on my merry way and not even have given it a second thought.  We are taught to trust our doctors and do what they tell us.  But breast cancer is not a one size fits all, and it comes in so many different sizes, shapes, and irregularities.  It might not be a textbook case but still be cancerous.  I especially urge you to have your daughter pursue it because in young women breast cancers tend to be the more aggressive types.  Do not let her walk away with the mindset of watching and waiting--even if it is just 6 months.  Aggressive cancers can grow and spread quickly.  Demand the biopsy.  It is a needle \"punch\" guided by an ultrasound--it's an easy procedure, and I doubt if it is very expensive.  It is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.",

Whoops, just realized this was a Stage3 forum, but I'll leave it anyways. Hope it's okay.",

Please, anyone, let us know what you find out!",
