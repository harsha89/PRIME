I have an appt with my MO nex week and she wants me to start Nerlynx. I am real nervous about the diarrhea and fatigue. How was it in the beginning and were you able to keep it in control? I had my reconstruction surgery last June 9.2017 and I am still dealing with an open wound. I have a wound vacuum and just finishing 37 of 40 days in a Hyperbaric Oxygen chamber. Any information would be appreciated. I am just trying to get my life back and be able to go back to work.",
