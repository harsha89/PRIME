Sometimes I will purposely wait until I am starving just so I can eat more than I normally can. It's messed up, and I absolutely hate it.

I already lost 15-20 lbs when I was ill from the liver troubles, I am worried about losing more. I am technically still overweight (I think last checked I was 168 and I am 5'6\") but losing weight like this just isn't healthy, not to mention the inevitable muscle mass loss. I never in my life thought I would lost weight from having \"anorexic symptoms.\" I've always had a more than adequate appetite. Oh and I gained about 20lbs on AC/T as well! Stupid steroids. I am very surprised you haven't gotten your appetite back yet, I really hope that changes for you soon!! What treatment regimen are you currently on? I apologize if you already wrote that elsewhere but I am so tired and don't feel like looking. Ha ha.",

Have you - or anyone else here - experienced a different treatment schedule? I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but if this drug really is working (need to hear CT results from today, ugh), I wonder if my oncologist would agree to a 2 weeks on 2 weeks off type of schedule? That would be like a freaking vacation!!! As far as this neuropathy, yes I really hope that it remains at this mild level. I have heard stories of how bad it can be and I do not want to lose function of my fingers and toes, or worse, have trouble walking! Why do these drugs that can do so good, make us feel so bad? Why is this the way it has to be?? Sue I am so sorry that you are dealing with lymphedema in your leg as well! I have lymphedema on my axillary dissection side, but fortunately it has not been an issue for me yet. The worst was right after that surgery I was in Vegas - walking a lot - and I had hand swelling. I was diagnosed after I got back, got the sleeve/gauntlet, and wore them maybe a handful of times. I only wear it when flying! My swelling is so slight you cannot even notice it unless you carried around a measuring tape....but I should probably start wearing the damn sleeve. It's just one more thing, you know? Do you have to wear a compression sock for your leg swelling?? I suppose that would be easy to hide with pants and such!!",

The scan didn't say much about my bone mets except that they were \"not perceptibly different.\" But apparently that doesn't mean it hasn't done anything. I hope I can get a bone scan before December (that's when my next one is supposed to be), because that is way too long to wait!!! I can't get MRI's because I still have tissue expanders in... I never made it long before stage 4 dx to get my reconstruction. Also, my neuropathy in my feet was worsening enough for them to reduce my dose by 20% for the foreseeable future. I would rather have a lower dose and no neuropathy rather than having to stop taking a drug that is WORKING. They also have me taking 200mg of B6 daily. It's mostly a numbness but there is some pain associated with it. If I don't move around enough, I can feel it in my calves. I will take a 5mg Oxycodone if it hurts enough. Anyone else dealing with this? Anyone have any stories/side-effects/good news to share?! Oh in other good news, there's a woman in one of my Facebook groups that has been NED for a year on Halaven!!!

I had only gotten half doses my first cycle, plus I was so sick already from liver issues that I couldn't tell if I was experiencing any side effects from the halaven or not. Now that my liver is \"normal\" I know that this fatigue is 100% from the chemo. I guess there could be worse things, and I am lucky to not be experiencing nausea.  I'm sorry Tina and DancingVeggie that you have nausea so bad!!! That is awful. I was told that you cannot take Zofran with Halaven - something to do with the drugs' interaction with each other, I didn't fully hear when the nurse was explaining it. So I think you'd have to ask for a different med. I was told that Ativan helps. I take it anyway to help me calm down, and even to help me sleep sometimes. Can everyone tell me what days are the worst for them? I think today (two days after) has been the worst so far. I was kinda tired the past two days but not quite like this. I took at least two naps today, and I'm about ready for bed again only an hour or so after waking from my last nap. I also had a hard time eating today, despite being hungry! It's very weird. My mom made this delicious vegetable pasta, and right as the fork touched my mouth my stomach started to hurt. Even though I was hungry! It's awful. I had an Ensure shake just so I had some nutrition, and then later on had some cereal and a bowl of fruit. Anyone lose their appetite, or have weird stomach issues?? DancingVeggie- were you given a prescription for a local anesthetic cream (lidocaine) to put on your port before treatment? I was given one and told to put it on an hour before your appointment, and cover it with plastic wrap so it stays on there. It REALLY helps avoid that pain when they access your port. I forgot to put it on this week and I really regretted that. If you don't already have it, definitely ask. I didn't know they gave you Neupogen through your port - I always got Neulasta in my arm??

As soon as I finished radiation mid-late January, I started on Xeloda as a precautionary drug (long story) but also because I'm TNBC and had sneaky positive nodes that were found two months after my surgery. After the first week I had this crazy localized back pain that went away after about 4-5 days. I went and saw a chiropractor which seemed to help. I did yoga stretches, also helped. Then it moved around. It has not been consistent but has gone from middle back to low back, and so on. Currently my chief complaint is stiffness. In my back, hips - and worse after I've slept through the night. I am constantly \"on high alert\" so I think I am probably making it worse by being afraid of certain movement. If I slip or trip, I seize up immediately for fear of hurting myself, which as you can imagine just makes it worse. I use a heating pad and take ibuprofen which helps, but obviously the thought has been on my mind that it is bone mets. And honestly at this point I feel that if it isn't, I will be so shocked that I will probably go skydiving naked or jump in a river and scream with joy. Those things are unrelated but you get the idea. Anyway - I've read so many posts about post-treatment effects, drug side-effects, radiation affecting your back, etc... and I could be lumped into any of those categories, really. I have an appointment with my onc next Wednesday - my last appointment in late Feb went fine, he seemed unconcerned about my pain, probably because at that point it was new. When I mentioned to the nurse practitioner that it could be the Xeloda, she brushed it off, even though back pain/stiffness is listed as a side-effect!! Anyway, I assume my blood counts were fine because I got no call about that either. I know that I need to ask for a bone scan - which I swear I will do -  I guess I'm just asking if anyone wants to talk me off the ledge? I'm only 31. This blows.",

What qualified you to be in it, and why did you decide to participate? I see you were already on carbo/gem and Halaven. I'm on Halaven now for liver and bone mets. How long did Halaven work for you? I am hoping to eventually get on an ABT-888 trial. I got kicked out of one before I even started because of my liver enzymes. Also, I have TP53 gene as well, and I think my oncologist is sending for more of some kind of testing - something that he learned about at ASCO this past conference. Anyway, hope you are doing well. I am feeling a lot better than I had been... had a blood transfusion a week ago and it's finally \"taking effect\" and I'm not debilitatingly tired, so that's good. -Lindsay (I posted right above you as well)",

Please ask your oncologist about it. It is rough on your counts so you would probably have to get Neulasta/Neupogen but I actually don't think you would lose your hair. The next route after that could possibly be Eribulin (Halaven) which is what I'm currently on. We think it's working but I don't have scans for another few weeks so I won't really know until then. Do you have the BRCA mutation? You should absolutely get the FoundationOne testing if you have the means. Did you get results yet?? If you are BRCA positive, you should ask about PARP inhibitor trials. PARP is showing great promise with TN and BRCA patients. I have a friend on a PARP trial who has had 72% regression in like only 4 cycles of the treatment on liver and bone mets. It's a combination of Carboplatin, Taxol and the PARP inhibitor. There are other trials that have different drugs, some that have the PARP only... but you have options!!! Please don't think you are out of options!!!! Where has your cancer spread?? Please don't lose hope! Stay positive!! -Lindsay",
