I'm still waiting for a second US, but that won't change my mind even if it's all clear. I been watching these ladies post and some have had very similar symptoms that turned out BC, but also others who turned out with B9 results. It's just not worth the risk for me, especially since there has been intermittent pain. Whatever step you decide on everyone here I believe will support you. I'll be praying for you! Let us know what you decide:)",

Saw the surgeon today and she wants to remove all the ducts from my left breast but also found 2 lumps. One was the size of a dime and the other egg size in my underarm. She ordered another US for the lumps she felt. I will pray that everything turns out B9 for you! Hang in there:)",

For the US though they didn't scan my whole breast, just the nipple so they could get a look at the milk ducts. They completely missed the other areas of concern so now I have to get another one next week. ",

I don't have mine scheduled yet, the BS wants to see the US on the areas of concern first before we schedule in the upcoming weeks. I will have all the ducts excised and the egg size lump removed for sure but waiting to see what else they find or don't find.  I'm just numb...I freaked out 2 weeks ago, then thought I was being ridiculous, felt even more so when my Mamo and US came back fine last week, but turned to worried again when my  doctor actually called me to refer me to BS worried that they might have missed something. Too much to think about with 3 kids under 12 and a full time job. Praying for you and glad to hear that I'm not alone.",
