    "Content": "TexasChic1989 wrote: My doctor told me last month that I had two masses totaling about 2.5 cm on my right breast, and a mass on my left breast measuring about 1 cm. I also have a scaly nipple that itches sometimes and sometimes hurts with a tiny amount of bloody discharge and ALOT of peeling. My doctor prescribed fungal cream to rule out fungus, a different cream later when the first didnt work to rule out eczema and there has been NO improvement. I have a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on March 9th and hes going to take a biopsy of the nipple too, I dont understand why this is happening at my age! My mother and her mother both have breast cancer but they didnt get it until their 40's so I thought I still had plenty of time and could hold off on getting a prohylactic bilateral mastectomy until after I had kids! Im panicking and I dont know what to do to stop freaking out about this! Log in to post a reply",
