Otherwise I'll be traveling 2 hours back to Portland next Thursday if they want me to see the surgeon, which from the phone conversations, it sounds a likely possibility. My sister will be going with me. My mom is calling with a list of her questions and I'll have mine. Though I am scared of surgery and 99.9% sure this is technically 'nothing' as far as BC is concerned, I feel like the ulitmate result will be an excision. I'm just worried about whether they'll only take the palpable portion, or excise the entire mass as seen on the first u/s, which extends to my chest wall and would result in me losing about half the volume of my breast for a mass that is benign for all intents and purposes. I'll let you all know how it goes tomorrow. I'm happy to be seen at a clinic that deals specifically with breast health and not people who see breast abnormalities occasionally.  Erica",

She went through all my paperwork, got a chronology of events, did an exam and told me she is recommending another u/s for her fancy radiologist to look at it and surgery even if they see nothing. She thought it felt like a fibroadenoma, but was sure that would have shown up on pathology. She said the surgery is a good way to just be done with it and have a definitive answer and I would have a good cosmetic result. I felt good. She had great bedside manner, was reassuring. I see the radiologist who came here from Harvard. He can't find the lump, even though it's right under the skin and they can see the clip that was placed in a previous biopsy. He tells me it's just denser tissue, but there's not even a mass on the screen that he would ever biopsy- even though you can clearly feel and see the mass. He said he would be done with all of this, but if I were to go on, just an MRI. He said to me, \"I wouldn't have surgery. You will be disfigured and you'll regret it and you can't undo it. But hey, go have more testing. I don't know how many people have to tell you this is nothing before you believe someone. This is clearly about peace of mind for you. This is my opinion and I only do this for a living, so do what you want.\" What a dick. I hate being treated like this. I am not asking for surgery. Just someone to tell me what the hell this is.  By the time he gave me a completely opposite opinion from the first doctor, she had gone home for the day and is on vacation now. Maybe the radiologist is right. A lump that grew in the past 2 months is nothing and I've been told that a couple times so I should forget it. Erica",

I first felt about a pea sized, hard immovable thing under the skin, but when I would lean forward it felt like a golf ball inside. I had a first u/s and biopsy- u/s shows mass actually extends to chest wall, macrolobulated, branched, architectural distortion, irregular borders. Biopsy was negative. A month later, that golf ball that was previously inside is now easily palpable, maybe growing (5cm now), and right under the areola. Another doctor looked at it, performed another biopsy, which also showed normal breast tissue. Now, the lump seems to still be pushing forward, or retracting the nipple. It's rock hard (bent the needles on the 2nd biopsy). I have an appointment at the only comprehensive breast clinic in Oregon this Friday. I feel very conflicted about how to proceed. I'm confident in the 2 negative biopsies, but worried about the visual changes (which aren't drastic, but I notice) and the fact that the mass is internally vascular. I am seeing a breast health specialist, not a surgeon. If they want me to see a surgeon, it will be another 2 hour drive to this place. I want to have all my ducks in a row when I get there. What questions should I ask this doctor?  My main questions: Why the heck is 'normal breast tissue' growing into a lump and distorting my breast? What the heck is that? Do I need it out? I have been to a lot of doctors, but I still don't know what to ask really. They'll have my films, but may want another u/s or MRI.  ETA: I am kind of terrified of a surgery after my radiologist (who I know is not a surgeon) told me that if I have this removed, they'd likely have to take a significant portion of the nipple due to proximity.  Any similar stories or question suggestions are greatly appreciated.

The best thing my radiologist told me was that while my mass looked like he should be biopsying to test for what kind of cancer I have, not if I had it, he was still 99% sure that I was ok- young women just tend to grow strange masses. They still can't explain mine. However, with your family history, I'd call your docs and ask them to read you the reporth. The radiologist should certainly have his findings written up by now. If they found a questionable mass, it's ok to ask for- demand no less- a biopsy. If nothing else but for peace of mind. Good luck. Erica",

I am young- I am just 2 weeks shy of being 24 (I've just said I'm 24 on this site previously just bc it's so close anyway). The tech had trouble finding my mass and when she did she commented that it's definitely not a cyst, solid, and has no borders and looks really weird. The radiologist was young, early 30s at best, told my the u/s looked really weird on a couple slides, but kind of ok on a couple other and felt I shouldn't have a biopsy for 6 months and monitor the 'abnormal growth'. I insisted on a biopsy because I've heard too many sad stories where radiologists blew someone off because of statistics. Statistics are not comforting to an individual! I don't care about the 80% of masses that are benign when I'm the one person sitting in a room with multiple people looking at and touching my breast and commenting on how strange it looks and how hard and immovable the lump is. It is likely that the masses are nothing. However, for peace of mind, please be your own number one advocate. And after the whirlwind experiences I've had this week, I must recommend you get yourself to a breast clinic. The treatment I received there (aside from the jerk radiologist) was bar-none. All the women were supportive and helpful. A couple of them gave me personal lines in case I had after hours questions or concerns or just needed to talk. Hopefully everything is fine, but it is important not only that you get treated for whatever the lumps are, but that you are happy with the treatment so you can ultimately feel the issue is resolved. I know I would always question the treatment if I wasn't happy with how the doctors handled it.  Are any of us experts? No. Are we all scared enough to possibly throw an embarrassing fit in front of strangers? Yes (well, maybe just me). But in the end, all I will remember about the experience is the outcome... how you get there is up to you. Speak up, please. You're on the right track and you need to follow through. Find more people who are on your side- they are definitely out there- and you have all the wonderful women here. Many who have been through much more than I have. Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat or have questions. I totally understand the frustration. Erica ",

      "Content": "Feb 13, 2009 11:09PM - edited Feb 13, 2009 11:11PM by ecm The truth is, and no one wants to hear this of course because we all want answers now, that there *typically* is no immediate rush to be seen. These things generally take quite a while to grow to a palpable size and nothing will change too much in 2 weeks. The ER is probably less versed in diagnosing breast tissue than an ob/gyn, and them less so than a breast specialist. I hope she gets into a breast clinic. Fibroadenomas are quite common. If that is what they suspect, however, I am surprised they are not opting for a core needle biopsy. Fibroadenomas are typically solid and the fine needle aspiration usually drains cysts. The core needle biopsy uses a larger needle so that if it is solid tissue, it is easier to draw out. A fibroadenoma can be left as it is unless it shows  atypia or hyperplasia, but some women opt to have them out anyway. It is a catch 22 in breast diagnosis because the fibroadenoma may grow and be biopsied several times, or if a lumpectomy occurs, it could form scar tissue that looks suspicious on later u/s and ends up being biopsied repeatedly anyway. I am caught in just that catch 22 myself at the moment. Her doctor will give better recommendations, but no one will know what it is definitively until she has that biopsy. And I know it seems like an eternity, but 2 weeks is about the standard. If you are uncomfortable with that, definitely call around to several breast clinics in your area and explain the situation. This approach worked for me and I was seen the next day or the same day at 2 different clinics. Hope that helps. Erica",

You need to see someone who has seen IBC before and can talk to you about your symptoms. To attempt to put your mind at ease, it's actually more common for women in their 20s to have cyclical breast pain due to dense, fibrocystic breasts. If your pain is cyclical, that is less worrisome, but you still need to be seen. Any changes need to be documented and investigated. I do not have cyclical pain associated with my growing lump, but I also do not have BC. It is just nice to be seen and don't let anyone write you off for your age- I have run into a lot of that already. Angel is right- talk to a patient advocate. Good luck. Keep us posted. Erica",

I am also in my early 20s and found a lump that ended up being quite large and needing a biopsy. So, go to your regular doctor and ask them to check it out. If it looks at all suspicious, they'll send you for an ultrasound.

I had a pea sized lump biopsied and it was benign, but over the next month or so it grew to about 4 cm. It was re-biopsied and benign again, but after consulting with a breast center, the specialst felt I should have it removed because she hasn't really seen anything grow that fast, benign or otherwise. The new radiologist also found a new 'branch' of growth extending toward my armpit. Also, like Beesie, I will over the next years be moving quite a bit and don't want to continue to explain to new doctors that the lump has been tested and benign.  I understand totally the question about removing it. I'm uncomfortable with such a prominent lump and I'd like to just remove it and be done with it. I'm 24, the lump is directly under my areola and I am concerned because some duct tissue would have to be removed. I also don't want to end up somewhat disfigured because I wanted a benign lump removed. But it is growing and if I don't have a surgery now and have to have it later because it continues to grow, I'm afraid of a worse cosmetic result because I waited. I am having a surgical consult tomorrow to ask about possible breast feeding effects (I don't have children and don't necessarily want them, but who knows), and the possible cosmetic outcome.  It's a tough choice to leave a lump in and always worry, even though it's benign, and even tougher to choose to remove it because of the consequences. You have to weigh all the costs and benefits for your particular situation. Good luck with your decision. I'll post tomorrow after I speak to the surgeon. Erica",

She's a 7 year survivor and was very scared for me. However, all is fine and I'm meeting with my doctor tomorrow to see about a lumpectomy because the thing is large and growing.  Erica ",

I am 24 and awaiting an u/s on Jan 19 with a likely biopsy for confirmation. I had my Dr. appt today and she was clearly surprised to feel the mass I said I felt, but she told me it is most definitely not a cyst. I kind of went into shock, but kept hearing- rock hard and immovable. Ultrasound needed ASAP. Not normal breast tissue. I also have very fibrocystic breasts. My doctor initially thought this was what I was was talking about and then felt the mass and all she said was \"Oh, Yeah. That's different.\" I wish the best for you.  I have been a mess waiting and my u/s was only scheduled today. I already have stress induced episodes of insomnia, but this is horrible. My suggestion is to call your imaging center every couple days and ask if there are any cancellations. You're not bothering anyone- your health is at stake. Do what you have to do. Most (80%) of findings are benign. Hopefully that's a small comfort in the agonizing wait. Erica ",

These are all things to definitely say to your doctor. Also, if it is just a small amount of discharge, try not to wipe it clean before you go in if at all possible. They will likely want to take a sample and have the discharge tested. They may even try to express a small amount of discharge, so don't squeeze your breast before your exam. This may be painful, but it's one of the things they may want to look at. Be sure you have your mammo done by a clinic that is experienced with implant imaging.. or simply read by a radiologist who has read implant mammo's successfully in the past. Don't be afraid to ask these questions. Were your implants saline or silicone? These are things your doc will need to know ahead of time. Are there changes in the appearance of your breast/nipple? Just be ready to answer these kinds of questions when you go in.  Good luck to you. Erica",

I found a lump about a month ago which didn't change in shape over my cycle and had it checked today at my yearly gyn thinking she would feel it was a cyst. She told me I have extremely fibrocystic breasts, which is completely normal for a 24 yr old caffeine addict. However when she felt my mass all she said was, \"Oh, yeah. That's different. It might still be benign, but you need an ultrasound soon.\" She was unable to move the mass and said it's extremely hard, which isn't characteristic of cysts. So radiology initially told me the earliest u/s and mammo combo I can have (they may still do a mammo even tho I'm young) is the 28th, but consulted with the breast specialist and was able to move up my appt to the 19th. I still feel like 2 weeks is a long time to wait, especially living away from family and bf, but I was able to be put on a cancellation list. Call every couple days and ask if there was an opening. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and it's not being annoying- it's your health. I was also afraid to tell my family, but ended up doing it and I'm happy I did. They're a good source of support in a scary time and hopefully you'll be able to confide in someone. Good luck. Erica ",
