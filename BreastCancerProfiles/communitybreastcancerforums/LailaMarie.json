Doc says the mass in my armpit is \"suspicious\" and wants a biopsy done. I don't have insurance, but am fortunate to have tribal health. There's a lot of red tape so I'm still waiting on approval for the biopsy. I have had nipple discharge in the past and they did a mammo (2007). They didn't see anything and told me I was fine. Now, 9 years later the discharge is back (Stopped when I got pregnant with my son who was born in 2012) and now I have a mass under my arm. Probably something benign, but will admit I'm worried. Hoping IHS hurries with my referral so I can get the biopsy and results as soon as possible. I hope you ladies find answers soon. Blessings!",
