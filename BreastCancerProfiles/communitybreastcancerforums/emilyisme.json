Here are the chain of events: Oct 11 - Found lump while putting on deodorant, went to Primary dr, sent to mammogram, then ultrasound Oct 16 - Sent to Breast Specialist Oct 19 - 5 tissue samples Biopsy Oct 25 - the \"call\"; Breast Cancer...will schedule MRI and Oncology visit Nov 1 - go to Breast Specialist to see if Biopsy was healing, he goes over pathology with me: Final Diagnosis: Metastatic Carcinoma, Compatible with breast primary within lymph node tissue ER - Weak Positive 20% Staining PR - 0% Staining Negative HER2 Score 1+ Negative 0% Staining Breast Specialist doctor says that this will probably be treated as a Triple Negative by the Oncologist. He says that I'll probably begin the 6-8 rounds of Chemo within the next 2 weeks (2 weeks between each treatment), next have surgery to remove the lymph node, then start quite a few radiation treatments. This seems really scary. Thoughts? Am I going to be able to teach while being treated? I see online that Metastatic Breast Cancer is Stage IV and only 22% live after 5 years. I really have positive thoughts about all of this. I haven't shed a tear. I just want to hear the good, bad, and ugly, so I am prepared. What's next: Nov 6 - MRI to look for the source (there's no sign in either breast) Nov 7 - Meet with oncologist to discuss the start of treatment Thanks y'all!! Log in to post a reply",

The breast specialist said it's definitely at least a 2. Thank you, MoonGirlJess for clearing that up! That's why I'm here. I hope to clear up some of my fears and self-diagnosis-es. LOL....",

Don't worry, I am totally stepping away from Dr. Google and will rely on this website for info. Hang in there with your treatments as I have read that they can be yucky. I'm looking forward to learning my treatment, just as you said. Keep staying so positive! ;) ",

Other than that, it wasn't bad at all. They were super nice, and I was able to go back to work afterwards. Tomorrow is the meeting with the oncologist. The waiting is finally coming to a hault (I hope he doesn't have an emergency and can't make the appt). They needed a medical advance directive, so that's done. My husband and I needed to do that anyway. Tomorrow I can meet everyone in the November 2018 Chemo thread, since I think I'll know my schedule. Thanks for making this girl feel better about things, especially the metastatic part of my dx!",

It's 4.5cm and the other Lymph Nodes look fine. In the mammograms, there is nothing concerning in either breast. Tuesday's MRI is to look at the breast and see if something \"lights up\" as cancer. I think I'm supposed to hope that it's there. I had a mammogram in Jan. '18 that had normal looking Nodes. I think this is quickly growing.",

I was just wondering what Chemo's process actually is. That's how much I really know about cancer (almost none). It sounds like so many have been through this.

Because I'm TNBC, I'm going to start on the maximum amount of Chemo first (8 treatments biweekly). It doesn't matter if I'm stage II or stage IV, I'm going to have the same treatment. The Stage will be more important after Chemo and before surgery. I'm starting to understand about 5% of this strange trip I'm on.",

I've heard something like that before, and needed to hear it again! Thank you! Much love everyone!! ",
