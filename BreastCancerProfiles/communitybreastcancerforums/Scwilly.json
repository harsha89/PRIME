No 1 went to Seattle, and No 2 is going to Boston. We live just north of LA - so both will be a flight away, with DS2 in a different timezone - almost closer to my homeland of England!. Whilst I miss DS1 - we do have a wonderful relationship communicating by text most days, and regular calls or FaceTime. His often calling either my DH or myself to get help proof reading his essays. In fact - last summer, when he was back, I missed our text conversations and we texted most afternoons to check how he was getting on at work (he was a Bellboy/BellHop) and how many tips he had managed to make. DS2 is being instructed in text convos - has he's not quite as good a communicator! DS1 sometimes calls out of the blue to tell me about a great lecture he has. Only once did I get a real scare when I got a call from an unknown Seattle number - but it was only a nurse calling to checkup on him (thinking my phone was his) after he had a fall, and I was already aware of his cut chin. When I went to college we had no phones and I called home from the college phonebook every now and again. My poor mother had to remind me to call home by once send me a letter just saying \"Our telephone number is still 777724\" (love how I can remember that 30+ years since) Right now I am stable with my current treatment - and I keep thoughts of what might happen if my health changes well away - not ready to face that yet! So I know I can't take away the sadness - but I will say there will many many good times and great communications to come.   ",

I would say that IBC is not known to get better and subside, it usually becomes progressively worse and sometimes this is quite rapid. For your 'red spot' to heal to a bruise indicates to me that the antibiotics had some effect. IBC would not do that. I cannot tell you with 100% confidence that you do not have IBC, but it appears very highly unlikely. Try to stay off the internet and seek advise from this site and from your doctors/midwife. Also - do not fear time passing. I took a couple of weeks form diagnosis to treatment - and my surgeon reassured me that this was ok and that thesis along game. So you don't need to panic. In fact you symptoms are probably hightened because of your fear and anxiety. I would advise that you need to address your anxiety - and then whatever your heath is you will be able to cope better. Please seek help from your doctor and perhaps consider the antianxiety medications.

This is the worst time, and if you are diagnosed (dx) you will feel better once you have more information, about the exact details and your treatment plan. Of course it's very frightening for you and your husband. Try not to worry about what you do not know for sure. That's so hard I know, but it's true at all stages of this disease. My tips for helping your anxiety is tokeep off the Internet and Dr Google, as the is a lot out there which is very frightened and misleading. It can be useful if you have something specific to research, and you can recognise valid and trusted sources. Also, fresh air is a great thing to try and banish anxiety, so go for a walk outside. Disatraction is what you need now too - watch movies, Netflix etc.Do not panic by the hour as BC is a long game and if you are DX then you will see that there is time to breathe and assess what needs to be done.

My radiation doctor gave me some fantastic advice. He said I had done everything I had been asked to do and I should gain comfort from that and to try go through life without worry. I did and often think back to his words. As you saw, I have had a recurrence, first DCIS and now in my liver, but I don't feel regret and feel I could have done something more beforehand. I say this because I feel you have similar feelings of - should I be dong something?!?! We can never know what is in our future a there are many dangers outside of breast cancer let alone from it. How can we prevent them all? As MTWoman says, you have seen a top Doctor who has reviewed your case and concluded you do not have IBC. This top doctor also concludes you need no further investigation. Take comfort from the fact you have done all you can at the current time. Spend you energy and thoughts (and money!!) on enjoying your baby. The greatest gift you can give him/her is for you to loose your anxiety. Whether that is something you can do alone or whether you have help with counseling or meds, it doesn't matter. Keep vigilant but don't stay obsessed. Give yourself a few weeks break of thinking and reading about breast cancer. I wish you well. Make this quote your new mantra \"You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying about the future'. It's so true! Sarah PS : thanks for your thoughts for me. I am coping well both mentally and physically at the moment. I don't know how either will be in my future but I am determined not to live life worrying about tomorrow. Edited for typos",

My biopsy had lymphovascular invasion: identified. Afer chemo the path report said 'Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified' my third path report showed DCIS, so did not report Lymphovascular invasion. On research, I discovered this meant (in simple terms) this was about the presence or not of cancer in the breast tissue and vessels on the way to the lymph nodes. See the Wiki page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphovascular_invasion Or the info on this site: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/vasc_lymph_inv So it could be thought that it's a good thing to have 'not identified'. For breast cancer the Wikipedia page says \"In breast cancer, LVI is not an independent risk factor for a poorer prognosis.\" I hope this helps. Best wishes Sarah ",

I also had genetic counseling and test which came back negative (my cousin had BC and Ovarian C) so I know Kaiser will support that if necessary.

I was going to have reconstruction in mid/end 2015, but this was brought forward to earlier in the year when DCIS was found in my remaining beast.

      "Content": "Scwilly wrote: I finished my course of radiation in July 2014. As time went on I realised I had a cough every now and then - not deep in my chest, but more in my airways and often it was as I was waking up. It wasn't too bad and I attributed this to damage to my lungs from radiation. I had a nasty cold (I think it was man flu!) over the xmas holidays and after that the cough became more persistent, but still not too bad. I had found a small lump in my right breast in October 2014. This was biopsied and found to be benign. On my 3month follow-up with my BS in Feb, he decided to do another biopsy and DCIS was found. So we have brought forward my reconstruction and I'm having bilateral DIEP reconstruction together with a right MX next week. I mentioned my cough to my doc, as I wanted to make sure it wouldn't effect such a long operation. He ordered a chest X-ray that day and I was also booked in for a CT scan just after. The Xray came back clear and the CT scan showed areas representative of post radiation injury and not a typical pattern for acute infection or metastatic disease. So I am happy to be reassured. My question is - Has any one else had a lingering cough after rads - how long did it last? What did you do to help it recover?

My scan however, showed the spots shrinking and showing necrosis. So I am reassured - though back on this not knowing schedule - gunna have to get used to this uncertainty. My tumor markers have never been an indication of trouble for me. My MO watches my liver tests which flared last October but are back on track. My side pain/discomfort is a little less now but still there if ever I think about it or when I take a big breath. I compare it to my feelings when I was pregnant - despite having tests etc you could never really tell what was going on inside. Sometimes I wish I was transparent (sounds yuk but i suppose if we evolved this way it would be all we knew! lol) Wishing you the best of results.

The non dangerous bush fire closing a couple of lanes on the freeway didn't help. This gave me time to think, and to think of you Micmel and to think of my life too with BC mets. We have such a massive item in our lives so many don't have and can't understand. And now M you are dealing with unbearable stress within your family. I can't give you specific advice - you know what is right for you - but feel you need to be comfortable with what you decide. I would say don't feed the beast, cut off what you can control, and what you are doing by getting legal advice is the right thing. (Btw I am appalled with the SIL's mother! Applying attorney advise to her own sons deplorable situation and advising he should stay with his wife's family only because he has the 'legal right' too and not because it's the 'right' thing to do. She has raised a toddler not a man!) I wish you peace and a good future relationship with your daughter but now you must deal with today's situation. On my slow journey in the freeway I decided I should embrace fun and peace and blasted my favourite Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez etc songs singing loudly along. I reslolved to be more choosey with what I do and how I spend my time. We need to think of ourselves, and though peace is difficult for you, putting your needs first is essential. This thread shows you have a vast army of supporters holding you up! Big hugs Sarah  PS: thanks all for advice with being treated as an invalid. I am definitely understanding that a bit more. You can\u2019tstop folks being themselves by trying to help and all are trying to do the right thing. So I do need to communicate more and not just silently sulk!",

I was told Cisplatin was the only drug I could take with my liver levels. Its hard on the kidneys, and so took 6 hours in total which included 2 * 2 hours of hydration to ensure my kidneys were kept ok. I am now on Carboplatin - I did 4 rounds of Cisplatin but its was hard on my hearing and I wanted to hold off in case I needed to go back on it. Although I understand Cis was a harsher drug than Carbo my white and red blood counts did much better than on Carbo. I had a Pet scan after 3 months and it showed real reduction in my tumor load. I'm going for another one tomorrow and hope to see its still good I certainly don't have the issues I had (lethargy, nausea, pale stools, dark urine) when I was really ill with my liver. On this thread I've seem many do well on Gemzar. My MO was going to add this to Cisplatin or Carboplatin for me but in the end we decided to keep me on a single track.

My nausia meds for AC were Amend, 1 tab morning of chemo, 1 a day for two more days. I also has Odansetron (Zofran) for 2-5 days as required. I only ever had nausia once, when I stopped the Odensetron early and I didn't do that again! It's a personal choice, but there was enough going on for me with the chemo that I wanted to feel as comfortable as possible. To me loosing my hair was the worst part, but I never researched/considered cold caps as I didn't want to interfere with the chemo. I now feel back to normal and the only remaining side effect is a little bit of tingling from Taxol (taxol toes) in my feet. My hair is almost back to normal - just a little shorter. Best of luck through AC, it will soon be over. If it's better for you to feel you want to avoid side effects of Decadron, then that's your choice.

This was really successful and I've been recovering well. Even walked a few steps 2 hours after the surgery! However, I started to get stomach cramps which I put it down to recovering from surgery. I could hardly eat or drink - so unlike me! However, these continued and I went yellow! Had a booked MO appointment and my bilirubin was 12.1! She got me an immediate ultrasound and they found a blockage, with a MRI confirming and giving them more detail. It was decided I needed a stent put in and my MO put in an order for an urgent ERCP procedure. Unusually, for Kaiser, we were having real trouble getting an appointment. The first urgent(!) one we could get was in 2 weeks. I had resigned myself for waiting, but was feeling really rotten and also worried about the level my bilirubin could get. My MO was not happy and decided this was unacceptable, so she booked me a bed for that night in the oncology surgical ward and I had the procedure as an emergency the next day. My bilirubin had gone to 19 but came back to 16 once they rehydrated me (I had really gone off eating and drinking) After the procedure on Thursday, I came out Friday. I am now waiting for blood tests early next week to see if the stent is working. I am feeling better, though a bit shell shocked. I'm eating and drinking (DH is like a Sargent major on that 😬) In the meanwhile I managed to fit in a Friday radiation planning appointment for my femur and will start that next Wednesday. I am currently enjoying a few 'medical appointment\u2019 free days and being well looked after by close friends who extended their trip to the US (from the UK) to come and look after me. I'm off Xeloda which while it worked well for two scans and 6 months did let the bone progression in and also was for me a miserable drug, making my feet and hands so sore. It was beginning to look like I would have to move on - but I was not happy if it was still working. My MO will put me on Chemo once my liver is better and I've finished radiation (just got 5 days of treatment) In the meanwhileI'm on hormonal treatment which makes me feel a little safer than nothing at all!

Thank you for those who posted recipes and nutrition advice. I've gone from someone who had a boundless appetite to someone who can't finish a normal sized dinner. Trying hard not to loose weight. A quick update on my progress. I had my first dose last Thursday of Cisplatin and am due a second dose three week after that. My MO says this is the only one ok with high bilirubin levels. It is hard on the kidneys - luckily my kidneys are (and hopefully still are) in good shape. So had normal nausea controlled about 80% with steroids and two other drugs (Zofran and OLanzapine) It took 6 hours for the chemo as I has two hours of hydration before and after. I haven't yet had my blood checked for my bilirubin levels, but I feel I may be better - certainly am less yellow. It feels too early for the chemo to take effect, maybe the stent is working better. I've had real appetite issues and have lost 20+ lbs (which my size can take) I would be ordinarily delighted - but need the nutrition so hope I can keep at this weight and not loose more. I'm going to loose my hair which was something I hated last time - feel a little scared I will never get my hair back! But as I was probably going on Taxol I would have lost it anyway. So I'm feeling more hopeful, though still have in the back of my mind this is a last chance to get back onto other treatments. It is so scary, but it's got my DH and I a bit more focused on getting our wills/power of attorney uptodate and I am really thinking what I want to do should I get more time (and feel a little better) We have life assurance that will pay out early if my MO says I have less than 1 year. But when faced with ill health where just the ride into LA for radiation was all I could do in a day it's hard to think what I want - trying to plan a few treats. My younger son is just back from his freshman year in Boston, and my older son is back in a few weeks from his junior year in UW in Seattle. Happy for me both boys are staying home n California for the summer. Best wishes and healing hugs to all. Sarah ",

I've got my MO appointment tomorrow - so will see when my next scan will be (think it will be around end June/early July) and also discuss what my next treatment is. With Cisplatin, my MO says she usually only put patients on for 4 doses - its quite hard on your hearing - mine is a little affected.

So now its on to one chemo my MO has identified I can have with such high levels. I've been having my 5 radiation sessions, with the last on Wed. Then its on to chemo Thursday. Sorry, I haven't got the name of the chemo to report. I will look at after Thursday when I have my fist dose. TBH - Right now, its all been too upsetting and I am not feeling up to finding all about it or how well it works because I just don't want to face the thought it it not working, then I dont have anything in reserve. Willing this to work. I'm taking two doses, three weeks apart, then we are going to assess if it has helped my liver. Love to you all. Sarah x",

But I did take the Xeloda right up to the night before the op. After this my body decided to embrace a high level of bilirubin and I've been working to get this down so I can go on 'normal' chemo.

I now have mets so I leave behind those stats. I sometimes worry how long I have left. I have had just over 2 years with mets so I'm just past the average survival time. However, I do think any survival stats are not important. Wha will be, will be. I 'm having a little of a bad time recently, horrible chemo side effects, raising liver markers, terrible chest cough, changing chemos and significant dehydration caused by current. And not being able to keep my TG dinner down. I try to keep positive (hard recently) and think Statistics are overall population based on evidence - but not an individuals direct forecast. Really hope to be able to see improvements in all the numbers soon. we deserve to be freed from these hard treatments! with love Sarah PS: I am (well was) a data manager so numbers are always a great love of mine.",

Unfortunately, my liver is really mucking about my blood thinner levels which aren't coming down even without taking Wafarin. Feeling really rotten, I went in ER Thursday morning, as I was getting out of control not eating and drinking much (weirdest feeling for me who has never had a problem with my appetite) ,v dehydrated (prob from chemo, no drink), constipation and generally rotten malaise. I was admitted and monitored. All low levels of supplements were corrected. I had a Pet scan booked for the Thursday This had increasing size cancer spots and increase in size of liver.. All in all a sorry state. I had continuous saline for dehydration which made me feel much better. I had a stints put in in April, so the surgeon was consulted, he said a metal stint might be appropriate, we parked that for a few days to see if I would be well enough for the procedure. My husband had a v frank discussion with my MO, because I felt my presence might make them more emotional, this might seems strange it would certainly not be good for me to be interrupted, I trust them both. What she said was we need to get me on chemo for any chance to shrink these spots, which is difficult given my neutrophils are v low (are 0.22, should be =>1 for chemo. All in all I went in ER Thursday morning. I was getting out of control not eating and drinking much (weirdest feeling for me who never has a problem with my apitite) , v dehydrated (perhaps from chemo, not much drinking and eating), constipation and generally rotten malaise. I was admitted and monitored. All low levels of supplements were corrected. I had a Pet scan booked for the Thurs eve. This unfortunately showed increasing size cancer spots and size of liver. My neutrophils crashed. All in all a sorry state. My bilirubin, which I had so much trouble in March actually held fast, at 3.5, only up a point since a week ago. Not great but not disastrous. I and my Mo thought it would be in the teens as I was so unwell. Other liver markers were high. I had continuous saline for dehydration which made me feel much better. I had had stints put in in April, so the surgeon was consulted, he said a metal stint might be appropriate, we have parked that for a few days to see if I would be well enough for the procedure. My husband had a v frank discussion with my MO, alone because I felt my presence might make them more emotional and difficult to stay focused and frank, sounds strange but it was my idea and decision and I feel the right one. I trust them both. The decision is to try to get me on chemos, particularly as my Bilirubin is not skyrocketing, only problem is getting my neutrophils raised, I've had two shots and am hopeful Currently, it's 0.22, needs to be >= 1. Last time the shots were a little delayed but had a lasting effect. They talked prognosis which we feel is probably through to January - what I expected . So we are slowly getting my boys (22&20) up to date with currently the decision made they come home end of this week after essential finals. They can come home earlier if they want but my MO says I'm not in danger right now - though sadly I know how quick a liver met can change, so things may change. They have both prepared their colleges so they can leave at a moments notice. I'm fighting on, definitely NOT giving up, but treating life a bit more gently with myself and fitting in some treats (I went out to lunch today with all my siblings who have come over for the week from the UK - 2 brothers and a sister.) Getting great support physically and emotionally. It's always sad to give this sort of news to the group, when so many are so hopeful. I say keep up your hope, I still have some, I've been with Mets for two years so am following averages or with some luck will overtake these and come through this crisis. Love to you all And try to stay calm and focused on yourself and your needs. Sarah ",

It's so devastating to hear of all those we have lost since I have been gone and I have shed a few tears. This darn diseases is so relentless. Big hugs and love to all the families out there. I feared so much when I developed such high bilirubin levels (it got to 19 when I was admitted to hospital and down slightly to 16 after stent op) about 6 weeks ago. My Mo told me there was one option, Cisplatin - which can affect the kidneys but is ok with high bilirubin. I would try 2 sessions 3 weeks apart, but if that didn't work it was most likely the end of the line for treatments for me. After I took my first dose on May 3rd, I have been feeling much less fatigue, stools darkened, urine lightened, and no more yellow, even my eyes which took the longest to clear. Last Monday, I had my blood checked before my MO visit just before the next scheduled dose of Chemo. These showed my bilirubin had come down to 2.5! (normal being 1). This is fantastic level for me. My MO indicated I should have the my next dose of Cisplatin which I had last Wednesday and if my white blood counts hold up (currently in edge of low) she would add Gemzar and I'd have an extra two doses of Cisplatin and I assume I'll be on Taxol after that as that was the plan. I feel I have teetered in the edge of a cliff and not fallen. My heart breaks for those who are no longer with us. So I am still v tired, can't walk far (due to fatigue and getting my leg going again after the pin I had put in my thigh in April). I have cancelled my gym membership, which was impossible to make use of, and I am trying to swim in our new refurbished pool. I'm even thinking of getting an electric scooter so I can take the dogs out and get some fresh air. In a more serious note, we are signing wills/trust/health directives/power of attorney documents with the lawyer next Tuesday. I'm also going for second opinions at centers who may have suitable clinical trials should I need some more options. My scare has given us a bit of a kick to get these things sorted. I am also getting more fussy about how I spend my time and planning nice days and adventures (eg day at cooking school) Wishing for all good news (so nice to see that too whilst I've been off the board) and successful and comfortable treatments for everyone. Sarah PS: Any one been on Cisplatin and didn't loose their hair? I've been expecting it but nothing so far though Taxol will probably finish it off. MomAtt: I hope this answers your question to me a few weeks ago.",

Immediately this seems to do the trick and my bilirubin and also other liver markers came down quickly (16 down to 2.5 on first round).

I did have slight increase pain when I actually got a good scan on Ibrance, so I take comfort that pain is not a sign of the spots increaseing - but for them being zapped by the TX I'm having.

I did do one blood test alongside another from my primary care doc that required it to be a 'fasting test' and that raised all the liver markers. These fell when my next test was not fasting. However, my bilirubin continued to raise to 2.1. So this time I did my tests at the end of my week off from Xeloda and the liver markers were all down, including bilirubin. So I think X has been affecting my liver tests. I have mets only in my liver, and my last CT scan showed great shrinkage (50% and 30% on my biggest spots) also I definitely get more side pain when I'm on X than my week off. It's always there but ranges from mild to annoying. I am feeling the activity on the cancer cells in my liver is what's causing the indicators to show stress. Hopefully this helps.",

The ward doc said they may have to inflate the ducts to help get it in. They go in with a camera through your stomach. It's very much like what they put in for blocked arteries, in and around the heart. The GI doc did say it was a temp thing and if it works what to do for longer time, will find out more next week. My blockage was is in tubes inside the liver, I think often blockages are the at the junctions of the liver ànd bile ducts. (Not precise anatomy but that's how I understand it.) Will find out more next week from docs, and the blood test will show if it's being effective. I did a search and found many people have had this procedure and it's been very successful for them, so I am taking confidence from their experiences. This site is so good to help calm ones fears.

So I feel cramped and breathless. All in all a nightmare. Finally settled down, and I'm back on Cisplatin (which I am grateful for the 3 week break and not weekly chemo which I have struggled to tolerate) This chemo brought me back when my liver went crazy in April - and my Bilirubin was so high (Max 21!!) Its one that can be used the if the liver is poorly and indicators high, goes through the kidneys so you get lots of hydration whilst getting Cisplatin. I had stopped it because of the effect only hearing so hopefully - so I hope I can get some benefit from it. Feeling not too bad a week after the first dose. Looking forward to a good Christmas before my next dose on 31st. Dec. We brought out boys home early from college because I was so ill - and I do feel I have slipped a little more to more serious days. I am still unable to walk far (got a wheelchair from my insurance and a disabled parking badge - this feels odd but I definitely need this to be able to get out) I have had lots of family fly in from the UK to help, so my Christmas shopping has continued if that is all I an do in a day! I wish all of you well and hope you are having great success indoor treatments. I wish I could send you personal best wishes as each day goes by, but my concentration and big fatigue has made it hard to keep up and both read or post here. I just wanted to let you all know I am chugging along - tolerating my current treatment (Cisplatin) well so far, and though I don't look much further than the next week or two have hope for some good times along the way. With love Sarah",

My MO will monitor them and any movement up can indicate trouble brewing, Then new tx may bring them down. Btw my tumour markers were nit usually useful, though I know others find them a good early warning method. My MO continues to monitor everything just in case it's useful. I have now developed Ascites in my stomach and feel like I\u2019m 5-6 months pregnant, I went to ER on MI\u2019s instruction, and there\u2019s fluid there but in lots of pockets not one or two large ones. So ER doc and I agreed whilst she could drain them it wasn\u2019t appropriate to puncture me so many times in ER. She found no blockages in my liver or bile ducts - which was what I was very scared of. Also my bloods came back all good (well liver markers were highish but stabile for me) ER doc sent a message to my MO (same hosp/actually I\u2019m Kauser Permanente so all care is connected) Back home waiting for MO (who has been unusually slow to respond) I\u2019m a bit laid out and unabke to do much. Very frustrating. A silver lining is I feel much better than I have for a long time except for my stomach and being breathless and immobile. Am I meant to rest or should I try to do things Dr Google says rest and also she recommended a low sodium diet - would this be worth doing? Any other advice out there? Thanks Sarah ",

      "Content": "May 19, 2016 06:37PM - edited May 19, 2016 06:46PM by Scwilly I am so sorry you have joined us here, BC is such a indiscrimate disease and does not look at our calendars or take notice that you are so young. You have joined a very supported group of women and men who can advise you for all sorts of questions you might have, or even just be there to support you through this. I was DX at the beginning of November 2013, and had my first chemo 14 days afterwards. I was concerned and wanted chemo asap preferably the next day as my dx was stage 3 IBC, but the doctors assured me this was fine and they kept me busy with scans, heart tests etc. I have 4 doses of AC (Adriamycin/doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide) every 2 weeks. For me the symptoms did increase each dose - and the 3rd and 4th courses made me much more tired. I strongly recommend taking side effect drugs. I had Emend (which you take the morning before chemo and then for two days) and Zofran (Ondansetron) for around 5 days as required, both for nausea. I didn't feel nauseous and was never sick. The only time I had slight nausea was when I stopped Zofran early, I didnt do that again. I also had Nuprogen shots, one a day for 5 days after each chemo. These were to boost my white blood counts. Sleep and getting some fresh air are also essential to get you through this. Also - get all the help you are offered as this is the time to be the center of attention (as much as you would like that is) I had my first chemo on November 18th, and my hair started to come out on November 29th. I remember the date as I was in the carpark of my sons school waving him off on the school bus to travel to Clovis to run in the California State XC meet. I just pulled through my hair and some came out. We joined him later that day, and whilst I was worried it would all fallout quickly, I didnt get much more unless I pulled. So it was 11 days from my first chemo. I didnt find my hair came out quickly, and I didnt need to wear a wig/head-covering for at least a week. I know others say it takes until after their second chemo. Its hard to say how you will feel, as everyone reacts differently. Your attitude will help you through your day, and I would say the first week of treatment is the worse and you will feel so much better the second week ( I even went skiing for 4 days just before my last dose) Timing your treatment to be at least a week before your wedding will give you the best chance of feeling well on the day. Congratulations on your upcoming Nuptials! Sarah ",

I know my Dh does this, I think, to reassure himself He's not one to talk about how he feels about my illness. Some days I just want time off and not to be ill and not have people comment on how I am. I am very bored with all of this! ",

I remember the horrible fear and being overwhelmed with what had just happened when I was first diagnosed. I haven't ever cried as much before or since. It does get better. Once there is more information, once her treatment plan has been defined you will definitely all feel much better and begin to see how your can get through this time. I am 2.5 years out and feeling so much better, through all my treatment and back to almost normal. This is such a wonderful resource and you will find lots of advice and people who support you. There is a topic for husbands whose spouse has been diagnosed where you will find others who are or have been in your position. Check out the All topics tab. You will also find a great wealth of information all over the site, and should not feel you are 'barging in' - you are welcome everywhere. Let us know how you and your wife are getting on. best wishes Sarah",

I had dx of an agressive atage 3 cancer and was desparate to get on with treatment, and was worried about the wait for chemo. My surgeon reassured me that it was ok and that they would be keeping me busy with tests/scans to see exactly what was happening. Also, many of us look to anti-anxiety meds to help get through this time, or try to keep distracted - walks, movies, meals out. Avoid being drawn too much to Dr Google! There is a lot of bad information out there. This site has lots of good knowledge. Two consults should also help your wife choose doctors with confidence. Sarah",
