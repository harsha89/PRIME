I think some people don't understand my humor but it's just how I am. YES on the nesting!!! I'm so tired and need to go to bed but want to connect with all of you more as our surgeries loom closer. Rest up ladies, we've got some long journeys ahead......",

I'm laying in bed typing on a kindle which drives me crazy so I'm keeping this brief, will write more tomorrow when I can use my laptop. I had immediate recon with TE's as well. I found the pain to be brutal at first and gladly took oxycodone as prescribed. But now I'm off them completely (take colace while on them!!!) I was up and around quickly but overdid it and developed swelling, more so on the left (also had 2 nodes removed....both neg..yay!) Now I have also developed \"cording\" in my left armpit....very limiting to my range of motion and painful. Meeting w/ my BS tomorrow, will share what she says re: cording and how to prevent/treat. My PS actually does say things are looking good as far as healing goes. 3 of my 4 drains are out already, 4th to be removed Thursday. My best advice is to REST AND DO NOTHING for as long as possible in the days/weeks following surgery. And don't 2nd guess your choice. Go with your gut as I did. There's no right answer, but I know i wanted to go through this once only. Hang in there and stay strong! Ask me anything you want too.....",

Some thought I was crazy not to want to cut the cancer out asap but I wanted to enjoy some of my summer and for my kids to enjoy it with me! So glad to read posts that reflect similar feelings to mine......",
