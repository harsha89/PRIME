I was PUMPED on the steroids. Still am today. My face is RED as an apple. I am dealing with nausea, but I am holding my own. The reports were re-read about the spot we THOUGHT was hangin on to the chest wall. Happy to report after more and more evaluation, IT IS NOT CANCER!! Scans show that there is NO ACTIVE DISEASE SHOWING ANYWHERE IN THE BODY!! PRAISE THE LORD! We call it DANCING WITH NED...NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. Now where do we go from here, we go back in three weeks do more scans. The hope is to get some back to back scans showing NED is still there. I call it WATCHING like a HAWK. I do not have any more chemo scheduled at this time. Craig will go with me the next trip. That is where WE sit and make the next decision. Do we continue on what we call as Maintenance chemo which is LOW DOSE THERAPY TO HELP KEEP THE BEAST AWAY, or do we go on Chemo Break, and BE ON GUARD. We struggle with this, because there is a thing called getting TOO much chemo when it is not needed. We know it can become way to toxic, but we also know the nature of my Triple Negative Breast Cancer. We know how fast and aggressive IT CAN FIRE RIGHT BACK OFF AND MOVE! We are waiting on the PARP Inhibitors to be released by the FDA. They are in stage III trials and showing great success with TNBC. They just may be our TARGETED THEREPY that we lack right now. We HAVE NOTHING but radiation and chemo. The other 85% have hormone blockers. They are not for us. Thank u for the prayers. We are now traveling into unstudied territory, OH MAN HOW DO WE MAKE THE DECISIONS????????

My surgeon did a needle biopsy ..I don't know what procedure your surgeon will use but either way it will give you piece of mind ....as not knowing is the worse part of it! When you know you can make a plan and it sort of gives you a bit of control over the situation Keep in mind even if your result is not what you want they have made such advancement with treatments and surguries now that you WILL have a bright furture ahead of you with your kids! You will find this forum a great place for information and has helped me so much up to this point, but one thing I learned (because i did it myself) is don't skip ahead into discussions that don't pertain to your situation yet. Just do one step at a time as you can become  overwhelmed very quickly. Good luck with your consult with the surgeon and staying positive will be a big help! It could be just a lump and nothing else !! Let me know how you are doing ",

      "Content": "angelsabove wrote: Let me see...Where do I start? I will start with the most important things to me. MY KIDS and  my family. I am 37 years old. I have three kids and a pretty darn good hubby. We are high school sweethearts and started our family early on. I have a 19 year old son. He is going into second year of college. I have a 17 year old daughter. She will be a junior in High School. Our baby is a boy and he is 9. My journey began in April 2009. I found a lump. I was waitig for 40 to get my first Mammo. That is what insurance recommended if you were NOT considered high risk. I am the first in my family to be dx with breast cancer. Well for that matter any kind of cancer. I was 36 years old at Dx. I chose double mastectomy. That was done May 2009. I was dx with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (IDC) stage IIB. I took a three week break to heal from surgery and began Chemotherapy. I did 12 weekly Taxol. Four Tri Weekly FAC. I took another three week break and began 32 radiation treatments. Before we started Rads.....I did a pet scan December 2009...IT WAS NED..... I completed my last radiation treatment 2-05-2010.......I was trying to get my life back and BOOM I began havin shoulder pain in April 2010. I called my Oncologist and the nurse well lets just say WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING. I did manage to get scans in May 2010 and YES we saw some things that looked suspicious. There was a 4.5 by 1.5 cm chest wall mass. The mediastinal node lit up and also a left mammary node. We scheduled the biopsy for the chest wall mass. Well....yes it was positive for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. I was shocked. I knew I had a high chance of reccurence. Just was hoping I would get some time to enjoy NED.... I then decided to change my Oncologist. Call it FEAR. I checked with Cancer Treatment Centers of America and that is now where I go. I do have to travel from Arkansas to Chicago for treatments. When we arrived for our first visit in Chicago, they did there own set of scans. We then found a 1.4 cm mass on liver. We did not biopsy that. We just started chemo. After my first new chemo, I could not breath. We found I had a Pleura Effusion. Well we did a Thorac procedure and drained 1700 cc of fluid off. The breathing was better. My doctor decided to do surgery and I now have a Pleurix tube in my side. During that surgery he drained another 1700 cc of fluid off. I must say I am NOW breathing. My hubby was draining it daily, but we hardly drain it much anymore. The fluid seems to be next to nothing. They did tell me I may be able to get this thing out if the fluid is under control. I think it is. I have not yet found out if the fluid was malignant. I did have a ct of chest without contrast about 2 weeks ago. The report read that my lung has completed re expanded to normal and the fluid is gone. THANK GOD. I have taken 3 of my new treatments. I go for number 4 next week. We will do all the scans on Wednesday to see where we are. I know after my first treatment we did tumor markers. They told me they dropped substantially. Last visit they said tumor markers continue to drop. I am so nervous about Wednesday. I will see Dr. with results on Thursday and I will also do chemo on Thursday. There are days I think I am able to deal with this. Then there are those days I honestly dont think I can. I have the FEARS.... I dont think it is for me, but for my family. ESPECIALLY my children. I look at my nine year old and sometimes just loose it. I cant imagine a child having to loose their mother. I want to know that this stuff is beatable!!!!!!!!  There are days I spend HOURS on the internet searching through all these post on all the forums on the internet just looking for that survivor who has amazingly beat the odds....We do not talk about my prognosis. My Oncologist just says. YOU ARE YOUNG and other than this you are AMAZINGLY HEALTHY and we are gonna FIGHT...FIGHT.....FIGHT.....and I am gonna be here in your corner. Chemo has been pretty rough...I am doing Taxotere/Carboplatin/Avastin every 21 days. I am also worried about this Avastin business that is going on. What if it is working for me and they pull it. Being Triple Negative we do not have any other targeted therapies. We just have our chemo. I yearn for the life I had before the awful disease. I guess I just needed to know or maybe just hear that there IS life after this........ I was actually going to do reconstruction before it came back....MMMMM guess that will not happen now. Here I am bald and boobless and me oh me......I at times am so, so, so, tired. Somedays are worse than others. Somedays while sick I think I CANT do this. Then I dust myself off and on I go.....TELLING MYSELF YOU MUST DO THIS......YOU STILL HAVE CHILDREN TO RAISE........

While if you hadn't had the test they wouldn't be as prepared. Hopefully you will get calming news from your surgeons office and you can spend the rest of the day preparing your self. Good Luck! Today I got my 2 drains out..yippee! I's amazing how these little accomplishments can make you feel so good. I'ts been  6 days since my mastectomy and axillary node dissection surgery. The whole time I had the drains in the most I ever had was 25cc of fluid and when she took them out I was only at 5 & 10. I am still feeling numb in places so I think this helped in making it an effortless process. The nurse even said the first drain she pulled out was the longest one she had ever seen. The second one was a little shorter. She had me take a deep breath and the only thing i felt was the slightest pull and it was out. Quite interesting to see the whole thing once it's out, the part inside is kinda like a soaker hose , flat with holes on either side while the tube outside the body is round and tiny. Hope thats not to much info for anybody !  So another step done, my next is waiting for path reports and getting my steri strips off on Sat.....oh boy will that shower feel good ! Good luck to everyone in recovery and those about to go into surgery my thought are with you !",

Our 2 boys 19 & 21 came home from out of town to see me this week which i wasn't expecting....boy when they want to they sure can surprise you, makes you think you did something right in raising them !  Just waiting for the call tomorrow to know what time we have to be there. The surgery is in a town an hour away so it might be an early morning...like I would be sleeping anyways ! Have the recliner waiting for me in the livingroom and know my hubby will be at my beckon call....I guess it won't be all bad ! Good luck to everyone with surgery tomorrow ",

Took me awhile to get comfortable when it was time for bed, I think my neck and back were sore from the hospital, not used to being in a bed all day. bounced back and forth from the bed to the recliner till I found a spot that worked. Emptied my drains last night.. a little nervous about that but the nurses showed me the way to get the air out of the bulb at the bottom by bending it in half before closing it so it all worked out. Doctor said my cancer was invasive but until the pathology reports come back won't know what kind so it will be a long week i'm sure. the waiting sucks! With just having the needle biopsy first, unlike alot of you I don't have much info on what I have all I know is it's the big C. When they went in for the mastectomy they did a frozen biopsy first before taking the breast.. for a double check and that was positive also. So at least I know I made the right choice !  The home care nurse is coming soon, so I should try and get rid of my bed head and put a brush through it, though I'm sure she has seen worse. Take care to all of you on the mend and good luck to those with surguries ahead.  ",

The travel is rough but I love it there. My new chemo regimen is Carboplatin/Avastin/Taxotere. I have had two treatments so far. I do these every 21 days. With that being said....right after my first treatment, I COULD NOT BREATHE. I thought it was due to the chemo. Well on the checkup before my second treatment we told the doctor that I was having HORRIBLE shortness of breath. We found Pleural Effusion. They got me upstairs in a room and drained the fluid. They got two large jar fulls. Unsure of the CC's. I felt so much better. This was on a Friday. He had to stop due to the pain. He knew there was more, so we scheduled a surgery for Monday to put in a cathedar. During the surgery he drained about the same amount out as before. I now have a cathedar on my left side and my hubby drains it. Monday will be two weeks post op and I am BREATHING. My hubby was draining it daily, but now we are able to go about every three days. I do not know if mine was malignant. I go for chemo next week and I am sure they will tell me then. Of course I am praying it is NOT. My mets are in my medistinal node, Left mammary node, and 1.4 cm on liver. I pray you get to feeling better. I know once they drain the fluid you will feel so much better.

I had no nausea or bad taste in my mouth, it just felt I had awoken from a really good sleep. I had only slight pain in my arm from the axillary dissection so they gave me a percocet and i was good again. Was taken up to my room and got settled in and even had some dinner that night with no problems. I did not go home that day as I had a mastectomy , they like you to stay overnight after that here , hey that worked for me ! I got a tv and just watched all my favourite shows.

I get 16 reg and 5 boosts. I get only 16 as apposed to the 30's that others get because i am not doing reconstruction .... so the radiation can be a bit more concentrated. When doing reconstruction the radiation is spread out more so not to compromise the skin so much so procedures later are easier. Thats my understanding any ways. I also get the bolus every day for 2 of my fields, it's like a thick rubber mat they lay on my chest. So far things are going fine, a little puffy under the arm similar to when i had the mastectomy, but can live with it. Got to get ready to go....hope everyone has a good zap today !",

My only concern is moving while the rad machine is going and having them zap something that shouldn't be zapped Yesterdays went alot faster as they didn't have to do any films or anything. was in an out in 15 min. I got a list of creams to use and was told the best one to use was the glaxol cream, it's water based and has no lanolin. While all the other creams were also good on the list the techs preferred this one. They also said no deoderant on the radiated side. Mind you ever since chemo i haven't really needed it on either side, one bonus i guess. Today is a double shift,  My reg radiation is at 9:00 then i  have to go back at 3:00 for my boost, so won't plan much for today. I'm pretty settled into my hotel room , it's adequate for what i need. Looking forward to the family coming to visit this weekend. Hope everone has a good day. ",

Don't have any skin problems yet, just a little puffy on the chest underarm area where they took the nodes, it feels like it did after the mastectomy. They said that was normal, so other than the tiredness i have felt since this all began back in Feb. I'm doing ok.  I have 3 younger lady techs who are really nice which makes it easier to come every day, they are very efficient...i'm in and out walking out the door in 15 min.  Rock sorry things are delayed for you, that sucks...it's just nice to get the party started sooner than later !  Re: ?...I started my rads pretty much 3 weeks after my last dose of chemo, just enough time to somewhat recover !

But for me this doesn't have the fear factor that chemo had.

My doctor also phones after every blood test at home so I count my blessings to have such caring people who are looking after me!  I have to go see my onc on Monday next week after a test to see if I will be able to do chemo that week, he's not that hopefull. I guess i shouldn't have written all my dates on the calendar with pen. I so don't want to prolong this longer than i have too!!  Otter so glad this is an easier round for you, maybe your body knows this is it and it's giving you a break!

Moved to Nelson when I was 4, Age 15 got a job in a local drugstore as reciever, kept working after graduating high school. Didn't know what i wanted to be when i grew up (still don't!) so didn't ever make it to college. Did make enough money to buy my childhood dream of owning a horse, moved out at 17, not because i didn't like it at home, but was independent and needed to try it. Started seeing my husband in the Nov. of '83 age 19 and we got married the following Sept., (no point in waisting time when you know it's right!)  So I guess after 3 kids 21,19 & 12 and 24 years of marriage (I\"m 44) my career could be summed up as domestic engineer.  Sometimes i wonder where i would be if i had gone to school and where that would of taken me, then i think  if i had done that the husband and the 3 kids in that picture next to me wouldn't be there and I know then i have made the right decision with my life and it has been all worth it!   This year i did go back into the work force and was helping out at our family business and thoroughly enjoying it until......well you all know the story from here. I do admire all you women who did take the career path as it too takes alot of courage to juggle relationships, homelife and work all together.

Soon she will need me less and less as the boys did and find her own way, hopefully making the right choices.   We have officially moved in from the cabin this weekend...love being out there but it is so nice to be home. We have some crazy wind storms coming through here lately.. the day after we moved in one blew through and brought down about 5 trees on the cabin property, just glad I wasn't there!  I don't mind thunderstorms just hate the wind where trees are involved. Kerry I wish I could detect the changes you are feeling , some days I think it's going the opposite way and I just can't think straight. I'm fearful that I am following my parents down the road of alzhiemers, so am hoping its related to the chemo .  I might try your brisk walking idea to get the oxygen flowing through! Eddie I hope the package you sent is just lost in postal limbo and will resurface and find it's way to the destination . I go for a follow up mamo on Thurs, will be happy to be done with that !

Some nut and bolts, sugar and shortbread cookies and butter tarts, not much else.  Finding it real hard to get motivated this year, I think last year is finally catching up with me and my mind is wandering, last year was such a whirlwind didn't have time to think! We always put the tree up the weekend before the big day and don't take it down till New years. So this weekend we will go and find the tree. Sadly my two boys can't make it home for christmas they both have to work on boxing day. We are hoping they can make it for New Years. It will be a quiet xmas without them , it will be the first one they both can't make.Our 14 yr old daughter will be missing them also, even though she wouldn't admit it. I heading up to visit my mom up at the care facility....always an adventure and I'm getting quite crafty in leaving without her following me ! Hope everyone has a great weekend and Happy Hannaka to those who celebrate.",

Most of our summer will be spent at the cabin so don't have to get to fancy, more for protection from the sun than anything. Has anyone come across something light and cool for the summer ?  I've been kinda lounging around the last couple days, the one time when i don't feel guilty about doing it! Feeling really quite good, so need to get up and get motivated hoping to get outside and enjoy the warm weather ahead. Here's one last note on Mothers, my 12 yr old daughter gave me this on Mothers day and  thought I might share..  When your a child she walks before you, To set an example. When your a teenager she walks behind you to be there if you need her. When you're an adult she walks beside you So that as two friends you can enjoy life together...  ",

Have been having a few heart flutters so he had me get an ECG just to rule out any problems. It's probablly just going into shock cause there's no chemicals or radiation flowing through my body !  He said he doesn't do follow up scans unless there is a symptom to look into....i'm ok with that there is no point in looking for things that aren't there...makes it easier to move on.  He said i have to be diligent with the followup doc visits and mamo's and just be aware of odd symptoms that last longer than they should.  So he's sending an ok to the surgeon for my port to be taken out..yipee !  Only problem is it's just a local anistetic, he makes the incision and he pulls it out and sews me back up .... yikes!    .......Suck it up princess ...right ! Every year we get together with our neighbours to celebrate all our birthdays which are all close together...it turns out its at our house this year on Sat. so have to pull out the cook books for something fun to make.  I just have to handle the main meal and the rest bring appys , dessert and salad.  It's just nice to be able to have enough energy to do this fun stuff again !  One of the gals makes the wickedest peach belinis...yummmmm!  Thanks to those who invited me into your facebook world and i will try and find the rest of you out there. I'm just finding it hard to find the time to do anything with it. Wow ... i kinda rambled on sorry about that...Happy  Thursday everyone.",

Thanks all for your well wishes, Gracie, Linda was right.....nothing to it.   The needle for the local no different than getting poked in the port for chemo. They did take me into a surgery room after the local had taken effect, draped me up , washed the area and in he went with the scapel in hand. I really thought I would feel the initial cut but nothing just some tugging when he was pulling it out. He said mine was a little more stuck than others he's done so just took a few minutes longer.  He did say I would have to postpone my mamo for another month until this heals properlly.   The only down side is i can't get the steri strips wet for 8 days...so much for showers...i'm really not a bath person.  Maybe I'll get some fancy bubble bath and take advantage.     Just have a very dull ache as the local wears off. Have to head out to moms as she is having her first home care visit tonight and want to be there for that...then looking forward to plopping down in front of the tv. Have a good evening ladies.   ",

Loved our time in Disney and the lineup gods were looking out for us as the lines weren't too bad. Sunday was the worst day and was crazy full with people, but stuck it out for the fireworks and a laser light show fantasmic, really cool.  Did a couple side trips, one down to San Diego for sea world..nice change of pace and to  Knotts Berry Farm. The kids were trying to talk us into Six Flags but hubby and I are not that adventerous with the monster coasters so settled on knotts .  Really enjoyed the hockey game...never been to a real live NHL game, fun to see what happens during the comercials. It was a good game but our team lost in overtime. I had taken a book to read ....what was i thinking. Always seemed to be on the go, but it was a fun kinda busy!  But am glad to be back...will try and get some pics up on facebook. I have a lot of reading here to do to try and catch up....so for now will just say missed all you wonderful ladies and looking forward to getting back into the loop !",

I don't know if it is just our area but when i do in for the mamo at the hospital the girls who does the procedure takes the films to the tech who actually reads them while i'm getting dressed and then if they don't see any thing then i get to go home. If there is something of concern that might need another film then i get more done. So if you get that nod to go home you know things are ok. When i got my mammo last year after feeling the lump i went right from mammo to ultrasound without an appt. Maybe it's the perks of being in a smaller center. I go  on Thursday for my first mammo since it all began. I hope you don't have to wait too long for the results! Noelle sending hugs your way too, you have to deal with way too much...wish i could be there to help you in some way. Otter have a great time on the boat and with family,  And i hope everyone who has chooks they are blessed with eggs in the future. A big hug to everyone else!",

Rest , rest, rest and let yourself heal.  I'm sorry your onc didn't listen to your request to take the port out sooner. When i had my port after the chemo, i had it flushed once a month but didn't have the coumadin you speak of Adrienne, had never even heard of it. Clots were never mentioned when it was put in...which i guess is a good thing as it would of been one more thing to worry about. My port was out  6 months after finishing chemo. Randie I admire your strength and wish we could take some of this suckiness away for you ! We will be there with you today and hope you can breathe easier when you leave. Sue sending good vibes your way for your operation and a speedy recovery! It's a beautiful sunny day today......sending the warmth from the sun to those who need a warm hug ! Cheers ",

My stomach is getting a little bruised, probablly because of the low platelets. Will go for another blood work tomorrow to see where i am at. My mouth is taking alot longer to come back to normal this time, maybe being #3 of FEC tx it has built up and takes that much longer to get back where it should be. I shouldn't complain this is pretty  minor compared to how i could be suffering!  Am trying to get myself psyched up for my first taxotere tx on next thursday, July 10 ....our second sons 19th birthday. Am more nervous about this one than i was before chemo started, don't know why..just worried. Will have 3 tx of that then on to radiation. I will have to catch up on the previous post to see where everyone is at in their journey...anyone going in for tx this week good luck !   ",

He has me doing the Neupogen this time starting on day 5 for 9 straight days, I should be a pro at handling a needle by the end of this! And i will have my counts done 2 x per week. oh ya and the lump, he said not at all related to a lymph node... hooray! I was so happy with that news (also chemo brain) i forgot to ask him what it might be. Oh well he wasn't concerned so I will put it at the back of my list for next time.  I also got some info on the Taxotare i will be switching to after this next treatment, se's sound doable. The chemo nurse even said they give you some ice gloves to wear during so you hopefully don't get the numbness in the fingers associated with it.  Good luck to those with tx tomorrow and I will meet the Thursday girls...where are we going this time...how about a poolside bar in Jamaica!

She is on an all kids team, as her friend the team captain (age 12) is a leukimea survivor, she had quite a ride for a few years earlier and now is living life to the fullest. So I will go down and support them tommorrow, looking forward to it as it is supposed to be in the 80's and the park is right on the lake, should be a wonderful day!  Good luck today Mominaz (Christy) hope things go well for you !

Had no problems with first taxotere, i tried the ice gloves so we will see if that helps with numbness in the hands, time will tell. It did make it interesting when i was trying to turn the pages of my book as it was like wearing really heavy oven mitts. Got there around 8:30 didn't get the drug until 12:30. My counts were low in the blood test the day before so they were contemplating delaying , so they did another blood test and it was up just enough to carry on , YEY!. But then had to wait for check over from onc and then it took forvever for the pharmacy to get the drug up to us....oh well had good company in the room.  There was a newbie in the chair next to me getting her chemo training, real sweat lady in her 70's and you could tell she was overwhelmed with the info. Just brought back how i felt when i was going through that not to long ago.  Feeling good today , the nurse said if i was to get the muscle aches it would probably crop up around day three, so will stock up on tylenol. I am heading out to the cabin for the weekend as the weather is supposed to be so nice so will put my feet up and relax. Hope everyone has a good weekend,  Eddie sorry to hear about you having to deal with the shingles , as if there isn't enough to deal with !! Take care all !  ",

It was like having several toothaches and earaches at once , but didn't last too long. My main complaint was having a sore throat starting day 4 which lasted about 4 days. Also my mouth having the feeling like i had just come home from the dentist and it was coming out of freezing and the on the edges of the tongue it felt like those candy sores you can get. It did start to clear up around day 9 and did not produce any mouth sores so I'm lucky i guess.   Did not have any problems with the feet or hands other than the nail beds were sore for a couple days, but that cleared up also. (they had the ice gloves on me so whether that made a difference or not who knows) So now getting geared up for Thursday, will start with the Decadron tomorrow and try to get house in order and put one more tx behind me. Then only one more to go, yippee! Then off to rads, which i think will be a piece of cake compared to this!

I just have this feeling of it being frozen and numb and the tongue feeling off. My taste went with it, and i have a slight sore throat, so i just stick to soft foods and soups for the first litlle while. Every time i eat something i brush and rinse with the baking soda and salt, and haven't had any mouth sores.   It seems to turn around for me at day 11 or 12 ....i wake up and things are back to normal. The last two times i only had about 1 day of aches and pains and i'm not sure if that was from the nuepogen or the Taxotere, other than that it has been very doable so you will make out just fine !!! Having said that, I did feel kinda slammed by a brick wall yesterday, it was like it was saying i'm not gonna let you off that easy , heres one for the road !! But feeling better today. My 19 yr old ds came home from Calgary last night ( 8 hrs away), which probably didn't help cause i was busy all day and fussing over things for his arrival . He's only home for 4 days then my dh and dd are taking him back to get him settled into rez.   Once again i got told i couldn't go,( thats the part i'm really getiing tired about )  i was so looking forward to seeing his dorm room and where he will be staying and being able to help him set up. Ok i realize he is probablly ok with mom not being there making his bed and hanging up his clothes, but it's just one of those things i wanted to be part of.  My onc feels this being the last one and right at my low period , why blow it now...so i will be a good little patient and do as he says Sue I'm so happy that you get to bring your 4 legged babies home, they will be a good distraction, nothing like a good slobbery lick on the face !  Roxi and anyone else with aches and pains hope they have subsided. Lewing great pic, i saw it before you took it off, congrats on finishing!! Sable, hope the first day of grade one goes great for your son, what an exciting time to send them off into the big world, but remember they are never far from home and with a mom like you how could he go wrong!

Wore my ice gloves for the hands again and sucked on ice chips this time so will be interested to see if that will help my mouth as i didn't do it last time. It was a fun morning in the room everyone was in good spirits made it more bearable!   Haven't had a problem with the decradon until last night .....brain wouldn't shut off and eyes wouldn't close was still looking at the clock at 3:30 am, I think a Friday afternoon siesta will be in order !  SE last time didn't kick in until about day 4 so have a few more good days to go. Our 12 year old daughter has been away this week at the Junior Olympics in Detroit, she is a competitive jump roper and made it through the provincial and national competitions in Canada to get there. (how can you tell i'm a proud Mama!)  She will be home on Sunday , can't wait. Its been hard not being able to go with her to her competitions this year ...I hadn't missed any up to now.  Soon she won't want me there anymore, so i think that has been the most dissapointing through all this is the missing out on some of her life.  But putting it into prospective...I'm doing this so I won't be missing out on her LIFE!  And my two older boys.  Hope everyone does well today with their aches and pains and you can enojoy the weekend, have a good one..cheers",

Way to go Randie on this being your last one , it really is a nice view from this side. Jean my heart goes out to you and sending hugs as you go through this hard time. Linda great poem, I can relate to every line in it ! So glad it is all over. Was feeling really good with the next step, with chemo behind me , really at peace with it all....then i see my onc for the last time before i go and he lays some info on me about a trial that he wants me to look into. He sends me home with a whole handfull of info and now my head is swimming. The head of it is in Kelowna where i'm going for my rads on Sunday , so he thought if i was interested i could have a consult while i was there. It a Phase 3 trial of Bisphosphonates . It is hoping to show if two drugs ....Zoledronic Acid & Ibandronate are any better than Clodronate in helping to prevent or delay the spread of cancer to the bones. It is a random trial , so you don't know which drug you would be getting and you would be taking it for 3 years and being followed for 10yrs. And you wouldn't really know if it would be any benifit at all to you until they have stats 14ys later. As with all drugs they all have side effects , and one nasty one ....which they say is not common but present...osteonecrosis of the jaw (permanent damage to the jawbone...ouch! ) So right now I am leaning towards saying no, as I was comfortable with the action I had already taken and feeling good about leaving it all behind after rads. I just don't want to have to deal the extra side effects be it as small as they might be. With my luck i would be the one to get the jaw problems and just don't like the loss of control in not knowing what drug i would be getting. I just wish he hadn't layed it on me now as the brain goes in overdrive as you consider all the options. Has anyone been in this trial or taken any of these drugs ? Any info would help. I believe the Zoledronic acid is also known as Zometa. I do want to make an informed decision. Sorry so long, hope everyone is doing well and plugging through , good luck to those with chemo or rads ahead. !",

Yesterday seemed a bit easier my muscles didn't tense up so much when the machine turned on, whether that was from being to tired or just getting used to  it i don't know.  The days I can keep busy enough, went for a long bike ride along the waterfront park, and gone for some walks. I am really gonna have to turn into a shopper as there is a lot of nice shopping places here...could never really get into it. Always figured the money could be used better elsewhere.....but i'm figuring i will splurge on myself before i leave, i think i deserve it. The nights get a little long, rented a movie last night Baby Momma...that was cute. My rad ladies have been really nice and that makes it easier to go in every day. I am looking forward to a visit from my hubby and daughter tomorrow, they will stay for the  weekend , hopefully the weather holds out. I hope everyone can get thru ailments that are bringing them down chemo related or not  and those getting zapped enjoy your weekend off. ! Roxi i'm glad your daughters lump turned out to be something else, i guess from now on we all will be on guard for things like that. Ladies my thoughts are with you all, there are too many of us to go thru list, just know i think about you often.",

Recovery was quick, only had to have the one percocet in the recovery room and was only needing xstr. tylenol after that. The drains were not painful just annoying at times. In our area we have health nurses that come to your home and change dressings and just give support thru your healing in case of questions, and help with the drains. I don't know if that is available to you or not.  Make sure to start your exercises as soon as you are able.  2 weeks after i started going to physio to help gaining the mobility back. When you get home you might find it easier sleeping in a recliner or something similiar, i know i took up residence in the living room for 2 weeks, wasn't that bad. Take advantage of being waited on and milk it as long as you can !!! Cris congrats on being done chemo ! My rad appts. are winding down, I just had #14 today and only 2 more reg zaps to go. I was supposed to have a boost yesterday but there was a glich. I was on the table in position waiting and they couldn't find an important template they needed, so got cancelled . Had to go in today to get an extra one made today so should have the boost tomorrow then 1 on tues & Wed then i am finito !! Have been tolerating it pretty good physically just more tired and just starting to get a little pink. It's just every time i go in i think i should be able to relax seeing as i have so many under my belt now but just laying there your body goes into protection mode and tenses up and makes it that much harder to lie still !! So if all goes well i will drive home on Thursday, can't wait! It hasn't been bad hubby has come up on the weekends and the weather has been great so we have been able to go out and check the town out. Went on a winery tour last weekend that was fun. Hugs to those still doing chemo or hormonal stuff, and those who are heading into, or are already in the land of radiation and anyone with surgery ahead !",

Great Pics !! My last Taxotere kinda sucked the wind out of me, good thing it my last as i don't know if i could of done another ! Not painfull just no energy and usual side effects just seemed to hang on forever. Just got back from my rad simulation and tattoos. Piece of cake , after driving for 4 hours the appt. amounted to about 1hr . We made it an overnight, and had a nice dinner out and even indulged in a few cocktails   I got to check out the place i will be staying, it should be fine it has a small kitchenette , separate bedroom and a pull out couch for when family visits. Close to the hospital and right across from a small mall with everything i should need. So my next little adventure begins next Sunday when i will drive there and rads start on the Mon the 15th. I hope to be home for Thanksgiving (Canadian) mid October.  So this next week will be busy with getting me and the family organized. Hope everyone is doing well and you all have a restful weekend !",

It's 10 more sleeps till we leave for Disneyland..can't wait. I am so looking forward to this as last year trips where non existant.

We had one really bad year about 6 years ago, to the point where you had things you wanted like pics and such organized in a way you could get them in a hurry.  It has a feeling like that again, we haven't had a fire on our mountain for a long time and there are so many trees with the pine beetle infestation that are a true fire hazard.   So we are hoping for a rainy june and July. Otter love the frog story, just not crazy about the toxic spiders who live with you ! The wildlife around here is getting active, we have a resident grizzly not too far from town who is getting a little annoyed with the bikers who travel through on the old train bed, so thats been closed for awhile . Also yesterday a cougar was sighted in town, haven't tracked him down yet, so hopefully he was just passing through. Was out at the cabin yesterday taking the first load of dust and dead bugs out...dd has us moving out there the day after school ends, we'll see how far I get. Roxi, I hope your infection clears up, & Cristine your kids get healthy in a hurry so you can go on your trip. Kerry stay warm under the electric blanket, anyone going on trips travel safely, and those at home just livin life have a good day !",

I think i start July 10 collector glad to hear you have a plan in place,my onc was the same in saying even though counts might be low he doesn't want to put things off. He wans to be aggressive with this.  LorenaB you are so right that a support system makes things so less stressful! Familyrocks sounds like you are coping well too, this is great! you mentioned you get a Neulasta shot, something i'm not getting . What drug does that help?  Had a good night last night , did my last midnight pee and slept till six, feel pretty good. I have had no nausea, just occasional loose bowels (to much info I know, it's amazing what we won't think twice about sharing) and slight headache. so I consider that pretty good and just wondering whats to come. I drank a ton of water the day before and yesterday and will try to keep up with that today. Wondering if that is helping with feeling so good. Feel like i can do a few things around the house today. Did anyone tell you , you couldn't drive for a periond of time after the chemo?  I forgot to ask. I should get my mom to the grocery store before I hit my low period. She's on her own and needs some help. Its a glorious sunny day here, wishing I could sit in the sun, but a book in the shade will do!  Everyone remember to make sure you have down time and rest up and look after yourselves, the little worlds we live in will still revolve without us helping out as much (albiet not as smoothly, or as neatly and so on.... !)

Roxi and collector good luck with your ports, you'll do fine..let us know how it goes !  Kat what a touching thing your husband said to you at the relay, it's sometimes the little things they say and do that mean the most I am on the same FEC as you & started on the same day sounds like you are doing ok too. I can't say I have ever been nauseas, just on day two felt a little funky in the mouth and really tired, I have been able to eat , i just keep it small and more often, and am trying to keep up on the fluids. But after that barrell full of water i had the day before, during and after it's hard to drink alot now. But for the the new girls, I think this is very important that they know to drink, drink , drink,...and pee, pee pee......it might of helped in how i feel now.  Also I have been diligent with the baking soda rinse 3 or more time a day. The only thing that turns my stomach and it's not even food is the purell hand sanitizer i have strategically place all around the house. I made the mistake of getting scented , so that is my mission for today, go replenish the house with unscented ! I'ld like to say I almost feel normal but I'm not quite sure what that is anymore!  I am a little worried though, my daughter as been caughing up a lung the last few days, and poor girl I have been on her so about the caughing in the arm and hand washing hands and such. How worried do we get if we just get a cold, with no fever just a cold? My low time is coming up so I'm wondering and a little concerned.  I have rambled long enough good wishes to those with ports and chemo coming up... angel hugs your way !",

It's a great place for info and support.   Lisa I had only had a single mastectomy early april and then a port put in on the other side just over a week ago . It hasn't caused me too much grief and haven't lost any mobility, but your situation is different with having a double mastectomy. Where did they position it ?   I'm with you on wanting to get this part of it over with.. I just keep focused on my last treatment of chemo on Aug 28 and the party i'm gonna have after!  My second tx is may 29 which seems along way away right now! Pepper, I can't help you on the fluid buildup problem , but i know I have read other posting of ladies who have had this problem that might be able to help you. Hopefully they will see your ? and give you the info you need. KinAz I'm with you on not knowing if i want a wig for the hot summer, but i figure there will be one or two situations where a ball cap or hat won't cut it. So next week I have to go to a larger town for a rad consult and think i might go wig shopping while i still have my hair so i can match it somewhat. Carla sounds like you have the wig thing all figured out and are having some fun with it too, thats the only way to get through this. More power to you to you for shaving your head tomorrow, are you losing your hair already ? I know we had our tx on the same day...i'm just waiting for that first fistfull to come out Gogators I hope you are doing ok and you can get your incision fixed up before it causes you too much grief! Hope everyone has a sunny and relaxing Sunday.. ..Angel hugs to everyone!",

I was out poking around in the garden (with out gloves cause it didn't cross my mind....chemo brain maybe.. i don't know if that is applicable this early on in treatment but i'll use it anyway!) and of course I got a small scratch and panic sets in ...oh no infection and so on.  So i have to remember to rethink everything i do and apply it to my new normal.

I just wouldn't have it in me to go there. I've been kinda a silent partner as of late, just haven't felt real talkative.. But I  have been comforted sittin in the big comfy chair in the corner being in your company.    Well, it's a beautiful day here, the birds are chirping, it's Friday , my cold is leaving,I have a nice big cup of coffee.... what more could a girl ask for ?    The kids are in the wind down at school, and summer holidays will be here before we know it. Have been planning our summer camping trip, feels good to be able to do this as it was a no go last year.  We think we will head up to Barkerville, up quite a ways north from us in BC. It's a historical mining town where a big part of the gold rush here took place. We've been before but it's great country and some awesome provincial campsites along the way. We've been camping in a tent trailer for the last 25 years, and finally my hubbie this year said maybe it's time we move up notch to a hardsided trailer.  I'm so excited. (obviously doesn't take much)    Even though we love the openess of the tent trailer it is a lot of work setting up and down, and we wouldn't have the worry of bears joining us for a nightcap as we do in some of the campsites.  This way we could make our way to Yellowstone and places like that.  So we are on the lookout for a gently used lite trailer ,   Know of any ? Kristy I get where your coming from, sometimes it's just nice to do your own thing, with your own family and not have to expend the extra energy it takes to be upbeat and sociable when other people are around !  So you can gripe all you want. Here's hoping everyone has a great weekend, Cheers",

Have been to both places but our daughter was too young to remember so now we have to redo alot of our trips. Don't mind it is just beautiful there. Just found out our son who is spending the summer where he went to school 8 hours away,,,lost his wallet. Of course with all id ,  DL, credit cards,and such , it just makes me feel bad I can't be there to help him get it all sorted out, And thinking if I was there i would probablly walk into his room which i know is a mess and find it right away.    Apparently he went to a movie and either it fell out or go swiped.    I know he is 20 and this will be a good lesson for him it's just hard to turn off the mom thing. .  While my DH just shook his head and said ....it's probablly because he was wearing those stupid baggy pants with his wallet hanging out, no wonder !  Mary I hope your drain quits draining soon and they can yank it out !

A totally unrelated subject.....after coming home found out immunizations were happening at school and they were offering the HPV shot containing guardasil to the girls in grade 9. It is supposed to protect against some of the viruses that are prevalent when they get sexually active (and I know daughter isn't there yet and hopefully not for a long time !)    that can cause cervical cancer down the road.   I haven't had any time to research it so said no for now....it's available any time you want it .  I know it is probably as safe as any of the other shots the kids get but this one is so new that you only hear about the bad reactions from it.  Have any of you with teenage girls been offered this and any feedback ? Just want to make the right decision for her. The weekend is almost here....happy Thursday May ladies !",

Our daughter has talked us into going on a little road trip to Kelowna next week so she can do some school shopping with a friend.  I think I will have to plant the husband in Princess Auto or some place like that so the girls can have the time they need! Had a follow up with the surgeon this week ....he said everything looked fine but did want to put a requisition in for another mamo.   When I had my mamo months ago there was some shadowing but they concluded it was the scar from the port.....but he didn't like the way the tech worded it on the report so he wants to be sure and do another.  I am really pleased with this guy...he listens and he has no problem going that extra step just to be sure and put you at ease. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend...and you see a rainbow along the way",

Just sent my daughter off on her grade 8 year end trip. They are heading down to Spokane and will stay at the Davenport...a very historic posh hotel. They have a dinner and dance cruise on Lake Courd'lane and a day in Silverwood an amusement park. Wow the year end trips sure have changed since i was in school...i don't think we even got one in grade 8 !    The house will be quiet for the next couple days.

Boy our lives sure can change in such a short time!! Here it goes... first off my experience might be a little different than yours will be as they did the AND at the same time as my mastectomy so it was  accessed through that incision and not with a seperate one. Was there a reason they didn't do yours at the same time, did you have a single mastectomy?  I woke up from surgery in recovery and had slight achiness in my arm so they gave me a percocet, and that was the last perscription pain pill I had. I stayed overnight in hospital, they put me on anti inflammatory for swelling and gave me a rx for tylenol 3. Before I left the physio came by a gave me some gentle excercises to do for my arm until i got my 2 drains out. You will probablly only have one, i had the extra cause of the mastectomy. My surgeon also told me to use that arm and let my body tell me when to stop. I slept in a recliner for pretty much a week and a half, as it was most comfortable and so much easier to get out of, I was worried about pulling something trying to get up out of bed. I had numbness also under upper arm, armpit and front and back of shoulder area. The numbness is fading under the upper arm and noticing it is quite sensitive to clothing and things rubbing up against it, but it is still quite numb under the armpit. For this reason I have been leary about shaving under that arm so today i am going to pick up an electric shaver so i dont cut myself. (just somethng to think about)  So loose fitting clothing thats not to tight in that area is better and as laureg said button up shirts are great. I got my drains out 6 days after surgery as my output was below 30CC the whole time. And was able to drive the next day. My range of motion is not to limited side to side it's more the up and down where i can't get my elbow to far above the shoulder. I have been trying to put on some of my t-shirts and find I get kinda stuck half way through cause I can't move the right way to get it on. It's actually kinda funny thinking I might have to walk around the house this way util someone gets home to help me out of this position! I started physio 2 weeks after surgery to help with this. It feels so good to get this as they gently massage the muscles and joints and then at the end she puts some nice heat on and I'm ready for a nap!  So I guess the most important thing is to keep up with the excercises they give you. I have a small bit of swelling from the surgery but they say it's normal, and no fluid buildup as of yet. So for you with already having had a mastectomy , this should be a piece of cake ! Let me know how it goes for you and sorry if I rambled on to much.",

Didn't think they would have a spot for a couple more months. Her mental health has been quickly deteriorating lately. A couple months ago they did a minnie mental test on her and she was at 10/30, they did one a couple weeks ago and she was at 5 so this might of moved her up on the list.  They asked if we wanted it......yaaaaa!  I thought it would be a week or so before we would take my mom up there but they said bring her up on Thursday, tomorrow.  So the brain has been in overdrive thinking of all the things that need to be taken care of, just happy this didn't happen next week just before we leave on the cruise. So after the call I went to visit my mom, i had phoned her at to say i would be down in a bit. When i got there the door was unlocked , dog inside but my mom was nowhere to be found. I ran to the neighbours, jogged around the area looking for her while panic was setting in.  She would never be able to find her way home or remember her address.   For those of you who have kids....it is the feeling you get if you ever have lost you kids in a busy store or mall and you don't know where they are.  I looked for quite awhile then phoned the police to let them know and get some direction.  Not too long after this a car pulls into the driveway with my mom and an old friend of hers gets out, apparently she took her out for some icecream and didn't think of leaving a note or phoning. She said as soon as she saw me she realized what she had done and she felt so bad. So I couldn't be mad with her as she had good intentions.     I think I gained a few grey hairs on that one. I have to go and do all the paperwork today to make it easier tomorrow. Busy days ahead. Jen take care of yourself, hoping your headaches go away. I will virtually send you a neck and temple massage to ease the tension and the headaches....here it comes ! Sorry I'm so chatty,....just needed to share with my sista's  Have a great day!",

Boy , you had a tough road leading up to your first tx, thats alot to process in a short period of time. You were not negative at all, you were just telling it like it is, and those meltdowns don't make you weak they just make you human and they can be very theraputic!  Aren't cats great, as indepnedent as they are, they are great comfort when you need them. (As any pet is!) Hope you have a good weekend! Haykat that sucks you have all that pain I hope you can still do that road trip with your son, but do take care of yourself first!   Wondering7, it's tough starting this chemo road, i know i'm only a week old. The worst part for me was the unknown, even though you get valuable info here that has made this so less frightning, when you are sitting in the chair waiting for it to start, it made me a little nervous. But once it started and I didn't feel anything, I'm asking thats it? It's all pretty uneventfull you just sit there drink and go pee, and they do the rest.  (thats how it worked for me anyways)  And when you get home, rest your body and your mind! Gogators, good luck with your port today, and Nmjohn good luck with your first tx today, even though you are not a newbie to all this , it makes it no less daunting i'm sure. Well I ordered my some hats and head scarfs from headcovers.com and plus a partial wig called a halo for under hats, thought it might be cooler, see if i can fool anyone!  Just not ready yet to commit to a full wig. I got a call and I have to go for a Rad consult next week to see it that is in my future after chemo,(that would be in Sept. sometime) I have to go to a city 4 hours away for rads if needed which kinda sucks so I would be there for 3 weeks straight without family. I guess 3 weeks is more doable than the alternative! it's just hard to wrap my head around rads right now with just starting chemo.  The ramble is over, hope everyone has a good weekend , good luck to anyone on tx today!",

I'v been feeling so good and thought i had sailed through this round, but have had a sore throat the last couple days and my temp was up from my normal , it had gone up to 99.4. I hummed and hawed about going to the doc seeing as the temp hadn't hit that majic # of 100, but sure glad i did , he did blood work and my counts were really low. I'm day 15 of tx. WBC- 0.9  (my orginal count before chemo was 6.5) Neutrophil - .05  so last night had to go up to emrg and get a shot of Neupogen (Filgrastim) and stay for an hour so they could see if i was allergic to it or not, and have to go back to get one for the next 4 days. (i'm not brave enough to do it myself..wimp i know)     It just shows trust your instincts and listen to your body. Do you get the aches and pains from Neupogen also ?  So yesterday was the most eventfull day i've had .....hair coming out in handfulls and evening entertainment. Just part of the rollercoaster ride of life! Hope everyone else has a wonderful side effect free Friday!",

I have private coverage that will cover half of it , but my pharmacist said to register with FairPharmacare and they might help out with more. So maybe check into pharmacare and see it that is an option for you. good luck !",

Got dd into appt. returned the surgeons call and got the info that would change my life forever and i was to see him in 2 days to discuss our options.....It was a beautiful day and i was down by the water so just went for a walk and pondered what was ahead. I remember that phone call like it was yesterday. On a tastier note...beverage of choice...an ice cold beer on the beach or with popcorn watching a thunderstorm.  Also i must admit i love my ceasars...vodka, clam juice , tobasco , worsteschire and lemon...and in my more refined moments a glass of white wine. Renee good luck with your journey...the info and the friendships that have been made here is invaluable...there are good things that can come out of the bad!  While i sit with my balmy 2 deg. celsius outside (around 35 F) i feel for all of you getting hit with the cold weather.. bundle up and stay warm!  On to the laundry, dishes and all that other stuff i say i will do later...cheers! ",

Rock so glad to hear that nothing was found but do hope you figure out what is causing the weight loss. In a normal life we would be happy about the loss but sorry yours is concerning you ! And colonoscopies left right and center....haven't been told i need one yet and i don't think i'll ask right at the moment.  The only test i had to do this week was a bone density...that was an easy one!  I did get a little anxious when laying on the table for a moment....i think it took me back to radiation with the machine overhead. Was over in a minute. Hauled up the holiday decorations from the basement and starting setting that up...now i just have a big fat mess in the livingroom..boxes everywhere, so have to deal with that today. It's nice when it's done i just dislike the process!  Girls i will really try to get these cards done, but haven't even started yet so hopefully you will get them before the New Year!  Jen good luck with doc and mamo today (i think thats what i read way back) and  Gracie with your pet/ct scans and anyone else going for a test. Kerry glad your move is almost complete, thats an accomplishment in itself..We have been talking of downsizing but the thought of packing everything up kinda slows the conversation. Other than it helps you to purge all the stuff you don't need !  Hope everyone has a great Monday! ",

Got a few things on the go...tonight we are getting cultural and going to the theatre. There is a production of My Fair Lady, so looking forward to that, hubby is even going, surprising as it's not really his cup of tea. Tomorrow is our business christmas party, we take over a restraunt and get a good meal and have some laughs. Had to trim the bonuses this year so hope everyone understands..times are so uncertain and the sales were really down this year. On Sunday we will attempt to at least get the tree in the stand and then i can just poke away at the decorations. Its not like it used to be when the kids would get all excited and want to be part of the tree trimming..two are no longer home and our daughter 13 on Dec. 27 will help with a couple ornaments then lose interest and wander away. It' makes me feel kinda sad in a way....sigh . Time marches on even though we try to hold onto the way things were. Got my bone density test back and according to them I am in the normal range of denseness.(not sure if that is a word) Oh it's so nice to be considered \"normal \" again !  So that should be the last test this year....but already have something lined up for Jan.7 getting a vaginal polyp removed, ouch! Knew i had it just before chemo started but put it off till now. I have had an endiometreal biopsy so shouldn't be any harder than that. \"they\" say that these things usually aren't canceruous so will keep thinking those good thoughts ! We are supposed to get a dump of snow today, so will try and get things done in the morning, feel a cold coming on so an afternoon nap might be in order. A collective happy weekend to all us May Gals !",

So if you have tagged me for something and i haven't replied i'm still working on it.

Our whole team each got one so will make a day of it and go out for a nice lunch and get the treatment.    I do have a physio appt today so that will help loosen things up.

Also i find everyday when i wake up it takes awhile to clear them, like they have a glaze over them and have to keep blinking to clear things up.  This happens throughout the day too..eye doc says everything checks out so come back in a year. So I guess i can just chock it up to the chemo giving me a gift that never ends! Have to take my moms dog to the vet today..peeing blood which can't be good! Just hoping its nothing more than a bladder infection. Cause i don't think my mom could handle losing her best friend right now it would crush her already fragile world .

Got a busy day ahead ...have to get daughter to physio at her lunch hour then have to go judge at her skipping records day for speed and power. Which means clicking how many times the right foot touches the floor as they jump the rope, not counting misses in either 30 seconds, 1 min or 3 min.She is in the 80's for her 30 seconds. And power is double and triple unders which means in one skip turning the rope under you 2 or 3 times........it's amzing to watch how fast these kids can go.   Then tonight is our weekly curling night for our ladies team, not to competetive on the curling just more a social night out.

Got the same tech i had last year so we had a real good chat.  Who knew you could take a pic on the mastectomy side..didn't think it was possible but it is....side view that is.   She did the other side and then told me to wait while her and the main tech check them out...waiting and waiting......comes back to tell me we need a few more pics, see something that is causing concern.  I thought here we go again, but glad she was being thorough. After the second set they feel it is probablly part of the scar tissue from the port they see, but will send report to doc and he might get me to have ultrasound. So now I'm left with the thought yes it makes sense it being the scar tissue, but will be pushing for the ultrasound to put it to rest.

Randie, hope you are breathing easier  with having the draining done, and you can minimize the pain you feel. Julie glad to hear your dad is coming home, but darnit.....sorry to hear about your aunt, enough already for you ! Kerry it is so sad when something like you explained happens to a child, my heart just aches for his family,  No words can ease a families grief at this time so  I  am sending prayers that  the time they have left with their little guy... is quality time and  he can go to a more peacefull place without any pain. They will be lucky to have you around for support !   I agree with you in that it kinda puts what we are going through into perspective . Sorry to freak some of you out with the mastectomy side mammo , as i said i didn't think it was possible either. It was vertical squish starting just underneath the arm and getting whatever she could on that side. Actually when i use my hand to simulate what the squisher would be doing i do get a handfulll especially just to the side of the armpit . It didn't bother me any more than doing the boob.  So bring it on especially , if there are any nodes that can be picked up or anything else lingering there. Had a great weekend....our friends were truly surprised and we spent the night eating , reminicing , laughing and drinking a bit too much wine. The head was a bit fuzzy in the morning, just can't do it like i used too, which tells me I shouldn't be doing it like I used too ! Everyone else hope you have a great Monday ! Cheers!",

You'll find you have some bad days but you find a way to get through it.  Sorry to say you will more than likely loose the hair.  Mine started coming out around day fourteen, had a really sore scalp which was the indication of what was to come.  After you get through the first visit it's not so bad. Kristy congrats on the last Herceptin. I know what you mean by the fatige in the arm and shoulder, I can feel it when i'm raking or using that side for something. Rock any more crushing news ? Gracie , Randie , Sue how you all feeling. Sue when you are up too it and ready to show off, maybe a little picture of the twins would be in order ? (edited to say with clothes on of course! I'm just not that kinda girl ) Noelle I hope you are feeling better. I had my 1 year follow up with the surgeon yesterday. Everything went fine, i showed him a little bump of concern but he seemed to think it was nothing to worry about. But said for me to come back in 3 months instead of 6 so he can check it again. He such a nice guy, he says he takes anything a women that has had bc seriously and won't take any chances. Also said for me to check it every 3 weeks or so (not everyday like I have been ) and if there is any change to let him know. I am on a road trip on Thursday to Victoria for our daughters jump rope provincials. A weekend filled with early mornings , no sleep and non stop action. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this. Keep looking in the mailbox hoping for some road trip music ! Cheers",

After an internal ultrasound they found i had a thickening in the endometrial lining, so wanted to make sure it wasn't cancer related and found after the biopsy everything was fine. Figured it had something to do with my early menopause or false reading on the ultra sound.   So get your testing done knowing what ever the result you will be able to over come (because there will be nothing wrong) and you can get on with life.....that was my gentle prodding loving nag....",

I just went through a mastectomy last week and was surprised at how good I felt afterwards. A weight was lifted off my shoulders and now I could move on to the next step. When I look at where my breast used to be I don't feel sad cause to me its a reminder that I am alive and fighting and did something about it. Even though you feel like you are losing a part of you, that part does not define you ! You will have good days and bad but thats ok , just go with the flow and allow yourself a good cry now and then.  i'm glad your surgeon called and that has reassured you, if you nee any other info. , this is the best place. I think these boards is what made my journery into surgery so calming because I was going in with info and insight and it took all the scary stuff away !  If you have any questions on surgery, procedures anything ask away!  And as hard as it may seem now , you will make it through this and we will all be there for you.",

Mind you I had very minimal SE, no problem with constipation or diahrrea, and hardly had any nausea, There were days when food would turn my stomach but or i felt a little queasy but it quickly  past.   My mouth kind of hit the gutter about day 3 where taste buds made everything taste like cardboard for about a week, I got a runny nose from one of the drugs on every round and dry itchy eyes but a natural tear product helped that. No mouth sores just a dry mouth and throat, again which usually cleared up by day 12 or on.  My biggest problem was my counts would take a nose dive every time around day 8 so I have been on Nuepogen for around 7 days for every round even through the Taxotere. I did not find the taxotere any worse than the FEC, just different. I had a little more fatigue with it between day 3 - 8, and very little bone or muscle aches, usually 1 day where i felt it. The Taxotere also plays with the mouth and food is pretty much tasteless (for me anyways) for the first 12 days or so. I'ld say the only tx that did a number on me was this last one, every thing just seems to be lasting a little bit longer and stronger,....I guess the body is just tired ! It's always scary going into something new, and even though 6 tx seems like alot , I must say i cannot believe how quickly it went! So good luck, hope you are managing your SE's,   feel free to send a private message if you want to chat. .....",
