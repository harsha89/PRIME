A prophylactic mastectomy was recommended to me recently due to my elevated bc risk after having the radiation treatment for hodgkin's (had the radiation approx 11 years ago) I have had yearly Mamo, MRI, sono yearly for the past 7 years with no notable change but very dense breast tissue is making it difficult to see a lot. I don't have a family history of bc on my mother's side and my paternal grandmother had bc in her 70's but lived to be 97 - so I don't think that counts. The dr seemed to think the proactive route is a smart option for me. I am curious to know if there is anyone out there in the same boat... I have been through the months of chemo/radiation for hodgkin's and now with two small children feel terrified at the prospect of getting breast cancer. From what I have read a mastectomy seems like a tremendously difficult thing to go through and the more I read about reconstruction and it's many risks I am fearful. The surgeon is recommending reconstruction with tissue expanders and implants. Anyone have experience? I am so anxious and confused. Thank you.",
