I thought i was done after 4 pictures but they called me back to get 3 more, and those hurt the most - my breast was purple! But after that the MRI was a piece of cake!   Now the waiting begins. I didn't get an MRI before my first lumpectomy so this is my first one, and of course i'm going straight to worst-case scenario in my crazy little mind. I wish you all a happy and healthy weekend and thanks again. ",
