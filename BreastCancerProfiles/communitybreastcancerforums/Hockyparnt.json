After it was drained during the second lumpectomy I felt great. Now it has returned again and I am very uncomfortable again and facing more surgery. Does anyone know of how to get relief from this. It is not lymphedema. I believe it. Is what's called a seroma. I really would feel bad at all if this was gone. It interrupts sleep and all every day activities. Any help any of you ladies can gov would be greatly appreciated Dx 4/15/2016, IDC, Right, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Or was it located elsewhere? Overnight has brought new symptoms the area now is as hard as a rock. Luckily today I have an appointment with a second opinion and my surgeon for follow up tomorrow",
