Can't move from being a victim to a survivor.  I have a JP drain which is doing fine and two incisions...with this tape on them the stitches are on the inside.  The surgeon said the lump margins looked good he removed tissue about the size of a golf balls.  I just hang on evey word.  I like him but he didn't tell me about needing this drain. ",
