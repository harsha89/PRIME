I have to go for an MRI on Oct 5 and they said it could \"light up\" due to the hematoma and I may need another biopsy. This scares the life out of me. I have been applying hot compresses to it every day several times a day in hopes this will help it heal.",

I did have fatigue that was difficult mid way through and this lasted about one week.  The techs explained to me that my body was busy regenerating the healthy cells that had been damaged by the radiation and this required alot of energy, hence, fatigue.  This made sense to me and let me know it was not all in my head.  So, lube the boob as they say from day one and all will be well.",
