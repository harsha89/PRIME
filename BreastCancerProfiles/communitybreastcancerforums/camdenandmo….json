And I knew I did not want to receive chemo at his hospital when that time came.  I decided that it was easier to change now. One of the problems was that we could not get the information we were requesting sent to Sloan-Kettering.   So I am now wondering if Sloan Kettering even had my January scan results.  I think I am going to email the nurse and see.  Either way, at best, I have had some more regression and, at worst, I've been stable for 6 months.   I am pleased, and know that this is good news.  I was hoping to be closer to NED.  I knew I wouldn't be NED, because there is still a little bit of the primary tumor remaining.  But I really wanted my markers to be getting close to the normal range.  I was surprised to see they were the same, because the nurse at my previous doctor told me they had dropped again in March. I had an oophorectomy a week and a half ago and I am going to have Zometa every other month.  I hope these give me a little boost.  But Tamoxifen does seem to be working.

I am stage IV from the beginning.  I was diagnosed September 2008 at 33.  I would not worry about how high your tumor markers are.  Markers are tricky and generally specific to the individual.  They don't move for some and for others they are absolute.  Also, from what I understand, the numbers aren't necessarily indicitive of how much cancer is in your body. Someone might have the same amount of cancer at 300 or 3000.   A rule of thumb I have heard is don't be concerned about an increase of less than 10%.  Also, since your oncologist is taking two markers, I would be more concerned if they were both moving up than if they move in different directions.  Stacie",
