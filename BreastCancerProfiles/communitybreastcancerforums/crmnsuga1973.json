I go on Dec 7 for a u/s follow up on my mri of the 1.5cm lobulated mass with mixed enhancement and vascular something in my left auxilla. Aat this point they do not feel it is worrisome, and I've done well not obsessing and I go to therapy for my health anxiety. But, my anxiety is rearing its ugly head the closer my appointment...and here I am. Log in to post a reply",

I dont know what this report means, and if anyone can assist in translation or give advice on what questions i should ask or procedure to request I would greatly appreciate it. Repirt as follows EXAM: MRI BREAST BILATERAL ACCESSION: 3329266 HISTORY: Follow-up left axillary lobulated mass. TECHNIQUE: Breast MRI was performed with an 8 channel coil. Sequences obtained included axial T2 fat sat, pre-contrast axial T1, post-contrast T1 every 90 seconds for three sequences and high resolution sagittal sequences. Subtraction axial images were generated. Axial 3D SPGR images were also obtained. Sagittal reconstructions were performed. Patient's BUN is 17 mg/dL, creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL with an eGFR of 107 mL/min/1.73 meters squared. 10 cc of MultiHance intravenous contrast were injected without incident. The study was processed using a CADstream system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar and three dimensional reconstructions, by creating subtraction images from the dynamic pre- and post-contrast data and by providing enhancement kinetic and analytical information. COMPARISON STUDIES: June 22, 2015 FINDINGS: RIGHT BREAST: In the upper outer aspect at anterior depth, there is an ill-defined enhancing focus. This measures approximately 8 x 7 mm in size. This is subthreshold for CADstream analysis. In the 9:00 axis at mid depth, there is an ill-defined area of nonmasslike enhancement. This area measures approximately 14 mm in length. This is subthreshold for CADstream analysis. Between the 2 enhancing foci described above, there is very faintly enhancing ill-defined focus at anterior to mid depth. This is subthreshold for CADstream analysis. No other worrisome areas of enhancement. No enlarged or abnormal appearing axillary or internal mammary chain lymph nodes. LEFT BREAST: The lobular mass described previously, which appears to represent a lymph node, has a stable appearance on MRI. There are several other normal appearing lymph nodes within the left axilla. No enhancing mass within the left breast. No areas of worrisome nonmasslike enhancement. No enlarged or abnormal appearing internal mammary chain lymph nodes. IMPRESSION: RIGHT BREAST: 1. Ill-defined area of nonmasslike enhancement at the 9:00 axis at mid depth. Recommend MRI guided biopsy. 2. Ill-defined nodular asymmetry in the upper outer aspect at anterior depth. Recommend diagnostic mammogram, and Second Look ultrasound. If this is sonographically and mammographically occult, recommend follow-up MRI in 6 months. 3. A third area of enhancement is noted between the 2 areas described above. Recommend 6 month follow-up MRI. LEFT BREAST: 1. The lymph node, within the axilla, which prompted follow-up has remained stable. No MRI evidence for malignancy. Log in to post a reply",

Left stable, right enhanced three different spots 1 non mass like, two asymmetric \"nodular\" (my actual report is on a thread here). Went in this week Wednesday to same breast center, same tech team, and radiologist to get MRI guided biopsy of the 14mm non mass like area because it was recommended. Went thru a second look mammo and u/s (tech made a comment about a shadow on the u/s and said \"that must be what they want to biopsy\"). Doc came in and said they couldn't see anything in either the u/s or mammo. Go down for MRI guided biopsy an hour later and they did the scans then shot me the dye. Both the doc and techs came in and said they weren't doing the biopsy because the areas didn't enhance?? The doc reassured me this was good news, and was confident, and recommended a 6 mo mri follow up. My bs is gone on vacation, and her RNP is on maternity leave, so I wont hear anything officially from her office until Monday or Tuesday. I just don't understand how it could change that much in a week for them to say no we cant biopsy this. Log in to post a reply",
