Soon after I hurriedly extracted the breast milk out due to the pain, and thats when I saw dopplets of blood. It has been over a year since the incident and I have not had any medical exam. Now I fell painfull pulses inside my breast's, but they come and go. Could this be a serious medical condition or of a symtom of something else? Log in to post a reply",
