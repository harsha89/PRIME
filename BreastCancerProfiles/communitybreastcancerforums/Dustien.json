I'm glad to hear it was only 9 days for you before you started feeling more energetic and that you're doing fine now. You gave me a lot of hope! Thank you for that. I'm also glad to hear your's was also 5 weeks after surgery and it was still doable without a great amount of pain. My Surgeon did give me a prescription for the burning pain I'm feeling now due to nerve endings being mess with and there should be plenty left to cover anything I might need due to the Savi and radiation. From your story it sounds like I'll only need it on the 1st and last day of the treatment. I'm so glad to hear that and so hope all goes as well for me! Thanks!",

      "Content": "Apr 1, 2018 06:01AM - edited Apr 1, 2018 06:50AM by Dustien Well, I wish I were as fortunate as the two of you. I am on antibiotics to stave off any infections. I guarantee you it's not the surgery damaged nerves waking up or anything like that. I've had that pretty seriously starting two weeks after the surgery and in the last week before the treatment it was starting to lighten up (It's now been 5+ weeks after surgery). That nerve pain was focused mostly around and under the nipple and though I still feel it a bit, the Savi pain is definitely different and overshadows it. Friday's treatment went from almost no pain before the 1st session to the pain starting as soon as he removed the bandage from Thursday's procedure and started tugging and messing with the Savi. Then, it lessened a bit when they took me to the Savi room, only to flair up worse when I had to do it all over again in the afternoon. I start out in the CT room where the bandage is taken off and the Dr. messes with the Savi. Then when I'd come out of the CT scan he'd do more messing with the Savi before taking me into the SAVI room. It's that tugging / adjusting that's causing all the pain. At one point I even said, Ouch! That Hurts! Then he wheeled me into the Savi room. Once there the hooking up and having the treatment wasn't painful, but the pain inflicted earlier just got worse. When it was over I told both the doctor and the nurse how badly it hurt. The Doc asked if I needed any pain medication. I told him I had some and he said that I should definitely take it. So I took a percocet as soon as I got out to the car. Today at home (Saturday) I've taken Tylenol twice and though I'm uncomfortable, I can't say I'm really hurting. The incision area did start to itch, so I used an anti itch medicine on it and that helped. I'm sleeping in the recliner and keep waking and sleeping off and on. It's now 4:30 AM on April 1st. It would be wonderful if God would wake me and say...APRIL FOOLS! This whole cancer thing was just a joke! Now, go on about your life as if it never happe Oh well, one can dream, can't they? Here's to 4 days down and 5 to go, then I can start to heal... I'm just not looking forward to those last 7 treatments! I'm hoping a percocet a day will keep the pain away!",

Each time he's said I had fluid coming out, but that it was normal. Perhaps the joggling is him trying to get the fluid out each time... all I know is it ticks off the incision and it really hurts. It has hurt (and itched) off and on all weekend, but tynolol and has kept it in check. I will be taking Percocet each morning this week though, and in the afternoon if I feel I need one. Hopefully It will keep me from going through the pain I went through on Friday. Tip to anyone doing this procedure... get your breast Doctor to give you a strong pain med prescription just in case. If you don't need it, great..but if you do, you'll be glad you have it! I'm expecting to be tired but hope it goes away soon after this is all over. I want to be out enjoying the spring and the dogwoods blooming and birds nesting. My favorite time of year and I'm spending it doing this! ;-(",

Just to have someone to post to who cared made more bearable. Sounds like I had it harder then many...but that could have been because of where my tumor was? It was at 6:00 at the bottom of my breast. You can't even see the scar, either from the surgery or from the Savi as it's hidden under the fall of the breast. The breast weight bearing down on the Savi may have had something to do with it being so painful I'm thinking. Then there's myself having a low tolerance for pain to begin with. I'm so pleased to say that it's nearly been a week now. Tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM will be almost one week to the minute when my Savi was removed. This last week on the mend has been great and it's getting better day by day. I'm doing fine. I've had a shower every day and am now ready to let a day go by without taking one. I'm normally an every other day shower gal, and am ok with getting back to the swing of my old life before cancer hit! Next step.... next Tuesday I meet with the oncologist and talk about Tomoxafin. I'm hoping I can hold off taking it as I've a camping trip coming up in May and don't want to be experiencing side effects then. I figure if they can waiting 5 week after surgery before giving me Radiation, I can wait 5 weeks after Radiation (or longer) before starting Tomoxifin.",

I really wanted it sooner, but couldn't get the radiation doc, my doc and the savi machine all lined up together until the 28th. I'm already fighting moderate to severe burning pain in my breast from nerves waking up and/or interferring with scar tissue (according to my surgeon). He gave me a prescription for Percocet when I went in to see him today to measure the cavity in my breast for the Savi. I know I won't need them the day they place the Savi since they are going to be numbing me, but I'm going to be glad to have them on hand if needed after placement so I'm hoping to be able to use them sparingly this week. I just pray this pain I'm having now lessons by then. I can't imaging this burning nerve pain and pain of the Savi at the same time. I do plan on turning my cars drivers side seat into a comfy bed and sleeping between treatments. The drive to the radiation treatement location is 35 minutes so I see no reason to drive there and back two times a day. I've a question though...will I be able to drive myself? I hate to put my husband through more then just going with me for the Savi placement as well as the 1st day of radiation if I don't have to. Thanks!",

When the Doctor puts in the catheters, he jiggles the device and it feels like I'm being stuck with a flaming red poker..and it continues to burn through the treatment and beyond. After the 2nd treatment for the day, when I got to my car, driving or no, I had to take a percocet. I'm off for the weekend, thank goodness. I fell asleep in the chair last night and slept all night (unusual for me) and then after a half hour up earlier today went back to sleep till after 4 PM. I slept nearly 24 hours with just a couple of bathroom breaks. I did take my Ipod and listened to a book on tape during the proceedure. I also took my sleeping mask and that helped me relax even further, though they do have pretty spring cherry blossoms on the ceiling to stare at. I told them they needed to put a TV up there with a slideshow of beautiful nature photos to watch and birds singing. Monday when I go in, I'm taking a percocet about 20 minutes before treatment, hoping then I don't have the same pain I had yesterday. I sleep in the car in the parking lot till 2nd treatment, so I won't be driving. Hopefully it will last through the 2nd treatment to cover the pain, but will be gone enough for me to drive home ok.",

Anyone can stand that. I am soooooooo glad this week is over. It's been the toughest week of all. Thank God I'm now cancer free, savi free and on the mend! Thanks to all of you for being there listening to my whins and gripes! I wish I could have been more positive but I'm afraid I'm a wimp when it comes to pain. Everything up to this has been pretty smoothly going. But though this week was the hardest and had me second guessing doing the Savi Proceedure instead of the Whole Breast Radiation, now that it's done I'm glad I went this way. I'd have another week to go with the WBR. I also think, long term, there's going to be less side effects and quicker healing then the WBR would have given me. And I've not had to take anything more then a single Tylenol since the proceedure. I find that quite amazing. Hopefully this is the end of having to take the strong pain meds! Plus, I finally get to take a regular shower tomorrow! Wahoo! How good is that going to feel??? Thanks Irish Girl and everyone else who gave me support and helped me though this! You're definitely the best! And, Irish Girl, I will be thinking good thoughts of you while I'm out there enjoying that lovely spring you talk about, as soon as it finally gets here! Do a search of \"Spring Forward How Freekin Far\" and check out the darling bird graphic someone came up with. That describes spring for much of the country very well right now. ;-) The next week is supposed to gradually warm up till it's beautiful! Can't wait!",

You make it sound like it's not going to be too awful. I'll just be glad when it's over though. And, I too, am greatful I can do this instead of the weeks of radiation. Thanks!

I really am jumping the gun on this one and should wait till I have all the facts.  It's just so hard...  I've always been a pro active take the bull by the horns type person and in this case there's nothing I can do but hurry up and wait!  So I turn to the net determined to learn what I can about this invader to my body and find that I have to take pills for 5 years that could give me all sorts of nasty side effects.  And yet, when I hear the list of side effects of any pills I have, in the past, not given them much notice, thinking that \"oh, they have to say that but I'm sure it's rare\".  And I've not been one to have many side effects at all that weren't manageable in any medications I've taken.  Though yet...in this case, I looked at the worse.  Go figure... Thank you all for helping bring me back down to earth on this one.  Of course I should wait until I have a more complete diagnosis... after MRI and even after Surgery (be it Breast Conserving or Mastectomy).  And of course I should at least give Tomoxafen a try to see how it affects me.  Of course if the side effects are worse then the cure I can quit then.  It seems I'm just not thinking strait these days.  Tomorrow will be my one week anniversary of hearing the words \"The Biopsy Shows You Have Cancer\".  That happens to the other guy...not to ME!  NO...ABSOLUTLY NOT!  My heart goes out to all of you who have diagnoses and procedures listed under your posts that are so much more dire and scarier then mine is at the moment.  It rather makes me ashamed of being so worried.   Thank you for your thoughtful posts trying to set my mind at ease.  I'm happy to have found this forum and all of you, and I give a big SHOUT OUT of gratitude to the Doctor who started it all. Hurrah for her and all the moderators and all of you who work tirelessly to help everyone else.  Hopefully I'll be able to contribute more in the future to help others as I go through this totally unexpected scary journey!

I, too, had the choice of a Mastectomy with no radiation or a Lumpectomy with Radiation.  I chose the later since I felt it would be the choice that would get me back on my feet quicker and was told, and read, that both offer the same results health wise.",

      "Content": "Feb 24, 2018 03:55AM - edited Feb 24, 2018 04:17AM by Dustien Have they set her up with a surgeon to consult with?  I had my yearly mammo at our local Mercy Hospital Clinic and two days later they called me back to a different facility for another look and did a sonogram.  Then four days later a biopsy.  Then diagnosis and they immediately set me up with a MRI and a general surgeon to meet with the following week. It was all happening to fast though and I wanted it to STOP!  So I called my insurance and asked for a list of Breast Cancer Specialists in our area and then hit the internet.  After a bit of reading I decided right then I wanted a 2nd opinion from someone who is a dedicated Breast Surgeon.  So I called the one the very next morning and they set me up with an appointment the next day.  I cancelled the MRI and the general surgeon appointment through Mercy and never looked back. The Doctor I chose has been absolutely wonderful.  I saw him 3 days after diagnosis (they had me set up with the general surgeon 5 days after that) and when I walked out of his office, I understood nearly everything I needed to know.  His nurse immediately called to set me up with an MRI on a dedicated breast MRI machine (40% more accurate at picking up breast problems then the general MRI Mercy had me set up with) at an imaging center about 30 minutes away, but that was fine by me.  There was a bit of a delay since insurance had already preapproved the first MRI and that approval had to be cancelled and this new MRI approved, but it happened quick enough, and yesterday, two weeks and two days after diagnosis, I had my Lumpectomy!  I'm a bit hyped up on Hydrocodone, but overall I'm feeling great!   I'm on no special insurance (just the affordable care act) and this Specialist and the Special MRI was covered just as the first doc and general MRI would have been covered.  I felt like had upgraded myself from Coach to First Class at no extra charge. I guess what I'm saying is, if they've not set your sis up with a dedicated breast surgeon (as opposed to a general surgeon) then she might want to find some who are in network with her insurance and do some research on the net of them.  Then choose one she likes who can get her in fast and go from there. It really paid off for me to handle it this way. I felt so much better about my care as soon as I talked with the Doctor.  When I was diagnosed and things were happening around me, I felt out of control.  Approaching it the way I did put me back in control and that was so important to me. The sooner your sis is able to talk with a specialist and have him explain everything to her, the better off she's going to be.  Also have her ask them about any breast specific MRI imaging available in the area.  If there is one in your area, or not to far from where you live that's where a specialist will be planning on sending you anyway. It's so good of you to reach out for help for your sister!  Good Luck! ",
