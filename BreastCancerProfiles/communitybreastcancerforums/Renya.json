no pain!  I literally walked off the OP table, went to dinner that night, still had my own boobie, slight indentation, but hey, it's mine!  Doc said they got all the tumor, only needed a partial....yet, medical likes to say, w'ere looking out for you, going to take everything...then why do so many of us still have problems later?   I am not trying to be self-righteous, but we all know, when it is a personal experience, we do get a bit agitated when we are yanked around by medical establishment...they tell us we're don't know what's best, seems to me, they don't either.   I've read countless books, educated myself as best I can, still I can't say I know anything close to being well educated in this field, but I do know without a doubt that statistics show cancer has NOT declined in survival rates in over 50 years, only the way stats are reported....and that fries me...doc's will order a 6mo round of chemo, knowing the patient can't tolerate more, then patient still alive after 6 mo's and counted as a cure, then in 8th month they die, but....still counted as a cure....????  You tell me.   All I know is I investigated nutrition, after learning cancer is not a virus, not a bacterial infection, well, what is it????   It's an Anaerobic Disease....and, can't find where any anaerobic disease can be cured with drugs, it's an immune disorder, who the heck knows what the cause is, medical doesn't, they only surmise.   But think 50 years ago we introduced lots of newbies into our life...mircowaves, countless preservatives in food, our water supply questionable, so, and I speak for me, I am not telling anyone what to do, we all have to be our own advocates....but again, \"I\", after learning I had this \"crap\" in me, got on purified water, natural/whole foods, 80% fruits/vegs, salmon, No sugars, no gluetemates, no soy (only fermented soy after cancer strikes), no milk products, cancer feeds on mucus.  Why didn't my doctor tell me these things...heck, doc office has candy treats everywhere!   Every day I take 2 Tbsp purred Asparagus-get Green Giant, boil, cool and puree, keep in refrig, every day I take 2 tblsp's AM and PM, you will be surprised how it cleans out body splatter/spot tumors.  I take Curcumin/Tumeric or Curcumin w/Biopriene - Fucoidan or U-FN, Phytoplankton, Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin C, Indole 3/Carbinol or DIM, D-3, B-12,Zinc, Flaxseed Omega3, CoQ1-. and Iodine.  You need to know amounts to take per how invasive your mets are.   Also,Anyone remember back in 70's the big hype over Laetriele?   Then all of sudden it went quiet???  Pharm co's found they couldn't patent as it was a natural food, so refused to produce and bring to market saying , oh it doesn't work.... Also called Amagdalin.    It can be purchased, I take it, along w/Apricot pit seed (So does Bill Clinton, so i'm not the only proponent).  Also, All my tumor markers fell like lead balloons once I started on the nutrients.  CEA down to 2.1, CA15-3 down to 30, the CA27-29 was stubborn, couldn't get it below 105 for 90 days, then started on the Fucoidan & Phytoplankton, dropped in 30 days to 70!!!    I don't mean to sound dictatoral or \"smartypants\", again, you asked, and this is MY regimine.   As stated, i've been on only Femara, now Aromasin, formerly Zometa, now Xgeva.  I've had NO chemo/No radiation, My choice.   Last scans, 2/7/12 -doc showed me results, explained...NO METS IN MY BODY, all this in 8 mo's.  Do have the tiny speck in my spine, only lighted area anywhere....so, I'm now exploring Exablate.   I've gotten used to breathing in air and enjoying my family, I will do all I can to save myself, after all, who cares more than me?   Love yourself, you are all important and we do deserve all the benefits available, after all, diet/nutrition cannot hurt, can we say the same for meds and poisons they feed us.  I could see look in my doc's face, he's asking me \"What did you say you are taking???\"  Yes, many of us survive the drugs, but would we have survived anyway with the right nutrients and treatments ro lessen the severe s/e's?    I'm not saying stop w/treatment, I still believe in medicine....but, we need to feed our body the right foods and give it a little kickstart. We are not all a One Size Fits All!  Sending very sincere wishes of health to you all, we are all holding hands in this battle and we deserve the right to know of the best treatments available. Godspeed.",

Inflammatory and Triple Neg are the worst, but no matter what they call our particular type, it's the worst when WE have it, or a loved one.  We lost our son to Lung Cancer ten years ago, I was really angry, seems strange I'm not angry now that I am the one bitten, but something is telling me I am going to survive this demon, I am determined...I wish you all the best, all sticken know the fight goes on every millisecond of every day, never give up.",

I don't thrive on anger, but I enjoy a good scream every once in awhile, for the most part i've changed nothing in my life, i've put all negativity behind me and i'm charting my own course.   I take many nutrients/supplements and a very healthy diet and yes, it is working for me.  Example Tamoxifin - well, I take Indole3/Carbinol.   The molecular makeup is identical, the only difference is Tamoxifin has the added poisons of chemo added.   I take the pure version.  Fucoidan, Bitter Melon, all these now being studied by Sloan Kettering, they realize there is something beneficial for longevity in Cancer patients.....many others, so stay strong and don't let anyone yank your chain, be your own best advocate, I know doctors don't believe it, but they don't know everything, sadly what they do know, they are not allowed to act on, BIG PHARMA standing in the wings with a loaded eradicator!     ",
