She was originally diagnosed in 2001, had a recurrence in 2010, Stage IV diagnosis in June of 2012, and made it almost a year after that. She was a very shy person, never posted much on the forums here but did talk to people individually through PM's. She would never discuss hospice and fought non-stop until she went into kidney failure and slipped into a coma to die in her sleep. Her doctors were hopeful up until the last 24 hours that she may pull through so when she slipped into her coma, she still had hope and I am so thankful for that. Out of the dozen or so ways i thought she could die, I couldn't have asked for any better way than the way it happened. As for the technical details: Mom was getting weaker over the past couple months that she was on Abraxane but was still able to walk around and do things. Her blood counts were always low after Abraxane so she would have to do \"on a week, off a week\" with IV fluids, Nupogen, and Procrit on her off week to get her ready for the next dose. Unfortunately, her last dose proved to be too much as her WBC dropped to 0.3 (normally it never went below 1.8), and her liver enzymes elevated, although not crazy high where the doctors suspected liver failure. She developed an infection in her mouth within a day and despite the multiple Nupogen shots, blood transfusions, and IV fluids she got after being admitted, it proved to be too much for her and the WBC's never went up from 0.3. She was admitted on a Sunday and died Thursday morning at 3:20 AM. This is one of the cases where the chemo killed the patient, not the cancer, but I am thankful that she left this world with hope that she may recover. Her last day, the onc told me he still had his fingers crossed but even if Mom pulled through, he was going to discontinue treatment... that would have devastated her. Anyway, Mom never wanted a funeral or any sorrow type event so we are having an outdoor memorial with a cook-out in her honor this Sunday which ironically is Mother's Day. I set up a little memorial page for her at www.SandyKomarek.org if anyone is interested in it. I will continue to stay active with the forums here to share any knowledge I've gained over the past 12 years and try to help out any way I can. - Paul Mom battled breast cancer for nearly 12 years from Stage IIIA, to Stage II recurrence, to Stage IV mets.
