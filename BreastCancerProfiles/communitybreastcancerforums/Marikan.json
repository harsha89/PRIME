I hope that your follow-up mammogram will show that all is well and you will finally be able to take a deep breath. I'm also still waiting and have other health issues being looked at so I completely understand your worry. MelissaDallas-Thanks for sharing your experience and the info about breast cancer as it has helped reassure me quite a bit. I still have another week and a half to go before I finally get my core biopsy and then another two weeks after that to get pathology results. By biopsy date it will have been almost exactly two months since my abnormal mass was discovered (bi rads 4). After screening mammogram I had to wait four weeks for diagnostic mammogram/ultrasound, and then another four weeks for biopsy.There's no reason for the delay other than being stuck on provincial waitlists. I keep trying to reassure myself that it's very likely benign, but I don't know that for sure.",

I gotcalled back for another appointment after my screening mammogram for a 3D mammogram and ultrasound. After the ultrasound the radiologist told me right then that I needed a biopsy. I had to wait another four weeks for my biopsy appointment but I'm finally having it tomorrow. The radiologist sends the report to your family physician, so your mom should check with her doctor to see if there are any recommendations. I'm in Ontario too and our healthcare system seems to move a lot slower. I hope it turns out that everything is fine with your mother.",
