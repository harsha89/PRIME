The MRI showed the tumor with 4 bright spots surrounding it (the 4 spots turned out to be non-malignant), but it did not show node involvement. During surgery, 4 sentinel nodes were removed and analyzed immediately by a pathologist, who found no cancer cells present, so no further nodes were removed. A more thorough analysis after surgery showed that a micromet (about 0.9mm) was present in one of the nodes. Because of that, I had chemotherapy, when up to that point everyone expected that hormonal therapy would be all that was necessary. So you never really know until the final path report after surgery. And that report is only done on the nodes they have removed... even if those nodes were clear, it is unlikely, but still possible, that cancer cells have migrated to nodes that were left intact.",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2016 09:46PM DiabeticCancerChick wrote: Hi PiNK, To answer your question about whether I was given stronger chemotherapy because of my micromet... I had chemotherapy ONLY because of node involvement. Had there been no sign of cancer cells in my node, chemotherapy would not have been recommended. Also, my rate of cancer cell division (Ki-67) was quite low, and since chemotherapy targets the most rapidly dividing cells, it meant that chemo was of little benefit to me. But node involvement made me do it anyway. As to strength of chemo, well... that's another story. I was originally supposed to have Taxotere-Cytoxan therapy, but my oncologist was on vacation during my \"chemo teach\" (orientation) and first infusion, and during the chemo teach I casually let it be known that I would never, under any circumstances, agree to take dexamethasone. They use dex with every chemo drug, and they decided that the risk of severe edema was too great to allow Taxotere without dexamethasone, so they switched me (under the care of another onc I never met) to Adriamycin and Cytoxan. Adriamycin is cardiotoxic, and has a lifetime limit, since heart damage can appear years and years after taking it. Turns out I was supposed to get 250mg total, but instead I got the lifetime limit of 421mg. So far so good, but we'll see. The moral of my story is: find out exactly what you're getting, if you get chemo, and see if it makes sense. I got a full dose of something that has a small, but not invisible chance of causing permanent heart damage, and the benefit of it is statistically smaller. And I could go on with the screw-ups I experienced during my surgeries, so my advice to you is Pay Attention. Little things like your oncologist being on vacation and another one stepping in are not always little things.",

Anything you do to cause irritation to the area will promote fluid buildup, and it can be really difficult to be aware of movements or exertions that can contribute to that. I had full range of motion right out of surgery, and aside from the first few days, it felt normal to do just about anything I used to do. But time kept marching on with those damn drains still there, and finally I just had to stop opening the refrigerator door so much, taking the garbage out, lifting pots and many other things that are often done unconsciously. My PS said that eventually the fluid WOULD go down, and finally it did. My first two drains came out after a couple of days, during which time I was basically immobile. But it also depends on the individual... some people just take a veeerrry long time to stop making so much fluid.",

The needle that was used on me was one that injected a small amount of Lidocaine before advancing, and although I thought of it as no more than a shot, really, it was the slowest shot I've ever had. I think it's because they wanted to make sure the Lidocaine was taking effect before advancing the needle. So if it hurts, let them know, and waiting a little longer for the Lidocaine to catch up might be just the thing. Fortunately, Lidocaine works immediately in me, and my biopsy was a big fat nothing as far as the experience goes.",
