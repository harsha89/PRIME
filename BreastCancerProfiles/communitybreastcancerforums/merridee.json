I did not want to be part of the breast cancer community, however I did do surgery (double lumpectomy with bilateral reduction) and except for a few fuzzy pain-free days post surgery I have been doing well. From my perspective, the worry and apprehension before the surgery decision was worse than the surgery. I understand your sister's initial decision and I encourage her to reconsider. Best wishes to you, your sister and your family.",
