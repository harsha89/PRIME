      "Content": "mtgirl wrote: When discussing my risk of breast cancer due to family history, I'm always told I have low risk because my mother, aunts, sisters, or daughters have no history. Well, I have NO siblings and only one son. My mother was an only child and had lung cancer. However, my grandmother was one of ten children, and four of her sisters had breast cancer. Sounds pretty risky to me. Should I be pressing the issue? Log in to post a reply",

My sister-in-law was diagnosed four years ago and went for genetics counseling, so I'm going to contact her and move forward with it. Since I just had an abnormal mammogram for the first time and will likely have a biopsy, I will continue to be vigilant no matter what the geneticist tells me, but should any of this be confirmed as bc the genetics would help me make treatment decisions. It had a huge impact on the aggressive treament path my sis-in-law took, and she's a 4-year survivor.",

      "Content": "mtgirl wrote: I try not to buy trouble but this getting overwhelming. I was notified after my mammogram that they found a \"dense area\" in my breast and set me up for an ultrasound. Scary, but the odds are in my favor, right? The next day my doctor's office called and he is referring me to a surgeon to review the results after my ultrasound. This has me completely freaked out. Being a logical individual, I want someone to tell me the percentages.   I just lost my job in a corporate layoff, my husband is disabled, and in a couple of months my insurance will run out. I have some good prospects on a new job, but what would I do if I have to tell them I need surgery/treatment? I have a friend in the final stages of breast cancer, and it has invaded my life far too many times. I feel as though, for the first time in my life, this is just more than I can handle. Please tell me I'm overreacting and that this is all normal procedure in a case like this? Log in to post a reply",

The doctor did say that referral to a surgeon is good practice, because they have experience in interpreting the results and can move forward with a biopsy if indicated. The ultrasound Doc said he feels 98% sure that this is not a cancerous mass, but if it would help me sleep at night we might want to go forward with a biopsy. I will probably do that since I'm NOT sleeping at night (I wonder how he knew that?)  :>)",
