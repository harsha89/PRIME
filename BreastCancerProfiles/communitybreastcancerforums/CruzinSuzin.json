With no history of cancer in our family, to say it's \"surreal\" is far from accurate to describe what I feel at this point.  We are 3 VERY concerned sibs that are offered NO support for any kind of testing from our current doctors.  Can anyone Please tell me what options we have to find out if we are also going to be sick?   Or preventative medicine we can seek?  thanks in advance~ Log in to post a reply",
