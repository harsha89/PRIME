I was very specific and asked my surgeon and chemo doc about all possible sexual side effects . They flat out refused to answer ! My surgeon said ask my nurse and when I asked her she referred me to a sex therapist ! The pharmacist and head nurse at chemo office told me they had never been asked in their combined 20 years of experience and had no idea . Wtf? They new , they just refused to tell me because they knew I would refuse treatment . Now I have permanent nerve damage on the entire right side of my body from the surgeon and it feels like I have been cut in half . I have no good feelings from the waste up in front or back only pain , pressure negative feelings .My biggest problem is inability to feel sensual feeling at all physically . Im 41 and a year out of surgery and have been told the damage is permanat and there is nothing they can do . Im Regret submitting to treatments I knew were wrong for me",
