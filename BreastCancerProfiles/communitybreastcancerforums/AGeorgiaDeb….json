All of you Texas ladies-I enjoy your posts.  I know where Frisco is and you have an amazing Christmas light presentation.  Very cool! Hey Canada girls don't think the US has horrible healthcare-I am paying for this treatment but compared to the cost it is very small.  I am thankful. I have choices and I do NOT want the government to be a part of my health care. Debbie",

I just dread having to go. I should want to get this over with.  But then again none of what I feel lately makes sense.  So far I have 5 treatments under my belt -I have to seee the medical oncologist tomorrow at 8AM.  Another drive on the ice. UGH! I guess I get all the info about Tamoxifen.   Debbie",

I was supposed to be in the Dec rads group but I got a reprieve to see family in Texas over the holidays.  I started the treatment on the 5th.  I found it very clinical.  No warm fuzzies. Not feeling like they care too much -just get her in and go on.  No warm blanket, no suggestions for skin care.  Just a pamphlet about no deodorant, under wire bras, shaving, use mild soap with no perfume, etc.  Like others I have not been advised to do any skin care and I am nervous.   We have been having cold weather and I have dry skin.  I think it is worse because of the chemo.  I want to be proactive on the skin issue.  I asked the RO about it and he said sue aloe vera cream.  Isn't  aloe vera a gel?  does anyone have a recommendation about one with little added ingredients. I think I am sensitive about the skin-I am about 6 weeks out from my last chemo and my body is showing signs of going back to normal.  BUT  2 days before the rads I ate dinner a friend's house.  I ate food I had eaten before and my lip started swelling.  I looked like collagen gone bad!  I think it was the dye in a Christmas napkin.  I  have never been allergic to anything!  Benedryl stopped it but I was a sight.  Bald and big lipped!!  Hot flashes and BO!!  LOL Well I just wanted to get in this group-tried to read all the posts but I started to get mixed up on all the info!  I will keep trying.   Seems like the things to try are Aquaphor, Miaderm and aloe vera. Do any of those natural deodorants help? I don't want o bother spending my money if they don't.  I perspire alot -winter or not and I get stinky!  Might as well wipe the underarms a few times a day. Most of all I am glad to hear from fellow BC folks.  I have been trying to be \"normal\" so I did not take time to read posts.  I really don't have anyone to talk with and I feel like all my friends are tired of it.  Plus I have some other friends who are recently diagnosed with not so great prognoses so I don't want to whine. Sorry to be so long. Debbie",
