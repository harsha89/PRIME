      "Content": "Nov 11, 2015 11:55AM anxiouslywaiting wrote: So sorry I haven't responded to you all. I've been trying to stay away until my 6-month follow up. Thank you so much for being so supportive and amazing. This is a great community. As far as my anxiety goes, I'm doing much better. I've been in intense therapy for the past six months in order to get my health anxiety under control. Unfortunately, I had my six month scans yesterday and now the radiologist wants to do a biopsy. She kind of confused me though. She wrote that I am a BIRADS 4A, which I expected, but that she thinks I'm \"totally fine.\" She asked if I have b.c in my family, I said no (not that that matters a great deal to me. I'm well aware people still get breast cancer with no family history). So, I went back to my surgeon and she had the biopsy scheduled for Thursday. I ended up canceling it so I can get a second opinion. She told me the microcalcs are so scattered that she can't just do the biopsy when I'm awake; that I'll have to go under and she'll have to perform surgery to get them all. But, if they're that spread out, I thought that was, potentially, a good thing? She said that she thinks I'm fine and that I'm \"being followed\" and that's why they're being so extensive because they want to take every measure to risk not being sued. I did some research and she has a malpractice suit against her (patient ended up dying).. so, I'm having my records sent to another surgeon for a second opinion. My mom thinks (I'm 26...and when it comes to stuff like this, I turn into a small child again ha. She's been very helpful) they're being SO thorough because of my anxiety. Anyway, if this new doc says this is the only way to biopsy my calcs, then I'll do it...but if a doc can do it without putting me under, I'd rather go that route. I had surgery a year ago and would rather not go under anesthesia so soon. I don't know. This whole thing has just been really confusing. She said we can either do the biopsy, or get scans every 6months for 2yrs to make sure I'm fine(but she said that, bc of my age, they'd probably just end up doing a biopsy at the end of the 2yrs anyway). If she's saying I can wait another six months for scans, I figure I can wait a week and try to get squeezed in with another doctor for a potentially easier biopsy. I was SO quick to get a second opinion about my mammo, so I feel it's best to get a second opinion regarding a full surgery too. Every scan, magnified mammo, ultrasound, breast exam has come back \"clean\" aside from the microcalcs. No masses or anything. I am trying to not get ahead of myself as, I've learned, for my mental illness, it's best to just...take it day by day. I have yet to decide what I'll do if the biopsy doesn't come back B9. I just keep telling myself that, with Birads4, there's a 70% chance I'll be just fine. If I'm not, a majority of the \"bad\" microcalcs are either ADH or DCIS...trying not to think it's invasive just yet. It's...very frustrating to say the least. I haven't done much googling, as that negatively affects my health anxiety. Any advice regarding biopsies is more than welcome though. I'm not sure what to ask the next doc other than, \"Do I have to be put under?\" I just don't understand why they can't just numb it locally. The surgeon did explain that it's because she could get SOME but not ALL and just because one is b9, it doesn't mean they all are. But, again, why can't this happen when I'm awake? People stay awake for surgeries all of the time. What was supposed to be just a biopsy, turned into me having to go to pre-op to get a chest X-ray, cbc drawn, mammogram, something placed inside of my boob so the surgeon knows where to go, then an hour-long surgery followed by another mammogram. ...which is where I get ALL kinds of confused because they keep telling me, \"I think this is nothing, but it's protocol.\" This seems a bit excessive for \"nothing.\"",

Both biopsies (needle and surgical) require 6month follow up scans. I know myself and I know my anxiety. Even IF they get every last microcalc out of there and they're all benign, I will be scared sh*tless come May. My peace of mind from removing all of them will not last long, because I have anxiety and that's, unfortunately, how it works (\"What if something new popped up?!\"). With that being the case, I'd like to be able to keep the sensation in my nipple (last surgeon said I'd lose some if I went through with the surgery) and be as non-invasive as possible until I absolutely need to go under the knife. Another thing that kind of helped make my decision was looking back on what my last surgeon said. She gave me two options: a surgical biopsy or watching every 6months for two years. I feel like those are extremes on opposite ends of the spectrum. This other surgeon said if I'd like to do a biopsy, I could push for one, but she would also not fight me if I'd rather wait another six months (bc at that point, it will have been one year since my calcifications were originally scanned with no change). A needle biopsy seems to be the best decision. I called John's Hopkins for another opinion a while ago and they recommended a needle biopsy instead of surgical. I guess I'll check back in with ya'll when I get the biopsy results.",

She referred me to the surgeon to do the biopsy. I don't know if she's just not telling me something bc she doesn't want to freak me out or what. All she said was that it's a birads4a. No masses. Probably just fibrocystic changes and that the calcs need to come out. The surgeon said another option is to get scans every 6months for 2yrs, but bc of my age, they'll end up doing a biopsy anyway. I get that they like to be more aggressive when you're younger, but I also know that the stats regarding calcifications aren't really there for women my age bc most don't get mammograms. For all we know, a majority of women my age could have microcalcifications. This is frustrating.. I know the odds are still in my favor, but as you all know, this waiting limbo is rather discouraging and confusing. I just don't understand why they would both tell me that it's likely nothing, just fibrocystic changes, but I can't just have a stereo. biopsy. It has to be surgery. Hopefully this new doctor will help shed some light on all of this. Thank you all for your comments. You guys have been super helpful.",

I really don't want to wait that long. The more I read on this site, the more I'm leaning towards just having the surgery done. I don't want her to miss anything. I keep seeing stories of women saying they had their tissue biopsied and it came back abnormal, then they did the surgery and found DCIS or something invasive. I don't want that to be the case for me. My mom keeps saying to wait the two weeks and go see the new doctor; \"two weeks won't change anything.\" My issue is that I trust my radiologist so much, so if she suggested to the surgeon that this is the only way...I just don't know. I keep allowing other people to get inside of my head. My boyfriend really doesn't want me to have the surgery before getting a second opinion, nor does my mother. So, I don't know if I'm putting it off for myself or for them. I know anesthesia sucks. I know it does a lot to your brain. I know surgery is risky. But, I just have a really bad feeling. I have had it since I began this journey 8 months ago and no one would listen to me because of my age. This isn't a doom-and-gloom, anxiety-induced, \"woe is me,\" kind of feeling. I just...really don't think this is going to end up being benign. I feel it in my gut. I have this whole time. I'm too young to have the calcifications that I have...to have the breast pain and the armpit pain (that has increased steadily over these past six months) all in the same breast that I have the calcifications. I keep telling myself the pain comes when I'm ovulating and then goes away. I'm really trying not to go down the \"C\" road. But it's really hard not to think about how much this will affect my life. I'm only 26. I'm not even engaged yet. I haven't even had the opportunity to think about kids or a wedding. All that seems to be happening right now is me fighting with my mom about what to do and me trying not to feel incredibly guilty for making my boyfriend's life a million times harder. His dad is dying. He doesn't need this too. I know that 80% of biopsies come back benign, but I just really don't think I'm in that category. I guess I just need some advice....do I wait the two week to get the second opinion, or do I go in for the surgery next week and get it done.",

She was much more knowledgeable than the last surgeon (Last surgeon was a general surgeon), even the breast exam itself was much more thorough. She wants to do a needle biopsy first and was borderline pissed that my other doctors suggested surgery first. She even said if it came to surgery, she'd have no qualms doing it with me awake [sedated] (something that I really wanted as I didn't want to go under anesthesia if I didn't have to). But, she said that she thinks I had a fibroadenoma (spelling?) that expanded (which would explain my initial pain when I went to the doctor eight months ago) and then shrunk back down and that when they shrink back down they can leave calcium deposits behind (I no longer have the pain I had 8 months ago...just cyclical, hormonal pain). So, I'm not sure what I should do. Apparently, my scans from my six month waiting period did not change at all.They were identical to the scans I had six months ago. She said she wants to do a needle biopsy followed by a 6month follow up in May. She said, from what she's seeing, the chances of malignancy are incredibly low. So, now I'm just so confused. I don't know what to do. AH. I went in with every intention of almost hating her and just going forward with the full surgery. But, the hospital is THE hospital in the area with some of THE best cancer care. All she does, all day long, is deal with cancer patients. She just seemed like she was much more... well-versed than the other doctor.",

When I had to wait these past six months (we did the watch and wait first. Now, she just wants to biopsy, unfortunately), I just really tried to focus on the \"now.\" It really helped my anxiety. I completely understand when you say this this waiting period made you a different person. It has made me a completely different person. However, I think that part of it has been for the better. When you're petrified of what will happen in six months, you really try to savor every single day. The good thing about getting checked out every six months is that, I think, the worry almost decreases a bit. It's not, \"Oh no...I have to wait another year, 10 months, etc., to find out if something is growing in there.\" It's just, \"Okay. I have 6,5,4,3,2 months to go. I can do this. Until then, I'm going to enjoy right now because, even if I'm as healthy as a horse, I'll never get right now back.\" Do I wish I could simply be a carefree 26yo woman, yes, but life has other plans for me apparently. I'd listen to your docs. I have some unconcerning calcifications in my R breast actually, and I'm not having those biopsied. I'll likely be on a watch and wait for those. As for the other breast, I'm about 95% sure I'm going through with the surgery. The *only* thing keeping me back right now is my fear of how my loved ones will react. They don't want me to do it until I get a second opinion. However, I spoke to my radiologist again today and had her sit down and tell me everything about my scans. Literally everything. She was probably very frustrated ha. I trust her judgement completely. She's been doing this for such a long time. Back in March, for my first mammo, I believe I was something like her 71,111th patient. She comes highly recommended from every single person I've talked to. If she thinks this is the ONLY way to get them all, then I trust her. Unfortunately, they're all different shapes and sizes, which I know isn't ideal. She said it looks like someone took a rock and shattered it inside my breast and that the stereotactic will not be able to get every single one, and she wants them all taken out. After hearing that they're different shapes and sizes, and knowing what that means (no bueno), I can't imagine only having *some* taken out. If they come back benign (fingers.freaking.crossed), I won't be upset I did it because I'll know 100%. If they come back malignant, I would have had to have the surgery anyway to get the rest out. Right now, I just hope my family can respect my decision and support me (and not get frustrated when I get super bitter sometimes about how other girls my age are traveling the world, drinking wine, and simply being in their 20s).",

I was sitting up the whole time, which was great. The women tending to me were incredible. Sore today and some bruising, obviously, but it's the same kind of \"sore\" I feel after a normal mammogram. It basically felt like getting a VERY fast tattoo. After the numbing meds, honestly, the most uncomfortable thing about it was that my leg was falling asleep (can't complain if that's the most uncomfortable part haha). It was a LITTLE confusing (in a good way) because the two radiologists didn't even want to do the biopsy (So, I've had one radiologist and surgeon say that I 100% NEED a full lumpectomy. I had the most recent surgeon say, she'd prefer to wait but will do the biopsy for peace of mind and I have her two radiologists telling me that this is basically ridiculous. My mind was all over the place). I told them my last doctor told me that it looked like a rock was smashed in my breast with all of the calcifications. The two radiologists, mammogram tech, and the nurse were all very angry with my previous radiologist. They showed me the scans. They were like, \"these are SO faint that we can barely see them and are in no distinguishable pattern at all.\" The radiologist said the only reason I'm even at the biopsy point is because another doctor suggested it and I went through nine months of stress and anxiety, so they simply can't turn me away now. She did say if I'd rather not do the biopsy, she'd be 100% okay with it because she said she's almost positive that this is benign and that she hates it when doctors put the fear of God into girls in their 20s. I told her I wish I would have gone to her first, however, considering it's already been nine months, I don't think I can do another six months of waiting. I'd rather just know. Anyway, they said I should have my results on Friday at the latest. I took a Xanax the second I got into the room (which helped greatly. If any biopsy newbies are reading this and do suffer from anxiety, I really recommend it. It made it so much easier). I did end up having someone drive me: My FIANCÉ!! (I got engaged last Thursday). Hopefully, Friday's results will be a wonderful engagement present. Fingers crossed for B9 results and thank ya'll so much for your advice! I'll keep you guys posted.",
