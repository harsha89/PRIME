I have gone thru periods of alot of muscle aches and stiffness and what I have found is that excersise helps out the most. Seems strange that when all you want to do is lie down and rest to force your body to excercise but for me it helps. I also know that the week after my Zometa IV that I am alot stiffer than usual. I also work FT and have more stiffness when I get up from sitting for any period of time.  I try to get in atleast 30 minutes each day of some type of excerise - usually either on the bike or eliptical. I have also started to work with a personal trainer who has given me some great stretching exercises that I can do daily to help loosen up the muscles. Jill",

I am fortunate in that I have only 1 bone met in my left femur and it has been surgically repaired.  I still have a good QOL am able to exercise on a regular basis, which helps reduce the stiffness. It seems odd to exercise when your body is achy and stiff but it seems to help.I will still get stiff if I sit around for any period of time - but after the 1st couple of steps it tends to go away.  I also take Glucosamine on a daily basis to help counter some of the joint pain and stiffness.",

We then went to Mayo and they agreed with the hormonal route. 3 years laters still on hormonals - last 2.5 on Femera. Stable with a very good quality of life and very happy we got other opinions.",

Have been on Femera now for 2 years and liver mets continue to shrink and tumor markers are in normal range. Also take Xgeva for the bone mets and have not had any progression since the original met in my femur. I also have not had any chemo and quality of life has been very good on the hormonals. I do have some bone and joint pain but have found that exercise helps reduce that side effect. My oncologist has told me that when Femera fails we would just transition to another AI drug unless for some reason he felt that the cancer had changed and become more aggressive. I am hoping for a very long run on the AI's.  ",

I started with Tamoxifen and has some complications with Fatty liver and switched to Femera. Femera has done a good job of keeping me stable and shrinking the liver mets. Once I was stable the doctor recommended a lumpectomy and lymph node removal which I had in March along with a ooph. The surgery went well and I definitely feel better knowing that the primary source of my cancer is out of my body. Good Luck",
