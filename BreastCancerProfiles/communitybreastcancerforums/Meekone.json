I had rather large breast, I believed immediately before speaking to any doctor that I would be left disfigured in the event that I selected lumpectomy.  I can honestly say that while I believed that I had beautiful breast before......LOL, I didn't want to morn the loss of one of them while holding onto the other.  Also, my diagnosis was made because I pushed the doctors to test me, they resisted due to my age, also had they listened to me earlier I would have been diagnosed two years ago.  So add the fear of believing something would go untreated or undiscovered in the healthy breast with the combination of knowing that modifications would have needed to be preformed in order to make them match and that wasn't anything I was willing to consider.  To this day I have not morned them being amputated, to me it is what it is!  I think always looking back at the \"healthy\" one would have depressed me and possibly messed with my self esteem.  I think that BMX was the best decision for me and I am so at peace with it, truly have not ever looked back.  The decision to do one thing over the other, to accept one treatment over the other, to use one doctor over the other is so personal and so situation specific........not at all easy!  Good luck to anyone out there struggling with these decisions, for me it is not over........getting ready to discuss Chemo regimens.  Walking into this I also had concerns about radiation (as others may remember).  I was very happy to learn that after my surgery and my pathology report showed clear margins and no node involvement my BS agreed with me that Radiation was not necessary and that it should not be taken just because of my age.  For me and I am sure for so many other ladies out there, Knowledge is a very strong tool and is irreplaceable!  Good luck to everyone out there still in the process of making the hard decisions......you have to do what you believe is truly in the best interest for you and what will help you to ensure that this beast is not allowed to continue in your life!",
