And really, why are there stages?  Either you have cancer or you don't.  It's like being a little pregnant!",

It is a wealth of information, both good and bad. I'm trying to just think of it as cancer and not focus so much on the numbers but the details are what's scaring me. I go from \"she is going to fight this and win\" to \"Oh God, I need to sell my house, quit my job and move back in with my parents to help them.\" I'm all over the place and questioning everything. How does she go from getting normal mammograms every year to stage 3 breast cancer? Why wasn't this caught sooner if they tell us it probably started over 5 years ago? Sorry for venting a little...just on cancer info overload!",

We went back to the surgeon, he put her on an antibiotic and opened her incision to clean and pack it. I was ok with that and when she met with him today, he said everything is looking good. However, she had her pet scan last saturday. The oncologist hadn't called her with the results yet so she asked the surgeon today if he got a copy. He reviewed them with her and something showed up on her one vertebrae. He said it looks like arthritis to him but the oncologist will have to review it. We don't go see him until April 4th. Instead of getting easier, it feels like things keep getting harder and harder. I'm beyond the point of scared and worried. I feel like if I breathe wrong something else will come up. I don't know how much more I can take. Thanks for letting me get this out.",

      "Content": "danlias wrote: Hello, I'm not sure where to start. Within the past week...We found out my mom's cancer has spread to her bone marrow and it has made her platelet numbers plummet. The problems with the blood had put so much strain on her heart that she had a mild heart attack. We knew nothing about the heart attack until we took her to the ER because she became so weak and wasn't eating. First they found the heart attack and then we got the results from the biopsy done the week before. Double Whammy. The problem is, neither can be treated. The heart has too much blockage but they can't do open heart surgery because her bloodwork numbers are so low. Her bloodwork numbers are so low because of the cancer. The cancer can't be treated because chemo would do more damage than good. Hormone therapy might still be an option but all the meds and IVs they have been treating her with have elevated her liver number a little bit and because her oncologist is an hour away and they don't want to move her, we have to work with a (new to us) oncologist that can treat her in the hospital she's at now. I think we all saw the cancer metastasis diagnosis coming but the heart thing has thrown a wrench into all of our plans and now it seems like we are all out of options. The doctors are talking to us about palliative care tomorrow and my head is spinning. This is all coming way too fast. I'm not even sure what I'm asking but I've been on and off of these discussions boards since my mom was first diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago and it just feels like a place where I can share what we're going through. If anybody has any other ideas or treatments we can try, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for listening, Danlias Log in to post a reply",
