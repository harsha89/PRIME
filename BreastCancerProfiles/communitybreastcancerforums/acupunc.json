In the meantime, I scheduled a 2nd opinion with another breast surgeon, but she can't see me till October 11.  I started freaking out, thinking that will be 5 weeks since the original diagnosis, meaning I might not have surgery for another week or so.  But after reading these comments, I am relaxing and realizing that patience is one of the lessons here....and as we used to say in the Sixties, \"go with the flow.\"  (And also be suitably assertive about following up on appts.)  It is amazing how people's vacations delay test results, isn't it???  Good luck, Amy!  We're all in it together.  Donna",
