The second one was painful. We took a break, another local and the third biopsy. They put the clips in mark the areas. I didn't expect the post biopsy mammogram. I guess it was fine since I was so numb but really?? What I also didn't expect was the US tech telling me it would be fine because she didn't see anything. That's twice she's said that and *shockingly* the Doctor has come in and showed her the areas of concern. Why are people like that?? Took the day off of work & enjoying an ice pack. Trying to make it to Thursday afternoon when the results will be in.",

They called me back as they saw a density. Had a second mammogram and ultrasound 6/13. Radiologist said he isn't comfortable giving the all clear as the density remains and my family history is \"scary.\" (Mom had two types of breast cancer and diagnosed at age 52, Grandma, Aunt, 1st cousin diagnosed in early 40's and a second cousin - all on my Mom's side. My Dad is Eastern European Jewish and has prostate cancer. Even he isn't doing me any favors....). Had a MRI 6/18 and received the call today that they found an additional area of concern. I wanted to vomit. Going back for another ultrasound and possible biopsy 6/25. Realized I have never received any of the reports and not happy that I received the MRI results from someone in the office....not the doctor. What? Who does that? The radiologist who read the MRI will be doing the ultrasound on Tuesday. I don't think I'm comfortable not doing a biopsy. Otherwise I think I'll worry until the next mammogram and wondering if I did the right thing. I'm also waiting for the results of the BRCA testing. Trying to keep busy so I make it through the coming days. Sick of everyone telling me not to worry. And if I hear the words \"oh, I can only imagine\" one more time.....I started reading this site and you all know. You get it. Just needed to vent to a group who understand. Wish we all didn't though. Hugs to all who are in the same boat. Log in to post a reply",

I came to work today and just feel so unfocused, which is so unlike me. I know I have good reason to not mentally be with it but it's frustrating. Keeping a sense of humor about all this is kind of getting old....the waiting is just miserable. Plus I have this ridiculous hot pink sports bra on today....and I'm sore as heck. I took some Advil but it's not helping much. I'm supposed to call in tomorrow afternoon and get my results. Is this how it's done elsewhere?",
