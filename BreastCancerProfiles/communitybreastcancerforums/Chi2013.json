The waiting is so difficult, especially with the lure of the internet right at your fingertips. I'm a 36 year old mom to a 9 month old and I feel so horrible that this is taking over me mentally. I should be focused on her and yet I keep thinking of the negative and how a diagnosis would affect our family. Any advice on how to get through the waiting? Log in to post a reply",
