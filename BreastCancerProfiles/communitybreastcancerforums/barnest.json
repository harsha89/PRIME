You can read my whole story under \"What the ????\" in the forum. But Im wondering could this be what I have. He did mention that he thought it was scar tissue but im wondering if this is what it is and should I actually have it removed. Please read my post on the other forum and tell me what you think. This is so inlighting. Thanks.",

Make sure you go to your appt prepared with questions that you want answered. I didnt and I had so many questions after I left. Ladies our age tend to get blown off a bit so make sure that the doc understands all of your concerns.  Make sure that when all is said in done you know what is inside of you. I still dont know and I had a core needle biopsy.  So I will keep going til I know what it is.  They may try to tell you what it might be but just tell them you want to KNOW exactly what it is. Hopefully you will be seeing a surgion tha specializes in breast issues but if not just make sure the doc explains everything to you until you are 100% satisfied. There are more b9 lumps then malignant ones so with that and your age the odds of you NOT having cancer are in your favor. But, from experience, its best to KNOW what it is for sure.",
