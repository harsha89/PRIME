I originally hoped for a lumpectomy so I could breastfeed in the future. This is so personal so I don't want to sway you but just to give my opinion: if I had the option, I would have opted for a lumpectomy. You can preserve the functionality/sensation of your breasts, and lumpectomy + radiation has been shown to be equally effective. The surgery is easier to recover from. Mastectomy is a longer surgery with more recovery & more long-term issues, disrupts your lymphatic system more which increase your chances of developing lymphadema, and if you choose to have reconstruction you may need multiple surgeries to complete that process. Mastectomy is not reversible so it's not like you can go back & change your mind... whereas with a lumpectomy you could always choose to have the mastectomy down the line.  Reasons I might lean toward mastectomy instead: If you have a family history and/or BRCA+, if you're at high risk for recurrrence for some other reason, if you need to try to avoid radiation for medical reasons, and the biggest reason -- if you just feel in your gut that mastectomy is best for you. Such a hard decision & hopefully you will get a bit more info before you need to make a final decision! Did you have an MRI? Do you have some idea of the tumor size? Did you get genetic testing or do you have any family history of BC?",

      "Content": "May 17, 2013 12:05PM - edited May 17, 2013 12:07PM by indenial I never even considered reconstruction, it was never an option in my mind. Outfield's list covers most of my reasons. I think my biggest one is just not being comfortable having anything fake/foreign/man-made as part of my body -- not just having implants (which totally freaks me out, to be perfectly honest!) but also just having my body artificially... sculpted? Can't think of quite the right word. I guess like you said, just being closest to how God made me. Another big reason is not wanting to have any extra surgeries -- extra risks, extra time away from my family, more pain, more complications, etc.  My breasts were never particularly important to me appearance-wise... I had nice breasts, they looked great in some clothes, but other times I was frustrated with not being able to wear certain clothes because they didn't look right with my relatively large-ish chest. Plus they got in the way, and I hated wearing a bra. For me the real value of my breasts was being able to breastfeed. If I couldn't have breasts that would allow me to nurse my children, feel sensation, etc. then I just didn't see the point of having fake ones. They would be purely for others' benefit, just to look at. That's not me, and I was not willing to go through the extra surgeries just to look good for someone else. I am who I am, take me as I am.  And there is a very very personal reason too that I'm not sure I've ever shared and I'm a bit reluctant to, I've never heard anyone else have this reason... I was sexually abused and my breasts were one target of that abuse. It was very emotionally freeing to know that without breasts, no one could hurt me that way ever again. I don't know if this is a \"good\" reason or a \"crazy\" one but I had enough other reasons not to reconstruct that I don't spend much time trying to figure it out. ",

I have a lot of online resources for breastfeeding, as well as breastfeeding after biopsy or surgery, and have not found even one good reference to titanium markers and breastfeeding. From what I've read, though, it seems it would be safe -- the marker is very very small, and I've never heard of anyone with titanium in their body (knee replacement or clips or anything else) being warned not to breastfeed.

Your body will adapt to your child's needs, whether you use one breast or two.

I didn't think I had it in me to handle one more thing! Plus, being very naturally-minded, everything involved with cancer treatment (even just taking a Tylenol!) really freaked me out. I would encourage you to research as much as possible, so you can make informed decisions. I also want to suggest that you don't worry about saying \"yes\" or \"no\" to chemo, radiation, etc., but just say \"maybe.\" And commit to learning the risks/benefits so you are making a decision out of knowledge & empowerment rather than fear & exhaustion. I won't lie, none of this is easy, and honestly the mental part has been much worse than the physical for me. I don't know if that's due to my pre-existing mental issues or maybe it's like that for others too. Make sure to put your mental health at the forefront, it's just as important as the physical. I ended up having a bilateral mastectomy & doing chemo, I only have one treatment left now! A lot of it has turned out to be easier than I'd envisioned. The unknown is scary and the way these things are portrayed in the media makes them seem even worse!

My whole family qualified for Medicaid before Obamacare but they lowered the limits. And I'm only in my 30s so I can't get Medicare. I'm very concerned about building up a nest egg for my child's care once I'm gone, so I want to put everything in savings, but then we'd be over the $2000 asset limit.

So MRI is not definitive, and I think biopsy is the only way to know for sure. You could see what the MRI shows and then make your next move based on that. Oh also find out how much the MRI will cost if finances are a concern. AFTER insurance paid their share I still owe $2000! Biopsy might be cheaper, especially if you think you'd ultimately want the biopsy no matter what the MRI shows. ",

The spot on my rib was found on the first scan but for some reason he didn't tell me about it until months later when he wanted to repeat the scan? I actually stopped tamoxifen a couple months ago but apparently the spot was there while I was still on it. The biopsy is scheduled for Friday.

It kind of feels swollen, but I am not the type to ever actually swell up (for any reason) and it's not at all visible. I can feel it though, like a tightness and achiness, and it seems to happen more often when I've had lots of blood draws on that side or overdone it with daily activities.  It's hard to tell because it's my dominant hand, plus I already had some carpal-tunnel-type issues for the last few years so I might just be imagining things! I also thought that not only would LE be more likely on the SNB side, but also higher up my arm, not in my hand?? Is this true, or a misconception? I did meet with the LE therapist once after surgery and am supposed to go back once more sometime in the next month or two so she can teach me some lymph massage... so I will ask her too if warranted. Also, she prescribed a compression sleeve for my left arm (just in case I ever need it) but I'm wondering if I should be getting a hand gauntlet too, and/or if I should be getting one for the right side instead/in addition, or can I use it on both sides interchangably (my measurements were symmetrical)...

And people have been surprisingly good about not commenting or acting weird or anything. It's not so bad, but I will be glad when I have hair again one day!  That's my really long way of saying, go ahead & do it tonight... make it fun if you can, but don't feel bad if you'd rather do it quickly, or privately, like I ended up doing once my son cut off a piece for me.

I find her ideas & suggestions to be very on-target with other research I've done and consistent with what some great therapists recommend. I strongly believe in giving kids as much factual information as they want and using real terminology. I found that the things my son most needed to hear were that cancer is not contagious and that the doctors and medicines would work hard to help my body fight it... He also really benefitted from simplified descriptions of each procedure/treatment I've had as well as pictures (mastectomy pictures, post-surgery recovery pics, pictures of bald women, people getting IV's, etc.) to take the mystery out of it. I involve him as much as I can, too -- he visited me in the hospital several times, he comes to some of my doctor's appointments, he watches me have blood drawn, he helped me clipper my hair...  LeslieFay & Schoenme, I hope you can get all your questions answered! I think it sounds more complicated than it is. For me, the only thing I had to take was the steroid the day before, day of, and day after. Everything else is just based on whatever side effects you have, which is different for everyone. They will prescribe nausea meds and you can write on the bottle what they are for so you don't get confused. You can also get meds for sleep &/or anxiety if you want. For constipation you can take colace, miralax, senakot, etc. For diarrhea, Immodium. For acid issues, Pecid or Zantac. Some of us take glutamine to ward off neuropathy as well as mucositis (inflammation/ulcers in mouth & digestive tract). Maybe you can make yourself a little chart? I was tempted to stock up on every med I might need but there is a 24-hour pharmacy less than 10mins down the road. You probably won't need half of those anyway. First round I took the steroids, preventative colace, glutamine, and a couple of nausea pills. That's it. Next round I will add in something for acid/heartburn. You'll figure it out as you go along and hopefully won't have too many side effects!  I'm on day 15 now and my head hair (umm... stubble I mean!) is finally starting to fall out. TMI but day 13 I started losing lots of pubic hair, yuck! Eyelashes have been slowly falling out since chemo day but I still have a lot left. Nose hairs are gone. All other hair... you know, the hair I'd actually WANT to get rid of.. is hanging on! I also find I have been super irritable, PMS-like, the last 2-3 days. Period isn't due for another week or so and I'm curious to see if it will arrive as scheduled (kind of hope it doesn't because I'm not sure if I can handle menstrual cramps along with chemo round 2!!) Feels like something is up hormonally... the irritability and other stuff is just not quite normal for me. ",

The worse I'm feeling physically, the worse I feel about my appearance! Going to church last weekend bald (well, with a scarf) with weird acne, no breasts, a huge swollen face, and that rash all over my body, plus still on my period, was probably one of my lowest points  body-image-wise. Ugh, it was so hard not to just run out of there!! I stayed home the rest of the day and it wasn't just because I wasn't feeling great but more because I couldn't stand the thought of going out in public like that! I've had some serious body image issues all my life but never let it stop me the way I did this week. Oh well. I am back to being OK for the time being.  Jen, LOL! I keep meaning to stash a spare scarf in my car because I just know one day I will leave without one! I don't mind walking around bald at home/in my yard and have even ventured out around my neighborhood a bit... but I'm not ready for anyone else (anyone I know!) to see my ugly bare head. Except kids under the age of 6 (they are very accepting) lol. I take my scarf off when I'm babysitting if it gets too warm/itchy and the kids are so cute about it. :) Speedy, YAY for halfway done and hurray for a vacation to look forward to! I'm hoping to get away once I'm done chemo too but waiting to actually book something because I'm not sure when I'll feel up to traveling.  Gardengirl! I looked up pictures of that rash you have and it looks horrible! I'm so sorry! So they think it's somehow chemo-related? I didn't end up going to the doctor for my rash but did call at least 4 times... looking back, I should have gone to the ER because I was in the early stages of anaphylaxis but fortunately my mega-doses of antihistimines stopped it from getting too dangerous! I have my pre-chemo appt. today and curious to talk to my MO about what he thinks caused it. The nurse said he thought it may be a reaction to the meds I was taking to stop my menstrual bleeding! It ended up lasting 5 days (the hives & swelling, that is) but has finally subsided. I really hope it was that med because if it was chemo then I am really scared for round 3. Thinking I need to get an epipen, this isn't the first time I've had an unexpected/new horrible allergy but definitely the worst. I hope your rash improves.

And a couple of other times I had some minor blurriness but figured it was just dry eyes plus allergies. I wear glasses and most days I can see just fine so I'm not really worried about it.  Eyebrows & eyelashes - I started losing them almost immediately after round 1 so they are A LOT thinner, but only noticable to me since a lot of them are still there. One eyebrow is missing most of the outer edge though. I guess glasses are coming in handy disguising it! I'm still surprised how much hair I have overall actually. I'm not totally bare anywhere, super thin up top (and wearing it shaved) and minimal armpit & pubic hair but still have tons of leg hair & haven't lost any hair elsewhere (like the fine hair on my arms & chest).  I had round 3 yesterday... the good news is that the allergic reaction I had doesn't seem to be from the Taxotere. So that's a relief! Probably was due to the other med I was taking for heavy bleeding (my period finally stopped after 22 days, yay!) Infusion was otherwise not too eventful... I got my favorite roommate, and she requested that we share a room next time for my last infusion so we can celebrate together. :) So sweet. She has been having chemo weekly for a long time & probably will never be \"done\" but has such a great attitude & cracks me up!! I had some issues with vital signs, of all things. At the beginning my heart rate was really high & erratic. The med assistant was freaking out but my nurse just said, \"Oh, don't worry, she's always like that.\" Umm... this nurse has only met me once! So I'm not sure how she knows that and I wasn't very reassured. They ended up starting the infusion anyway (not sure the point of taking vitals if they are just going to do the infusion no matter what) and I ended up privately having a bit of a panic attack for a while but once the Benadryl kicked in I calmed down. Then at the end I had 1 minute left of Cytoxan and they decided to take my blood pressure before removing the IV for some reason (on the same arm, just about the IV site). OW it hurt so much!! They were scrambling to find the Stop button but couldn't find it so I ripped the cuff off! Next time I will insist they remove the IV before doing vitals! Definitely feeling this round a bit more, tired & achy & crampy... also forgot to take my morning colace before infusion and apparently that dose is crucial, first time I've gotten stopped up since starting chemo. Oops. Also having high anxiety still. I'm mostly camping out on the couch today & every time I get up my heart rate shoots up & I get a little short of breath and lightheaded. Not to a worrisome degree but enough to feed my anxiety even more. UGH. I am very tempted to ask for a prescription for Ativan or something but I spent so much of my life on anxiety meds that I'm reluctant to depend on them anymore and worried about withdrawal and stuff. But I'm kind of miserable feeling like this. Also feel like I need a really good cry but every time tears start to well up I just can't seem to let myself really cry.  Just have to get through the weekend & remember I'll probably be on the upswing (especially mentally) by Monday. Oh man now I really want to cry. :(",

So I am not sure if it makes sense to me to take the Ativan to avoid anxiety now when I know it will catch up to me when I stop the meds. I am on the fence and only have one round of chemo left but will see how I feel over the next couple days. OK guys don't laugh but... the mild shortness of breath I had, the pains, the tight chest? I finally figured out it was due to gas! I feel kind of silly now, don't know why I didn't recognize it as gas! I didn't have gas issues the last 2 rounds, not sure why I do this time around. But peppermint tea, some yoga, and a warm bath & now I'm feeling much better. Thought I'd mention it on the off chance anyone else has this issue.  Ahhh having a hot flash now. Fun. LOL.",

Fortunately I'm done with surgery but now I have to see a new BS for all my followups. Also there is a NP who covered for my MO once & I discovered I LOVED her... well I guess she is leaving too. So I'm just stuck with my MO who I'm not crazy about. He's nice enough but may be the least reassuring doc I've ever met in my life. I'm kind of terrified of him. I went today for my pre-chemo appt. He asked me about all my symptoms and seemed interested/concerned but didn't actually SAY anything. Not, \"Oh that's normal, don't worry about it,\" or, \"That's concerning, let's keep an eye on it,\" or \"Take XYZ to help with that.\" He just asked me my side effects and silently examined me and said, \"See you in a month, we'll start you on Tamoxifen.\" (He has never discussed Tamoxifen with me, or anything else for that matter -- I get all my info from the internet or the nurse navigator.) He & I just don't seem to communicate well at all. I wish he'd talk to me!!! I keep thinking he's not talking because he secretly knows I am worse off than I think I am. :( OK that sounds paranoid huh? Well anyway. Not sure why I'm rambling on but you've definitely got my sympathy! But suppress the teenage urges & speak to her LOL because you'd really only be punishing yourself if you didn't! Also, since the MO is the one it seems you'll be dealing with the longest, maybe this is a good time to insist they get you in with a different one who you'll be comfortable seeing long term? ",

If so, call the MO, you might need oral antibiotics. And is there a possibility you have some unrelated illness going on, with the sinus headache? Maybe this isn't a direct effect of chemo itself but just bad timing to have caught a bug. Even with Neulasta I think you could still have low counts and be more susceptible to illness & infection. And my final thought is, if you are taking lots of different meds for various side effects, they can leave you feeling kind of yucky. I definitely feel much more \"sick\" whenever I need narcotics, or high doses of pain relievers, or steroids, or OTC pills... I don't know if that happens to everyone or I'm just weird but I now try to avoid meds as much as possible and once anything I take has flushed out of my system I feel so much better & more human. ",

I was really frustrated the first couple of weeks post-final-chemo because I thought I'd magically feel wonderful but it does take time to recover. It still takes the 2-3 weeks for your blood levels to bounce back and about that same length of time to start to feel human again. Today I am 5 weeks PFC and feeling better than ever. I wasn't healthy in the years before breast cancer (I know many of you were so this may have been harder on you) but now I feel more energized, stronger, healthier, all around better than I have in over 7 years! I feel like I have my life back! Chemo \"reset\" me somehow. Anyway, most of my lingering side effects are already gone (neuropathy was mild but has basically disappeared in the last week!) I still have to pace myself because I am tending to overdo it & I need to remember to rest more frequently. But I feel great! I hope this is encouraging for those just finishing or still in the middle of it! My eyebrows are still very very sparse and a mess. Eyelashes are thinned too. But my other body hair has been growing slowly, & I've shaved twice. Head hair is a slow process. There is finally a bit of stubble in most of my bald spots (front/top of my head, where it's thinnest) and the rest of my head has about 1/4\" that hasn't really grown much but it's filling in around it. My hair was normally dark brown/black and is coming in kind of colorless/gray with a bit of black mixed in. It looks weird and I am still wearing scarves most of the time but did get some headbands that I will probably switch to in a week or two just because it's so HOT and really, everyone already knows my head looks ridiculous so I'm not sure why I bother \"hiding\" it with a scarf! At any rate, it's exciting to see some growth, I recommend taking pictures every couple of days so you can see your progress, otherwise it feels like nothing is happening! ",

I really needed something snug-fitting to feel comfortable and to avoid having my shirt rub against my incisions and the severed nerves. I wore that band every day for about a month, and then on & off for another month or two (whenever I had swelling or pain). I have not worn a bra since my surgery though. I just wear regular shirts with nothing under them. I find ribbed tanks are especially comfortable, and I do not like camis with built-in shelf bras. I am also more sensitive to certain fabrics/textures now. ",

(A little worried because all the good veins were in my off-limits arm!)  Had my chemo teaching a week or two ago. It was an hour+ long session with the Nurse Navigator, listening to all the horrible side effects and how to deal with them and stuff. It actually wasn't too bad, and I felt really prepared with all the reading I'd done, so I didn't have many questions. I also got a tour of the infusion floor... not crazy about it, so dismal! Glad I'll only be going there 4 times. :)  Sunday1856 - I hear you about being a burden to friends & family! I have zero family support (aside from my husband and my young son), but I do have a small but amazing group of friends. However, they are all going through really serious struggles of their own. It's hard to accept help from them and even harder to actually reach out for it. I'm not sure how that will go during chemo. Guess I'm hoping to be one of the lucky ones who are able to work right through (\"work\" in my case means parenting my intense son without help, I'm a stay-at-home/homeschooling mom). People from my church have also offered to bring meals but I have some food restrictions & feel like it may be asking too much of them. I don't know... I have been trying to decide when to shave my head and I think I'll do it immediately after my first treatment. I don't want to give it a chance to fall out on its own. I'm almost tempted to shave it before the first round just in case I'm too sick to do it after, but I just don't think I have the guts to do it! Next thing I want to work on is deep-cleaning the house (hard right now since I'm still recovering from my BMX) and freezing some meals. ",

It brings a smile to my face & hope to my heart. :) I'm only 1 day post-chemo but here's my experience so far for those who haven't started yet & want a play-by-play: This week - started l-glutamine, swish & swallow 10mg 3x/day to help with mouth/stomach issues and neuropathy. Stopped all my other vitamins & supplements. Day before -- took steroids with dinner (I'm only on half-dose of steroids) -- they made me \"high\" and I actually loved it lol, got so much done & was in a great mood & not anxious! I didn't sleep all night though, only got about 3 hours in the early morning, and they also gave me very mild heartburn. (Oh, and I started taking colace the night before & will continue for several days.) Day of -- IV benadryl made me drunk & sleepy. Also got more steroids, Pepcid for acid reflux & Aloxi for nausea, stays in your system for 3-4 days & I haven't had to take a single nausea pill yet! Took a long walk when I got home. Was really wiped out by evening, but had to take another dose of steroids which made it hard to sleep. I did sleep, but very fitfully with long stretches of awake time. Mild heartburn again from the steroids.  Day 1 post-chemo -- woke up feeling pretty good, took my son on errands & to story time. I don't really have any symptoms, just kind of sleepy (probably from the lack of sleep itself, not the chemo!) Not very hungry but that's not really unusual for me, I tend to be an erratic eater lol. No nausea or mouth sores or anything yet. My digestive system is a bit off -- I think the meds made my body \"forget\" how to go -- like my lower part of my digestive tract is kind of paralyzed? Probably the Aloxi which is related to Zofran (I had the same effect from Zofran post-surgery) so I'm keeping up the colace & staying patient. No major discomfort. If the steroids do such a great job at warding off reactions & side effects, I wonder why they don't just have us take them for a week+ straight??? I'm tempted to experiment! But I won't... not yet at least. ;) I shaved my head last night since I was feeling good. Wanted to take care of that well before any started falling out. I'm not sure what I think. It's not horrible but looks weird to me. I also thought I'd feel like a \"cancer patient\" once I shaved my head, but I don't. I just feel like me, minus hair. It was very unemotional for me. Sleeping on stubble was annoying -- every time I moved my head I got a pins & needles sensation that woke me up. I grabbed a hat & that helped a ton (even though it felt a bit too warm!) so... sleep with a hat if you have stubble! I managed to go in public this morning with just a scarf and only had one person stare. It wasn't as bad as I anticipated, most people just acted friendly & normal, & I'm glad I got it over with. ",

I took none for the first 4 days (had no nausea and the Aloxi I got at infusion was supposed to stay in my system 3-4 days anyway) but since then have found myself needing to take something. I'm worried about taking it too often/too long. The nausea isn't intolerable but my appetite has gotten worse and I can no longer tolerate the glutamine I was taking and I'm drinking less water because it irritates me. I also have stomach pains for a few hours after eating. Worried that the nausea meds are going to make things worse (more stomach pains, constipation, etc.) I'm on day 6 today.  ",

I am only 30 years old so even if my risk of local recurrence is only 1-2% per year, that's 50-100% by the time I'm 80! I don't ever want to deal with this again, and bilateral didn't eliminate my risk but it did drastically reduce it. Plus I did not want to go through the anxiety of bi-annual mammograms and MRI's for the rest of my life, I just couldn't take the stress of it. Also, I had multifocal cancer (all in one breast but multiple tumors) so I had to have a mastectomy (vs. lumpectomy) on the cancer side and was not interested in reconstruction and felt that bilateral would make me more comfortable phsyically, emotionally, and appearance-wise. I definitely felt like bilateral was the right decision for me (and am also very happy with my decision to forego reconstruction).",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2013 03:21PM - edited Apr 17, 2013 03:22PM by indenial PamelaKay, welcome! Good idea on having people cook in your kitchen with your food. I don't know that it would really work in our situation but it sure seems safer! My friend picked some food for us up the other day and I ended up having to call the restaurant to check the ingredients. Wish I didn't have to worry about reactions on top of everything else, it's just one more stressor! On the plus side, I'm doing amazingly well with side effects so we haven't been struggling too much with getting meals together ourselves. Someone is also giving us a grocery gift card so that will let us buy some frozen dinners/convenience foods that would normally be out of our budget.   As far as the antiemetics, I found I preferred not to take them unless I needed them. The first few days I still had Aloxi in my system from the IV and after that wore off I was only mildly nauseous a few times & took the milder of the 2 nausea drugs I had. I'm surprised I wasn't really nauseous -- I had a million times more nausea post-surgery than post-chemo! The antiemetics have their own side effects... for me Zofran causes really extreme constipation... so taking it prophylactively would not only treat a side effect I didn't really have, but also cause extra side effects. (By the way if you react to the meds like I do then it may be helpful to take a stool softener with any doses of antiemetics.) I would recommend taking the drugs at the very first sign of nausea though -- don't wait it out & see if it subsides, just take something the minute you start to feel a bit off. They do work pretty quickly and you can also get the ones that dissolve under your tongue which kick in even more quickly and are easier to get down if you are too queasy to drink/swallow.",

I want to get some slippery elm lozenges for round 2, this might be something to try -- I used them once before BC and think they'd be perfect for this type of discomfort. Dede - Glad to hear that chemo #2 has brought more manageable SE's! I also feel like an imposter. This whole experience is so surreal to me.  Carol - No port for me, I think my veins are holding up well so far for bloodwork etc., but my chemo vein is pretty bruised, hoping it will be OK by next week! Some body hair started falling out day 13 & head hair day 15. Today is day 17 and I looked like I had mange with the super short buzz cut so I finally shaved it down to the scalp. It still looks weird, totally bald patches and dark patches where the follicles are still in tact and then a few stubbly patches that the razor just couldn't get. It looks gross but feels so much better... who knew hair loss could be so painful!! My one piece of advice to anyone who hasn't faced the hair loss yet is, go somewhere to get it shaved to the scalp before it starts falling out. I thought I was \"safe\" with just stubble but it was horrible shedding everywhere & I wish I had shaved it sooner or at least shelled out the money for a professional to do it because I'm horrible at shaving!",

It's something about the changes in hormones that causes them, and like I said above, I think steroids makes them even worse for some reason. If anything it's probably a sign that chemo IS working, at least on the hormones! If it's lymphoma then why would it happen to over half of us going through chemo? (On another note, I'm glad I'm not the only one that jumps to the worst-case scenarios, yesterday I convinced myself that some very slight swelling in my neck was lymphoma! Maybe chemo side effects just happen to mimic lymphoma symptoms????) Kerri, I got the acne bumps too, I attribute it to the steroids, it was worst the first round (although second round I also had folliculitis on my scalp which was much worse but overall a similar rash). Hydrogren peroxide or white vinegar seemed to soothe & dry it out more quickly. And... you will get through the rest of the treatments. I seem to have had sooo many side effects too but I've made it through 3 rounds & have my last next week. Definitely Ativan is helping me through these last rounds because now I am a nervous wreck about the zillion side effects I had round 2 (which fortunately didn't happen with round 1 or 3 so I'm a bit calmer even without the Ativan!)  Daffy, I'm so sorry about your news, I can only imagine how I'd feel in your shoes. At least the chemo seems to be working if it was indeed mets... which hopefully means 10+ years might be realistic? You must be a basket case. HUGS and love to you.",

Has anyone else experienced post-infusion depression? I felt this last time around days 3-5 but this time it is much, much worse. I know a big part of the problem is I have so little support. For some reason I expected everyone to rally around me throughout chemo -- bring food, offer to babysit, help me clean, etc. Instead, I was taking care of my kid alone yesterday (today my husband is home at least!) and we are eating crap food and I just feel so very alone. I have 2 friends who are usually very helpful but neither is able to be around right now (for very good reasons) and the other friends have disappeared. We have no family support. My husband is totally floundering and I cannot be supportive to him because I'm too wrapped up in my own discomfort & misery. I really tried to line up some support for him (and for all of us, for that matter) but apparently my efforts have failed and we are on our own. In addition to the lack of support, all of a sudden the reality of all of this is hitting me. I'm sitting here with tears streaming down my face realizing I will never be able to breastfeed again. Minor to some, maybe, but it has been central to my parenting. And I may not even be able to have anymore kids anyway, and no one wants to adopt to a parent with cancer. This is all so depressing. I don't know if it's the chemo or the steroids or feeling so hurt about my friends abandoning me or just the reality of cancer hitting me all at once, but I am so, so down. I just want to say I'm done with cancer & get up and walk away and have my life go back to normal. To be honest, 'normal' wasn't really much better than this, but this sucks. ",

I am so sorry for what you are dealing with, for your husband's illness, and his losses... I can't imagine how much more that complicatest things, emotionally & practically.  I am worried about early menopause too... Being only 30 means we weren't prepared for this AT ALL, I mean we knew we struggled with fertility but everything else that goes along with menopause wasn't remotely on our radar. And this may get to be TMI so I hope I don't offend anyone but... we have not had sex since my diagnosis. Not even once. It's not because we don't want to, but because we are opposed to any kind of birth control (it's against closely-held religious beliefs) and obviously need to avoid conceiving during treatment, and also during Tamoxifen. So we are looking at 5-10 years of no sex!!! I was not ready for this! And it's hard to find any other kind of intimacy when I'm still terrified about BC and adjusting to my bald, breastless body and worried about whether we'll ever be \"normal\" again and maybe once I'm finally done with Tamoxifen I will be starting \"real\" menopause if chemopause isn't permanent... my mind is spinning. My husband will touch my flat chest. I am glad but sometimes I feel like he's trying too hard, that he's not really OK with all this but just wants to make me feel OK & beautiful even though I don't totally feel that way and I'm not sure he believes it himself. Ugh... I have no real suggestions (aside from open communication with him) but I can understand a bit what you may be feeling.",

I don't think I was cautioned about any other summery things though.  Lynn, could your skin pain have anything to do with the steroids? I haven't had any issues this round or the last but I remember the very first round I felt like my face was sunburned after the steroids wore off (except it wasn't red & I hadn't been in the sun). Pamela, I have to admit I was disappointed, I saw you posted and was hoping it was another episode of Chemogate! Round 3 has been a bit rougher in terms of fatigue & pain... but mostly constipation!! I don't know what happened, I forgot 2 preventative doses of colace and ate something with rice flour the night of chemo (I usually avoid rice) and have been in horrible pain ever since. Finally got things moving not long ago but still recovering from writhing on the couch with waves of cramps and not sleeping for several nights due to the pain. :( UGH glad it seems to be better, but hope everyone can learn from my mistake and don't slip up or slack off on the anti-constipation regimes! ",

And I feel handicapped if I cut my nails too short, never mind lose them altogether. I keep saying losing my nails would be worse for me than losing my hair. So far they are hanging on, though lately I have had some random pains around my nails??? Weird. MsPharoah YES I still probably should be shaving my legs too! I almost always wear jeans so I can get away without bothering but I am annoyed there is still leg hair. It is pretty sparse though, same with underarms, and if I hadn't shaved my head I would look like a Dr. Seuss character with stray random hairs sticking out amidst the baldness! Wednesday is my LAST CHEMO!!!! I am sooo looking forward to being done. Already had surgery and no rads so I will be really totally done, just have to start Tamoxifen. Why am I still scared to death every round though??? I have in the back of my mind that THIS last round will be the one to kill me. I don't know where I got that idea (do people even die from chemo itself nowadays???) but it's stuck in my head & won't leave! As bad as each round has been, I feel like I've sailed through relatively unscathed, but I'm still so apprehensive thinking my luck could change now. Also how on earth does anyone sleep with hot flashes?? They are still waking me up every hour or two. It's really sad that I now consider 2-3 hours straight a \"good night of sleep.\" Will I ever sleep through the night again??? (Actually I haven't slept through the night in nearly 5 years thanks to my son LOL but now HE is sleeping well and I'm still up all night long!!)",

I was so emotionallu unprepared for losing my hair, even though it was one of the last things I was worried about initially (hair grows back!!) it was just so hard realizing I truly was \"sick\" and seeing it fall. I had to shave it down to the skin, both to ease the scalp pain but also to stop seeing the little hairs everywhere. I also was so anxious about going into public for the first time without hair. I thought people would treat me differently... but they haven't. Most people are surprisingly polite & pretend not to notice. No one rushes up to me and laughs or cries or offers sympathy or pries into my personal life. I don't think anyone is any nicer than before I was bald, which surprised me & maybe even disappointed me a bit but overally has ended up being very comforting. I'm glad you're finally rounding the bend physically. There will be more emotional stuff, sorry to say. Lean on your husband. Encourage him to lean on others himself so that he will be strong enough for you to keep leaning. And lean on us, and friends, and anyone else who has offered to be there with you. It's OK to cry (and cry and cry and cry!!) and vent and scream! I too have been through many horrible things throughout my life, some of them life-threatening, some soul-stealing, and I have survived them all, which gives me courage I could survive this too. The difference with BC is that the threat is within you. You can't run away & hide, you can't get away & forget about it for a day or even an hour, you can't lock enough doors to prevent BC from getting to you. For me that has made it hard in a very different way than many of my past difficulties. I'm sorry for all that you've been through & all that you're going through now. You deserve better than all this. HUGS. Molinda so sorry to scare you!!! I do sometimes have to take a break from this site so I don't get overwhelmed by fear. But most of the time it has become a place of help, comfort, and healing. You will get through this!! I am getting through this! Going for my very last chemo in less than 2 hours! I never thought I'd say that. If I can do it, you can too. Intimacy has been a struggle for me too, though for different reasons. We do not use birth control for moral reasons and even though I think I may have been pushed into menopause (although I'm only 30), we just can't take the risk that I *could* conceive, so we haven't had sex since before my diagnosis. It's been almost 6 months now and we try to just take it one day at a time. My husband struggles with it more than I do, because quite frankly I'm too preoccupied with surviving (and often too sick from chemo and too dry from chemopause) to even want sex! At the same time, it has been good for us & for our relationship to find other ways to connect & feel close & I think we are emotionally closer than we have been in a very long time. As far as lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, it is indeed a hard decision. I had multifocal BC so needed a mastectomy on one side & it made more sense (medically, psychologically, etc.) to have both sides removed. I do think if I could have gotten away wth just a lumpectomy I would have chosen that. BMX is such huge surgery (with several more surgeries if you choose reconstruction, which I didn't). No one tells you of the lasting pain, nerve issues, etc. plus you completely lose all functionality & sensation of your breasts. The medical benefit is often small or non-existent -- meaning you don't survive any longer because of choosing MX. Lumpectomy is considered as effective or even more so than MX. But then there might be good reasons to chooose a MX, like if you're hoping to avoid radiation, or if your tests show you have other areas of concern in one or both breasts. My advice to you is don't rush the decision. Don't have the MX if you aren't 100% certain that it's right for you -- even if it ultimately means you end up having a LX and then opting for the MX down the line. You can't undo a MX. As hard as it is, try not to make a decision out of fear... but also, trust your gut, because only you know what is best for YOU. All of this will feel much easier once you have a solid plan in place... the waiting and deciding and more waiting and more deciding is truly torture. I'm nearly on the other side of this... soon you will be too, sooner than you even think. ",

The taste issues are rough on their own though... I couldn't stand even water, and everything tasted like garbage! Things I could tolerate were mashed potatoes, miso soup, and spicy Mexican food. Virtually everything else was gross. Oh I also liked ice cream and milkshakes. And watermelon.

My last visit to my onc was weird. He didn't examine me at all, didn't run any blood work, just gave me my prescription & sent me on my way. Didn't have much to say in terms of preventing a recurrence (I asked about aspirin & other things). I'll go back in 3 months (and back to my BS in about 5 months) so I feel like I've been let loose! I started Tamoxifen 3 days ago & so far, so good. No major side effects, maybe some slight anxiety in the first couple of hours after I take it (but I'm always anxious so it's hard to tell if it's the meds causing it now). I have had a lot more energy the past few days. I'd been slowly getting more & more fatigued for the past 7 years, to the point that I was on disability before I was diagnosed with BC. In the last few days I have been cooking some meals, went grocery shopping, vacuumed, did a mini workout... I know these sound like minor things but they've been things I've struggled with for a long time now. Starting to think maybe I will feel like myself again! Not sure if it's because the cancer is gone, or I'm sleeping a little better, or Tamoxifen is helping my energy somehow... but I'm enjoying it for as long as it lasts! :) ",

I'm still new to all this myself but if you want to share what specific questions you have, I can try my best to answer, or someone else here might be able to help. No one here can tell you if it's cancer though. I know that's what I wanted in the pre-diagnosis stage... I just wanted someone to tell me, \"No, you're fine,\" or \"Yes, that's probably cancer.\" Even the doctors can't tell you that at this point. Unfortunately a biopsy is really the only way to know for sure.  Your appointment with the surgeon is less than a week away, but I know that feels like forever! Perhaps you can call ahead to see whether there are any other tests you can get done before your appointment. That could help expedite things... also ask to be put on their cancelation list, maybe they can get you in sooner. The waiting is agony, but you will get through it. Spend some time doing your favorite things, take some long walks, sit in front of the TV for hours, go shopping -- whatever distractions work. Once you know, it gets easier, even if it's bad news.",

It was one of those days where I didn't really notice or care that I have cancer, that I had chemo only a week ago, really all the bad stuff just faded to the background. Then tonight I got scary news about a family member, which was quickly rescinded (she is fine!) and followed by even better news that she is moving closer to me! This then sent me into a panic because she doesn't know I have BC. And now there's a chance I could see her in the coming months and she will see I'm bald and breastless. And I hate keeping secrets, and she is the family member I am closest to. I don't regret not telling her (and I will, eventually, when I'm done with treatment), but I wish it didn't have to be this way.

Breathe in for a count of 5, hold for 5, then breathe out as slowly as you can. I know it sounds too simple to make a difference but it can work wonders for anxiety. When you breathe deeply you are slowing down your body, your heart rate, all the little things that keep you stuck in your anxiety. I also find walking or anything outdoors & physical really calms me. Or a warm bath. Do something to bring your body to a calm space and your mind will start to follow, or at least have an easier time conquering the worries & fears. ",

As far as chemo day itself, you can bring whatever would help you feel calm & relaxed & entertained. It looks like you're getting the same cocktail as I did, and that took about 3 hours total for me. It could be longer for you if you need to see your MO first that day or if they need to slow the drip down. So basically you are sitting in a recliner for minimum 3 hours. You can get up to use the bathroom, you can eat, you can chat with the other patients, move your hands to do things, etc. So you can bring a laptop, music, knitting, a good book, a journal or sketch pad, things like that. I brought a few things with me but mostly ended up talking with the nurse & my roommates the whole time. You might get sleepy when they give you the Benadryl, so you may want to nap for a bit. If you have a cozy blanket or shawl, it might make you feel more at home (and sometimes IVs make you cold!) Snacks are a good idea too, they may have some on hand but bring your favorites. I also brought lunch even though my infusion was after lunch time... I knew I'd be a little too nervous to eat lunch at home beforehand! Some women bring ice to chew on & to ice their fingers and toes during the Taxotere portion, and/or cold caps to ice their heads (I did not ice anything). I think that's it. Like the others have said, the anticipation is the worst part!",

My head looks gross, especially with all the little bumps that still haven't gone away. Glad to wear scarves out & about, even if they're hot & itchy.  It seems my pattern is that as soon as the physical intensity of chemo lets up a bit, I go into a mental processing space. I am trying to figure out how to improve my life and be happier and enjoy it more. I think the key for me will be to somehow get over my fear of death. It's not just BC that has made me afraid... I've had a lifelong fear of my own mortality and now I'm realizing that if by chance I really do only have a few more years to live (though I expect to have many more!)... I don't want to waste them living in fear! So I want to find a way to get over it, just not sure how to go about that. And I'm also dealing with a lot of self-centeredness & jealousy that has taken me by surprise... a lot of it around a friend who has been complaining about morning sickness... I think many of my feelings are understandable/justifiable but I just really want to become a better person & rise above all of my own negativity.

And it does seem that those on Taxol/Herceptin have an easier time of it, both from what I've read here & from those I've talked to on the infusion floor. Pamela! LOL!!! I loved this episode! I woke up in the middle of the night in an anxiety-ridden state and reading your post made me laugh & calmed me. I'm glad you finally got to have chemo. Carol, when I had hives, it was about 11 days out from round 2... My MO thought it probably wasn't the chemo itself but couldn't rule it out, he said sometimes people do react with a rash a week or two later. Not sure about 3 weeks out though. He also said I should ask my chemo nurse to watch me/start slow with the next round to make sure I didn't react. For me it seems like a reaction to another med I was taking for heavy bleeding. Did you start any new meds within the last week or so, or eat any new foods or change laundry soap or anything? Oh and I should have gone on steroids because my hives/swelling were so bad, but I didn't... I did find the combination of Claritin plus round-the-clock Benadryl plus Pepcid (which is an H2 antagonist - blocks histamine receptors on your skin or something like that) gave me the most relief, but it was still almost a week of agony. Hope it eases up for you sooner! I'm finally feeling mostly functional now (day 9 post round 3). Most annoying lingering SE seems to be some neuropathy. Also finding my right arm (chemo arm) to be uncomfortable, kind of feels heavy and achy and occasionally mildly swollen. Not sure what that's about but it's driving me nuts.",

Carol, glad the hives are improving! I would probably not tall them you are in the middle of chemo until you are further along in the hiring process. Depending on your treatment plan (number of rounds of chemo, whether you'll go on to rads) you might not have to tell them at all, but if you think you will need lots of time off then you might want to mention it on a second/third interview. If you do decide to bring it up at any point, make sure you present yourself in a way that gives them confidence that it won't negatively affect your job performance, that you have a plan to make up for missed time, etc. Two questions for you all: 1. How do you know when to call your doctor about issues/side effects? This is something I've been struggling with since the beginning, and I tend to err on the side of not calling, mostly because weird things seem to always happen on the weekends when I'd have to call the on-call doc. I guess mostly I only call if it seems ER-worthy. But then I have this sheet that lists things to call about and I'm just never sure. Like one is \"unexplained bleeding\" and I've had very very mild bleeding issues (like a bloody nose) and if I wasn't in the middle of chemo I wouldn't even think twice about these minor things but I always wonder if it's something I'm supposed to contact them about! Then I get all panicky that I'm going to wind up with some severe infection or something all because I never called when I was supposed to. 2. How do you thank all the people who are helping you through this? Do you write thank you notes? What if you have nowhere to send them, like when a big anonymous group is helping you out (i.e. someone from my church has been sending me gift cards she has collected from the congregation). I appreciate it so, so much but can't figure out to express that! Also I have a close friend who has gone above & beyond and been there for me emotionally & practically in every way, day in & day out. I really want to come up with a nice way to show my gratitude!",

Yet here I am... I still got BC... I can't say all-natural has made chemo easier to deal with or anything... I still strive to live as naturally as possible because I enjoy it and benefit from it in many ways, but I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't do it out of fear or a desperate desire to control the uncontrollable. Unfortunately, there is only so much within our power and the rest is left to God or fate or crapshoot depending what you choose to believe. You can drive yourself crazy trying to control it all. Amy, good luck with your scan results!! Also, my second treatment was the worst in terms of weird side effects. Last rounds had more fatigue but overall 4rd & 4th weren't as bad/scary/miserable. ",

I'm still having a hard time reconciling the stats vs. so many living with this for years. Are the stats just plain wrong, or are those who live for years statistical outliers?  I'm still in shock. I felt so strongly that this would be benign, that I almost started telling family it was benign before I even got the results. I don't see how I could've been so wrong. My initial stage 1 diagnosis was delayed by 6 months because of a useless doctor. Now I'm wondering if things would be different if he'd run the proper tests in the first place. I wonder if that met has been there from the beginning (never had scans since I was early stage). Wonder how this happened. In December I was told \"all clear\" and actually went off tamoxifen and was about to try to get pregnant. Then in April my onc said the December bone scan actually showed this spot and now here I am. Not having a baby and telling my 7 year old that it's treatable but not curable. I'm only 33, this shouldn't be happening Onc didn't mention radiation but that might be better than removing the rib, if it's an option. I want a second opinion but I'm too overwhelmed to search one out, don't even know where to start! I want aggressive treatment. I want to raise my son.",

It was only 2 weeks from diagnosis to surgery so I didn't have a lot of time to process it all beforehand but I did go through a grieving process in the days before & immediately after surgery. Looking at my scars the first time post-surgery was really difficult. I felt like a deformed freak. I was also worried about how my husband would react. I cried every time I showered or otherwise saw myself naked. And then, a week or two later, it was over. I stopped feeling badly and started to feel acceptance for my new, breastless body. I was relived the cancer was gone, relieved I wouldn't have to deal with screenings etc., relieved to get rid of my bras!! The first few times I went out in public I thought everyone would notice. No one notices AT ALL. When they hear I had cancer, people ask me if I had a MX, and if I had reconstruction... even while they are looking straight at me & my flat chest. I started to find outfits in my closet that still looked good. Some looked even better without breasts! Within a month my acceptance turned to appreciation and I actually really like the way I look now. I knew from the start that reconstruction isn't something I wanted and I can safely say I am 100% happy with my decision. But at the same time, I also know that if by some slim chance I change my mind 2, 5, 10, 20+ years down the line, reconstruction will still be an option for me.  There is a forum here for Living Without Reconstruction, and we also have a Facebook page called Flat and Fabulous... if you want to talk to others who chose no reconstruction. ",

I can say that my own MX definitely seems worse than what I've heard rads described as, but since I didn't experience radiation first hand, I don't feel qualified to compare. It just sounds weird to me to hear someone say MX is easier than rads. I think part of my hangup with it is that we are only talking about the physical aspect of things (though it still seems to me that having body parts removed is more physically invasive than radiation???) But there is also the emotional side of it and I don't know what kind of psychological effects stem from rads but I do know BMX is mentally difficult. You are removing body parts that had sensation. You are losing everyday sensation, sexual feeling, ability to breastfeed (if you're still childbearing age like I am), change in appearance, change in how you view yourself, change in how others view you... I had an \"easy\" time with the psychological toll of my MX compared to many, but I still think it's so important to consider in making decisions around this issue. And obviously this is highly variable... for some, breasts are unnecessary appendages. For others, they are vital to childrearing & nurturing. For many, they are important for sexuality and womanhood, and some don't feel feminine without breasts. These aren't major issues with rads as far as I'm aware.  ",

I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop but it seems many say days 3-5 are the worst and I'm on day 5 and so far I haven't felt any worse than I do on a normal bad day (I've had a chronic illness for years) and the mental stuff is the worst, the anxiety and a bit of brain fog but mostly the anticipation of what will happen next. You can do this... you really can. I swear, if I can do it, anyone can, because I am such a wimp!!! Virginger - I had chemo the 10th, supposed to go for bloodwork a few times (no Neulasta) but no actual appointment until my pre-chemo appt a few days before my next infusion.",

Trials age you but also deepen your spirit and strengthen you. :) Mammogram didn't \"see\" any of my tumors either. Ultrasound did see the big one but it was very palpable by that point. Even MRI missed some spots. It was a (sad) relief to just have them both gone, and I'm glad I don't need to rely on imaging tests now that I realize how inaccurate they can be. My BRCA tests were negative but because I'm young & my grandmother was also young when she had BC, there is still a high likelihood that it's somehow genetic. ",

I had a horrendous time after surgery (seriously, I'd do chemo 100 times before having another BMX!!) and couldn't do anything for myself... I needed my husband to stay with me in the hospital because I couldn't lower/raise my bed or push the call button for the nurse! I was in the hospital 2 nights and readmitted for 2 more nights less than a week later. At home, I had my husband with me for the first few days. My drains came out after 5 days but it seems many (most?) docs leave them in longer. They were hard to take care of on my own for the first 3-4 days but by the last couple days I could do it. Once the drains were out, my range of motion (and general healing) rapidly improved. I did have a lot of pain and trouble reaching things but the worst part was a bad reaction to my meds... I think if I could have gotten my pain & nausea under control and not had the med side effects it would have been more manageable.  Anyway, hope I am not scaring you, even though it was really bad, the worst was over after 2 weeks or so and now I'm just over 2 months post-surgery and mostly back to normal -- some days I have pain still but usually just if I overdo it or something. One thing I'd recommend if you live alone is set your house up ahead of time -- move the microwave to a low counter, put a step-stool near high cabinets, put your meds in easy-open containers, get an electric toothbrush, stock up on frozen dinners, ask a neighbor to come feed your pets and help you clean... You will make it through no matter what but anything you can do to make it easier on yourself is worth it!! ",

Tip of the day: If you have the bumps on your scalp (they are like itchy acne, not sure if it's from the steroids or the chemo itself but happened both rounds about 6 days post-infusion for me!) try rubbing hydrogen peroxide on them.

I keep waiting to go into anaphylatic shock but large doses of 3 different antihistamines seem to be keeping me breathing at least!! It's actually starting to get better I think. It's just discouraging to have one thing on top of another and it all feels so much more scary because I'm in the middle of chemo! I have had lifelong anxiety/panic around my health & am a bit of a hypochondriac and I'm just finding this whole ordeal especially difficult. I get why some people choose not to continue chemo... I really get it. Two more rounds for me though, and I am determined to make it through them.   In other news... my 4-year-old is designing a \"Take Off Breasts machine\" -- he already built the motor. He said it will remove breasts and make you all better RIGHT AWAY... so no chemo, no recoveries, etc. :) I love it!

By the third week I've been back to nearly-normal for 2 out of the 3 rounds I've had (the 2nd I had an allergic reaction and never quite got back to normal that round) and it seems that is the pattern for many, so hopefully in a couple of days you'll start feeling more like yourself. ",

So I didn't take the glutamine this round, and I haven't had the stomach pains this round! (Well, aside from constipation-related pain...) So just throwing that out there, take a look at any meds or supplements you're taking because sometimes the things we're taking to help can cause their own side effects!

Everyone was eager to help in the beginning (but seemed to be waiting 'til I started treatment to do anything) and by the time I had surgery just a couple weeks later, some had already lost their enthusiasm, and more than half had kind of fallen away less than 2 months later when I started chemo. It would be great if you could assign a point person to organize help for you, or set up a support planner on caringbridge.com or something. And the limbo time while you're still getting tests & deciding on treatment is the absolute worst... I wish I had been able to ask people to cook for me & help with cleaning & babysitting then, because even though I wasn't physically struggling the way I was after surgery or chemo, mentally I was so completely freaked out & emotional & unable to do anything and it would have been amazing to have more support then. Don't feel guilty about asking for or accepting help, and don't try to hold off on asking until things are worse, take it whenever & however you can get it! And if friends & family don't have the time or energy to cook or clean or drive you to appointments, they can give you gift cards for groceries/meals, gas cards or bus passes to get to the doctors, money toward medical expenses or cleaning services or child care, and gift cards to clothing stores for hats/scarves and mastectomy-friendly clothing. Crafty friends could help by knitting a hat or sewing pockets to hold drains or small pillows for after surgery. Computer-savvy friends can research treatments for you. If friends are limited in time or money, you can at least ask them to call or email you every Wednesday to check in or send you some uplifting stories or poems... every little thing makes a huge difference and don't be afraid to ask for whatever it is that would feel helpful to you. ",

She said something like, \"If you have to have BC, this is the kind to have.\" (IDC, ~2cm, ER+/PR+, HER2-, Grade 2... lymph nodes haven't been tested yet but don't feel swollen at least...) Then I had my MRI Saturday and it was really... tough... emotionally. I think I mentioned above that I have PTSD and something about this MRI really triggered me, I think it was the pressure on my sternum & being told not to move & all. :( Anyway, since then I'm just feel so down, so disoriented... My anxiety has improved since stopping a hormone supplement I was on, and I'm sleeping a bit better too. Mostly I'm just sad, and fearful. I'm so worried the MRI will show it's spread. I hate that today is a holiday & I have to wait longer for the results. My biggest fear is that it has metastasized. How do you get over that fear? How do you accept the results for what they are and not get into all the \"what if\"s??? How do I convince myself that I'm not going to die?!?! I'm trying so hard to be a good parent to my son but I'm so incredibly distracted that I feel like I'm not giving him the attention he deserves, I can't focus on conversations with anyone, I can't distract myself... I tried watching some shows & reading yesterday but for some bizarre reason every show I watched, everything I read, had references to cancer! I feel like cancer is running after me and I can't escape it. I don't want my life to become all about cancer but that's exactly what is happening right now. I just feel so scared and alone.",

You may want to avoid particularly germy places like daycare centers or the movie theater during the week or two that your counts are at their lowest. And definitely avoid sick people. I did all normal activities, including taking my son to places like the children's museum, although he & I always used hand sanitizer between every exhibit. I didn't get Neulasta and still managed to get through without any infections or anything. :) I think as a young mom my immune system was already pretty strong! 2. Can I go to work? Yes, though some find they want/need a bit of time off during the first week or so post infusion. 3. Can I do cooking, cleaning, and other similar things? Yes, but you may not always feel up to it. Ask people to cook meals for you and/or stock up on frozen dinners. Sign up for cleaningforareason.org or ask friends to help with cleaning.  4. Can I go to drop off my kids to school? Yes. 5. Can I go for shopping and grocery? Yes. 6. Is there any other thing which I should do or avoid during chemo? Don't eat sushi or raw meat -- make sure your food is cooked thoroughly, and wash fruits & veggies well. Keep hand sanitizer in your purse. Buy a few new toothbrushes or sanitize yours regularly. Use only electric razors, or at least brand-new disposable ones. I think that's about all I did to prevent infections. If you don't live close to a pharmacy, stock up on meds for various side effects (constipation/diarreah, sore throat, heartburn, etc.)  If hair loss is a side effect of your chemo regime, have a plan for that (head coverings/wigs/hats/scarves if desired). If you have young kids, get some videos/books/toys/crafts to keep them busy when you're not feeling well. ASK FOR HELP whenever you need it. 7. Can I attend my yoga classes? Yes. It's good to stay moving as much as you can -- I took walks almost every day. Yoga will help! ",

I don't really know all the details, the on-call doctor didn't have the report, my own doc is on vacation for a week. I have a call in to the surgeon. The uncertainty is killing me, though I'm almost relieved to at least know something. My mind is spinning and I can't sleep. In a way, a part of me kind of knew it was cancer from the beginning. I found the lump several months ago and my doc thought it was a cyst (I'm only 30 but do have a family history) but that didn't sit right with me. Then it started getting indented. I read some posts on here about the indent being a very bad sign and I think that's when I knew. I'm glad I found those posts because I wouldn't have pushed for more tests if I hadn't. And I don't think I've ever felt such a high level of denial as what I've felt in the past few months. I'm grateful that the doc who called was very straight-forward & direct and not afraid to blurt out \"you have cancer\" because I think I needed to hear it straight. I have a young child. I can deal with pain and suffering. Most of my life has been struggles and suffering. I can do this... as long as I will survive. I need to know I'm not going to die. And more than anything, I need prayers. Oh... and sleep. The human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it. ~C.C.

One question I have is... my biopsy was a week ago and the biopsy itself hurt a bit (even with a double-dose of novacaine) but I felt pretty much OK for the day or two after it... but since then I keep getting random stabbing pains on & off and the breast seems a bit swollen or something. Is that normal??? The pain isn't intense/unbearable, just a bit painful... and of course just enough pain to constantly remind me throughout the day that I have cancer. (Every time I manage to distract myself I get a stabbing pain to bring me back to reality!) I'm pretty sure I'm making the pain worse in my head though...",

I have a Caring Bridge page but so far have really used it more for my own journaling, no one has access to it yet and I feel weird about it for some reason because the stuff I end up writing is too emotional.  I did ask one of my best friends to be my point person -- I update her & she takes care of updating everyone else. She even told everyone the news that I had BC so I wouldn't have to say it over & over. She is a good person to lean on and confide in and good at filtering my updates to be more appropriate for general sharing. :)",
