The report says the lesion could be trapped fat or fibrocystic change but they reccomend biopsy to be sure. So that at least sounds positive. Booked in for tuesday ;-) I have requested a refferal to a dermatologist to be sure that the nipple rash is not anything sinister. The GP was not really happy about it, she thinks pagets is to rare to be concerned about and believes it is just excema. .. maybe it is but if it is more then I'll be grateful that I pushed for follow up.

Nipple- Larger probably double size of other nipple / flatter nipple, not inverted but sort of indented into areola sometimes. ..until touched/stimulated then will erect. Let down feeling in breast Red rash on areola, sometimes red raw sometimes scaley. Sometimes weeping sores/crust around join between nipple/areola. Extremely itchy nipple/areola comes and goes but there every day. Burning sensation, sensitive nipples Ive always had lumpyish breasts so hard to find any changes. I have a Mammogram and ultrasound booked for next wednesday. Im worried I'm overreacting. I wanted a biopsy of skin too but dr thinks it is just excema. She said if It feels like I have a cyst in same breast I have syptoms in but also daid if it was cancer id have orsnge peel type skin. Breasts both have visable veins Log in to post a reply",

My general doc seems unphased by my nipple symptoms because she feels no underlying lump behind the nipple. The nipple really concerns me due to the continuing changes. She also said if it was cancer I'd have orange peel type skin. Reading the replies here has shown me cancer presents in many ways and so do benign conditions. Im trying to worry less.

Cattledog- Im a person who has had excema so have already tried cortisone creams, washing with sorboline cream instead of soap, changing wash powders, washing my hair in sink to be sure it isnt shampoo. The nipple also seem flatter and bigger. Im hoping they begin to take it seriously. My GP seems to only be looking for orange peel type skin issues... that I dont have.",

Ultrasound showed 3-4 cysts on right side, all black inside so normal looking according to ultrasound tech. The left side had a different cyst/lump that didnt look black on the inside. She said radiologist will check images and decide if it is fat filled or needs more looking into. Gp visit tomorrow for follow up. Still confused why no one seems concerned about my changing nipple size and rash which was reason i went to doc in the first place.  Keeping fingers crossed.",

He straight away refered me to a breast specialist. Yesterday I saw the specialist and he was very thorough. He said he agrees the nipple could be pagets, but that there is no way to know without a biopsy. He said he has a great interest in pagets, he see' almost all cases in our area due to that special interest. He is doing that next week. He is also going to do a core biopsy of the lump. Finally I feel like I'm moving forward and getting answers .",
