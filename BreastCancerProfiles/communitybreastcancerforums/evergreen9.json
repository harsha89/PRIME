Apparently there is a scale the radiologist uses to indicate the level of suspicion there is.My memory is getting sketchy, but I think it was a 4 or 5 point scale, with the highest number being almost certainly cancer. Mine was the second highest number, and it was. Having said that, radiologists don't always agree. e.g., I had an abnormality on an MRI on the top bone of my spine. When a group of radiologists looked at it, one was sure it was cancer, 3 disagreed, one strongly. So try not to second guess. It is hard waiting, I know. But exbrnxgrl is right, it is less likely to be cancer than not. And remember, breast cancer caught early is highly treatable. Even folks like me, where it was caught after it got to the nodes, have good treatment options.",

I have gotten past that phase now - two years, touch wood - and do have a regime that I developed from reading the research and various books (Anti-Cancer, Foods That Fight Cancer, Dr Susan Lolve's book, etc. I am hoping this regime may aid in delaying or avoiding recurrence... my stats are not very good! 1. Exercise, enough to make you sweat, 30 minutes daily, most days 2. Daily - multigrain /whole grain sources of carbs 3. Fruits and vegetables - lots, ESP cabbage family, berries, shitake and oyster mushrooms, cooked tomatoes, etc. 4. Red meat RARELY and very small portion 5. Primarily fish, eggs, tofu, poultry- lean cuts 6. Green tea - Sencha variety, 3 times a day 7. Supplements - omega 3, Vit D 8. Every night, a drink of almond milk which includes pureed garlic and turmeric as well as tomato sauce. Sounds gross, but it rounds off the foods I try to include daily....",

All of these are believed to have properties that fight cancer trying to start up again. My oncologist and several books I've read encourage \"food as medicine\", saying that not enough is known re the components of a food, and whether all of these components survive the manufacture process of a supplement. So I do this instead of supplements, though I do take Vit d. Regardless of what you believe re the food vs supplements issue, there is a lot of evidence at the lab level, of the effectiveness of turmeric in fighting cancer. I don't know of any human studies, which of course will be the \"last word\" on the topic. But for now, I am taking my turmeric!

I think the research is clear on many types of surgery, that you are better with someone who does a lot of the specific ype you are having done.",

Hopefully your government will get more involved in health care as the years go by. While the Canadian system is not perfect, and there are sometimes waits for elective surgeries, (e.g., hip transplant) with my cancer, everything happened in a timely fashion, and the doctor makes the decisions with my input, according to government guidelines that are consistent for all. The one place we seem to lag is getting approval for new drugs... it seems we lag behind the FDA. Otherwise, from what I read here, treatment methods seem very similar.
