It's just something in us that does that, especially seeing our relatives in pain because of our diagnosis. Somehow it feels like we're responsible. Only now are there some studies out which can help us start to make heads or tails about what might be best to put into our bodies to help us ward off the disease.  Generally, eating less sugars/carbs, more organics (w/o hormones and pesticides), and exercising regularly seem to be mainstays for overall health, and assisting us with most every disease or ailment. As you learn from your docs, do you own research, you can make a plan that feels right, and true, and healthy to you so you don't beat yourself up for what you think are unhealthy habits anymore. Right now is the time to nurture yourself unlike ever before. Being hit with a breast cancer diagnosis can no doubt be traumatic, so be kind to you.  ",

Have you been tested for BRACA 1 & 2.  I've also heard from my doctor as well as  many women on here who thought they had it in the other breast too once they were diagnosed, and docs usually say that IDC \"doesn't jump breasts.\"  I understand you concern though. I've also heard a lot of women talk about having scar tissue after breast surgery that they thought were malignant lumps. My mom was one of them. Her scar tissue feels like a hard mass, much like the malignant ones, but the malignant one I had was slightly red and hot to the touch. No way of knowing without a biopsy, but hope it is just benign.  I'm in Hawaii too if you ever want to drop a line.",

      "Content": "Jun 15, 2013 09:36PM - edited Jun 15, 2013 09:49PM by lightandwind I wanted to chime in on this thread too. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago at age 43 (premen). I was stage III, grade 3, ER 96% and PR 96%. I chose no chemo and the only sane alternative to that according to my onc and other docs was to have an ooph w/ mx on same day to what they called \"remove the fuel\" and \"burn down the factory to stop the production\". I had looked at some studies that had discussed that this approach was as effective or maybe even more than chemo for hormone+ cancers. I was clearly estogen dominant..had heavy periods and uterine fibroids. I followed the advice as I saw it as the best option for me. I had the mx and ooph during the same surgery. I was put on femara only 1 week following the surgery to get to stray cells as quickly as possible. My tumor markers leveled off and are currently still w/n normal range. For months following this surgery during and on femara, it was real tough. I couldn't think straight, walk straight, i was depressed and uncomfortable in my body. As time passed though, I've gotten more comfortable in my body, and now feel better than I did for years prior to diagnosis (despite the daily downer from the femara-sore joints, etc). I no longer have inflammation, chronic fluid retention, and feel more level and grounded emotionally and mentally.  I truly get now why estogen dominance is such a bad thing for breasts and all of the other body's functions. Had I been younger, not as high % on the hormone +, then I might have not seen the benefits that I have had so far. Since I was nearing meno and having all the problems from estogen dominance anyway, I don't regret my choice at all. AND it might have saved my life (at least for a while). I do think that in the very near future, we are going to know more about BC and how to control and balance hormones to prevent disease which will help to allow women to go through natural meno without having to make this grueling decision. Best to you whatever your choice!",
