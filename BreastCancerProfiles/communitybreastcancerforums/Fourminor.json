But the issue may come to whether or not it will change management at this point. If you are being treated with chemotherapy first and that would not change either way, for one, your insurance may balk at paying for the test. But also I would not subject myself to a radiation based imaging study unless the results would make a difference in how I was to be treated. I would speak with your MO, because the plan may be to do PET CT after chemo and prior to surgery to ensure that there are no distant metastasis at that point. Its terrifying, no question. I waited about 6 weeks between diagnosis and surgery and every night I started feeling pains in my breast and worried that it was growing and spreading. And even though I was determined to be stage 1, after surgery when you face decisions about adjuvant chemo, there is the unfortunate reality that any of us could have some cells that escaped somewhere and are too small to be seen with any imaging. That's the reality of breast cancer; once you have it, even after every therapy is done, there's no way to know if you are cured or not. And staging is only one part of the story, because some big tumors are less aggressive, and some small ones are more aggressive. So don't get bogged down in statistics. Every story is unique. However, all of us are in the same boat unfortunately, and having kids makes its very hard (I have an almost 4 year old). I found it helped to stay present when I was with him and let his natural positivity lift us both up. Its totally normal to feel anxious and terrified, but try to balance that energy out with some joy and gratitude during each day when you can. ",
