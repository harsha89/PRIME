I'm 5 years out now, and while I'm on a great chemo (Gemzar) I'd much rather do the hormonals! But if they do them, remember it might take a few months to be sure they work. My onc said chemo does show results faster, but once the hormonals start working, they can do a good, even better job than chemo, so I wouldn't be afraid to give it a try. Good luck either way, and I hope you get better soon!",

I had just had the CT dye added to my IV, which of course always makes me feel flushed and weird for a minute or two. But I sat up and promptly felt extremely weird. The nurse asked if I was okay, but it felt like there was pressure on my ears and her voice was very far away. My head felt really heavy and I knew I had to lie back. Next thing I knew, I was lying back on the table and a bunch of nurses are nervously asking if I'm okay. They took my blood pressure: it was 60 over 40. And that was after lying down a few minutes. So they wheeled me about 10 steps down the hall, where conveniently, the ER is. After a few tests, the ER dr. said that my EKG was \"a bit off\" and showed a prolonged QT interval, meaning the time it takes to recover from one beat and start the next is longer than it should be. I've had an EKG before, this is new. Well, okay, what does that mean? He said I'd have to stay the night so they can monitor me. It was 10 a.m. so I was not happy. Plus it means yet another day of missed work. But then I started looking up on good ole Dr. Google and found a list of meds that can cause this condition. First among them is,...you guessed it...Halaven. Seriously?! I find a chemo that is mild enough to tolerate and it causes heart problems?! I'm not 100% sure if it's the chemo, but the only other drug I've been on (Lexapro) that can cause it I've been on for over a year, so I don't think that's it. I just don;t know what is going to happen. I don't want to switch chemos, but one of the side effects of a prolonged QT is sudden death, which I would prefer not to have, either. Gaaaahhhh!!!

You're trying something very daring and brave and there will be a lot of people who will assume you are selfish at best and stupid at worst. Don't listen to them. You have the chance of bringing a little life into this sad world, and I say, go for the stars. You are not dead yet, you are alive and nobody can tell you when you will die.

The more PET scan spots light up, the more active the tumor. Insurance companies don't want to pay for them because they are more expensive and because CT and bone scans pretty much can tell you if the cancer is progressing.  As to cancer in the skull, I have several spots, and most oncs I've dealt with have said repeatedly that they \"rarely, if ever\" push into the brain. Well, looks like mine are doing just that. If you do have mets to the skull, I would definitely push for a brain MRI for a baseline. They don't usually do brain MRIs unless there are actual symptoms of brain mets (headaches, vision changes, etc.) but if you at least get a starting one, you'll have something to compare it with if you ever do have symptoms.  In the meantime, I'd find another onc. This one doesn't sound very invested in your care.  Oh, and my onc said the only real way to tell knee spots as arthritis vs. cancer is that arthritis tends to be in both knees, and cancer in the knee isn't as common. It's mostly just guesswork. ",

As for me, I am totally convinced that grief brought on my cancer. I may have gotten it later in life (I was 39 at original diagnosis), but my husband passed away after 18 months of marriage, leaving me with 2 teens and a 5-month-old. And my dad died during that time, too. Then my best friend. So yeah, lots of stress. I would love to know the cause of it because if we knew the cause, we could try to undo whatever it was that started it all. Just because I think I know WHY it started doesn't mean I know HOW it started. I often wonder, just what was I doing when that very first cell divided screwy and ended up cancer?! I will never know, and I don't beat myself up or blame myself, my lifestyle, or my diet. Other people eat, live, and work far worse than I do and don't get cancer. But I think we all search for answers. We all seem to have bits of the puzzle, but for each person it is totally different, and that's the frustrating part! Two people with the EXACT same type of cancer, same genetic makeup, and one will respond to a drug that the other won't. That is frustrating enough to make me never want to be an oncologist!!!",

I said my body was tired and I just could not do that again. His response was that TAC and its components are among \"the most brutal\" chemos there are. He assured me that not all chemos are so intolerable. I am currently on Halaven and was very worried because I have very few symptoms and feel better than when I was on Aromasin/Afinitor. I thought maybe it wasn't working. But in 2 months it shrunk my tumors by over half and brought my tumor count to zero. I'm not saying you should try Halaven or any other chemo, just that there ARE more \"gentle\" chemos out there, and hopefully your onc takes into account your quality of life. My onc at first wanted to put me on Xempra but said that it is a tougher chemo and while it might do the job, my quality of life might suffer more. I appreciated that he was concerned about that. Whether you decide to try another chemo or to stop treatment, you can be assured that many of us will be here to support you in whatever you choose. And regardless, I hope you have a fabulous, restful, wonderful Thanksgiving and Christmas.",

My onc has been concerned about the headaches, of course, and I know some of it has been caused by the spinal tap (especially the horrid one last week!) but some of the symptoms I realized have been caused by the methotrexate itself. Like my onc said, we're basically pouring acid into the most vulnerable part of my body.  I also realized something else...the two times I have had this particular doctor (not my onc) do the spinal tap, I felt a peculiar, strong tingling down to my toes, then up to my head. I didn't have it with the other doctors. So I am wondering if some of the pain was caused by this hotshot doctor putting in the chemo too fast? He does act like he has done this a million times and is out of there the second he's done. ",

The nurse did say, though, not to worry about caffeine addiction/rebound headaches until after next week. Then I can worry about tapering down.

Then again, I don't know how a snail has the energy to move, either, at this point.  As to pain management, up until now I really didn't have much pain. I've been on oxycontin for about 4 years for the bone mets, and have considered stopping it (or tapering, whatever), but the few times I tried a slow taper, I ended up with the worst case of restless legs syndrome, and then I thought, \"Why am I bothering? If it ain't broke, why am I trying to fix it?!\" So this headache has really hit me out of the blue.  I did have a long talk with the nurses and tech, who, frankly, I think know more than the doctors do in most cases! They said that I likely did have a small CSF leak because when they did the blood patch thingy, I had a sharp headache for just a few seconds and then it faded. They said that's pretty typical. The nurses were furious about the whole pharmacy thing, but also very familiar with it. Like one nurse said, why is it so hard to get anti-nausea drugs for CHEMO patients, and yet some states allow medical marijuana?! I said I would smoke old socks if I thought it would help with the nausea!",

I've been on most of the chemos/AIs you mention, and Gemzar for me is probably the easiest. I make sure I eat a lot of fresh fruit for 2 to 3 days after and it prevents constipation. Otherwise, that's the main side effect. My hair hasn't thinned, surprisingly. Like a lot of chemos, it hits you with a bit of fatigue on the 2nd or 3rd day. I get it 3 weeks on and 1 week off. I also get a steroid IV with it, which makes me wonder if that's what delays the fatigue for a few days. I'm not complaining, though! I did have Xeloda several years ago and didn't last more than 6 months before progression. I don't remember much about it except being relieved that I didn't have the hand-foot thing...but I do remember having to lower the dose because I couldn't tolerate it. I'm amazingly (and very gratefully) sturdy when it comes to blood counts; I almost never have too low counts, so it must have been just feeling crappy that caused them to lower the X.  If you're going from X to Gemzar, I'd say you're onto much bigger and better things.

Some people react that way, but I don't, so for me driving an hour after wouldn't be a problem. As nice as people can be, you're right, it does get so old after awhile, and driving myself would be such a blessing right now.

I did TAC and don't know if I got out of bed except to use the bathroom, go to dr. appointments/chemo, and to be shuffled off to the hospital in an ambulance. II did all 3 drugs at once because I stupidly wanted \"to hit it with everything I can!\" I mean, no matter hard it is, it's only for 6 or 8 weeks, right? Hah. I was so naive.  I remember my onc telling me that I'd be (I think, if I remember correctly) getting infused something like once every 3 weeks. I asked him why not once every 2 weeks because I was so gung-ho about getting it done. He actually shuddered. He said, \"Absolutely not. You will need that extra week to recover, I promise.\" I thought other people could be wimps, but I could handle it! Until about 24 hours after the first infusion when I thought I would die and didn't care if I did. At the time, I had no health insurance. I called my onc's office and they were able to give me some Kytril which helped, but gave me serious headaches after long-term use.  One thing I have learned is that pretty much all meds come with a price. Trying to get the right balance is a process. I found that for me, Compazine and Phenergan were great oldies but goodies, but I could only take them at night because they knock you out. So if you want something to help you sleep, they are good ones (and cheap, too, if you have no insurance). They also come (gross, but apparently effective) in suppository form when you can't keep anything down. \"Vitamin Z\" (as my rad onc called Zofran) really helps, but for me it gives me horrid headaches long term. But you could try it at least in the daytime to see if it helps. And you may not get the headaches. The one good thing about Zofran is that it comes in a dissolving tablet. Tastes minty and just dissolves on your tongue so it's good when you're feeling pukey. And as for Ativan...although I really think it is a miracle drug, it comes with a price for me, too. The three things it does that are perfect for me are 1. helps hugely with anxiety,  2. helps prevent seizures  3. helps with nausea. Oh, and it also helps you sleep, too. The price I have to pay if I want it long-term? It can cause slight amnesia. I never had to worry about hallucinating (Why don't I ever get blue butterflies like Deb?!) but boy did it cause me to have memory loss. So now I take it occasionally and am fine. Sorry for the long post. But I think everyone here has the same idea...Find what works for you, and DEMAND that you get help. I don't know if this helps or not, but when I told my new onc after being diagnosed stage 4 was that I could never do chemo again after TAC, his response was, \"TAC chemo is, bar none, the most difficult of ANY chemo for ANY cancer. NOTHING you take from this point on will ever be as difficult as TAC.\" So you can look at it as \"No wonder my life sucks right now, but at least it's temporary,\" and knowing that this is likely the worst you'll ever feel. And in the meantime, please know we're all here for you and you can feel free to rant all you want. It truly sucks.",

They may not understand the issues, but they understand feelings. I got to the point recently where I could not remember the last time I was happy, could not remember how it even felt. So I knew I had to do something. We are bombarded with toxic chemicals every day, and our bodies and brains just can't handle it all the time. I don't know about the rest of you, but going from one multivitamin a day to a basketful of meds is depressing all by itself! If the antidepressant you're on isn't working, talk to your doctor. They can switch it, increase it, or add something else. There are so many days when I think, \"Life isn't supposed to be this hard, is it?!?\" and I look around and everyone else seems to just be going along quite fine. But \"everyone else\" doesn't have cancer or has to deal with what we have to deal with. You need to advocate for yourself and get whatever help you need, with no apologies.",

At least I can prepare for it. Maybe you can ask your onc about it? For something like Taxol, I would think it would help hugely with your side effects.

I allowed myself one of those Lindor chocolate ball things each evening, and boy did I enjoy them more than usual! And last night I wasn't really hungry but wanted to chew on something, so I ate a few Twizzlers. Didn't help much, and I realized that they didn't taste as good as they usually did. So I won't be getting them anymore.  My stomach has rebelled against the sudden intake of more fruits and veggies (and here I thought I ate a high-fiber diet!) but I think it's getting used to it. I can't tell if I feel better or not because I'm still focused on cravings at the moment, but I'm going to try to severely limit my sugar intake from now on.  I have been reading a lot about sugar lately. I also don't want to \"be a Nazi about it,\" but I think for me, I kind of have to for awhile just to get it out of my system. A few things I have discovered: - Chronic sugar intake messes with our ability to tell when we are full. (This describes me to a T...I'll stop eating and realize I should have stopped 15 minutes before and feel queasy) - Even 100% whole wheat breads have the whole wheat ground into such a fine dust (so the bread won't feel too \"heavy\") that it only has a single gram more fiber than white bread, which means it isn't any better than Wonder bread)  This was a surprise to me, since I've eaten 100% whole wheat bread for years and thought I was doing good for my body.  - Our bodies process all white flour products exactly the same as sugar, because white flour and sugar are simple carbs that flood our bloodstream much faster than whole grains. - In 1980, very few adults had fatty liver (except for morbidly obese and alcoholics). Now, a third of adults have it. (Including me, as I found out from my CT scans awhile back) - The sugar that affects our brain and blood most quickly is fructose, which is found in fruits. But when we eat fruits, their fiber keeps the fructose from flooding the bloodstream too fast. But once high fructose corn syrup was invented, it goes into our bloodstream very quickly.  - Almost all packaged foods have added sugar, including ketchup, salad dressing, even ramen noodles! I checked that last one and yes, it's in the little flavor packets. I really hate that Italian dressing, which is perfectly fine when it's oil, vinegar and a few spices, has sugar added to it, which 99% of them do. I have to make my own, which is a pain.  Anyway, I hope I didn't bore you all with all of this. I don't really think that fasting from sugar is going to slow down the cancer or anything, but hopefully it can help me feel better and more able to fight it. ",

I get that, really.  But...I accidentally skipped 2 days of my antidepressant, and it was...revealing.

I ate an entire box of Whitman's samplers and a dozen of those Ferraro-Rochet chocolate ball things in a day. I simply couldn't stop.  So now I need to majorly detox, and I have NO idea how to wean myself off a true sugar addiction. I've always loved anything sweet, but it's gotten pretty bad. My friend said when she craves sweets she just eats one piece of candy. That's like telling an alcoholic to get rid of their craving by having \"just one drink.\"  And of course, it doesn't help that my emotions are all over the place, that all the meds we're on cause all sorts of weird cravings or side effects, and, well, my body is totally out of whack. And then I feel lousy so all I want to do is sit in bed and eat bonbons. (Okay, I don't even know what bonbons are, but you know what I mean)  Has anyone gone through this?

For the past few months, we've gotten a food stamps card, and lo and behold, the farmer's market takes it! We had fresh, organic strawberries last week. I need to just take the time to make a bunch of things from scratch to take the place of sugar (and donuts! Boy, do I crave donuts, too!). Anyway, thanks for the support.I'll see how the next 3 days go...if nobody hears from me by then, the donuts won... :-)   And I really like the idea of focusing on what I can/should eat rather than what I can't.

I'm not usually offended by the terms,but I really don't like it when others talk about me as if my \"battle\" is such an inspiration to them. I get put on a pedestal and told how \"strong\" I am. That word annoys me, because first of all, I'm feeling pretty dang weak right now, and secondly, it's not like we have a choice. At my dr.'s office there's a great saying on his wall \"You don't know how strong you are until being strong is the ONLY CHOICE.\" I mean, it's not often that you hear about people who get diagnosed with cancer ,so they go home to bed and stay there until they die. The whole \"fighting\" thing is pretty pointless, since by \"fighting\" they mean getting up every day and living our lives. I'd like to ask those people who use the \"warrior\" imagery what exactly they think we're doing as warriors? Having cancer is mostly just going through life while waiting. Waiting for test results, waiting to see if the chemo works, waiting in doctors' offices...not the ideal \"warrior\" image, you know?  I also don't like the warrior image for another reason, and I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been with me since day one. This cancer that I have...it's something that somehow, my body created. Whether I have faulty genes, or ate the wrong foods, or was exposed to the wrong chemicals doesn't matter. This thing was something MY OWN BODY created. So if I am \"fighting\" cancer, that means in a way that I'm fighting myself. I would rather think that I am \"working with\" the cancer to find ways to overcome it. Not that it will happen, but if this were a bacteria or virus, I could talk truthfully about fighting an invading force. This is more devastating in a way because it's as if the troops lined up to fight the enemy have turned on me instead. I hope that makes sense. ",

We all feel the need to rant at times, and this is one safe place you can come and be heard by people who understand. I have done things I swore I would never do because I also have a guy at home who would be devastated without his mom. I just can't do it to him, if I have any say in the matter. I am not familiar with your entire story, but it sounds like you can't climb out of a hole if you don't get a boost. You need to take care of the physical pain as much as possible...there's no reason you should suffer more than you are already. Physical pain can very rapidly deteriorate to emotional depression. I hope you are seeing someone, taking an anti-depressant, or have enormous support in your struggles. Most of us here have gone that route, and it helps us dig out of the deep hole of depression. In the meantime, know that we are here to hold your hand through the rough spots.",

We compromised by her going to Walmart and buying a $3.00 bottle of St. John's wort and taking two a day.  It has made all the difference. Within a few days, I noticed that the total hopelessness was fading. Suddenly she could think of the future with interest instead of apathy. I know St. John's wort doesn't work for everybody, but it might be something your DH might be willing to try, since it's easy to get and doesn't involve sharing his worst fears with strange doctors, which many men have problems with.  I read an article awhile back that said that in Europe they use St. John's wort more than Prozac or other drugs and that for mild to moderate depression it is every bit as effective. Don't know about severe depression, but it sounds like your DH, like my DD, at least needs a jump start to get out of the dark hole he is in. Then maybe he'll be open to counseling if needed. ",

It's pretty definite on the brain mets (which were completely absent 3 months ago and now are 3 large tumors and lots of tiny ones). I didn't understand about the pleura and the lungs. My onc explained that while the lining of my lungs (outside of the lungs themselves) tested negative, the inside of my lungs now looks \"very suspicious\" for cancer. So they're going to do a lung biopsy to be sure. In the meantime, he gave me antibiotics just in case there is an infection there, because my SOB is so severe. He's a good doctor, and I love him to pieces, but he admitted he was more concerned with \"the immediate problem, the brain.\" I get that ,but I have no symptoms from the brain mets, and I'm dying here with the lung mets (uh, no pun intended) ! I'm coughing every few seconds, but don't cough up anything. I'm out of breath walking to the bathroom. Does anyone else experience panic attacks about breathing? Mostly I'm okay. I even went out with my mom today and it wasn't too bad. But especially at night, when I start thinking about how hard it is to breathe, I have to really struggle because I get anxious and then my breathing gets worse. I know the oxygen is getting to my body (my pulse ox - the finger clamp thingy) says 95-98% every time. But my heart races when I walk any length and sometimes my arms/legs feel tingly. I can't do oxygen...it won't help. My onc was very clear (said in a very gentle but straightforward way) that his one worry about my lungs is that if I had to go on ventilation he would be very worried about my never getting off of it. And there's not enough fluid in the pleura to suction out. Maybe when they do the lung biopsy, I can ask if they can just suction the cancer out along with it?! Sigh. Well, I'm off to take Ativan and flexeril. Maybe the flexeril will calm the lung muscles so I don't cough all night, and maybe the ativan will keep me sane enough to fall asleep?! One can hope, at least.  ",

I have had increasing shortness of breath over the past several months. My scans showed an \"area of consolidation\" (whatever that means...onc said it meant they had no idea what it was!) and pleural effusion. I got the lung drained, which did absolutely nothing for my SOB. So I got referred to a pulmonologist. They did complete pulmonary function testing and found that while my 02 saturation was entirely normal, my lungs were not. (well, duh, I could have told him that!) Basically I have \"restrictive\" disease, which the pulmonologist says means my lungs are \"tight\" and I can't take in as much oxygen, or expel as much, as I should be. When he found that I'm getting scans in a week or so, he was very casual about it, basically saying that I should hold off on worrying until the scans. Well, that's all fine and dandy, but in the meantime, I can't breathe!!! It feels like there is a tight band around my upper ribs so I can't inhale as much. And it's getting worse, to the point where if I walk to the bathroom I can feel my heart rate increasing to offset the lack of air. Just coming up the stairs makes me pant like a dog and feel like I'm going to pass out. The dr. said that I don't need to have supplementary oxygen because the problem is not the oxygen, it's a \"mechanical\" problem with my lungs. He likened it to a toaster: if the toaster doesn't work, it doesn't matter how much bread you try to stuff in it, it still won't work. So in the meantime, my lungs are toast (haha) and I can't breathe, and I am SO tired. So I'm hoping somebody can answer my questions: -Is this how you felt your lung mets? (I am not trying to find out if I have lung mets since I will know soon enough. I just want to know if this is \"normal\" for lung mets) -Is there ANYTHING that helps with shortness of breath like this? Any exercise, medicine, anything?! I went to the ER about a month ago and they basically just scanned me and said everything looked okay except for that small area of consolidation and I should follow up with my doctor. So I know they're useless. My onc said that this was \"out of his expertise\" and that the pulmonologist should tell me what to do, but the pulmonologist (who was a decent and very thorough doctor) doesn't seem to think there is anything to do at this point. Agggh. Any thoughts, advice, comments would be welcome. And sorry for the long post. Thanks. ",

      "Content": "raro wrote: Sorry for the long post... I've been on Gemzar for about six months now,and it's been a pretty easy chemo, all things considered. But now I am at a crossroads and would like a bit of advice, if you have it. Quick history: I've had worsening shortness of breath for months now. Did every scan known to womankind, and all the results were inconclusive. In short, my onc (with the input from pulmonology, radiology, etc.) has, by his own admission, \"no idea\" what is really causing it. Many things we know contribute to it, but are they the cause?  CT shows an \"area of consolidation\" which in the pulm. dr.'s words, means that it's an area that they have no idea what is going on in. Could be cancer (unlikely since fluid drained from there showed no cancer cells), could be pneumonitis, could be old scar tissue, fluid, pus, whatever.  So  I finished the Gemzar cycle and had no treatment for a week. I was feeling pretty good, mowed the front lawn, went up/down stairs without too many issues, etc. Then I got Gemzar last Monday, and I still felt good (steroids) but I knew that the nausea/fatigue would hit on Wednesday. Sure enough, I woke up feeling like I'd been hit by a truck, as usual....but I also realized that the horrible shortness of breath was right back again. Like there's a tight band around my upper ribs so I can't take a deep breath.  Saw the onc today because I was scheduled for Gemzar. I told him my observations and he was very concerned. He says that he is torn because it is very hard to determine...Is this lung issue a side effect of Gemzar? OR is it a reaction (i.e., a type of allergy)? If it's a side effect, I can bear it at least until Thanksgiving, when I have my next scans. If it's an allergic issue, we'll have to stop it. But it has been working so well that he is reluctant to stop it, since I only have a few options left.  He asked me honestly what I thought. Not dumping the decision on me, but because he cares what I think. I said I could manage to get through until my scans. But I'm second-guessing myself. My onc said that if it worsens, if I'm struggling to breathe while at rest, etc. I can call him and he will stop it immediately and/or send me to the ER. Part of me thinks I'll be just fine since I've had the issue for months. But part of me suddenly wonders, what if I get an anaphylactic reaction to this drug? Am I panicking over nothing? Or am I being sensible?! Help! Log in to post a reply",

I had been on tamoxifen for 4 years after my initial stage III diagnosis but stopped it when it came back. After doing the chemo and rads, the dr. said, \"You know, just because tamox failed you doesn't mean you can't try another hormonal. Since chemo hasn't really worked, let's try Femara.\" Okay, fine. But for the first time these past few weeks I have been feeling pain in the spine where the tumors are. Before, I hadn't felt anything. Well, I know they progressed from the scan in April, but it's kind of scary to actually feel it. So my question is, could it just be that it takes time? I really hate that I could be feeling bad and the cancer could be improving, OR I could be feeling great and the cancer is progressing, there is no way to know.

They hemmed and hawed and said it wouldn't make a difference. I said he spent half the past year on antibiotics, so do the dang surgery! They did, and wouldn't you know, never again did he have strep, and he also stopped wetting the bed (never did find the connection there, LOL).  But with my having kidney stones and being told over the phone that it was just gas, with having strep myself and almost dying, and a million other instances, I had to be much more forceful and demanding than I was used to. You can't be \"nice\" although you don't have to be obnoxious, either. I think it has to do with it being an HMO and trying to save money. Nice in theory, except it hurts the patients. ",

He said he would contact my onc and one of them would get back to me. He is a world renowned doctor so he is almost impossible to reach, but I haven't heard from either doctor.  I don't know, maybe my symptoms have receded a bit because of the Gemzar I was switched to. But if it is the methotrexate, has anyone else been on it? Oral or intrathecal? I do not particularly want to get a spinal tap on a \"regular basis.\" But I'm not sure the Gemzar is working, either. My MRI/CT of the brain found no actual brain tumors, but \"dural thickening.\" The neurosurgeon said that sometimes they would insert a catheter into that area or some other such thing (can't remember details) but that my space was \"way too small\" for that due to the dural thickening. Spinal tap found no cancer cells in spinal fluid, but apparently the skull mets are trying to bully their way into my meninges and brain? Gah.  Log in to post a reply",

I honestly can't think of a single downside to zometa. No symptoms at all. As to the ONJ, I spoke with both my oncologist and my dentist, and both of them said it was very rare (couldn't remember the last time they had dealt with it) and in most cases could have been prevented with better dental hygiene. Please tell your mom that it's a lot of worry over nothing. It takes 20 minutes for an infusion once a month, and it really strengthens the bones, especially if she isn't taking calcium. Can she at least take vitamin D? And were her kidney stones calcium based? I've had kidney stones a few times, but mine were mostly uric acid, not calcium deposits.

If your kids can see you laugh about things, it seems so much less frightening. The first time I did chemo, I had my son shave my head. He was about 15 or so, and as I watched the hair fall, I had to really try hard not to have the tears fall, too. Instead of crying, I grabbed the three wigs I had bought and tried them on all my kids (at the time, 15, 14, and 4 years old). My kids laughed hysterically to see the 4-year-old in a wig, and they still talk about the fun night we all goofed off with the wigs. My little one is now 7, and the way I explained to him was that a few cells got loose and set up shop in my sacrum. When I explained what the sacrum was, he said in tones of total disbelief, \"You mean you have cancer in your BUTT now?!?\" So now it's not metastatic cancer, it's mom's butt blob. Somehow it's easier to deal with it by making fun of it or laughing at it. Because we all know if we don't laugh, we'll cry. One thing I can say is that my kids and I are much closer than their friends and friends' parents are. They've been through so much that it has brought out a compassion and wisdom that they probably wouldn't have had otherwise. Even so, I wish they could have gotten the compassion and wisdom some other way!",

There are plenty of other anti-nausea drugs, from the oldies-but-goodies like compazine to the newer ones like Kytril. Before you give up, maybe you can see if you can alter some things. Also, did you just start at 3000 mg/day? My onc had me start with one pill twice a day for three days, then 2 a day for 3 days, etc. until I got to my current dose.

You do NOT have to hide it from your husband, either. I assume it's an attempt not to worry him, but that's what marriage is for, to join together to face life's trials. If both of you are trying so hard to protect one another, you'll end up in your own little worlds and miss out on the immense support you can offer each other. Even both of you admitting you're scared stupid can be a support!  It took me awhile to admit that I needed to take meds for depression. I kept saying that \"It's not a chemical imbalance, I'm just grieving!\" Well, who cares what causes it?! Taking meds (in my case, Lexapro) has helped me function instead of being a weepy, watery mess. Once you get the depression under control, you can face any other issues you have to. Without help, everything seems hopeless. There is no need for you to struggle with depression on top of cancer. ",

There are other, better-case scenarios that are probably more realistic than the worst. As to our children, I think they can become stronger and more sensitive to others. Not that they are better off because of our cancer (NOT!) but that dealing with something like this can make a lot of kids more mature simply because they have endured more. My son has been dealing with my cancer since he was 4. He occasionally gets anxious, but mostly he is able to adjust. Right now I'm stable. I don't give him a lot of details, but he sees me take handfuls of pills and I go to a lot of doctor visits, so it's out there for him to see.

I had almost immediate progression with Taxol, Abraxane, Xeloda, and now I have the sneaking suspicion that my 4-month honeymoon with Halaven might be coming to a close. I still have several more chemos to try (Navelbine, Gemzar, Xempra, etc.) but I don't anticipate more than 3 months on any of them, if my past is any indication.  Is it possible, once the chemos are exhausted, to go back to, say Femara? I got a good 18 months out of Femara. My onc said the Afinitor is only approved for use with Aromasin (which I got a year out of), but if all else fails, could I be successful on Femara/Afinitor? Has anyone tried that?  I'm just trying to look at long-term options here. The hormonals were good to me. Chemos, not so much. Anyone with experience in re-doing a chemo or hormonal?

Mum spent the week before Christmas in the hospital. She was released on Christmas Eve, on a constant flow of oxygen. The week after Christmas, she went back to the hospital. That time, they started treating her with Navalbean. She went to the ER in mid January, and came home with a walker. The last week of January, she was struggling to breathe even with her oxygen turned up to 5 (the highest that particular machine went), so she was admitted to the hospital yet again. She was released to in-home hospice care last Tuesday. Her body can't handle any more treatments. We have a hospital bed set up in the living room, but she hates it. She gets up every 10-20 minutes all day and night. I found that a Flexeril and two Ativan let her sleep for about 3 hours, but I don't want to over-use it. She says she's scared of the bed, especially when we put up the rails on both sides. She gets really upset when we try to talk her out of getting up. She feels held captive, but she's also confused. For example, she heard us talking about the wheelchair and where to put it, and she thought she was going to the hospital. Do you have any ideas of how to keep her comfortable and calm? We wouldn't mind her getting up so much if she could do it on her own, but she has to have help to stand up, and then it takes lots of effort for her to lay comfortably, only for her to try to get up again 5 minutes later. It's wearing us all out, but we don't her to have to go to a nursing home. Log in to post a reply",

I do trust him, and he is very knowledgeable and kind. He said rads would be a possibility, but that it usually only shrinks tumors, not eliminates them, and he would rather have this one eliminated. He wasn't going to treat them any differently, except that when I got the brain MRI (for the 1st time in 3 years) it was a bit worrisome, apparently. He talked with the neurosurgeon, who said he would at least like to meet with me and talk about things. So I'll let you know tomorrow how that goes. Sandilee, you're right in that my onc explained that for some weird reason, my cancer only \"likes\" bones. He said they go through the bloodstream and right past the organs, but for some reason \"set up shop\" in the bones. But apparently if they press onto brain tissue long enough, it can kind of \"tempt fate.\" It's not hugely common, but it does apparently happen and he is trying to be proactive.",

(I told my onc that he REALLY needed to get new magazines because everything he had was either some golfing magazine or a cancer magazine, usually a year out of date..) Anyway, flipping through the cancer magazines (sorry, I hate golf), I noticed a pattern. I don't remember the title (something about \"Living with Cancer\" I think) but every article had a common theme. Didn't matter whether they were discussing thyroid cancer, breast cancer, or leukemia, it was the same thing: How to make it through treatment.  It's pretty sad when someone with cancer looks at an entire magazine about cancer, and there is not ONE article about long-term, permanent treatment. Every article had the word \"survivor\" in it, complete with pictures of happy looking bald people or families looking chipper and relaxed. No articles about how to talk to friends and family about being in treatment forever. No articles about how to handle \"the Talk\" with your onc, or how to choose good hospice care. In fact, they frame the idea of stage four with things like, \"There is always the worry that things won't go the way we want,\" or \"Anxiety about worsening disease can be stressful.\" It's like we're invisible. We aren't pink and pretty, so let's focus on what cancer patients really want, which is to be told only good news, only positive stuff. Heaven forbid someone should actually be called (gasp!) terminal.  Like I said,I know this has been discussed before, but I just wanted to rant to people who get it. My family is very sympathetic, but they just nod and agree with me and I don't think they get it at all, sigh... Log in to post a reply",

I told him I was nervous about lowering it so much that it's not effective, and he said it was in the literature that it's a viable option. He said it's akin to a loading dose vs. a maintenance dose.  Fortunately, my blood counts have been really good, so I haven't needed any neulasta, etc. The hair that fell out the first month is already a half-inch long again, so that's good. Almost no nausea or mouth sores. I take Neurontin for the neuropathy, but I don't know how well it's working. The only thing that really works is skipping a week when it gets bad!

From now on, I will not share my medical information with you.\" If she has no information, she will either move on to something else, or she'll spread rumors about how mean and horrible you are. In fact, she would probably count on your not wanting to \"look bad\" to others as a way to manipulate you.  The sad truth is, all the issues you mention are HER problems, and you can't force her to do the right thing. Can't force her to do anything, in fact. So, given her free agency to be as much as a jerk as she wants, the only thing YOU can do is to protect yourself. I agree that you need to set your finances in order. (Then, wicked me, I would thank her sweetly for suggesting the idea in the first place and tell her that you have followed her advice and gotten your finances all set, letting her know that all your money is spoken for, ignoring any questions about whether or not she will get any...) As to your husband, that's a hard one. He probably has spent his entire life walking on eggshells because to go against her means to face her wrath/manipulation/withdrawal of affection and to be portrayed as such a horrible person that it has always been easier to let her get her way. My daughter, whom I love with all my heart, had a tiny streak of that...when upset, she would lash out enough that sometimes people let her get her way in order to avoid dealing with the drama. I think I have helped her to see herself as others do, and she is much better about it. Your husband may need to be faced with two very plain options:  1. He could continue deferring to her and thus the problem will remain long after you are gone. Or 2. He could gently but firmly stand up to her, with you by his side, showing her that you are a team. As a bonus, if he were to do this, he would have a vaster amount of respect and appreciation from you, and he might find that your love and connection is far superior to the superficial relationship he has with his mother. ",

But a year ago I had zero income (just retired on disability but didn't get any income for several months after) so of course I qualified. Then I got my Virginia disability retirement and SSDI, and being a good little citizen, I wrote a letter to my social worker to verify that I now had income. No response.  So then I get a little nervous. Am I now above a certain level where I won't qualify? So I look up \"Medically needy\" on all the government sites I can find, and all that I can find is impossible for my 3-cell brain to understand. For example: \"Each source of income received by a member of the FU/BU is evaluated and the countable amount determined based on the policy in this chapter. The countable amount of each FU/BU member\u2019s income is added to the countable amount of the income of all other FU/BU members. That total is used to determine the income eligibility of each individual within that FU/BU. The FU/BU\u2019s total countable income is compared to the income limit that is applicable to the individual\u2019s classification and to the number of members in the FU/BU.\" Huh? All I want to know is, if I'm medically needy, is there an income limit that if I exceed it I will be kicked out of Medicaid? There is no way I can afford Obamacare. I'm getting a little frantic here. I can't even find if the income limit is anywhere near the Federal Poverty Level (like, some programs say \"200% of the federal poverty level\", etc.) I've tried local, state, and federal handbooks on line, as well as non-government programs, but I can't find this information anywhere!

She asked me a bunch of questions and we have both pretty much decided that the SOB has been caused by too rapid weight gain over too short a time.

My lungs have felt much better today, which we both thought is likely related to the fact that I've been off steroids for a few days and I'm losing all that water weight and food cravings.  One thing I've learned from my kids is that it is TOTALLY understandable why in ancient days people thought seizures were caused by evil spirits.

Since I took off chemo this week, I've noticed I've lost a little bit of weight,and it's made all the difference. So I guess my instinct was right.  My onc ordered an MRI for tomorrow to be sure my brain is okay after the seizure. He is concerned that my skull mets are pressing on the brain, and if so, he will give me a spinal tap and insert chemo into the spine/brain to hopefully zap it. He doesn't think it's a big deal but he wants to be certain.  In the meantime, I spent ALL DAY yesterday in bed! And for once I didn't even feel like a slacker. I just gave myself a treat and slept off and on throughout the day and read a lot and watched TV. My youngest 2 kids and I have a tradition of reading all the Harry Potter books each summer.

Of course, things always get worse over the weekend, don't they?! Had pneumonia a year ago, very severe. Have had fluid around left lung since then, mostly with no symptoms. Since starting Gemzar, (which has a side effect of shortness of breath, and in rare cases can severely damage the lungs to the point of fatality) I've had a crackle in the left lung. They drained 1/2 a liter of fluid, but the crackle has persisted. Put me on steroids for 3 days after infusion, which helps me feel great, but has caused severe weight gain...and the crackle persists. Onc has been ambivalent about switching chemos because I don't have many left and because it has worked so well with so few other side effects.  So I get the infusion Mondays, 3 out of 4 weeks. The past few weeks have gotten steadily worse with regard to shortness of breath. Last week I was able (VERY slowly) to swim 16 laps if I paused between each one. This week I could barely manage half that.  So yesterday and today it's gotten to the point where I feel like there is a tight band around  my lower ribs and lower lungs. I have gained over 20 pounds in the past month from the steroids. I am out of breath and exhausted just puttering around the house.  So is it the weight that is making me feel like there is no room in my body for my lungs to expand? Or is it the Gemzar that is irritating the lungs and causing such severe shortness of breath? I was going to go in on Monday for my infusion and talk to the nurse...but I don't know if I can stand this horrid feeling of there simply not being enough room in my body for my organs. It feels like my lower ribs are separating from the pressure.  Has anyone ever experienced this?! Is it worth it to go to the ER and do a bunch of tests? I had the fluid drained only a month ago, so I can't imagine a huge tumor suddenly sprouting up in that time. I just dread going to the hospital.

I've been on it for about 6 months due to severe fatigue. My onc prescribed it and it has enabled me to function. Doesn't give me any superpowers (I wish) but at least I can survive the day.  So I'm about to run out, I go get the prescription, and they tell me I need prior authorization. My onc's office goes to bat for me, but calls me to say the insurance still won't approve it. \\ So now I've completely run out and have gone from 20 mg twice a day to nothing. I am not thrilled about stopping psych drugs cold turkey. I cannot function. I am walking around like a zombie. Is this going to be my life from now on?! I am so depressed and fed up I don't even know what to do.  And then I find that all of my Medicaid claims are being rejected because the stupid social worker entered my date of birth wrong (said June instead of March). Do you have any idea how impossible it is to fix an error in government computer systems?! I will be fighting this for years, I bet. I would scream ,if I had the energy. Thanks for letting me vent.

It says in the instructions (which I will keep and guard with my life, LOL) whom you HAVE to include as part of your household (myself, my son, and my daughter), and then there's a list of people you do NOT HAVE to include. My son and DIL live with me. They file their own taxes so I've considered them a separate family. If I include my son, I would have to include his income. He works 40 hours a week at $9.35/hour, which is barely enough even living with me, but it would certainly put us beyond the limit. BUT my DIL does not work currently, although she is looking. I can include her, but I don't have to include my son, according to the instructions. If we're a family of 4 instead of 3, I just might qualify for Medicaid.  And unfortunately, the mostly Republican government of VA decided not to expand Medicaid. My brother said incredulously, \"You make $29,000 a YEAR on disability, and your medical expenses are about $20,000 per MONTH, and you don't qualify for Medicaid?!\" This world is definitely FUBAR! At my church today, a woman I know came up to me and asked if I got her email. I said no, and she said that she had spent \"a long time\" talking to one of the state senators about me. Her husband used to be a state senator, so she has \"inside\" connections. She said she will resend the email, which has the number to call for a person who works for the senator and would be happy to help me. Must be nice to have such connections! We'll see what happens.

Just a thought.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but nowadays when people are touched by something they throw money at it. Well, money helps. At least you know they're not donating to Komen or buying pink toenail clippers, right?  The idea of donating directly to a patient would likely mirror your own experience...a lot of people would feel offended or afraid of sounding like they're whining or begging. And there are many people who could use the money but haven't told anyone they have MBC. So I vote for: -If they know someone in treatment, advocate bringing a meal or doing laundry or helping clean their house -if they don't know someone personally, they can donate to a fund your friend can set up and then figure out how you can use it to benefit yourselves and/or others with BC.",

Unfortunately, it didn't work for me, but there are tons of women here who got a lot of good out of it. Compared to chemo infusions, Xeloda is a breeze. Just a few pills a day, no needles! You do have to watch out for hand-foot stuff, though. I used a mix of petroleum jelly and lotion on my hands and feet twice a day and never had any peeling, itching, etc. But because I had neuropathy (numbness and tingling) in my feet from other chemos, I got neuropathy from Xeloda, too. It did make me tired and forgetful, but I was still able to work just fine. And you usually don't have the horrible days like you do with infusions when the chemo \"hits\" you. I didn't really have any other symptoms. There are other threads here about Xeloda if you want other opinions, too. Like you, I have a lot of family support, but sometimes it's good to know you're not alone on this trip.",

I know the long-term purpose of my life, aside to find happiness for myself (raise my son, help my older kids become more independent, etc. etc.) but it's the day-to-day stuff that has gotten me down. I make lists of things I want to do each day. I try to make it simple, not too rigid or demanding. But I find myself bored because I can't do much anymore. The LAST thing I want to do is become a daytime TV junkie (daytime TV is so crappy I can't watch it no matter how bored I get!) How do you all deal with finding purpose in each day when the mind has so many ideas but the body won't cooperate? I'm on antidepressants, so I know it's not that.

But what my kids (grown and young) have told me is that their best memories of me will be the times we have spent at home together, playing cards, reading together, praying together, even doing kitchen chores after dinner. I try very hard to have a sit-down dinner with my kids so that we can talk and laugh together. I don't always manage it, but those small moments are what our kids will hold onto in later years.  Secondly, as to pain...I am with Carolyn - Why on earth hasn't your doctor worked with you on pain?! I would park myself outside his door until he listened to me, because there is no excuse for living with such pain. I've been there, and it colors EVERYTHING you do. You can't enjoy anything when you're in pain, and the effect it has on our minds is huge. No wonder people get depressed when they're in pain! I was trying to find (unsuccessfully) a procedure that my rad onc told me about. When someone has bone mets that are extensive, there is a relatively new procedure where they give some form of radiation to the entire body. It's primarily done for pain. But when I looked up \"whole body radiation\" I got something completely different. Grr. If the Xeloda doesn't alleviate your pain, maybe you could ask your doctor about it. Either way, I hope Xeloda works for you for a long time. I do have to say that when I was on Afinitor, after awhile it REALLY wore me down. I couldn't believe that I was happier doing Halaven chemo than Afinitor/Aromasin. My quality of life was much better. ",

Well, I'm smart enough to know I can't do much, so I figured I'd be the driller and drill some screws into the subfloor. Maybe a half-hour of drilling, tops, and I took it easy.  Then I made sure to take my afternoon dose of oxycontin because I knew I'd probably be a bit sore, muscle-wise. Sure enough, I was a bit sore. But nothing I couldn't handle. I had my son slap on a pain patch. Then I noticed a slightly sharper pain in the ribs on the FRONT, as if the muscle pain in my back was going through to the front. I've never felt that before, but it wasn't that major and it didn't last, just kind of hurt if I moved a certain way. So I stuck a pain patch there, too.  All was well until, while I was sitting in my bed on my laptop, out of NOWHERE (I wasn't bending, moving, doing anything) I got the worst pain in my life. It was as if someone stabbed my back with an ice pick and it went right through almost to the front of me. I screamed and my DIL, who was in the room, raced over to see what was going on. I was in tears, but it went away. Then I blew my nose, and the pain seared through me again.  I have no idea what is going on. I'm afraid to move. It is the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, and I've felt a lot of pain! It's not a torn muscle, as far as I can tell. I don't think it's a nerve pain, although it was very sharp and defined. And I can still breathe okay, so I doubt it's lung-related. The best I could describe it is, like an 8-inch sliver of wood stabbing through my right side, a few inches below the shoulder blade. My DIL suggested all sorts of things, none of which would correspond to such a sharp pain. I was wondering, since I have extensive mets to the bones (including ribs), is it possible that I could have fractured a rib? I've never had a broken bone before, so I have no idea. Is it possible that the rib was so...I don't know, mushy with cancer? that it just spintered?!  I really, really don't want to go to the ER yet again. I'm thinking of just waiting it out and seeing what happens. In the meantime, I'm afraid to move, sneeze, wiggle, laugh, cry...even going to the bathroom was pathetic, because I moved so slowly and was so afraid that peeing or pooping would bring the pain back!

Onc has been ambivalent about switching chemos because I don't have many left and because it has worked so well with so few other side effects.  So I get the infusion Mondays, 3 out of 4 weeks. The past few weeks have gotten steadily worse with regard to shortness of breath. Last week I was able (VERY slowly) to swim 16 laps if I paused between each one. This week I could barely manage half that.  So yesterday and today it's gotten to the point where I feel like there is a tight band around  my lower ribs and lower lungs. I have gained over 20 pounds in the past month from the steroids. I am out of breath and exhausted just puttering around the house.  So is it the weight that is making me feel like there is no room in my body for my lungs to expand? Or is it the Gemzar that is irritating the lungs and causing such severe shortness of breath? I was going to go in on Monday for my infusion and talk to the nurse...but I don't know if I can stand this horrid feeling of there simply not being enough room in my body for my organs. It feels like my lower ribs are separating from the pressure.  Has anyone ever experienced this?! Is it worth it to go to the ER and do a bunch of tests? I had the fluid drained only a month ago, so I can't imagine a huge tumor suddenly sprouting up in that time. I just dread going to the hospital. It stresses my kids horribly and I hate, hate, hate being there. I'm sure you gals can relate. Any advice?! Log in to post a reply",

I started thinking maybe it could be, although it's on the wrong side and didn't really match up to the descriptions on line.  Either way, I have a cardiogram tomorrow morning and a CT on Thursday. THey're going to give me a different contrast AND premedicate me, but I'm still nervous about anaphylaxis. At least I'll be a few steps away from the ER when they do it! I also found that I somehow managed to gain TWELVE POUNDS in one week. I told the nurse \"That is NOT fat!\" She agreed ,said it was more likely water retention. No wonder I'm having shortness of breath that is getting severe! So hopefully I'll find out what the deal is tomorrow or Thursday, because my quality of life at the moment STINKS!

I don't know how old your kids are, but just talking about it with them will go a long way toward calming their worries. Our kids have had to be more resilient than most. I think they have the ability to be in the land of DeNile (in a healthy way) much more than adults do, and in a short while your kids will likely just accept that this is one of those cancer things.  And in the meantime, YOU did not ruin the holiday for your family! It's just a stupid fact of cancer that it causes dumb crises like this. It doesn't erase any of the good times you have had already.

Older kids would pass by (it was held at an elementary school) and keep looking at me out of the corner of their eyes, and I would give them a bright, cheery smile and they would usually smile back and be okay. But some of the younger kids would stare, wide-eyed and fearful, as if I were some monster that they couldn't name. I did, however, meet another crafter, a man with 4 elementary-aged kids whose wife died 2 months ago from a rare form of throat cancer. He looked at me and said quietly, \"What you got?\" It took me a minute to realize he was referring to my bald head. I told him and then he shared his story. I could tell he was just so lonely and needed to talk to someone who understood. Aside from knowing about cancer, I also lost my spouse when my youngest was 6 months old, so I understood him more than most. So sometimes being bald brings out the worst in people, while at others it brings out the best. I know that poor man was clinging to me (metaphorically speaking!) in desperation, just wanting to not feel alone in his pain. I just wish I could explain to all the little kids that I'm not really scary. I could explain to them if they stopped, but a lot of them were just walking by. Sigh.",

As to the brain MRI, my onc always said that there would usually be symptoms that would make him suspect brain mets. Well, when my skull mets started trying to break through to the brain, I definitely had symptoms: vision issues, severe headaches, etc. And it wasn't until about 2 years into my diagnosis that he suggested a baseline MRI just because he hadn't done it before. So not all MRIs are for brain mets. Your onc could just be being cautious. Also, considering that MRI results are MY records, I decided to return the next day and get the results myself. I thought I'd have to park myself in the hospital where it was done and argue all day. But nope, they printed out a copy and gave it to me with no fuss.  My onc is okay with that because he knows I can't wait for results and he knows I pretty much know the terminology. You might want to call the office of wherever you get the MRI (or talk to them when you do get it) and tell them you'll be stopping by the next day to get a printout of the results. You can stress that you do NOT need (unless you really want it) a copy of the images, just the written part. That way you won't have to wait forever for the doctor to tell you that your brain is (hopefully) JUST FINE.:-) Either way, we're here for you. This disease truly stinks. ",

It's easier for me than Xeloda was. It's often taken with another chemo but I'm just on the Gemzar. It doesn't have nearly the neuropathy that other chemos can have. Mostly side effects are constipation, a bit of nausea, constipation, fatigue, and did I mention constipation? For the first few days after treatment, I take an extra laxative and eat lots of fiber, or else I'd be going nuts. Oh, and flatulence is another side effect. My blood counts have been fine, though.

So they don't want him and me in the same school, I guess. It was okay to be there last year, yet somehow this year they waited until the last moment of last week to tell me that instead of going to my school to set up my classroom, I needed to go to the HR department.  I started the Halaven Friday, so I'm grateful I had the weekend. There is nausea, but it's really mostly when I have to have a bowel movement, which is weird. And I was jittery from the steroid they gave me. It looks like the day I get the steroid, I'm fine because of the steroids, but the next 2 days I just feel...icky. But compared to taxol, etc., I can't complain! Do you know if hair loss happens with Halaven? I've read conflicting reports on it. My son says if I lose my hair, I can show up before the school board when the time comes, looking like the frail, crippled widow that I am, and my principal will look like a big meanie! I just don't get why, as soon as he realized I had a disability (which I did NOT advertise) he went after me relentlessly. What makes people do that? Seven years of great evaluations, yet suddenly I'm incompetent. Go figure. I never asked for special treatment, but I just don't get how people can go out of their way to be mean. Anyway, at least I can do the work...filing and copying and other boring, tedious, useless things instead of teaching...I am trying to be grateful that I CAN work, at least. ",

They couldn't do a CT scan (which would have helped much quicker) due to my severe allergy to the dye, so they had to admit me to wait until they could do a VQ study or some such thing to rule out a blood clot in my lung. After one of the worst night's sleep in my life last night, I woke at 7 a.m. for the stupid test (which was actually mercifully short) and they said no blood clot. But my \"D-dimer\" was elevated, which is why they thought it could be that in the first place. The idiot doc on call was a woman who assumed that because the test was negative, I must be having an anxiety attack.  I said, yeah, then why can the ER docs hear \"diminished breath sounds\" and cracxkles in my left lung? Was I faking that?! She backed down a bit but seemed adamant that I was having an anxiety attack and needed to prescribe ativan. I told her I already had more than enough (which only confirmed in her mind that I was anxious) and she went on her way.  So I went home, utterly exhausted, and lay down on my bed to have a nap. My son came in to say goodbye as he and his big brother were on their way to church...only to once AGAIN find me in the middle of a grand mal seizure!! At least this time they knew what to do. My oldest son turned me on my side, my DD called 911, and within an hour of coming home, there I was back at the ER. I was really out of it (apparently they asked me 3 times if I could say the President's name and I couldn't tell them, although I have no memory of that).  The doc on call was a no-nonsense guy who was kind but honest, which is rare at such places. He said that if a person's neural pathways are already \"set\" toward a seizure, there are a few things that would cause it: 1. suddenly going off seizure meds (nope), 2. sleep deprivation (um, yup!) and 3., morning. He said many, if not most seizures of that sort happen in the first few hours of awakening. I realized I'd had 5 seizures so far, and ALL of them were within an hour or so after waking up. I'd never noticed.  He scoffed at the idea of anxiety \"causing\" seizures and rolled his eyes. He said it was likely my lousy night and it being right after waking up, and also because I usually take my seizure meds at 7 or so and the hospital didn't get them to me until almost 11 a.m.this morning. He said usually that wouldn't be an issue, but with the other stuff going on, it could have just added to things.  So anyway, the one nice thing is that my church has informed me that people are bringing meals every night for 3 days. I can't even imagine standing in the kitchen, let alone cooking, so I'm thrilled. Unfortunately, I don't know if I will be able to eat it...apparently when I seized, I bit my tongue pretty badly.  So now I have sores on either side of my tongue, pretty severe ones, as well as sores right at the corners of my mouth, caused by the chemo, I'm sure. So all it all, I can hardly swallow or eat. Maybe that will help me lose weight, haha.  Thanks again SO much for your thoughts and prayers. They were effective and comforting and did not go unnoticed.  :-)",

The onc said that even though usually skull mets don't turn into brain mets, if it pushes long enough it will push through the meninges and into the brain, and we don't want that. So they surgically removed it. It was about 2 inches square, and they cut my skull from ear to ear, like a hairband would be. They cut out the tumor, put in bone putty and mesh, and superglued my skin back. (I can only say that in this forum, because most people start gagging at this point) I expected severe headaches for weeks afterwards, but It didn't hurt nearly as much as I would have thought. And they only shaved a small area of my bangs. My neurosurgeon is world class. The only complication was that I had a grand mal seizure the night I came home from the hospital. It was a relatively rare side effect caused by swelling of the area that put pressure on my brain. Although it terrified my son, who was (fortunately) sleeping in my king-sized bed with me, he was able to call 911 and I spent another night at the hospital. Never had another seizure, and the wound can hardly be seen. I also have a smaller tumor at the base of the skull, the \"clivus,\" whatever that is. I told my surgeon it sounded vaguely obscene! He said surgery in that area would be a good 2-week hospital stay, and that gamma knife would take care of it in one shot. I'm planning on doing that soon. I hope some of this helps. It just seems so unfair that we always have to strive to keep a balance between having a coherant brain or being in pain.

He explained that nerve damage happens a lot. He told me that it was pretty certain that I'd have numbness there, which I do (but who cares if your underarm is numb, you don't notice it except for having to be careful while shaving, and who needs to shave during chemo, anyway?!?) Maybe the drs. were nervous about nerve damage but didn't want to say anything? I did my first stint of bc without any insurance. What infuriates me is that now that I have BC/BS, I see how much of a discount they give the insurance companies! Whereas I had to pay, say, a thousand dollars to the hospital for a scan, BC/BS only has to pay, like $300!!! WIthout any insurance, my rads treatment was about $40 thousand. Each chemo (done in the hospital because I did have hospital-only medicaid) was $25,000. Neulasta shots:$2,500 each. SOMEBODY out there is making a ton of money. Nobody can tell me it really costs anywhere near that much, including salaries, equipment, etc.",

And that I can get accelerated death benefits from my life insurance (which I didn't even know I had, so talk about free money!!). AND because once I found that I was going to be fired as soon as the school board met, I went and retired on disability, the paperwork all says \"disability retirement\" instead of \"dismissal.\" It still irks me that so many people assumed I was a terrible teacher when I gave 100% of my time to students with emotional disabilities who still contact me and let me know I was their favorite teacher. I have to keep that in mind and remember that politics play such a ridiculous role in things like this, and I am SO glad I got out when I did. In fact, I have considered writing my former principal a thank you note, telling him that because he tried to fire me, I'm now living a great life, with all the money I need, and am able to be home with my family. I won't do it, but I'm sure tempted! I truly thought I would have to work until I dropped dead. ",

It has NEVER made me high, and in fact, I refer to it as making me \"low,\" because I used to feel under water and mentally slow. Now, it's just there, it does its job.

I told him my regular onc and I had worked it out, and it was what worked for me. He went on a long rant about how it could cause me to take more than I should, I could overdose since the dosages were overlapping, yada yada. Well, I mentioned it to my onc, who is a colleague of him, and he blew his top! He said, \"If it works for you, we are continuing it. If HE wants to take over your pain management for the REST OF YOUR LIFE, I'd be happy to transfer it to him. But if not, he needs to keep his big mouth SHUT about his opinions that have nothing to do with him!\" I just started laughing because it was nice to have a doctor stand up for me like that. And it was all over 10 flipping milligrams of the stuff! My point is, we do what we have to do to get by. You don't owe anyone, even a loved family member, any explanation. If you and your daughter begin to make steps to make up, you might tell her that it's okay for you both to \"agree to disagree\" but not discuss it.

I kept telling her things like \"You just have to try harder,\" and \"How can you drop out of college because you're feeling a little blue?!\" I have long since apologized because I learned (slowly) about depression and how it affects people. So I try to be understanding and educate others about MBC.

She was doing very well on Herceptin, and when she moved to this area, she just could not seem to face going to find an oncologist and continuing the whole thing. Her husband kept nagging her to go find a doctor, but she didn't. For about 2 years, she was on no treatment and was NED. But then symptoms started, and she is back on treatment. I think for her, she needed that denial period, but I don't know that I could do that. I've never been on Herceptin, but I also haven't been NED, either, so I guess I don't know what I'd do.  I guess the important thing is to support one another, even if we shake our heads at some people's decisions. I also know that sometimes when we haven't faced that exact situation, we think we know what we'd do.  I vividly remember telling anyone who would listen that when *I* had my baby, he was NOT going to be in a crib, because cribs looked like jails, and we were going to do the \"natural\" thing and have him sleep with us. Yeah, right. That lasted until he could crawl, and boy, did we then go out and buy a crib! I'm sure many of my friends were snickering behind my back. But I learned the hard way that sometimes when we're faced with something scary or bad, we react quite differently than we think we would. I don't know about the poster everyone is mentioning, but I figure, if it makes her happy to tell people she's in remission, or even cured, then so be it. I hope she is. But if she isn't, we will still be here to support her, because facing progression after telling everyone she might be cured must be even harder. ",

My dad's dad died of leukemia about 10 years before I was born, and I only heard great things about him from my dad. But aside from some pictures and his death certificate, he was just a name to me growing up.  But all that changed when his childhood best friend sent me some stuff a few years back. In among that stuff was a letter my grandfather wrote to him when he was 16...from France, where he had lied about his age in order to serve in WWI.  That letter is the only window into my grandfather's personality that I have. I have treasured not only the cool information he provides (he was a bugler and got regularly pelted with shoes when he played to wake everyone up!) but also it showed me what this stranger was like when he was a teenager, facing far more dangerous situations than I had ever dreamed.  My point is, for all of you who, like me, haven't started the diary/journal/scrapbook/letters for our kids, let yourselves off the hook a bit. Those of you with older kids will not forget you, and those of you with younger kids, there are plenty of things you can do that won't sound like \"This is the Last Message from your dearly departed mother...\" Just writing down your thoughts in general, not even about cancer, but what you think of your wacky cousin Hortense, or how much you hate pistachios, or how grateful you are that you live in a warm climate...ANYTHING will be treasured by your kids. The most fascinating details for them will be the most mundane ones. Having a child say, \"Oh, THAT'S where I get that habit from!\" or \"I love that TV show, too!\" creates a bond between you and your child that death cannot break.  Anyway, I thought I would share that. Sure, in my mind I will have written a letter for all my family members, my own eulogy, letters to people who annoyed me in life (so I'm not the most pure-hearted person all the time, so sue me), and I'll have all the important papers, passwords, etc. all nicely filed...will that actually happen? I have no idea. But I do know that my family members know how much I love them and that, while no amount of letters, videos, etc. would ever be enough for them, at least they will have an idea of who I was and what kind of person I was. ",

I think I just need a bit of encouragement, which you ladies are so good at doing! I work in a middle school teaching kids with emotional disabilities. It's always a stressful job, but I love the children and I really think I make a difference. But my colleagues and boss are a different matter. Colleagues seem to believe that I'm not a \"real\" teacher, despite my master's degree, because I only teach a half-dozen children. (A half-dozen children who are on enough meds to kill a horse, who curse at me and throw tantrums and get into fist fights and end up in mental hospitals...) But I love the kids so I can deal with that. But my principal...he is young and ambitious and new (2nd year) and seems to want total control. And for some reason, he has set his sights on me. Last week, he wrote me TWO letters of reprimand for my permanent file. One of them was because I wrote in a note to a sub that my students could \"goof off\" for the last 10 minutes of the period if they had been good. He told me that \"goof off\" was an \"entirely inappropriate term\" and that if I didn't understand that then \"maybe you should be in a different profession.\" Gee, I had no idea that \"goof off\" was an obscenity!! But on the good side, I have a great union representative who is meeting with me tomorrow to help write letters of rebuttal. She told me that she had stopped by the human resources department and told the head of HR that if nothing else, she was demanding that this principal accept and acknowledge the fact that I have cancer and that he \"darn well ought to deal with it.\" He makes a huge deal out of everything to do with the cancer, without actually ackowledging that I have it. For example, the HR people told me that on my leave slips I need to write \"FMLA leave\" (not that it really matters since I take sick leave,and then leave without pay once that is gone). So he emails me to complain that \"I thought you had an ear infection. Why did you write FMLA when that wasn't related to your disability?\" I told him that my treatments made me prone to infections, so it was related. I mean, seriously, what does it matter?! Another time, I wanted to be proactive, so I told him several days in advance that I would be taking off the afternoon for my scans. He responded with a curt note that he had not seen my leave slip, so he could only assume that I was trying to take off work \"for free.\" Seriously?! When I've worked extra if I take so much as five minutes off in the past?! I'm just worried that I will lose my job. I can't transfer to another school because he put me on an \"improvement plan\" last year and won't remove it, even though I completed everything (and more) that was required. I can't move to another district because with these letters of reprimand, no one would hire me. I have worked here for 7 years and have had only good performance evaluations, and then this guy comes in and my file is down the toilet. I would give anything to just quit and go on disability, but I can't see how I could ever afford it. I have family who support me 100%, but they don't understand and they just hurt for me. My best friend died, as did my husband,and my friend who lived with me for 3 years and was like a sister to me had a psychotic episode a few months back and tried to kill me. Needless to say, she is now out of my life. So I'm feeling a tad alone and sorry for myself right now. Log in to post a reply",

The next day he was so \"out of it\" that I was alarmed and took him to the ER. He was admitted with sepsis and died that night. It was so sudden and nobody could believe it, least of all me. My SIL and I are very close, and she was pretty devastated, too. After a few months, she and I got to talking and we agreed that if I died, I would need some kind of insurance to care for my kids (at the time, they were 14, 13, and 5 months). She got the policy for me and has paid the premiums all this time. She is not the beneficiary, my kids are. If I died, she would care for my youngest, who is 11, since now my oldest 2 are out of the house. However, I think it would be a good idea to ask for a copy of it. SHe may have even given me one once, but if so, I have no idea where it would be. She would be happy to do that; she is very up front with money and stuff like that. Bon, I LOVE your idea about writing the certified letter! Do you think it's \"going behind the back\" of the union rep? (I call her the union rep because it's easy...it's actually the \"education association.\" Not sure if that makes a difference. Everyone calls it the union, anyway). I really like the rep, but I feel that she just doesn't know what else to do except help me come up with defenses to all these nitpicky things. There must be 50 of them that he listed, half of them things that I already rebutted previously. I've been copying out all my emails, my improvement plan stuff, performance evaluations, etc. I even have a file box to help organize the stuff. It's just so pathetic!

It definitely helps to know that I'm not the only one going through this and that there are things I can do. When I'm depressed, nothing comes to mind, so I appreciate the suggestions. Today I did a craft fair. I do them during the winter holidays but since I'm on disability now I figured I would try the spring ones. Well, we didn't even make fifty bucks, so at least I know I'm not missing much! But I came across a guy from the fall craft fair, one who had lost his wife to a rare esophageal cancer about 6 months ago. He was selling gourmet coffees a few booths down. It was good to see that he is doing reasonably well after his wife's passing. I think it was good for me to see that our loved ones can survive once we are gone. He will obviously always deeply miss his wife, but he is moving on slowly.  He shared a cute photo he took that he knew I would understand. He had cried out a few nights back for his wife, just to know she was there, sort of a \"Give me a sign\" thing. He told the kids to clean up after breakfast and then they went off to school. He went into the kitchen and saw two cheerios and a smear of milk that looked like a really cute smiley face. When his kids got home, he casually asked them what they had had for breakfast, and none of them had had cheerios. He admitted that maybe it was coincidence, but said, \"Hey, I'll take it as a sign.

I get tired of \"taking one day at a time,\" but I sometimes need to, I guess.  I wonder, is acupressure as good as acupuncture? Just curious. Anyway, at least I know I'm not the only one sick of the winter! I'm in Virginia, and we usually have maybe 4-5 days of snow a year. We've gone double past that. Normally this time of year I'd be out planting peas or whatever.  Moondancer, I used to have Silkies! We have only 5 hens at the moment (since I live in the suburbs I'm just grateful to have any) and I really miss silkies. They are so docile and cute. One lady on line had them at her daughter's wedding, dyed pink, with tiaras! She described how a little old lady insisted on knowing what animal it was, and she finally got annoyed and told her, \"It's a cross between a poodle and a chicken.\" She said that somewhere, in some pet store, a little old lady was likely asking for such an animal! (For those of you who don't know what a silkie hen is, google image it and see. They are amazing little birds!!)",

I did find that my local farmer's market will be accepting food stamps this year, and not only that, but they will give an extra $10 for every $10 you spend! So I am thinking that in a month or so I should start feeling a lot better. Not to mention more daylight hours and all that. I'll likely only have food stamps for another month or two, so I want to use them well! I just finished a really sobering book called the Secret History of the War against Breast Cancer. It really pushed for environmental, not genetic, causes of breast cancer. Aside from being depressing (all the conflicts of interest between chemical companies and toxic waste companies and the American Cancer Society, etc.) it made me look at all the negative influences in my life. I know the cancer likely started from something in my childhood that I will never figure out, and I'm okay with that, but I also realized that I haven't been watching the things I have been eating lately, not just in case they cause cancer, but because they influence how I feel. The lousier I eat, the lousier I feel. Pretty simple, huh. Sigh. ",

Maybe it's the doctors trying to be in denial, too! But then the doctors (not to mention the patients) feel gobsmacked when it comes back cancer.  My OB/GYN told me, when I told him about the original lump, that \"90% of these lumps are noncancerous, so we'll check it out, but it's likely nothing.\" Yet somehow I knew he didn't really think it was nothing. It did help reassure me so I didn't freak out (I have no family history), but it didn't help at all when I found it was actually cancer.  Then a few years back, my onc commented on the thyroid nodule that kept showing up on my scans. He told me the same thing, that 90% of thyroid nodules were noncancerous. But he was very honest about the fact that it could be cancer and that we needed to biopsy it. And of course, it was thyroid cancer. I sure wish BC were as easy to treat, sigh.  It's funny, because I consider myself \"cured\" of thyroid cancer, not in remission. I mean, it riddled the thyroid, but had not spread, so they removed the thyroid and the cancer was gone. I would love to say I'm cured of BC (Wouldn't we all!) but even if there were NED for 20 years, I don't know that I would ever get to the point where I could say I was cured. ",

He privately explained to me that the Xgeva would still be in my system during that time, but if the dentist knew that, she would flip out and never do anything on my teeth. I had weird \"zapping\" sensations up and down my spine for the first several days after each shot for maybe 3 months, and since then I've had no side effects whatsoever. I started on Zometa first, then my onc said Xgeva had better results in tests, so we did that. I've been on Xgeva for maybe 2-3 years? No weight gain, no other issues.   For the constipation, I've had it primarily due to narcotic painkillers, so if you're on them, that would be the culprit. My chemo also causes constipation. I found awhile back (and CANNOT find again, grr!!) a paper from the Mayo Clinic about constipation for cancer patients. You can take up to 3 pills 3 times a day, but it has to be a \"sennosides\"  and \"docusate sodium\" kind. Others are too harsh or addicting. I get Walmart Equate stool softener, often in a 2-pack. It's got a green label and \"compare to Peri-Colace\" in tiny letters, in case you want a brand name. I know a lot of people who have great ideas for kicking constipation as an acute issue, but for chronic constipation, this is the only thing that works for me. I take 2 a.m. and 2 p.m. but you can start with 1 a day and move up as you need to.  Hope that helps!",

In the meantime, the cats are stressed and the dog (a beagle, who are notorious for their iffy potty training) poos on the living room rug. I make my kids clean it up, but once they've marked their spot, it's a joke trying to get them never to go there again. The best advice I got was from the owner of a dog shelter who said forget about all the chemicals in pet stores, the best deterrent is plain old vinegar.

It does work, but my house still reeks because of the old accidents and how they got into the carpet padding, etc. But my real shame has been my tub! I finally cleaned it after...well, I'm ashamed to say how long it's been. In fact, I have no idea except that it's been a long time, mostly because I can't bend over and scrub - way too painful. So yesterday I did something I've never tried before, and I wouldn't confess it to anyone but you ladies.. I needed a shower, and my tub needed a bath, so...combine the two, right? I stripped down to nothing and sat in the tub with a container of cleanser and a scrub brush. I scrubbed away all the grayish grime and soap scum buildup. Of course, my butt got all gritty, but hey, the tub got clean, and what better place to wash off then the shower, right? When the tub was sparkling, I stood up, put back my shower chair, and had my shower, while at the same time rinsing off the cleanser. Ta da!!! A clean tub and a clean me.

I think I just need a bit of encouragement, which you ladies are so good at doing! I work in a middle school teaching kids with emotional disabilities. It's always a stressful job, but I love the children and I really think I make a difference. But my colleagues and boss are a different matter. Colleagues seem to believe that I'm not a \"real\" teacher, despite my master's degree, because I only teach a half-dozen children. (A half-dozen children who are on enough meds to kill a horse, who curse at me and throw tantrums and get into fist fights and end up in mental hospitals...) But I love the kids so I can deal with that. But my principal...he is young and ambitious and new (2nd year) and seems to want total control. And for some reason, he has set his sights on me. Last week, he wrote me TWO letters of reprimand for my permanent file. One of them was because I wrote in a note to a sub that my students could \"goof off\" for the last 10 minutes of the period if they had been good. He told me that \"goof off\" was an \"entirely inappropriate term\" and that if I didn't understand that then \"maybe you should be in a different profession.\" Gee, I had no idea that \"goof off\" was an obscenity!! But on the good side, I have a great union representative who is meeting with me tomorrow to help write letters of rebuttal. She told me that she had stopped by the human resources department and told the head of HR that if nothing else, she was demanding that this principal accept and acknowledge the fact that I have cancer and that he \"darn well ought to deal with it.\" He makes a huge deal out of everything to do with the cancer, without actually ackowledging that I have it. For example, the HR people told me that on my leave slips I need to write \"FMLA leave\" (not that it really matters since I take sick leave,and then leave without pay once that is gone). So he emails me to complain that \"I thought you had an ear infection. Why did you write FMLA when that wasn't related to your disability?\" I told him that my treatments made me prone to infections, so it was related. I mean, seriously, what does it matter?! Another time, I wanted to be proactive, so I told him several days in advance that I would be taking off the afternoon for my scans. He responded with a curt note that he had not seen my leave slip, so he could only assume that I was trying to take off work \"for free.\" Seriously?! When I've worked extra if I take so much as five minutes off in the past?! I'm just worried that I will lose my job. I can't transfer to another school because he put me on an \"improvement plan\" last year and won't remove it, even though I completed everything (and more) that was required. I can't move to another district because with these letters of reprimand, no one would hire me. I have worked here for 7 years and have had only good performance evaluations, and then this guy comes in and my file is down the toilet. I would give anything to just quit and go on disability, but I can't see how I could ever afford it. I have family who support me 100%, but they don't understand and they just hurt for me. My best friend died, as did my husband,and my friend who lived with me for 3 years and was like a sister to me had a psychotic episode a few months back and tried to kill me. Needless to say, she is now out of my life. So I'm feeling a tad alone and sorry for myself right now. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "raro wrote: So I was at the library the other day and saw a book about breast cancer. I don't usually get them (I mean, what else can they say that hasn't been said here, right?!) But this one caught my eye. It's called \"No Family History: the Environmental Causes of Breast Cancer.\" It is a relatively easy book to read, but it got me thinking. We have a zillion threads on this forum, but none that have to do directly with breast cancer prevention. Part of it, I think, is the automatic defense mechanisms that come up; heck, we already have breast cancer, what good would it do to talk about prevention, except make us feel guilty for \"bringing it on ourselves,\" right?  But the author, Sabrina McCormick, isn't interested in blame at all. She talks about how scientists are studying the genetics of BC because it's easier than trying to find a correlation between chemicals and BC. For example, is eating a ton of Big Macs bad for you, or is it the non-milk shake we drink with it that causes the problem? With all the environmental issues that surround us, there are likely dozens, if not hundreds, that could cause BC. But she focuses most on those chemicals that have an estrogen-like effect on tissues in the body, disrupting the normal reproductive patterns in a woman's body. I thought I would give just a few highlights, if nobody minds, because it was really fascinating: I'd love to know others' thoughts. Like I said, I'd put it in another section, since it applies to not only stage IV people, but there's no section on prevention and causes of BC. Anyway: - Most scientists of BC discount environment because of the attitude that \"everything causes cancer.\" Yet industrialized cities have much higher rates of BC than do more rural areas. For example, the highest incidents of BC are in Cape Cod, Long Island, and Marin Co. California (that last one has the highest rates in the world). Asian women have the lowest BC rates - until they move to the US, that is, and then they have the same rates as wherever they settled...so how can it be just genetic? - Cape Cod and Long Island were once home to many industrial and factory businesses. Most of the chemicals that were banned there are still found in the homes of women with BC.  -Almost all of the estrogen-like chemicals she discusses are transmitted through breast milk when breastfeeding. - Companies like Avon and AstraZenica have quite the conflict of interest. Avon makes cosmetics that are known to contain carcinogens. Then they do fundraisers in which some of the money goes right back to them. AstraZenica used to be a company that produced chemicals, many of which have been found to cause cancer. Then they found that there was more money to be made in cancer drugs so they gradually switched to that.  - 89% of the 10,500 ingredients in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety. - 55% of those ingredients contain penetration enhancers to enable the product to be more easily absorbed through the bloodstream. - The FDA does not regulate cosmetic ingredients. At all. According to the FDA. \"A cosmetic manufacturer may use almost any raw ingredient and market the product without approval from the FDA.\" - Did you know that AstraZeneca owns the copyright to National Breast Cancer Awareness Month? This means they have the right to sue you if you use that term without their permission. - The pink ribbon had nothing to do with Komen. It was started as a peach ribbon by Charlotte Haley, who sent out hundreds of postcards with a peach ribbon attached to anyone she could think of to raise awareness of BC after losing several relatives. Self magazine and Estee Lauder wanted to use her idea as a marketing gimmick for AZ's National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but she refused because she felt it was too commercialized. So they got their lawyers and were told they could avoid a lawsuit by changing it to another color ribbon. So of course, they chose pink because it was felt to be the most feminine color. They ran right over Charlotte Haley's peach ribbon and used her idea to sell the public on a gimmick. A whole new reason to hate Pinktober. Log in to post a reply",

She does point out that the chemicals that were eliminated decades ago are still in the air, dust, and bloodstream of people who have lived there. That was the surprising thing for me in that you'd think those chemicals would have long since dissipated by now.  As to AstraZeneca and the cost of cancer meds, I agree that they're often outrageously expensive, but I was shocked to realize that there is little to no oversight from the government about the costs of the meds. They can charge literally whatever they want. And since they're a business in the business of making money, they charge what they think they can get away with. Anyway, I appreciate the comments! I really wanted to get other people's insights. It's very interesting.",

I am glad that he has older siblings to take him to soccer games and all that, but I miss out on so much.

When my father died of Lewybody dementia (sort of like Parkinson's), he lay in his bed, wasted away, in a sort of half-coma. I had the chance to tell him every last thing I could think of, which helped me. I knew it would be the last time I saw him. The next morning, the nurses told me that they were watching him because they could tell the end was near, and suddenly they heard a shout from across the hall. They raced across, found the other patient sleeping, and came back to my father's room to find he had died.  My father was a private man, and I believe that he wanted to die without nurses gawking at him. As I had watched him, I felt the impression (and it's only my impression, of course) that he was communing with angels, preparing to \"cross over.\" He was able to make the decision when to go in spite of his condition. Even at our weakest, I think we have some control. And I also felt that it would be incredibly presumptuous if I were to try and shorten that time period via euthanasia, etc. I know that's a touchy subject for a lot of people, but in his case I felt he needed those extra days before his passing.

After taking her off the machines, they expected her to die immediately, but she hung on...unconscious, until 12:01 the morning of her anniversary. Then she went downhill immediately and passed. Even in a coma, I know she wanted to make it to her 25th anniversary because it was so important to her. A few months ago, I almost died of pneumonia in the ICU. I would have expected to be struggling to breathe (I was on 100% oxygen, which, if you have never been on it, is nothing like the little stream of air they usually use...it's quite the blast!). But I was so comfortable and peaceful and didn't even feel like moving. My mind wasn't particularly clear - when is it ever?! - but I realized that when my time comes, it will be okay.  I guess what I'm getting at is that if we make the decision to stop treatment, it should feel right..as right as anything feels, that is. If it feels wrong, we keep going. That's all anyone can do. And NOBODY has the right to tell us we're wrong for our decision.  In a weird way, I suppose we are blessed in that we know what is coming and can be sure to make whatever arrangements we want. I personally have decided to write letters to all sorts of people to be delivered after my death, not just family members, but others. I wrote out what I want said at my funeral. I can't do it all at once because it is rather intense and kind of morbid, but there is kind of a release with every letter I write and stash away. Even if by some miracle I don't die, it's certainly a self reflective exercise that has made me a better person. (It's not for everyone, I know. ) We live each day walking through the \"Valley of the shadow of death.\" But we also know more than most people how to live well and what is important in life. I'd still rather not have the cancer, but I try to suck out anything positive from it, however small. ",

And then, suddenly, I was waking up on the floor of my kitchen, with a couple of guys in dark blue calling to me, telling me I'd had a grand mal seizure and they were taking me to the hospital. Apparently, I scared the wits out of my poor DIL, who came in with the paper to find me shaking all over the kitchen floor.  I remember bits and pieces of the ambulance ride. Once at the hospital, they did a CT of the brain, which was fine (yay!). The ER dr said he thought it was because almost 2 years ago I'd had skull surgery and the swelling had caused a seizure way back when, so now I was \"predispositioned\" for seizures.  I don't think so. I think it was the Cymbalta. Or, rather, the interaction with that drug and several others to produce what they call the \"seritonin syndrome.\" Seizures is one of the side effects of that.  So now I can't drive for SIX MONTHS!!! and I'm all wiped out and sleepy,and my tongue has huge sores in the shape of my molars on either side where I apparently clenched my teeth/tongue during the seizure. And my legs feel like they've been through the wringer, all achy and heavy feeling. I don't know if any of you have had or witnessed a seizure. I'm pretty hard to freak out about medical stuff, but because my kids were so upset, I looked on YouTube to see if I could see what a grand mal seizure looked like.

So if you've only been on hormonals for 6 weeks or whatever, I can see his wanting to wait and see.  However, I think it's MORE stressful to \"watch and wait\" than it is to at least attempt to see if tumor markers are reliable for you. The CTC markers are extremely reliable for me, while the CA-whatever (can NEVER remember that one!) are not at all reliable, so we simply don't use them. Maybe if he knows that you'll be on pins and needles for 3 months (or until your next scans), he might be willing to do tumor markers. If not, I would definitely find a doctor more willing to work with you on that.",

But some people who are supposedly intolerant to gluten find that consuming organic wheat is perfectly safe.  I'm not trying to discount those who have true allergies or intolerance to foods. But sometimes it may just not be the food itself, but the pesticides, hormones, dyes, or other additives that are the true problem.

I received today (Merry Christmas to me, haha) an 8-page \"summary review\" that listed, in minute detail, everything my principal felt I had done wrong in the past year and a half. He concluded that we needed to meet by January 11th to discuss where we were at, and \"if no improvements are seen by mid-April, I will recommend termination.\" My union rep is really nice, but I think from her comments that her boss wants her to resolve things without the cost of a lawyer, and I don't see that happening. So after escaping home and stewing awhile, I remembered that a lady at my church is...on the school board! My sister-in-law reminded me, but at first I was hesitant, as I don't know her very well and felt like I was asking favors from her. She told me no, I'm asking my school board representative for clarification and help. So I called her, and she was very nice and says we can meet after Christmas next week. She agrees that it sounds like he is trying to get rid of me. I'm bringing all my papers and documentations and I'm hoping she will be able to help. Janis, I would give ANYTHING to be able to go on disability. My school does not offer STD or LTD. I could get on SSDI but could not pay COBRA, so I would be out of insurance for 2 years, which I can't do. SSDI payments would not even pay the mortgage on my house, unfortunately. Then again, my sister-in-law said that if it goes as far as a lawsuit, I should sue for them to pay for my disability...I found out that this principal last year fired one of the teachers, and he sued for wrongful termination...and won. He got his retirement package plus a settlement. I can't even look into a different school because I'm on this stupid improvement plan that he won't let me get off of, and you can't transfer while on it. And I can't try for a different county, because who would hire someone with all those letters of reprimand in their file? (Of course, the fact that they are all from the last year and a half might tell them something...) Anyway, I'm just feeling way sorry for myself right now. I wanted so much to stay and fight, but I have realized it's affecting my health. I was having heart palpitations and I think high blood pressure, feeling dizzy and faint. I can't work like this. And to top it all off, I'm REALLY feeling sorry for myself because all the teachers and staff were giving gifts to one another today...and I didn't get so much as a card or a cookie. I truly am invisible there. Talk about weird...in the 7 years I have worked there, I've given little gifts to those I've worked with every year. And not one of these professional people has even said thank you. Not one. I gave up this year. When the only time you ever get noticed is when you do something wrong, well, it grates on your soul. All I wanted was to teach these troubled kids. This past week I helped them make really useful presents for their parents/guardians...soup in a jar and cookies in a jar (where you layer the dry ingredients in a jar with instructions on how to make the soup/cookies). The kids were thrilled to make something for the adults in their lives that wasn't an ornament or bookmark. And I gave them sock monkeys for Christmas. They LOVED them. And I got in trouble because one of them hit another kid in the hall with his sock monkey. The principal called it an \"incident.\" Seriously? Death by sock monkey?!",

Yeah, right.  As to early detection, had I waited until 40 to get a mammogram, I'd be dead now. ",

I don't really understand that part, but I mentioned to the school board lady that could it be possible they were trying to get rid of me because of the cost? She said the principal would not because it wouldn't affect how much money he gets, but the superintendant...She paused and thought a minute and then said, no, she really did not think he was the type. She said it sounded like the principal is a control freak who is intimidated both by the students I work with and the cancer. I think she is right. After my husband died, my sister-in-law asked about life insurance for me. I had no money at all, so she invested in some life insurance for me as a gift. I asked her about taking it out and apparently it's the wrong kind. (Term vs. whole? I can't remember if that's the issue or not). I was pretty bummed. I've only been working for 7 years, and I'm 46 years old, so it's not like I have enough invested to retire. It used to be that the county paid into our retirement for us as a benefit, but that went out the window last year. Now we pay for it. And I'm sure it isn't much. So many other teachers are at the point where they can consider retiring. But SSDI wouldn't pay my mortgage. It would be around a thousand dollars, and my mortgage is 1400. I do pay into SS, though. I don't know if I could even get unemployment if I was fired for being supposedly incompetent? One thing I did this year might help somewhat. The county changed insurers or something, and they made available some extra programs that normally I couldn't qualify for, but if I pay the premiums all this year, then Oct 1 of 2013 I will qualify. It's STD, I think up to 17 weeks. And the lady told me that it's unrelated to my regular health insurance. I asked what about if I go on a new chemo in June...she said I could take the whole summer and get disability payments. I said, but I don't work in the summer, and she said who cares? I'm legally employed, so I would get the payments! The other is a cancer rider, where they send a check for cancer-related stuff, even if it's already covered by my regular insurance. That's assuming that I'm still employed next year, though, sigh. From what I understand, if I'm actually fired, can I get unemployment? And if I do, does that lower the COBRA pay? I know so little and like you said, I need to get my ducks in a row.  I'm frustrated because the union doesn't want to get me a lawyer (it's supposed to be a FREE benefit!) because it's expensive for them. So the union rep is trying to make nice and solve the problem without one. But I was talking to my brother tonight, and he said, \"This is a situation that you cannot win with this guy. He is determined to get rid of you, and is even MORE upset when you do things right. You could be Jesus Christ and it would never be good enough for him.\" Rather dramatic, but he is right. But how to nudge the union rep to get a lawyer? I really don't have money to hire my own.",

I think sometimes we women get this idea that \"nice girls\" don't fight back. I need one of those \"Fight like a girl\" T shirts, huh?! Thanks so much for being so helpful and supportive. We also have a shortage of Special Ed teachers (I remember once the SPED department telling me that the average number of years for a teacher of students with emotional disabilities is 3-5 years, because they burn out so fast). It's just so stupid. A few years back they were importing teachers from the Philippines because we didn't have enough. And then they allow good teachers to be pushed out. I was talking with another teacher who mentioned the names of at least a half-dozen teachers in our building who are nearing retirement age, and they are ALL going to just give up and leave at the end of the year. Which is just what he wants, because then he can fill their spots with his buddies. Before he was principal, he was...a girls' cheerleading coach. Boggles the mind.",

I got some of my scans results today as I was leaving (how often does THAT happen, you get them 3 hours after having the scans?!). Turns out I have breast cancer in the OTHER breast. Two 1-cm nodules, but it brought me back to all those years ago when I had my mastectomy (9 years now) and I asked my onc as I was being wheeled into the OR, \"Why don't you just chop both of them off?\" and he responded, \"I know you will worry about it, but studies show that you don't have any higher chance of getting cancer in the other breast than a woman who has never had it.\" So what, I hit the lottery twice? I think not. I just started Gemzar, so I'm hoping it will knock out the lumps. But still. And supposedly my breast skin is thicker, whatever that means. I also had a CT of my neck. Supposedly the bone mets are stable, but I know from all the symptoms that they are growing, just not to the point that they can tell. They also say that there is a band of fatty thickening from my neck to behind my ear, but they can't tell if it's inflammation, infection, or mets. Since my lymph nodes are enlarged and I had several low-grade fevers, I am hoping for infection. Pretty sad, but better than the alternative, I guess. Log in to post a reply",

I've been getting weekly spinal taps to check for it, and this past Monday, the 5th one, they sent back a path report saying there were cells that were \"concerning for malignancy.\" I spoke with my onc (because I was devastated, along with the rest of the crap I've dealt with this month) and he basically said that it's like a biopsy, so if I have cancer cells in the cerebro-spinal fluid, it means there is cancer in the  brain. So I asked him if I could gamma-knife the brain, and unfortunately, if your friend is like me, there aren't actual blobs of cancer to zap. He likened it to sand scattered across my brain. So the only option would be Xeloda (which I failed years ago, but he felt it was never really given a chance) or whole brain rads, which I swore I'd never do. But now that it looms in front of me as a possibility, who knows. The symptoms of cancer in the CSF are frankly frightening, but the more you know the more you can help. For me, there have been seizures (now under control, but originally terrifying), blurred vision, cognitive function issues (I forget EVERYTHING, much more than the usual chemo-brain) and I guess what you'd call hand-eye coordination (I constantly have to back-space on the computer because my hands won't type what my brain tells them to). So if your friend doesn't recognize you, it may be scary, but it could be temporary and/or depending how close you are, if you were wearing different clothing she might not have recognized you. Sounds weird, but if I saw someone at church every week in a dress, then I see them in sweats at the supermarket, I'd have a hard time remembering who they were and where I knew them from.  I asked my dr. about prognosis and he was very kind but also very honest...usually the life expectancy is about six months. He hurried to assure me that not everyone had poor response to treatment, so i shouldn't worry too much about the statistics, but that's easier said than done. There is really no way to tell if this issue with your friend is just a bump in the road or the beginning of the end.  Even so, she is blessed to have someone like you who cares for her. Even if she doesn't recognize you, you are doing a wonderful thing to want to take care of someone who is struggling through such trials. ",

And I hate to break it to those people, but a child with a disability IS the state's responsibility as well as her parents'.  Just yesterday my brother found out about my possibly getting the accelerated death benefit on my insurance, and he joked that, \"Wow, maybe I should get cancer and apply for all these programs and get rich!\" He said it in a totally joking way, but I have the feeling from my stunned silence that his comment went over like a lead balloon. I finally just said dryly, \"I think I'm going to ignore that comment.\" I give him the benefit of the doubt because he is normally such a great support. But wow.",

(Since you can't radiate twice in the same spot). He shrugged and said, \"well, if it got that bad, we could just remove the rib...\" But again, that was for pain. At stage IV, it's already in the bloodstream and could easily pop up anywhere else. It's kind of like whack-a-mole, really!",

The way he explained it, if the anti-hormonals killed off 95% of the cancer cells, the remaining 5% could be of a different cellular structure. When they say you're \"75% PR positive,: it means 75% of the cells looked at had the receptors. Well, the other 25% would be negative, and those may be the ones that burst forth, immune to the anti-hormonals.  My onc said that the breast cancer that you have 3 years down the road could be very different from the cancer you started with. Weird. My cancer did change, but I went from ER+ to ER and PR+ which makes no difference in treatment.  And a liver biopsy is no big deal. Took a few hours at the hospital and came out with a a bandaid on my tummy. Didn't hurt at all. ",

I think some doctors try so hard to be upbeat that they don't think of how the family might feel when it isn't good news. I know from experience that a LOT of doctors have no idea how to give bad news in a tactful, gentle way.  I would expect a doctor in that little girl's situation to give maybe a general explanation that \"most of the time\" these things are benign, but \"we want to be sure.\" I know everyone wouldl love to know the exact statistics, but there's no way to tell anyway, and if the mass turned out to be benign, it would have been a scary few days of worry and then relief.

It was about 3 years ago, and I was about to start rads to the sacrum, so I was terrified that they would put it off. I was already in terrible back/butt pain. I showed the nurse, and she took one look (right in the crease where your leg meets your body) and said, \"Oh, honey, you've got shingles!\" Fortunately I could still do the rads. I ended up in the hospital with a totally different issue, but they put a sign on my door saying I had shingles. And EVERY single nurse, aide, or doctor who entered the room wanted to look at it, even the pulmonologist, etc.!! And they all put gloves on, etc. as if it were contagious (who knows, maybe it is?!). I joked that I was growing mushrooms in that area because the blisters were HUGE. Acyclovir was what I think they gave me. The pain did recede after a few days to an annoyance, then faded. But from the start, It felt as though (sorry if this is TMI) some pubic hairs were caught in my undies or something. I could hardly walk, and it's not like you can tell people at work where the rash is!  So yes, the pain does start to fade after a few days on treatment. For me, the pain was completely gone by maybe 8 days? And I have fortunately had NO lasting issues with it. And I am very grateful I didn't have the rash in some places that the nurse told me about (vaginal, eyeballs, etc.). Ick!! It's probably cold comfort at the moment, though. They did give me some sort of cream to put on it that helped numb it. There are all sorts of numbing creams; surely they have SOMETHING that works on shingles! Unfortunately, you have to be persistent and your own advocate and all that. Grr.",
