One of the many ways you end up with a low body temp is just taking soemthing as innocent as Tylenol.  He theorizes that when the body has a fever it's trying to fight of something and instead of letting our bodies do this we all now just take a pill.  I don't recal having a proper fever since I was a teenager!  Of course there are no absolutes and many things can contribute to the breakdown of the body:  bad diet, heavy alcohol or drug abuse, exposure to toxins & poisons, etc.  However, for me, this is a way to help heal the body after all of the chemo, radiation, anesthesia, surgeries.  Getting your body temp up I think is a big key to healing--then if you still have issues with your health you won't also be dealing with the side effects of low body temp, you will just be addressing things unrelated.  My friend in the UK said her cracking skin finally sloughed off and her toenail fungus has now all grown out.  I have had nail toe nail fungus on my baby toes since I was a teenager so I am really looking forward to getting rid of this! ",

Also, I found a link lowbodytemp.com and a forum bodytemp.eu that assists people in resetting your body temperature back to 98.6 F.  http://hansacenter.com/pdfs/Cancer_and_Low_Body_Temperature_01-10-2010.pdf BTW:  I can be drenched in sweat from a \"hot\" flash yet my temp is only 96.5 F.  So my body temp that I think I am at is much lower then what I feel like.  LOW BODY TEMPERATURE RELATED DISEASES: Cancer, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, diabetes, and heart disease. LIST OF THINGS THAT CAN BOOST LOW BODY TEMP: Immediately upon getting up:  Very hot coffee or expresso--just one cup, hot breakfast with fat in it to help keep up temp, the hottest shower you can stand, a hot room to get dressed in, dressing slightly over warm, using a space heater wherever you are, eating every two hours, eating coconut oil.  SIDE EFFECTS OF LOW BODY TEMP:  Brain Fog, Hair Loss, Skin Rashes, Nail Fungus, Chapped Lips, Inability to Sleep, Hot Flashes but low Temperature, Ice Cold Sweats or complete Inability to Sweat, Exhaustion & Fatigue, Weight Gain, Sensistivity to Temperature, Constant Pain and feeling like an arthritic, 90 year old woman.  headaches, migraines, PMS, easy weight gain, depression, irritability, fluid retention, anxiety and panic attacks,  poor memory, poor concentration, low sex drive,  dry skin and hair, cold intolerance, heat intolerance, low motivation, low ambition, insomnia, allergies, acne, carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma, odd swallowing sensations, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, muscle and joint aches, slow healing, sweating abnormalities, Raynaud's Phenomenon, itchiness, irregular periods, easy bruising, ringing of the ears, flushing, bad breath, dry eyes/blurred vision, and more. BEST THERMOMETER TO USE: Vicks oral thermometer is fast & fairly accurate.  I also have a cheapo that is slightly off due to it converting celcius to farenheit.  I only use this to test the accuracy of the Vicks.  Always hold a thermometer in your mouth for one minute before pressing the button to get an accurate reading.  It's best to start tracking your temperature for a couple of weeks until you can accurately guess what your temperature is at any time of the day. I know when my temp is low by what body parts hurt, plus I go into a cold sweat. CORE TEMPERATURE (rectal, esophageal, etc.) 　 NORMAL : 36.5-37.5 °C (97.7-99.5 °F) HYPOTHERMIA: <35.0 °C (95.0 °F) FEVER: >37.5-38.3 °C (99.5-100.9 °F) HYPERTHERMIA: >37.5-38.3 °C (99.5-100.9 °F) HYPERPYREXIA >40.0-41.5 °C (104-106.7 °F) Note: The difference between fever and hyperthermia is the mechanism HOW TO TRACK YOUR TEMPERATURE: http://www.drrind.com/therapies/metabolic-temperature-graph#intro DIET:  Anything that spikes your blood sugar can cause your temperature to crash, so eating a low glycemic diet is key.  Rebecca Katz has a great cookbook \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen that addresses this and the food is  also great for those undergoing chemo.  Also a good book to read is \"Anti Cancer-A New Way Of Life\" by David Servan Schreiber with diet points which stress a low sugar diet.  The idea in resetting your temp is to have your first meal of the day be high in fat to get your day started-I know, this sounds contrary to most diets, however, upping your temp will speed up your metabolism and fat is necessary to help keep the body warm. A reset requires at least 2 weeks of not exposing yourself to an AC which means some down time. Anyone?

      "Content": "MBJ wrote: I decided to start a thread to see how many women are suffering from low body temperature.  I find I get down to as low as 95,6 F at night and can barely get up to 98.1 F during the day and usually stay around 97.6 F.  I have been trying something to \"reset\" my body temperature, but it has been a struggle.  One step forward, two steps back.  Just wondering if anyone else has been having issues with this.  I should add that when I am able to get my body temp up to 98.6 F, I have zero pain.  When my body temp is low I have severe plantar fasciitis in my right foot and I can't use or bend my thumbs and it's incredibly painful. Also, I found a link lowbodytemp.com and a forum bodytemp.eu that assists people in resetting your body temperature back to 98.6 F.  http://hansacenter.com/pdfs/Cancer_and_Low_Body_Temperature_01-10-2010.pdf BTW:  I can be drenched in sweat from a \"hot\" flash yet my temp is only 96.5 F.  So my body temp that I think I am at is much lower then what I feel like.  LOW BODY TEMPERATURE RELATED DISEASES: Cancer, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, diabetes, and heart disease. LIST OF THINGS THAT CAN BOOST LOW BODY TEMP: Immediately upon getting up:  Very hot coffee or expresso--just one cup, hot breakfast with fat in it to help keep up temp, the hottest shower you can stand, a hot room to get dressed in, dressing slightly over warm, using a space heater wherever you are, eating every two hours, eating coconut oil.  SIDE EFFECTS OF LOW BODY TEMP:  Brain Fog, Hair Loss, Skin Rashes, Nail Fungus, Chapped Lips, Inability to Sleep, Hot Flashes but low Temperature, Ice Cold Sweats or complete Inability to Sweat, Exhaustion & Fatigue, Weight Gain, Sensistivity to Temperature, Constant Pain and feeling like an arthritic, 90 year old woman.  headaches, migraines, PMS, easy weight gain, depression, irritability, fluid retention, anxiety and panic attacks,  poor memory, poor concentration, low sex drive,  dry skin and hair, cold intolerance, heat intolerance, low motivation, low ambition, insomnia, allergies, acne, carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma, odd swallowing sensations, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, muscle and joint aches, slow healing, sweating abnormalities, Raynaud's Phenomenon, itchiness, irregular periods, easy bruising, ringing of the ears, flushing, bad breath, dry eyes/blurred vision, and more. BEST THERMOMETER TO USE: Vicks oral thermometer is fast & fairly accurate.  I also have a cheapo that is slightly off due to it converting celcius to farenheit.  I only use this to test the accuracy of the Vicks.  Always hold a thermometer in your mouth for one minute before pressing the button to get an accurate reading.  It's best to start tracking your temperature for a couple of weeks until you can accurately guess what your temperature is at any time of the day. I know when my temp is low by what body parts hurt, plus I go into a cold sweat. CORE TEMPERATURE (rectal, esophageal, etc.) 　 NORMAL : 36.5-37.5 °C (97.7-99.5 °F) HYPOTHERMIA: <35.0 °C (95.0 °F) FEVER: >37.5-38.3 °C (99.5-100.9 °F) HYPERTHERMIA: >37.5-38.3 °C (99.5-100.9 °F) HYPERPYREXIA >40.0-41.5 °C (104-106.7 °F) Note: The difference between fever and hyperthermia is the mechanism HOW TO TRACK YOUR TEMPERATURE: http://www.drrind.com/therapies/metabolic-temperature-graph#intro DIET:  Anything that spikes your blood sugar can cause your temperature to crash, so eating a low glycemic diet is key.  Rebecca Katz has a great cookbook \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen that addresses this and the food is  also great for those undergoing chemo.  Also a good book to read is \"Anti Cancer-A New Way Of Life\" by David Servan Schreiber with diet points which stress a low sugar diet.  The idea in resetting your temp is to have your first meal of the day be high in fat to get your day started-I know, this sounds contrary to most diets, however, upping your temp will speed up your metabolism and fat is necessary to help keep the body warm. A reset requires at least 2 weeks of not exposing yourself to an AC which means some down time. Anyone?

      "Content": "Jun 27, 2011 02:58PM - edited Jun 27, 2011 02:59PM by MBJ So my thoughts are that until I fix my adrenal disfunction I am not going to be able to reset my body temp. Yesterday was horrible--could barely hold my temp and last night I did an experiment and just noted what happenedz: My temp goes up around 9 pm to 98.3 and stays high until maybe 3-4 am which is when I wake up freezing because I am soaked. Last night instead of throwing all of the covers on I slept with just a sheet and slept a little hot all night and then around 4 am woke up freezing and covered myself. Core temp on waking 96.9 F. Got up to 98.3 with food and coffee but couldn't maintain it at all today and hanging around at 97-97.6F which is where I seem to want to be when awake. This is very typical of adrenal fatigue: wide awake at night and unable to sleep and slow moving and unable to do anything during the day. This dr. says you can't do a reset without first fixing the adrenals and I am beginning to think he is right: http://www.drrind.com/therapies/adrenal-support-recommendation-sheet And then I posted this: 1 PM: So in frustration, about an hour ago I took a bunch of my adrenal support supplements and all of a sudden, while sitting in front of the heater, overdressed and then some, my temp went from riding aroudn 98.6 to 99.4. Finally had to turn off the heat and it seems to be staying. Coincidence? Maybe, but I am just glad this is what is finally happening today. I do recall this happening last time I tried to reset: my temp cam up on the fourth day late in the afternoon and then all day the next. Crossing my fingers that we can get through the next few days and my temp starts coming up more willingly. So it's an uphill battle right now.  When at 98.6 your temps should be more stable but at the lower temps there seems so be the whole sweat issue.  Maybe it's the chemo?",

I had my first real hair cut yesterday meaning it's the first time I didn't feel as if I only had chemo hair.  It still sticks out like I have weird cowlicks, but my stylist was able to get a cut that looked like the way I used to wear it.  She said when I come back in a few weeks, my front should finally have the length I had when I started chemo in November of 2009.  I have worn it for years in an edgy bob with pieced out bangs and this is the first time I feel like I no longer have a bush for hair! John Frieda 3 Day Straight:  I bought and tried out this product and it does leave my hair straight the next day, but when I try and add my gels to get the right texture, it doesn't work as well.  I would recommend this product for those of you with long hair who are still dealing with chemo frizz.  It requires the use of a flat iron and a blow out to get the best results.

For those of you afraid of flat iron damage, Sally's sells a new style flat iron that also dispenses oil at the same time.  If you want really straight hair, this would be the way to go with the least amount of damage.  The other wya is to use a spray on straightening product for use with flat irons--this does the same thing-protects your hair.

Ozzyfish:  Great name!  It is so not pathetic to mourn the loss of your hair.  Losing my hair and eyebrows and eyelashes--much worse then losing my breast!  It is the time when you realize you are sick and it's difficult to hide.  I wore wigs and painted on tons of eye makeup and liner to hide it but at the end of the day I felt like I was looking like Gollem and 20 years older then when I started and I was quite devastated by it.  The hair usually does come back and if it doesn't there are many things you can do to help assist it's coming back.  It does take time and my hair resembles something other then hair and it's almost impossible to get a brush or comb through it and I am counting the days until it's long enough to straighten. New Hair Products:  Garnier Fructis Style Sleek & Shine Blow Dry Perfector at home frizz free treatment that lasts up to 7 shampoos.  It's a three step process very similar to the Japanese system developed by L'Oreal.  Bonus:  It can have a cumulative relaxing effect.  I am going to try this one!  Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth Shampoo:  Also, Sally's Beauty Supply has a Frizz Free Straightening Shampoo--Every little bit helps!  I might try the Pantene, and the Sally's does make the hair smoother.  Remington Style Therapy Frizz Therapy Flatiron:  The plates on this flatiron have a porous ceramic coating that emits a silicone based conditioner (enough to last 4 years).  During tests, one session dimished frizz 65 percent more than a traditional flat iron and lasted up to 15 hours!  Yes!!!  L'Oreal Professional INOA Color:  This is an oil based coloring system that opens the hair cuticle less then previous types of water based dyes and does less damage and it is milder with superiour results.  This is ammonia free and uses a different product called MEA (monothenolamine) which only opens the hair cuticle a smidgen instead of lifting the whole cuticle, and it's combined with oil and is gentler to both the hair and scalp and the color is completely oderless and resistant to fading! I should start a blog on beauty products for chemo hair!!! LOL!",

Perricone's 21 day challenge.  It's all high antioxidant foods, lots of omega 3 fish and lots of turkey protein-no pasta, bread, rice, or high carb stuff, but you can eat everything else, a little dark chocolate, dairy, whole grains like oatmeal and millet, beans.  You eat often so you are never hungry and because it's high healthy proteins you lose the fat without losing muscle.  Once you get to your desired weight you can add in, occasionally, pastas, potatoes and rice but not as often unless you want to gain the weight back.  You can go to his website and download the 21 day menu.  I like it because it's brainless, too.  It tells you what to eat.",

PurpleMe:  I know exactly how you feel.  I use a generic Rogaine on my head from Target (cheap!) 2 x a day (I started out using the men's and then switched to women's in June), I take Biotin 5000 mcg 1 x a day, I am part of a Latisse double blind study.  4 weeks after my last chemo I started using it and I have to say my top eylashes are coming in great!  I had plenty before chemo, but now they are a bit longer then before.  I don't know if I would recommend it for those of you with light eyes, but mine are brown so it wasn't a concern.   Also, it can create a thin line of darker pigmentation along the top lashline.  I dind't know that there was a generic!  How is your diet?  Do you eat lots of protein?  I have heard that long after chemo and other treatments, we still need to up our nutrients and protein.  I hear that if you find a great tattoo artist, then it can look very natural--I have part of my right eyebrow that I now have to draw on because it never grew in there.  Really weird looking without anything. I will post a new picture soon, as my avatar picture is about 3 weeks new (my hair is wet so it doesn't look curly here-wish it would stay that way!) Eyebrows: I have used Smashbox and Anastacia brow products and thought they were a bit messy and expensive and I hate using a pencil.  I love Clinique's Brow Powder & Brush Kit!  I has a perfect, angled brush with a good choice of colors (I use Wheat & Taupe together) and it only costs $15.  It has better staying power then the other two and I have really oily skin, so the wax is extra oil on me.  If my brows are really unruly, I use an old, brown mascara wand that's been wiped of for jjust a touch of control. Sugar:  You hair is coming in great!  Nice and thick, but you can have my curly, kinky hair.  Just what does one do with it?  I try spiking it, it curls, I try a headband and it kinks.  I would love to have your hair!",

That being said, in 3 1/2 months you could possibly go without your wig, but you may not want to if it's cold (if it's 65 out my head gets chilly and it's over 6 months since my chemo) and you are used to longer hair.  Of course, there are hats with short hair!  Also, my first inch of growth my hair came in this weird, white almost transparant color and the growth was very uneven, so I had my husband shave it down to a 1/4\" and re-started my hair growth.  My hair is in the 3\"+ range but I got it \"styled\" about a month ago and she cut off more then I wanted her to (isn't that always the case?).  So, I alternate between short hair and wig depending on the weather (not much of a hat person-I suffer from little head syndrome LOL).

      "Content": "Nov 7, 2010 04:36PM MBJ wrote: Ladies, a friend of mine sent me this article--I don't have the link so I apologize for the lengthy post, however, for those of you who can't seem to grow their hair back, read this!  Chemo can throw your thyroid and your hormones out and there are remedies for this: Vitamins, Minerals and your Thyroidby Anthony Pearce   Anthony Pearce is a Specialist Trichologist & Registered Nurse - a founding member of the Society for Progressive Trichology & the official lecturer for Analytical Reference Laboratory (ARL) for hair loss & hormone imbalance. He is the Clinical Director for Trichology Hair Solutions of Virginia/DC in the United States. In Australia he can be contacted on 02 9542 2700, or through his website at www.hairlossclinic.com.au .   Shortly after hanging my Trichology 'shingle' I decided to specialise in female hair loss issues. I'd discovered early - contrary to general opinion - female hair loss is quite complex in what both influences and impels it.   Although males can (and do) experience different forms of alopecia, overwhelmingly the most commonly seen is Male Androgenic Alopecia - male 'pattern' balding. When a male has the genetics to exhibit this, it's as much a natural part of post-pubertal secondary sex characteristics as facial whiskers, deepening voice, muscle bulk, and body hair. By contrast thinning scalp hair in women is almost always an indication of internal dysfunction; a collapsing of body homeostasis to the point where hair growth can no longer be supported.   From menarche* to menopause it's reasonable to assert most menstruating females will have some degree of iron deficiency at times in their life. Very few functions of the body are activated without sufficient iron to 'furnace' them.   Iron storage (termed ferritin ) is considered the true indicator of iron status - with an accepted reference range of 20-300ug/L. To aspire to a 'target' level about mid-range - i.e.: 150ug/L - could not be considered unrealistic given the importance of iron in the body.   The significance of reaching and maintaining this target level was the research of Dr. John Lee - Australia's most prolific thyroid researcher. Insufficient iron restricts cell mitochondria production from which Adenosine Tri-phosphate (ATP) - 'cellular energy' is created. Our metabolic activity and Phase II liver detoxification pathways are ATP dependant. Regrettably conformist practitioners still claim a ferritin of 21ug/L is within range and therefore 'normal'! Just two points below (19ug/L) suggests 'depleted iron stores'. To take this point further are they proposing a woman with a ferritin of 21ug/L (one point within range) will experience the equal energy and metabolic drive as another whose ferritin is 299ug/L (again one point within range)?   I also reject the claim of those traditionalists who say it's impossible to achieve a 150ug/L ferritin in a pre-menopausal woman.   In terms of metabolic importance, Iodine is deemed the next most essential (trace) nutrient after iron. Simply put: Iodine deficiency = compromised thyroid hormone production. Testing Iodine levels is a simple urinary 'spot-screen', but is seldom routinely assessed. Low Iodine results in an under-functioning thyroid. There is also a studied correlation between Iodine deficiency and reduced IQ in children, and breast disease in women.   At the time of writing - Australian Professor Creswell Eastman from the Council of Control (Iodine Deficiency Disorders) - is urging food manufacturers to again add Iodine to their products. His statement arises from a recent national study which found almost half of all children of primary school age show Iodine deficiency.   A urinary Iodine test is not even presently claimable under Australian Medicare. As a Trichologist/ registered nurse I'm unable to directly order blood pathology for my clients. Instead I suggest they ask their family doctor to review their complaint and authorise appropriate blood pathology. Two principle reasons for this:   It's a professional 'given'; the primary doctor has a right to know what another practitioner - orthodox or alternate - is proposing for their patient.   Medicare should cover the bulk of this pathology - that's why we pay the Medicare Levy. It can be exasperating when zinc and/or copper testing are disregarded as unnecessary. Sometimes one will be authorised but the other refused. Both nutrients are vital for thyroid homeostasis (and hair growth) but each antagonises the other's action and absorption. If either mineral is elevated the other will (but not always) be depressed. Elevated or depleted levels of either mineral will have a profound affect on body functioning and the disruption of other nutrients.   Zinc is held to be implicated in at least 150 enzymatic actions within the body. Its main contributions to thyroid homeostasis are:   The synthesis of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) - produced by the Hypothalamus to stimulate production of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). A crucial catalyst in the binding and activation of the active thyroid hormone Triiodothyronine (T3) to receptors on the cell nucleus.   Zinc deficiency is thought to contribute to poor thyroid hormone conversion - and deficiency diminishes healthy genetic expression of thyroid hormone.   A refractory zinc deficiency may result from inadequate protein availability (Baratosy:2006). Amino acid (Tyrosine) derived from protein is a foundation of thyroid hormone production. Reviewing copper levels is particularly crucial. Low copper is said to inhibit thyroid gland hormone production, whilst elevated copper obstructs cell receptor interaction with thyroid hormone.   A deficiency of copper hinders the deployment of iron by the red blood cells, resulting in the iron being accumulated (and unavailable) within the organs of the body. Because this stored iron cannot be utilised whilst the copper deficiency persists, symptoms of iron deficiency may present - despite an actual iron sufficiency .   An elevated copper level and Sex Hormone Binding Globulin is regularly seen in females using a contraceptive. This is largely due to the additional (synthetic) oestrogen found in contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. Oestrogen gives rise to copper retention - and vice versa - ultimately leading to zinc and other nutrient depletion, and oestrogen dominance.   Once copper is in excess and too dominant in relation to zinc, it can exert what Baratosy (2005) describes as an 'anti-nutrient' - or toxic metal influence. High copper levels restrict the absorption and utilisation of zinc (particularly), iron, magnesium, Vitamins B3, 5, and 6, Vitamins C and E, and certain trace elements.   Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is produced in the liver, and is the carrier vitamins protein for (amongst other hormones) 70% of the circulating but 'bound' (inactive) testosterone and oestrogen. Elevated SHBG levels may result in symptoms of testosterone and oestrogen deficiency.   In the long line of essential nutrients for optimal thyroid function, the importance of Selenium is only shaded by Iron and Iodine. Several thyroid enzymes are Selenium-dependant to the creation of thyroid hormone. Unlike copper and zinc, Selenium and Iodine are agonists to each other - with optimal levels of both (in balance) essential for a healthy thyroid gland. Selenium also has an integral role in anti-oxidant and immunity defence mechanisms. There remain some differing opinions on the most reliable form of Selenium testing. Some advocate blood serum; others support hair mineral analysis (HTMA) - still others suggest toe nail clippings.   The B-vitamins are essential co-enzymes to maintaining mitochondrial ATP production. Compromised mitochondrial function leads to low metabolic (thyroid) activity. Thiamine (Vitamin B1), B12, Vitamin D and folic acid are synergistic to copper. Supplementing these nutrients where required helps restore body copper balance. Vitamin D metabolism is enhanced by copper.   The Thyroid Hormones:   It's not my intention to detail or even outline the anatomy and physiology of the thyroid-related endocrine system and the hormones involved. There are many excellent thyroid texts written by better educated and more qualified folk than me. I simply wish to convey to the lay reader what thyroid hormones they might request tested - and why:   Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): produced by the (anterior) Pituitary Gland - TSH regulates thyroid hormone production from the thyroid gland. TSH has long been regarded as the most reliable and sensitive indicator of thyroid function, however its limitations are these: TSH does not reflect low metabolic activity; cell mitochondrial energy output and the necessary nutrients to furnace the body.   TSH does not reflect sufficient and quality conversion of the inactive thyroid hormone Thyroxine (T4) to the active, cell-influencing Triiodothyronine (T3). TSH does not reflect deficiency of any of the numerous nutrients crucial to T4 - T3 synthesis, conversion, and activation.   TSH does not reflect T3 interaction with its mitochondrial or DNA receptors within the cell itself. If this interface fails - T3 cannot influence cell activity in any meaningful way. TSH does not reflect elevated Reverse Triiodothyronine (rT3) levels which interfere with T4 - T3 conversion and T3's activation of its intra-cell receptors.   TSH does not immediately reflect increasing thyroid antibodies in autoimmune thyroiditis. Difficulties with any of the above has been termed 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' - patient's exhibit symptoms of an under functioning thyroid but their TSH and T4 results are \"normal\".   Thyroxine (T4): T4 is secreted by the thyroid gland in response to hypothalamic-pituitary stimulation (TRH/TSH). This secreted T4 then circulates in the blood - bound to a carrier protein - until synthesised (in the liver and kidneys) to T3. T4 possesses no interfacing receptors of its own, but is the inactive precursor of T3.   Triiodothyronine (T3): although some T3 is produced by the thyroid gland, greater than 80% results from T4 conversion. T3 is our active thyroid hormone which profoundly regulates body metabolism.   Reverse Triiodothyronine (rT3): rT3 is an adapted non-active form of Triiodothyronine. In times of protracted physiological and emotional stress or illness, T4's normal conversion to T3 is corrupted - and rT3 results. Lee (2005) found forty percent of the synthetic thyroid hormone replacement Thyroxine sodium (Oroxine et al) is altered to rT3.   In healthy, minimally-stressed people rT3 is quickly purged from the body. When rT3 levels are allowed to become excessive, it inhibits and distorts T4 - T3 conversion - thus producing further rT3.   Elevated levels of rT3 are commonly detected in Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia sufferers. Arem (1999) proposes these two debilitating illnesses are manifestations of thyroid dysfunction. A characteristic of 'Wilson's Thyroid Syndrome' is patients' exhibit high rT3 levels because T4 is continually corrupted to rT3 at the expense of T3. rT3 disrupts thyroid homeostasis by inhibiting the production and function of T3. rT3 binds to - but does not activate - T3 intra-cell receptors; effectively blocking T3 interface and activation. Dr. John Lee was the first practitioner to facilitate the testing of rT3 in Australia.   Thyroid antibodies: thyroid antibodies are detectable indicators within the circulatory system that our immunity is primed against our thyroid gland. The presence of thyroid antibodies is sometimes discounted by medicos because a percentage of the population shows low levels of antibodies without any discernable thyroid disease.   Elevated levels typically signify autoimmune thyroiditis - 'Hashimotos' if the patient exhibits an under active thyroid state, and 'Graves' Disease' if their symptoms/pathology suggest the thyroid is over active.   The usual thyroid antibodies tested in Australia are:   Thyroglobulin Antibodies  Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPO Ab) - the more sensitive test.   Researchers suggest a strong association between autoimmune thyroiditis and Coeliac Disease. Patients exhibiting both conditions were able to eliminate thyroid antibodies by adopting a Gluten-free diet (Baratosy:2005). An Italian study of female nursing home geriatrics with hypothyroidism, found that by eliminating gluten from the diet, the hypothyroid symptoms in these patients greatly diminished or disappeared.   The crucial roles sex and steroid hormones play in thyroid homeostasis - particularly Cortisol, Progesterone, and DHEA - have not been discussed here. Suffice to say the thyroid-adrenal relationship is mutually dependant, and a Saliva Hormone Assay of these and other relevant hormones is an integral part of the complete investigative process.   Toxic heavy metals - principally Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Aluminum and Arsenic block the function of Vitamins and Minerals necessary for thyroid homeostasis. Where patients relate long-standing illness, toxic heavy metals should be an early assessment priority. Accurate and convenient testing is achieved by HTMA.   The thyroid hormone cascade is incredibly involved and complex. Vitamins, minerals, amino acids, trace elements, essential fatty acids (DHA/EPA), sex and steroid hormones, as well as the immune system must all be adequately available - and harmonious to each other - for T3 to accomplish its task. If any one of these vital components are lacking the process will stall - and optimal body functioning diminished.   In all this - hair is the expendable extravagance; usually the first tissue to suffer a withdrawal of metabolic and nutrient support.   It should now be appreciated that \"gimmicky\" single treatments such as laser combs, commercial hair loss programs etc can do nothing to influence nutritional, metabolic or hormonal disturbance. These areas must be individually tested for - but reviewed and treated as part of the total picture.   *the onset of menstruation in a young female     Orthodox Hair-sciences & Hair-specialisms - The Trichological Society",

I was finally and accurately diagnosed with Adrenal Exhaustion 5 months prior to BC and still continue to have problems with it almost 2 years later.  I am wondering how many of us have adrenal fatige due to chemo and this is the most helpful and informative site I have found on the issue.  He gives pointers on supplements, eating to get a good night's sleep and to address the adrenal issues and hair loss:  www.DrLam.com.   I am having success doing this only the last two nights and I wanted to share these with you!

Lago:  That is great advice regarding the Men's vs's Women's Rogaine-we are all so different in how we react to products.  Target sells the exact same product for much less. Nikola:  I prefer to use the men's rogaine (see Abnerb's post, first) in the dropper so that it doesn't go everywhere because it's too greasy otherwise. Saralmom:  I preferred the Style Straight instant straightening creme.  It \"smoothes waves and frizzy curls into shiny, straight styles\".  I didn't like the Instant Straight as it was too drying. Nancy: Sorry the dye didn't take.  I bleached the heck out of my hair when it was about 3\" long (I don't recommend this as it really dried out my hair) and wore it blonde for 3 months and then dyed it and I didn't have any problems.  If you try and dye it before six months on chemo growth, the dye doesn't \"take\".  That's why I say it's better to dye it yourself at home (you can buy Herbal dyes at Whole Foods or Health Food stores) to see if it will hold any color.  Do you know what color your stylist used?  You can also try the temporary wash and wear over the counter dyes without any amonia.",

Ann:  Sally's has great sales!  I have never used their flat irons--last week when I was there they still had that type of sale going on with the other brands, too.  I would look for an iron that puts out at least 450 degrees (professional heat) because my new chemo hair was not straightened with my Revlon iron.  Although, now that I use the Ion spray maybe any iron would work.  The one that was recommended to me by one of their sales staff who does hair professionaly,is by Jilbere de paris the Palladium 2.  I love it! Ann, I am using both products on my hair.  The ingredients are different, but they do the same thing-kill the hormones that kill your hair.  They are used differently though--the topical solution you can use throughout the day and the Nioxin products are for washing, conditioning and styling only.",

Ladies, I just had a bunch of bood work up to determine why I am still having hair loss.  This is what I have learned.  My Dr. put me on bioidentical estrogen and my numbers are now up.  However, my blood test results show my DHEA (male hormones) are through the roof and I have no progesterone.  I think once I add progesterone to the mix, the DHEA should lower and so will the hair loss.  After going on line and doing research, I have also discoverd that a diet high in bread and grains can also cause an imbalance of DHEA which can contribute to hair loss.  So, for those of you still dealing with hair loss long after the chemo is completed, going to a hormone specialist could be beneficial.  I hope this helps someone! Happy Hair Day!",
