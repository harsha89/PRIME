She then immediately transferred me to the surgeon's office where I was set for a consult this coming Monday. I will need an excision so they can tell me why I have abnormal cells. While I am glad it wasn't worst case, this does not exactly make me happy. I need to read my online chart to see additional information from the radiologist and my oncologist. I don't know how I can tolerate any more waiting.",

After lumpectomy I had 7 1/2 weeks of radiation and was on tamoxifen for one year (side effects were horrible for me). I just went in yesterday morning for a 3D annual mammogram (started a year ago after six month follow ups). I got a call back today that they saw calcifications on the same breast and I need to go back tomorrow. I am so sad. I was doing so well. My son is getting married in June and all I can think about is how this will affect everything. I have only told my husband. I don't want to talk to any one in the family until I know what will happen. I know calcifications can be nothing or it could signal more early breast cancer. I have an appointment tomorrow morning at 8:30am. I will know there whether they will want a biopsy or they think it is nothing. The fact I had a 3D mammo makes me think they really did see something clearly.

The radiologist said the results were listed as indeterminate so they really can't tell what the calcifications are even with increased images. Therefore, on Friday I will have a biopsy. He said worst case scenario (since the calcifications are in the same spot as my 2012 DCIS) would be a recurrance of the DCIS (I find that so hard to believe after the lumpectomy and all the radiation I had plus my DCIS was listed as low grade). He said it could also be from trauma, radiation etc. Better safe than sorry. If it is positive then I will have a mastectomy since I am unable to be radiated again and even if they could, since it is left sided, I do not want more damage to my lung or heart. Looking forward to Friday (not) but really would like to have results (they thought by Tuesday). I have shared with my older daughter (45) since she just went through some biopsies which thankfully were cysts. I am the first in my family to have breast cancer. My husband and I are both retired and he's very supportive and battling low-grade prostate cancer himself (being watched). I will eventually share any bad news with my twin - the last time I did in 2012 she posted it on facebook!!! Geez - I think it's the only time we ever fought!",

He said I have AHD cells and he needs to make sure nothing else is hiding there. I went back and retread my initial path report after my lumpectomy four years ago for DCIS and noticed a comment that there was some AHD very close to a margin. The surgeon said those cells would have been destroyed during my radiation. I am so on edge. He told me we could wait and see or do the biopsy. If anything else is found I would need a mastectomy. Just wondering if any others have received an AHD diagnosis after having DCIS",

Radiologist said indeterminate findings so I needed a stereotactic biopsy which I had last Friday. Results are due today. He said worst case scenerio would be a return of my original DCIS since the microcalcifications are in the old biopsy site or could be 'degenerate' material. I have been beside myself with worry. I've lost 7 pounds this last week. I cannot eat. I do sleep because I think I am worn out from the worry. Today my twin arrives back from Florida and I may have to tell her our vacations are off (one end of May and a two weeker end of June because I need a mastectomy (would would be my only recourse). My focus has to be on my son's wedding. I know once I get the call - if bad news - I will feel better because there will be a plan and that really helped last time. I don't necessarily believe worst case scenerio could be just a return of the DCIS since I was also told I was 'cured' after the radiation (in fact my surgeon didn't feel I even needed the radiation!) I guess I'm just sort of venting. It is torturous to wait - someone needs to figure a way to give same day results to people and I realize that my wait probably isn't as long as others have waited. My older daughter calls me all the time to see if I have any news - she wants to set up a brunch for Mother's Day but I am just not in the mood for that.",

Because of the atypia cells I needed to see a breast surgeon (in case something was lurking behind the atypia). I had an excisional biopsy and got the all clear. This year my mammogram was good. I hope you have the same results and everything is fine. It is a bit of a worry though and waiting for answers is the hardest part. Twinmar",
