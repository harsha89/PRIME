I agree with sespebadger to go in and see the nurses, because they will give you stuff to help it feel better/heal and may be antimicrobial to prevent infection.  They gave me xenoform (sp?), it is great; that and advil were almost instant relief for me!",

Then it started hitting me the third day out, but mostly just tired and starting to ache after the neulasta shot.  Then on the 4th and 5th days, I was generally achy and tired and ever so slightly nauseated (I would down an anti-nausea pill as soon as I felt any twinge of nausea after the first 48 hours, which kept it at bay).  I didn't eat too  much those days; just nibbled and drank gatorade like crazy!  All in all though, it wasn't as bad as I kinda expected.  By the 6th day, I went to lunch, drank a glass of wine to ease my nerves at bit and ate a nice salmon lunch.  I am curious to see how the second treatment goes.  My oncologist said, although they always cavaet with 'everyone is different' jazz, this combination is a little less harsh than the other regimines, and also a little less harsh on fertility.  This week - the entire week - I go for hours even forgetting I am on chemotherapy - I feel totally normal. Eating mexican food and working full time. Although I do notice I am sleeping a bit more :)  I am taking this opportunity to cut myself some slack.   I was also curious about others, because side effects with this combo is kinda similar to others but not totally.  Even if it gets a little worse, I am feeling good right now (knock on wood) and feel that, although this sucks overall, this treatment regime is do-able. ",
