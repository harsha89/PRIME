I know it may seem crazy but I just found out that my grandmother on my father side was tested for BC but neg. Yet her mother and a sister died from BC and her 3 other sisters have survived BC. Just want to know if this puts me at a greater risk? My grandmother had throat cancer 2 times and her sister had and died from BC on my mothers side. Can someone help!  Thank you!

She said that the us from 2 years ago and the one today look about the same. YAY.....SHe did however say that if it was bothering me that we can do a needle biopsy to make sure the cells were ok or we can remove it and send it to make sure everything was ok. I have the surgery on Friday April 13 (i know right) She sent me for a chest xray to she if something else was causing my shortness of breath and chest pains. I will keep you posted on those results. Ladies  yall are the best. Thank you so much and God bless Now Im off the Fl with the family! ",
