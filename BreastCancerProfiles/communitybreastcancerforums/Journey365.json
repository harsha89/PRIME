Many days, I have received strength from you all! I will begin chemotherapy on the 3rd of January, the particular medication will be 4 treatments of TC. I had very little fear of surgery in November, however at this moment I am full of anxiety, fear and second thoughts. Yesterday I received the different medications to take before chemo such as the steroids, cream for port, clartin and something to alleviate nausea symptoms. Again, I really do appreciate your experiences...they provide strength, motivation, determination and support!! Blessings to All!!!!!",

Today is the day for me.....I didnt sleep at all last night, I tossed and turned and finally just got up and tried to do anything to ease my mind. I was told that this will be a 6hr process, my aappointments start at 10am today....so pretty much I will be at the CCOA all day and most of the night, actual infusion time is 430pm. I'm tired of not knowing what will happen, how I will feel, how I will react or look. I have never been sick, hospitalized, or had children. I'm 36 years old, and I guess today it will hit me that my health isn't great, I did I have surgery in November, but I think I have been in denial. Anyway, thanks again to all who have shared their story and very helpful information. I appreciate it a great deal. In conclusion, May we all rise above this and take back full control of our lives, doable side effects and no permanent hold on us, our family or friends!!! Fuk Cancer....thats really how Im feeling.....yes, Im trying to remain Postive, I know it is extremely important to me overcoming this.......but again......Fuk Cancer!!! Have a great day ladies!!üíìüíìüíìüíì",
