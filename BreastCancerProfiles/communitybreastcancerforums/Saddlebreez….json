He died from a recurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 65 and I'm pretty sure the gene was responsible. I know it is what caused my breast cancer at the age of 45. Nothing invasive, thank goodness. A radiology test and biopsy found the ductal, but not the lobular which was found during surgery. I'm so glad I opted to have both breasts taken as they were both littered with fibroadenomas, and it prevented me from needing treatment of any kind. I DON'T know, however, if CHEK2 is responsible for the other weird stuff I've grown, like the malignant GI Stromal tumor at age 30. Or the big thyroid nodule at 46. I call myself a \"garden of oddities,\" and I may be...just may be a little paranoid. I keep looking for those signs and symptoms of blood cancer since I am about the same age as my dad when he was first diagnosed. All I can do is be well informed, I guess. Knowledge is power!",
