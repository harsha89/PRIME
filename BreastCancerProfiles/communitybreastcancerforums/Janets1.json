You can find more information at www.healthjourneys.com and check it out. The section that helped me immensely were the affirmations which always bring me back to a peaceful place within. I now use them for radiation but only get through a few of them before the session is over, it happens so quickly.You can download the MP3 instantly. Practice the affirmations for a few hours - you will be amazed, I promise!!! The section starts out with these words...\"I declare my intention to heal myself in body, mind and spirit\" and goes from there. Worth a try and can be used with or without ativan!",

I have had so many reservations as DCIS is treated as a \"one size fits all\" and it is not known who really needs rads and who does not. That makes me feel personally responsible for putting radiation into my body and subjecting myself to something I may not even need. Of course, after reading the posts and seeing how much treatment so many women have had, I know I am getting off pretty darn easy. I am really inspired by how many strong, determined and simply wonderful women are out there and I draw strength from your experiences!",

But my breast looks like a treasure hunt map with not dots but squiggly lines as well as some straight lines,  not very uniform looking - and all done with a Sharpie pen plus a few little tabs that keep falling off. I'm nervous enough without worrying that the technicians were on acid. Does anyone else have lines that look like this? Somehow I expected something more strategic looking. Janet",

I listen to the affirmations at night when going to sleep and in the morning before I get out of bed. That way they are in my head and stick with me....and the ones that are meaningful (like the one I mentioned) are the ones I can repeat to myself while getting zapped. Here's the funny thing....I've had 3 treatments so far and my life is so hectic and nuts right now that I actually find the 6 or so minutes I lie there are the most peaceful of the day - because it's the one true time I am doing something for me, and me alone. I wish you peace and will \"see\" you on the discussion board soon. Janet",
