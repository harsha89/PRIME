Since before my dx, I've had a hard time eating. At first it was nerves - it felt like I had scratchy ropes tying up my stomach and intestines. I suppose nerves are still involved... But I have a green smoothie late morning, maybe a couple spoonfuls of leftover veggies at lunch ( only because I think I should try to eat something) and then I do eat something for supper, but not like normally. And that's it. I don't want more - my stomach feels tight and uncomfortable and food just doesn't seem very appealing. In the last month and a half I've lost about 16 lbs. the weight loss is a good thing, as I am overweight, but I am concerned that I don't want to eat... I know there is a little paranoid - no sugar, not too much fruit, no bad carbs, etc, but even foods that I'd consider healthy just aren't appealing. Is this nerves? It's not a sign of mets is it??? I haven't even started any treatments yet.",

Years ago I made up an oil containing lavender for a friend undergoing rads for esophageal cancer ( radiologist approved) and it worked great. However lavender is a phytoestrogen and I'm not keen on slathering it all over my breast that had an er+ tumor in it - so reading further I found some really interesting info on sacred frankincense. Apparently Oklahoma University had studied it and confirmed its anti cancer properties. They still need to isolate the components that are responsible so drug companies can use it, but it sounded pretty interesting. Smells good too.",

Three incisions - the tumor site, the sentinel node, and the biopsy entrance (she wanted to try to clear the path of the core needle) I find myself crying more now than I did before surgery... I'm not taking meds now, so can't be that. Could it be that the discomfort has made this even more real? I've been finding myself telling my friends that what I never realized about breast cancer (and I know that they don't know) is that even though the lymph was clear, margins clean, that doesn't mean you're \"done\". There's still rads, possibly chemo and hormone therapy - and always hanging over you is the threat of that one evasive cell setting up camp. And bad enough if he's found locally, but if he gets loose, you're done. And now I'm sobbing again. I'm telling my friends that its not that I want to be gloom and doom, it's just the reality. Odds are that this lump wasn't supposed to be breast cancer either, but it was. So how can I trust where I'll wind up with any other statistic? And now I'm also wondering... She just took the one sentinel node. It looks like most of you had more than one removed initially for testing. Should she have taken more??? How do I live with this??",

So chemo doesn't \"cure\", if stems cells aren't destroyed, it will return, cancer cells can stay dormant and revive later and mets, even those that have been really diligent and strict using complementary treatments have had recurrences - it is beginning to feel like no matter what I do, it will return to kill me!! Can you help me? Is it really possible to live out a long normal life without ever seeing cancer again?",

Ok, my friend really wantd and needed support today - he can't drive because of having tumor related seizures and she was way too upset. She does better with people around her so it was a good thing. It was all going \"well\" - Genomic finally received the tissue sample, and the 2nd opinion place called and said he would see me the day after the results were due back, and said that if they didn't get back in time he would see me the following week. They've been great. Until they called back and said there was a problem with our insurance. They are within our network so that isn't the problem, it's that we are up for review very soon (we think was the problem) - I could make an essay trying to explain it all, but now we're waiting for a return call about the insurance. This is adding a huge stress. What do you do if you lose your insurance at a time like this?! As far as a 2nd opinion, my surgeon was very understanding about the possible need to get another oncologists opinion. Ours has a reputation.... And unfortunately, I know several people that have died under his care. Not that that couldn't happen regardless of how wonderful the dr is, but it's on my mind and doesn't inspire confidence. The dr I'm getting the 2nd opinion from has high credentials and has treated a friend with ( so far) good success. Mentally, especially after trying out the first oncologist, I feel the need to find someone I feel more confidence in. Right now I'm just worried that I'll be able to see ANYONE. I've lost 19 lbs since this all started - this isnt helping!",

I totally understand what cancer does even with the best of care. But I need the emotional end of it too. Maybe you need to live in this town to understand what I mean about our oncologist. Even my surgeon knew and understood my concerns. And I do need to add that my calling Genomic was not to check up on anyone - they have customer service for patients and were very understanding when I explained why I was calling - that I needed to know when it was received so I'd have an idea when the results would be back - so the results would be available for this 2nd opinion (and who could likely wind up being my mo). The 2nd opinion clinic is interested in seeing the results as well as I was told they could move my appt out a few days if they weren't in yet.",

I know she was trying to get a lot of the duct, just in case. But that's probably why my nipple hurts and pulls in - there was a lot of cutting in there! And then she had to tell me that she also put her finger in there to make sure there were no jagged edges... Knowing that kind of ooks me out! I guess this just a self-pity day. I just took a look at my path report again - I'm not flat, but I'm not huge breasted either - 36C - and the tissue removed measured 10cm x 8 cm x 3.2 cm! No wonder it looks and feels awful!",

It only took the edge off. I've been trying to search out info on it, but I'm not finding what I'm looking for... It's not really at the node incision - or really tumor incision either (although they are sore still). The tumor was on the outside of the breast near my armpit - not near the nipple at all. From there to the nipple, and a bit further, it's just really uncomfortable. It is swollen, but I would not say its excessive, so I wouldn't think there's anything that needs draining.... It's not really even bruised. The incisions dont appear to be infected. The area that is uncomfortable is also numb (if that makes sense) and very slightly (if you look carefully) has a more redder look. Whats going on? I see the surgeon for a follow up on Wed.",

My cancer cells looked like tiny seeds compared to the other cells. It was a good thing. But then I forgot my purse there. Was nervous and had to run across the road from the hospital to the clinic for my first onc appt - so he called my onc to tell him he was sending a nurse over with it and said \"she came to meet with me!!\" So he learned what a nut I was before he met me. Ok. I feel a bit relieved, but I'm not sure totally why yet... He plugged in the statistics and it spit out that I have an 88% chance of living 10 years with radiation. Tamoxifen adds 2.5% and chemo adds about 3%. (Together they add 4% for some reason). The oncotype dx test was sent out, so I have to wait a week or so for those results. That will help determine chemo or not. And he knows and is ok with me going for a 2nd opinion, which I will schedule for when the oncotype results are in. Some confusing things though... He told us that diet and exercise could equal chemo. I need to have that clarified. Maybe I feel good because I got through today... And the onc was not as bad as I heard... That was a relief too. Probably in a couple of days the nerves will set back in when I start waiting for those test results. Oh I had also asked him about vit D and mets - so I did a blood test today too. So, my future with chemo or no chemo is still uncertain.",

I met with the pathologist mainly because of a thread on here started by a pathologist! He had a patient ask to meet with him and see her slides etc, and said she really benefited from it. He said to just ask them to go over report with you. He had a lot more details for me than my surgeon did, and even told me that the only \"cure\" was surgery to get it out - our immune systems won't go after it since it is our own tissue ( tho wonky), and treatments don't necessarily kill it all. His wife was diagnosed 3 yrs ago, so he understood what I was going through. I was questioning my decision on the way to his office, but now I'm really glad I went. We also talked about the oncotype test and he must've assumed my onc was going to order it - cause he already had it prepared to go when he called it over! It was nice to see the hidden part of my team!",

I'm not sure why - isn't 18 to 30 the grey area? Not that I want to do chemo.... You know what's still unnerving? Even so, the chance of mets in 10 yrs is still 10%! I know it could be worse, but it still seems higher than I'd like! Still waiting for insurance to be straightened out, and getting a little anxious - I still have to make that 2nd opinion appt. Another reason I'm looking forward to that is that my vit D did test low - and I asked my onc if he was going to prescribe it. He said he knows of all the studies but doesn't do that. Said I could just take 1000iu's of over the counter. Frustrating. I did see the radiology onc today - really like him. He answered my questions, is interested in reading about a university study I mentioned about frankincense - both nice and knowledgeable. And my friend with the brain tumor? Not good. An astrocytoma - even with treatments they say its probably 2 years tops (and that includes a 2nd surgery to remove it when it re grows). It's very difficult to think about. Horrifying actually. Kinda makes me feel guilty to worry about 10%. I do see my surgeon in the morning for another followup. The whole end of my breast is red now. The rad onc even called my surgeon to try to get me in (he must not have heard me say I had an appt in the morn). I have to admit that a part of me is afraid of ibc - it does have all the symptoms except inverted nipple - but then the symptoms are supposed to be basically the same for infection too.",

Ok, so I saw the mo on Friday, who personality wise wasn't as bad as I was fearing. But. My surgeon said he was \"by the book\" and that was very apparent. Filling my info in on the computer in front of me and it spit out my prognosis and plans for chemo. Maybe that's how they all do it? I don't have a clue since ive never done this before. Anyway, we did order the oncotype dx test. Both the mo and the pathologist said they'd have the results in a week. I called genome on Monday to make sure they received it and to see what date the results were expected to be at my mo's. I need to know this because I need to make an appt for a 2nd opinion (I heard of a dr about an hour from here who comes highly rated). But they hadn't received it yet. Told me to call my dr. They got back to me this morning saying it only went out on Monday, but next day. So I called Genome again and they still have not received it. And they told me it takes two weeks for results. So now I have to check again tomorrow. Really?! And why do my drs keeps saying one week? Don't they know how sick a patient would be to wait that extra week, wondering why?! So I meanwhile call for the 2nd opinion appt (with the possibility of switching to him as my mo) and thankfully they are wonderful! The girl also told me that sometimes the oncotype even takes longer if they want to check more. She's checking with the dr to see if he could get me in on what would be 15 days from when the oncotype was sent in - and should call me tomorrow. They are also requesting all of my info and also will be sending things to their pathologist. So this part sounds good. But meanwhile my surgery was on August 5th - and this 2nd opinion will be will be 4 and a half weeks from surgery - that makes me really nervous - it seems to be cutting it really close to when they want to get things rolling!! But I just can't do anything without this other opinion. I'm just afraid of getting pressured. I see the radiation oncologist next week for consultation. And this morning.... I find out that a good friend has a brain tumor. We will be with them all day tomorrow while he has specialized testing and has surgery next Tues. I'm telling nurses \"no, I can't come for an appt that day because...\" \"No, that's the day....\" And talking to his wife is bringing up all my terrifying emotions again - that initial time when you don't really know what you're dealing with, facing surgery, etc. I am so drained again.",

At first they thought it might have something to do with the radioactive or blue dyes, but after finding out the size of the tissue she removed and learning that she tried to remove most of the duct, I understood why - there has been a lot of trauma right behind a super sensitive area. So maybe where the cavity is could have something to do with it?",

Overall it isn't anymore swollen than it was, but at least initially I was happy that the shape of my breast seemed perfect after the lumpectomy - now weird things are showing up. As long as its not IBC though, I can deal with it! My surgeon is not a breast specialist, and I've read how IBC is typically misdiagnosed as an infection. I very well could have some infection, and have been on cephalexin for over 24 hours so far... Redness around my nipple might be slightly better, but not this area. Hopefully I can get in for that 2nd appt pretty quickly - one of his specialties is bc and it's at a breast cancer center. I just need to know for sure. I don't want my 90% chance of survival suddenly dropping to 40%! And this seemed to come on pretty quickly. Last weekend actually.",

I didn't take any meds after I got home because I wanted to see how bad it was, if I really needed them ( I have a fairly high pain tolerance and don't like to take anything). When the pain woke me up at 3:30 am, I realized that I most certainly did need them! Spent the next day at another hospital because a friend was having serious surgery - thought that would be rest enough since I was just sitting there, but was pretty uncomfortable (with meds). Today (surgery was Monday, today is Wed) its much better, but still really sore. I just took one Vicodin so I can move easier. Is this normal? The tumor was 1.5 cm and she just took the sentinel node. Also, after 48 hours it says to remove the bandages. That kind of oooks me out - I'm afraid to look at it! She couldn't use steri strips on me, just glue. I'm nervous that my bra will rub on an incision - and I have to wear a bra - otherwise it pulls. So am I being a wimp? Also, I cried some before this - I'd swing from being strong to being emotional, but I feel like I'm sliding more into the emotional side and am crying more... Is it just the settling of the adrenaline and the discomfort making it more real? Or am I just a basket case?
