I had minimal SEs Â and the fatigue was never bad enough to prevent me from taking care of the basic necessities. Do you have a nurse practioner or nurse navigator on your team? Perhaps she could tell you what services there are in your area that could help you out if you need assistance. Rides to treatments for instance. Do you live in an area where you can order your groceries online and have them delivered? Could you arrange to have your parents with you for the week of your first session, just to give you peace of mine and to see how you fare? Everyone if different in how they react to chemo and I was worried at first because I was going through it alone but it can be done, I was able to work throughout most of it. Best of luck. ",
