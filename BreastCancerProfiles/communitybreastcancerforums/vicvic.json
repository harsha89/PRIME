He told me to start using it before I began radiaiton and to continue throughout the treatment. It has really helped me! I just ordered my sixth tube!! I use it 3-4 times a day and will continue to use it after I finish radiation until my skin is restored. The website is being revamped and you can't order from it at this time but there is a 1-800 # on the website. I highly recommend this product! Good luck!!",
