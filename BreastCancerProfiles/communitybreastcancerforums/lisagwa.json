I chose mastectomy, actually double mastectomy. This was the right decision for me. Research your choices and contemplate your pros and cons of these choices. Also, you might want a 2nd opinion. (At first I was sure I was going to use the highly recommended first set of doctors I consulted with. Then I went for a 2nd opinion. I didn't expect to switch doctors but to my surprise did switch.) Lastly, once you gather all your info, think about the choice in the long run that you could live with best. good luck.",

      "Content": "May 22, 2012 11:45PM - edited May 23, 2012 12:17AM by lisagwa I don't remember exactly how long I took the pain meds. I do remember that the women on this board encouraged me to take them and not to hesitate about it. They were right. I started taking the pain meds regularly the first week. Then I think changed to IB Profen the 2nd week and maybe pain meds for sleeping only. I slept laying in bed with my head and legs elevated with pillows (not sitting up). i stayed in hospital only 1 night. You are having unilateral MX so you might feel better than I did. Also each person's body, age, pain tolerance and so on is different. listen to your body. Re drains, I didn't have any cancer in the sentinel node (I think they only took 2). I had 2 drains on each side. After the first week, one drain from each side was removed. I was told it was important to keep the drains in until a certain level. I think it's to prevent blood or fluid buildup so that you don't get an infection. I was also given antibiotics directly after mastectomes to prevent infection. I didn't find the drains to be a big problem, just annoying, especially when sleeping. Curveball, once this surgery is behind you, you will probably be relieved. I know I was. Good luck.",

You were diagnosed so recently.I think it takes time to come to terms. I was diagnosed 2 months ago and still am coming to terms and accepting this. I feel vulnerable and scared at times. Getting facts, researching information, and taking one day at a time helped me some.",
