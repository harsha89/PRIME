It's ok to be moany & moody, you're allowed ~ I tried to allow myself the occasional pity party, it's ok. It is not humanly possible to be in tip top shape 24/7, even without being faced with what we're going through. We tend to get back up and keep going through each phase of treatment, one foot in front of the other... just keep going, one day, hour, minute at a time... keep going. You will do well sometimes, and other times be extra kind to yourself. It's great to reach out here, it's helped me a lot when trying to get my head around so much information, and the community & tips are great. You're in very good company. Keep in close contact with your docs to let them know your concerns & symptoms, I hope you are, we're all different. It took awhile for my hair to start coming back, seemed stubborn ~ I'm over 3 months out from A/C & Taxol... really felt they were brutal on me, and am probably still experiencing side effects. My nails took a beating as well, but things are starting to come back. Am still careful about what to eat, but ecstatic in comparison to the chemo. Will only have my 4th Herceptin tomorrow, have a while to go with it. I had to come to terms with trying to live up to other's expectations of how they felt I should be doing... it really is an unnecessary additional burden to put on yourself. It is hard not to feel selfish over it, but I realized I had to make it a priority to take care of myself and put myself first sometimes - that included reducing needless stress in so many different ways in my life. It's not a game we're playing in, it's our lives. Your loved ones will understand, and if they don't right away they hopefully will eventually. (((virtual hugs))) SpecialK I really like your probiotic recommendation for the grumblies, I just ran out, maybe that's why they (grumblies) are back! That's going back on my priority list to get. :) Made the mistake of having a nice big bowl of baked beans, boy were they good though! All the best!!",
