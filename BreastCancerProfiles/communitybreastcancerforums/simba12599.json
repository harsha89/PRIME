She said it was inflamed also and put me on antibiotics in case it was mastitis and sent me for mammogram and ultrasound. Had both of those done this past Friday. U/s only showed several fluid filled cysts in both breasts. Spot has not changed during the week of antibiotics. She called me yesterday and to be on the safe side is sending me to local surgeon this thursday. Depending on what he thinks he may or may not do a biopsy of the skin. Do you think this is anything to be alarmed about? This past week has been a little nerve wracking.  Log in to post a reply",

I should have said I have had the cysts for years, first showed up in a 2003 mammogram but they is all the radiologist noted from these latest tests, not associated with the skin issue.",
