I felt like it was time to get back to a normal routine. I work part time, but long days. I am still really tired all the time. How is everyone else doing with energy? I also have a 3 and 5 year old so that might have something to do with lack of energy. I have Tamoxefin in my future and hope I end up being able to tolerate it. I have read that getting vitamin D level and magnesium level to normal may help with decreasing side effects. Does anyone else have any insight on preventing side effects. I just found this thread and it is helpful to read about everyone\u2019s journey",

I have found the fills just a little bit uncomfortable. I also only have one side. I try to do lots of stretching and massage around the expander. I think if you already have air expanding the muscle the saline should not be much different. I am really curious to see how everyone does on Tamoxefin. I hope everyone tolerates it ok ",

I have no idea if that is normal, but seems a long time. Are you still on antibiotics? Was your output under 30 mls before they were pulled? Mine closed up after about 48 hours, however I did have my drain in for over 24 days... horrible. I am on day 4 of Tamoxefin with no noticeable side effects. Hope is continues. I am taking it at night with dinner. When are others taking it and why? It sounds like peak plasma level is about 5 hours after taking it, so I think I would rather be sleeping. However steady state takes about 4 weeks and its metabolite about 8 weeks. So it will be between 1-2 months to know how we all really respond to it. What have others heard or read",

I would say normal, but I find myself a little short tempered. So much has changed hormonally I feel I should get a little slack... Is it the surgery removing part of me, the removal of the IUD, starting cycles after not having one the last 7 years (back to back pregnancies, breast feeding, then IUD). I forgot how much monthly bleeding stinks (that in itself could make me moody) or is it the starting a medication that mimics menopause. Oh and I completely changed my diet to plant based andno refined sugar. I just want to say I love ice cream in the Summer, say bye bye. Yeah... I think we should all get a little or a lot of slack if we are not quite ourselves for a little bit.",

My PS said that it is actually beneficial to wait a little bit because the implant softens the further out. I am also trying to plan the second surgery with time off. I truly hope things improve for you. Have you discussed your nerve pain with your oncology surgeon or MO? They would also be able to prescribe gabapentin. Some providers are not comfortable prescribing that because it needs to be titration up to therapeutic dose. I am a physician assistant. It can help with nerve pain. Try a different path to get it and try it. There are side effects as there are with everything... sigh .",

I am so sorry for those of you suffering from chronic pain and nerve pain. It wears on you both physically and mentally. You are correct those who have not experienced it do not understand. Hang in there and hopefully some of the alternative therapies will help. Being in the hands of a pain specialist is probably the best place to be. Surgeons are great at surgery, but generally at a loss with continued post-op pain. It is not their specialty and honestly they stink at it",

If not it is strict plant based diet for me, which I am starting anyway. I am about 6 weeks out and have no real pain. My expanders are full 550cc and I am back to work and exercise. It does get better!!! Hang in there. My energy is also starting to come back. Just a little bumb in the road called life!! I have three very important reason to make better lifestyle choices they are Austin (5), Sawyer (3), and my hubs. I was not necessarily unhealthy before, but I can do better. For those that are looking for other ways besides medication to decrease recurrence risk check out the book \u201cBreasts, the owners Manuel\u201d. Have a great weekend everyone",
