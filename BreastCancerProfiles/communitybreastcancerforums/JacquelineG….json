Lately I've felt it in my right hip and that's worried me (especially since next week is my 3-month and I'm concerned my onc will want to scan me) but today I walked for a while and it didn't bother me at all. These last 2 weeks I haven't exercised much because I had my exchange surgery, and those are the weeks I felt the pain -- so exercise does seem to help!) Everyminute, do you remember when you were allowed to run after your exchange surgery? I forgot to ask my PS and I'm getting very antsy after 2 1/2 weeks! Jackie",

I go through my ups and downs, and just when I feel like I'm going through a bit of a rut and think of doing something about it, I have some good days and forget about it for a while (never completely forget though). But yes, this is a grieving process and like you, I had never been sick before and really dislike the hypochondriac that I've become. But I can see a light at the end of the tunnel for us - the more time goes by, the better we will feel for more extended periods of time. About the hip pain, I'm on Tamoxifen, but I do hear some people experience hip pain with it. I'm comforted by the fact the pain goes away for days and sometimes weeks at a time... And yes, all those pains are normal - the mastectomy severed all those little nerves around the breast area and some of them will slowly regenerate and cause twinges of pain - that's how my BS described it.  Very exciting that your reconstruction is coming up!

Side effects: FEC-- mainly nausea, general weakness, some night sweats (especially after the first round) and just an overall feeling of discomfort. The first round was the hardest, the following 2 not as bad. Oh, and I felt great after 1 week, so it was nice to have 2 good weeks before the next round... I took Emend and Zofran for nausea, which seemed to help a lot. Taxotere had very different SE's. More flu-like symptoms, joint and muscle pain (but only for about 10 days or so -- after that I felt fine). Although the first Taxotere was tough, it was nice not to have the nausea! I got some of those icky side effects like darkening of nails and watery eyes, but it really wasn't too bad. The last 2 Taxoteres were a lot easier to bear.  Chemo is no picnic, but I promise, it's worth it! My first PET scan after mastectomy revealed a positive mammary lymph node (aside from my 6 positve axillary nodes) so I was very freaked out knowing I still had cancer in my body. BUT I had another PET after chemo, and the lymph node completely cleared up -- no sign of cancer!! So every little discomfort was worth it!! You'll do great, Kerry! Jackie",

For me this was a BIG hurdle, and I couldn't seem to find anyone else with a similar diagnosis. But since then I've heard of others with positive chest nodes who are doing fine. They also told me it was inoperable but that they would blast it with chemo and rads. I had a PET scan after chemo and BEFORE rads, and guess what? no signs of that chest node! I was ecstatic, and hopefully radiation to the IM nodes was just a reinforcement... So just wanted to let you know chemo and rads are just as effective on those nodes as surgery, if not more!  You'll do fine! Jackie",

Can there still be changes on radiated breast even 18 months post treatment? They are not itchy at all but I don't have much feeling there so I'm not sure I would feel them itch... I'm trying to tell myself it's nothing but i remember reading somewhere that skin mets can look like pimples so I'm freaking myself out! thanks for listening - Jackie Dx 6/2/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 6/40 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It's also bruising so I think I somehow injured it but I have no feeling there so I don't remember! Could be my 3-year old toddler???  Anyway, sending good vibes your way!

I was done with chemo on Dec. 12 and feel no effects of chemo anymore, haven't for a long time! You will get through this and feel FANTASTIC again!
