I am almost a six year survivor. ( I am a tri-neg.  had one positive node, 6 rounds of chemo, mastec. and oopherectomy/hysterectomy. BRCA 1 AND 2 positve.) I am very nervous. I have been having pain in my right hip for about 4-6 months. I had a MRI of my hip and it came back stating there was a \"suspicious\" area about an inch in diameter.  I had a bone scan in Feb. that was clear.  But, the MRI showed this area.  My doc ordered a Pet Scan.  Does anyone have any similar stories that ended up being not cancer related.  So nervous. I am 32. I have a 9 year old and 5 year old. Ugh!!!!!  This sucks! Dx 6/23/2002, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIB, 1/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

She would call and try to get a preliminary reading! She is an Angel!!!  So I do relate with your tension and anxiety as you wait. I do promise it will get better as time passes! xoxoxoxoxoxox",
