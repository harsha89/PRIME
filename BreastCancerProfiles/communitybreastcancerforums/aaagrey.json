I know this is normal, but the thing that I'm mostly worried about is on my right breast on the lower side is possibly an indent. Not sure if it's dimpling because when I raise my arms up or down or stretch my arms out in any way it doesn't show anymore. Both of my breasts sometimes have pain, but they aren't constant and go away. I don't have any lumps and other than the \"indent\" on my right breast and sometimes the pain everything else seems normal. I worry about little things a lot and look up condition so online that probably don't partake to me, but i just want to make sure because im very confused. If anyone could help that would be really great. Log in to post a reply",
