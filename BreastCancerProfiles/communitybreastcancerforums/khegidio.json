If I wanted to do a lumpectomy the tumor would hopefully be smaller 2. Doing chemo with the tumor in place would allow the drs. to identify if the chemo was working 3. It would give me more time to decide on my surgery There is essentially no difference in the prognosis.  Its a personal decision. ",
