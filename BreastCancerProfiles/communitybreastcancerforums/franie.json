Those that are a uni may need to be fitted to match the remaining breast and internet purchasing may not be practical the first time. We that are bilats may have it easier to purchase over the internet. Many types of prosthesis are available. I did choose silicone as I want the weight as light weight forms tended to let my bra ride up. I was and am a DDD and would be mortified to be seen without my prosthesis. I know my boobs are false but most do not and I can wear everything in my wardrobe that isn't curt to low. No one solution fits everyone and if it costs me a few hundred dollars to maintain my image I am willing. This is not to say I am right and others are wrong. Just my thoughts as what I feel is right for me. The important thing is we are alive regardless of our difference in whether we want to be flat or not. The best to everyone going through this horrible disease.",

Getting prosthetics at times does seem to be overwhelming but don't give up. I did purchase mine over the internet with some trail and error. To me getting a bra was more difficult than the forms. I have foam forms, light weight silicone forms and Jodee permaform which is forms built into a bra. I do wear the permaforms some around the house but the forms I wear the most are full silicone forms that have some weight to them, They keep my bra from riding up and give me the feel like something is there not just two lumps on my chest. The bra I choose is somewhat sexy and has pockets for the forms. I can wear the forms just in the bra cups also. I have found I get more bounce if the forms are in the pockets. Being a bilat you have the option to change size. I chose to remain the same size a DDD. A good store should have many forms and bras for you to try on. As has been said before you purchase make sure you can return them if not satisfied. Once you get what you like you can then order over the internet in the future for less. Good forms should last at least two years depending on the use and probably longer. Please don't get discouraged, there is a form and bra combination for you.  Franie ",

I just can't do it, I have tried. Noting fits and I feel naked. I really can't see how you can do it with one breast. I removed one of my forms and felt so unbalanced and couldn't conceal the fact I had a breast missing. I admire those that can go flat either with one or both breasts removed. I guess I haven't gotten over the fact I don't have my breasts. ",

I wear silicone forms that weigh about 3 lbs each. Yes they are heavy but so were my breasts. I wear them in both mastectomy and regular bras depending on what I am doing and wearing. In the pockets of a mastectomy bra I get jiggle and bounce and in a regular bra with the form next to my chest there is a lot less movement. Do to the weight and keeping my bra tight in the band and straps my bra tends to stay in place. I to would like to wear Victoria Secrets again, but I don't know if that is possible even with implants as bras are for breast tissue that can be molded and not for silicone or saline implants. ",

As you don't need to match an existing breast you could order forms over the internet. I was a DDD and choose to be the same size after surgery. With forms I do have the option to change size someday if I choose. With implants it would have been more difficult and expensive.",
