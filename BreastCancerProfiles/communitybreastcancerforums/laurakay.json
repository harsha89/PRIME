My heart is with you all.  Laura ",

I can't die. I called my clinic.  No news.  I'm going to the post office to get out of here.  I hope you're feeling better, and that your news will be good, and soon.  I'm feeling slightly better myself, mainly because I quit with the googling, which was so upsetting.  I'm sure I'll be a wreck again in about twenty minutes...
