I met with the Radiologist and she recommended three different lotions to prevent burning. They are called Miaderm, Radiaderm R1/R2, and StrataXRT. When I checked the price they were extremely expensive. Has anyone used these products and/or does any have any recommendations as to where to purchase these lotionsat a reasonable price? Thank you!
