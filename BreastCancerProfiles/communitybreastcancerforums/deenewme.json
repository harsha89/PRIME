I am going to get my doc to put me in the breast center at this other hospital. They are a teaching hospital so they have all new technology. Plus their center does all biopsies the same day and give you preliminary results. I hope they can get me in sooner. Please pray",

We caught early so I just had a total hysterectomy.  Now I noticed about two months ago my left breast felt weird when my arms where down. It changed its shape and my armpit felt slightly bigger.Also my chest area right below collarbone has been swollen.  I even spent a week in hospital thinking I was having a blood clot or something.   I ignored the swelling in my breast and armpit it until last week when I went outside during below freezing weather and felt this intense pain in one area of my left breast. I went in the house and did a breast exam and right in that spot and there it was. A lump I never had.  I decided to check the armpit and there was another one.  I made my appt with my OB/GYN and she reminded me of my last mammogram 3 yrs ago where they focused on my left breast cause they found something but ultrasound said everything was ok. She did another breast exam and found two more plus the two i found. She said one was under my breast, one near nipple,  one at 12o clock and one at 3o clock...oh yeah plus the one in armpit. I just remembered that.  Well they made my diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound appointment but they were backed up two weeks due to the holidays now I have to wait till the 28th.I have been calling everyday to see if any cancellations but I guess I have to be patient.  Well that's my story for now. I am scared and I know it may be nothing but I can't shake my intuition that it is something. My left breast just feels different and looks different from right. I want to say i admire all the courageous women i have been reading on here.  You all are truly an inspiration. One last thing I have been having pain in my left shoulder and arm.

I know it sounds weird but I just knew something was wrong with my cervix even though there were no symptoms but abnormal pap smears. I had cryosurgery when I was 17 because pre cancer cells were present. Had my four kids and that's when it came but this time they were cancerous cell's. I have diagnosed myself with all the health issues I have had then doctor always confirmed. I told them something was wrong with my spine. They ignored it cause I was like 25 now it was finally confirmed few yrs ago I have two herniated disc, sacroiliac joint dysfunction and degenerative  disc disease. I told them something was wrong with my right leg and arm. Turned out I have neuropathy and sciatica. They thought I was just this young woman trying to get pain pills.  I know I shouldn't think ill thoughts but I feel when I have my mammogram the results will be BC. I think that's why I am calm about it and handling it. I have no hormones to get lots of cyst.  I remember what cysts felt like when I was menstruating and these are not that.  I have never had these symptoms with my breast. It's also weird to look down and see my left breast looking so oddly shaped and swollen especially my armpit. I shouldn't have ignored it when I noticed my arm was resting differently on my left breast.  It also won't stop itc",
