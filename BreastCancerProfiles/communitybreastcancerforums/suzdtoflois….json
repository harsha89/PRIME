Finished Chemo in September of '09 - Well, February 14th, I started my period and I am still flowing - 29 days. some days are light, others are heavy -no consistency what so ever. Anyway, called ocn - they discussed symptoms with me asking lots of questions, advised me to call gyn. Gyn asked in I were extremely weak or if I had passed out yet - no - they made me an appt for June and told me to keep track what was going on. I personnally think 29 days is quite a long time - anyone else going through similar?
