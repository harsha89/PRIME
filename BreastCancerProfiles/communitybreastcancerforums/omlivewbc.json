Isn't it something the way our test results can vary?  We come together in hopes of benefiting from other experiences.  There are so many variables and so many different tests.  However, in this case based on your test results it sounds like a safe bet to rely on the bonescan.  I will add that I recently had a spine MRI to check for mets on spinal cord.  There were no mets found on cord, but the spine itself showed mets on a couple the original areas.  Both rad and med onc currently feel this is possibly an inactive spot and not reason to adjust tx at this time.  But we will definitely be on the lookout when I scan again next month.  We'll see.

Since I was in the stores anyway I went ahead and browsed through Ladies Home Journal, Good Housekeeping and Essence magazine.  Of course each of these fine publications carried some type of bc article in their Oct issue.  I was so saddened by the disregard for any mention of a bc stage less than II.  I was once stage II seven years ago and would have sucked up stories such as those featured in these articles.  Now, I get out the big \"Not Applicable\" stamp and hunger for stories from stage IV ladies.  So thank you.

I'm 100% convinced I'll be in better hands with her. She's at a major cancer center affiliated with an academic insitution and hospital and we've already discussed more tx options than I have heard about from my current onc. I have been with my current onc since my initial bc dx in 1999 at age 32. We have a great relationship. I just don't think he's aggressive enough or that he has a broad variety of treatment options in mind for me. Or that he uses the proper tools to diagnose and monitor me. I don't think he's used to assertive 40 yr old patients who do their own research and wants her doc to do everything possible to keep her around for her two young children. His practice is fairly small and I very rarely see anyone close to my age in his office. Most of the tests he has ordered for me have been at my request, and I had to really work to convince him. That's exhausting and scary. When I was coughing incessantly back in Nov he gave me an xray which came back clean and sent me on my way. If I hadn't insisted on further testing, I wouldn't know I am now stage IV. And I had to absolutely insist on the brain MRI I had last month that dx a lesion in the brain. And also, although he is a sweetheart, the bedside manner of his office staff sucks. I want out of there as it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the urge to slap his staff when they talk down to me. I'm currently being treated for lung/bone mets with weekly chemo. I've already scheduled my first treatment with my new onc in a few weeks and need to inform my current onc of this decision when I see him this week. He knows I've been using this major cancer center as a 2nd opinion, but will be surprised to learn that I plan to break up with him. But the truth is I think my outlook and prognosis will be much better in someone else's hand. I'd be interested in advice from anyone who has also switched oncs mid-treatment. What to say? Is it a good idea to have the old and new onc have a conversation? How to deal with the anxiety of ending this 7 year relationship? Olivia Log in to post a reply",

I had three ports placed during my Abraxane/Avastin treatment this year.  Infections, poor healing, just a mess.  And quite a nuisance when one is trying to focus on the treatment and not the port which is supposed to make treatments easier!!  During my last placement the surgeon loaded me up on stitches on both the old and new incisions and we kept them in for two weeks to allow extra healing.  That finally seemed to work.  Left an ugly scar though, but really who cares.  I hope you read this in time to discuss this option with your doc.",

I'm currently being treated for lung/bone mets. Only three months into treatment and my mets are already difficult to detect on my scans. Encouraging part number one is that it appears I'm on my way back to NED. Encouraging part number two is that I had a seven year remission before my recent mets dx. Of course we thought I was cured after 7 yrs stage II. But if I had to have a recurrence, I'm glad to know it was held off for 7 years. I was 32 when first dx.
