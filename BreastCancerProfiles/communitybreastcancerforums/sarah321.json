      "Content": "sarah321 wrote: I found a lump in my right breast 4 months ago - it's right at the top of my breast. It's more an area of thickening than a well definited lump, which is why I am particularly worried. There are no defined edges, but it is not attached to the chest wall - it moves up and down but not side to side. It's deeper than being just under the skin, making me wonder if it is attached to deeper tissue and it is that that is moving? It doesn't hurt when I press it like the same area on my opposite breast does, although after the doctor had a good hard poke at it last week it was painful for days - I could feel it as I ran downstairs for example. (My breasts are 32FF so they move a lot when I run!) I didn't really worry about it that much till a few weeks ago when I realised this breast has got bigger than the other. It also feels more uncomfortable in this breast than the other when I'm not wearing a bra - no particular pain, it just feels more heavy and uncomfortable. I've suffered from horribly painful breasts for 3 weeks out of the month since I started taking the pill anyway, so it's hard to differentiate sometimes. The doctor said he thought it was just fibrous tissue but booked me into the breast clinic as he agreed that, as I have had it for more than a few cycles, it should be checked out properly. (He didn't bother giving me a full breast exam though, pretty much using my age as a reason to not be worried - but I am!) I started taking the pill 5 months ago and only noticed this lump / breast thickening after my first month on that, so research has made me start to wonder if there is some connection there? I have an appointment next Monday at the clinic, but obviously my mind is going crazy and I can't do anything but think of what might lie ahead. I can't stop getting upset. I can't stop googling either - and every one of my symptoms point towards the least desirable outcome. Any kind and uplifting words would be much appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

I've been digging around in there for the last few weeks but only just found it, though my armpit has been feeling a bit strange for the last week. I'm freaking out, my clinic appointment isn't till Monday. Is there a way of getting in faster or should I just wait?",
