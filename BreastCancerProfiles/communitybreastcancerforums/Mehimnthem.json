      "Content": "Mehimnthem wrote: Hi, I feel very tearful and mixed up whilst writing this. I am 40 years old, married and have two children 12 years n 8 years. This all started last Friday night 11.8.12. In brief i was driving along the road when somehow I discovered a lump. It is on my left side somewhere between my breast and armpit. I had never felt it before, but without sounding irresponsible, had I ever really checked myself properly or regularly enough to find it. I was a little concerned. Completely out of character for me. My mind started running a bit wayward, thinking all sorts n I had a few secret tears. My two children were in the car. They knew nothing n saw nothing. My husband was home. I had no intention of telling him anything at that stage as instantly he would think the worst. i went to work the next day as usual. I went to a local drop in centre on the morning. As it happens the doctor i seen was a skin specialist. After examining me, and my request for honesty and his true opinion, I was told the following; That the lump which is approx 2inchs by 1/2\" in his opinion was one of two things. A piece of fatty tissue or a breast lump, but he said he was swaying more towards the lump. Just like me he couldn't quite decide if it was in the armpit or attached to my breast. Obviously I fully understand that this was not any kind of diagnosis only his opinion. He said as his job was a skin specialist, he deals with all sorts of irrregularities n mine did not feel like fatty tissue. On the other hand he was by no way telling me that It was a cancerous lump either. He treated me professionally and exactly as I had asked. I was advised to see my own GP first thing Monday and ask for an urgent referral to the hospital. I did just that and now have my appointment which is this coming Tues. (that is the day of the clinic each week). I would describe myself as very level headed and also independent. My husband is level headed but to say he is a pessimist is an under statement. I left grateful for his honesty. Understandably I was concerned but felt as he was so honest I had little to worry about. I told my hubby when I got home on his advice. Well, well well well well! Since then it has been one of the most emotional mixed up weeks of my life. He is completely convinced the absolute worst thing is inevitable. I understand his worry, quite obviously, it is happening to me after all. The thing is, because he is so so bad, my mind keeps going off in a tangent, I keep telling him all will be fine, all of it is simply precaution. I am working so hard at trying to protect him but inside I am getting more n more worried. Then I pull myself together and feel so so guilty for feeling sorry for myself. I almost feel like a fraud, as how do I know I have anything to be worried about. There are so many people who a million times worse of then I am. How dare I? Yet then secretly I cry myself to sleep!!! I am beating myself up in so many directions I feel like I am going crazy!!!! Is this normal? Log in to post a reply",

I think I just feel un justified feeling so worried when I have nothing to worry about yet! How selfish am I? I know you will say I am not but that's how I feel. The advice on research I definitely will adhere to. Initially I did start but as soon as I realised lumps don't usually hurt if harmful, mine doesn't. I stopped looking. I think this was an opportunity for me to talk openly without judgement and without worrying loved ones because I am worried!!!!! Do u think I will know one way or the other Tuesday! I understand the scan shows enough to give the doctor a vg idea but the biopsy results could take a while. ðŸ˜˜",

I have seen my own gp following the initial visit to the drop in centre. He has referred me to my local hospital to the breast clinic. He said it was an urgent referral on request of the initial doctor. I do however believe if it relates to lumps this is standard procedure. I believe I am going for an ultra sound scan, then depending on the findings take it from there. My own GP stated due to the location of it, it may not be suitable for the breast clinic and this may result in a further referral to another department. That is because it's in clear if it is in breast or armpit! I don't why it has hit me so hard just now. I have been strong, focused, and almost dismissive of anything. Then in bed last night (alone as hubby was in with my son) (we play musical beds as a matter of course). It just hit me like a steam train. Now I can't seem to focus on positivity. I am at work tomorrow, (I am a police women) that will keep me occupied, so hopefully tuesday will be here real soon and I will be on here very soon with happy smiles n thanking u all for your true support.

I just wanted to say a huge huge thank you to all you sincere lovely people that took the time to listen and support me. U will never know how grateful I am it really did help me so much. I hopefully will never be in this position again. I had a minute, miniscule, tiny, period in my life where i thought the worst. Something you brave, strong, wonderful people have as reality every day and still find the strength and kindness to help others. I take my hat off to u all! I wish you all sincere best wishes n luck.
