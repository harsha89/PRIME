It's not that long but it sure feels like a lifetime ago. I am still on the road to recovery, but this community is definitely a wonderful place to be. I don't post very often, but always find myself turning here for some encouragement when I am down, some advise when I am confused. Some advise that I have gotten over the past two months, which I find does help me especially during the period I was waiting for results, don't fret over the things that you have no control over. Focus on what you can do to make yourself feel better and prepared. For me, it was reading up and talking to people with similar experiences. Knowledge always makes me feel less fearful and helps me to make decisions better. Although, try not to \"over-read\" which can cause stress, since we are in an era of information overload with the internet, books, etc. See if you can zero down to the legit material and sources. For example, the information here is really helpful and helps me narrow down on the things I want to do further research on. Go out and have some fun when possible; a positive, relaxed mind can make all the difference. Stop what you are doing when you feel overwhelmed, and take deep, deep breaths. This really helps me, the feeling of oxygen permeating my entire being just has this soothing effect that really calms me down. Are there any support groups or medical social support you can go to? I was not given such recommendations at first and had to request for it through my Oncologist. I was then referred to a Psychologist who not only talked me through my fear of surgery (never had any before my diagnosis), and also my financial and social worries. This was really a big help. Do let us know how it goes. One step at a time. I wish you all the best!",

      "Content": "May 16, 2017 08:16PM - edited May 16, 2017 08:18PM by Matryoshka Thank you for your kind words, KimPossible. You may want to ask your Doctor about sentinel lymph nodes biopsy and axillary lymph nodes clearance. My lymph nodes were clear from the MRI scans, but my Oncologist told me she would remove some sentinel nodes from my underarm for testing during my lumpectomy, and if need be, I will need a clearance of the underarm nodes. And turns out one of the two sentinel nodes removed from my first surgery had expansion beyond the nodal wall that my doctor was concerned with, so she recommended a second surgery to clear it out, to see if it has spread. I read up somewhere that sometimes Doctors don't always tell patients about lymph nodes procedures up front, or even if it was shared, it gets forgotten because we are more concerned about the breast cancer diagnosis, the chemo, the radiation. So may be a good idea to check with your Doctor on this. Good to know what procedure you will be undergoing, especially when any form of lymph nodes removal will have potential side effects ranging from mild to serious (such as numbness, stiffness, painful sensitivity, lymphedema). We don't need any surprises like this in our condition! (= Just keep in mindthat a clearance is not always necessary, it may not even be recommended if you will be going for radiation. Just that for my case, the Onco felt it is necessary, and I trust her. Feel free to ask if you have any questions! There are a lot of information on this site to read up on too!",

And there I was, all confident that I would be able to go back to work today. Really felt the fatigue too! But it wasn't that bad, was able to eat and got some work done. Then I cut myself a little break, left work early and came home for a good nap. Feeling all better now. Now I find myself wondering if it gets worst in the upcoming sessions, or will this be what is expected. Still kind of waiting for the worst to hit me. The waiting can be quite urgh. @theantz yeah, the icing really hurt my hands and feet! I winced like a baby. But I am going to tweak a few things for this week, try out DodgersGirl's suggestion, and see how it goes. Cannot wait for my elastogel gloves and footwraps to arrive. Anyway, the session last Friday was done through my forearm, because they attached the blood pressure monitor to my upper arm since it was my first chemo. I am seriously considering a port now because of the bruising. I am going to try attaching a picture at the end of this post. One bruising is not that bad but 12 more sessions of this, people might just start wondering if I am in some fight club. The doctor did not specifically push for a port, he just told me about it and that I can decide when I am good and ready, and he can pop it right in. Sounds like a breeze. My Taxol sessions are 12 sessions, once a week. I am not entirely sure of the dosage. Let me try to see if I can find out tomorrow. Sounds like you are getting a higher dosage per week than me, although the total sessions is still 12, which puts us at the same overall dosage? This can get really confusing at times. I will also get 5 weeks of rads after the chemo, and hormone therapy. Do you know your hormone therapy regimen yet? I am already on ovary suppression (leuprolide) to help preserve my fertility, and will be on aromatase inhibitors after rads, if nothing changes. I totally get the part about life revolving around this. Just barely three months ago, my worries basically consist of back-stabbing colleagues, work deadlines, who to meet after work, what to do on weekends. And now, it's just different. It's not horrible different, but definitely not good different. I do struggle sometimes, trying to find a meaning out of it all, why this is happening to me. But it's not that bad. I am still going, and plan to keep going. =) @Mari- definitely believe acupuncture works! But my Onco has warned me A LOT of times not to mix disciplines since acupuncture is considered alternative therapy. But will definitely look into it once I finished the chemo and rads! Here, acupuncture is usually offered with Chinese traditional medicine, and there are a lot of health benefits associated with keeping general health. Just not whilst going through chemo. Hope all you ladies are having a wonderful day! Edit: here's the bruise from last Friday. It looks worst than it really is! Sorry the picture is so huge! ",

I was talking a mile a minute to my friend right before the pre-med infusion, but almost immediately felt drowsy and fell asleep when it started. I didn't even realized they began the actual chemo! But sadly I couldn't do the icing of limbs, it was so, so, so painful! :( Was really hungry after the session, ate a lot and let the fatigue claimed me. Woke up about 4 hours later now and feeling quite ok. So here I am! Anyone on taxol who have similar experience with increased appetite? :) Would really appreciate any advise what to expect over the next few days!",

Oh and theantz, you probably already have a confirmed plan for your treatment, but would like to share a bit of my own experience, if it helps. I am getting the full works, chemo, radiation after and five years of hormone therapy (ovary suppression and aromatase inhibitors instead of just tamoxifen as my Medical Onco felt she wants me to benefit from the addition few percent of survival rate on this regimen). I was really worried and stressed out about overtreatment, it really seems like ALOT. But the Onco told me, you are young (I am 34), and most likely to be able to make a good recovery from the treatments, and we want you to have the best shot at survival possible, even if each treatment only adds on a small percentage, we still want you to have it. Felt the sincerity and thought put into it, so I say, alright then, let's strap up and get going! Only thing that boughs me down a little is my decision not to preserve my eggs. But I won't be able to think about getting pregnant for the next 5 to 6 years anyways, and I am single, so keeping the faith that if I am meant to be a mother, I will. :",

I have been preparing to shave off everything, but again did not anticipate how difficult monitoring the hair loss and deciding when to actually do it will be. It will probably be this week. Kinda tiring sweeping up after myself. All the hair! ok, sad things aside. I am faring much better this week than last week. Except that the weight gain is starting! And I been having a little salty, buttery taste in my mouth since yesterday. But nothing horrible. Comfort level is still good! Teese - yup, I am doing Taxol first. A little worried about having an easier time now, and having a tougher time with AC later. But trying not to overthink on what I cannot control. Don't think I am given any neulasta, but I am having my first follow-up with my Onco after starting chemo tomorrow. We will know how I am faring! But overall, feeling good! Sunnyjay - My nurses too told me to report anything unusual. I actually tried to close my eyes and FEEL my entire being just to see if anything is out of norm.

But hey, I should listen to my body, right? My medical Onco is out of town, but she is keen to start my treatment soon, hence she got a fellow doctor to run through the information with me, so I can start asap. There has been a delay of about two months since my first surgery, due to a second surgery to remove more lymph nodes and me wanting to go through a mammaprint test to see if chemo is really necessary. The lab somehow delayed my tissue samples, which caused the whole process to take a little longer than expected, and my medical Onco seems rather uncomfortable with waiting any further. Now that we know chemo is necessary, everything is moving quickly. I hope I have time to prepare everything before next Friday! I see most of you have or are getting ports placed. Is this something mandated by the hospital? The stand in Doctor told me briefly about it, but said I don't have to decide now. Great, even more decisions. Meh.

Just realized after reading more posts that no one told me what was in my pre-meds, and I never thought to ask. Silly me. Will find out during next week's session! But seeing I have improved appetite and trouble sleeping, won't be surprised steroids is in the mix. It's now 4 am over here, and my brain is humming the Smurfs' jingle. I am gonna do 12 weekly sessions of taxol, followed by 4 sessions of AC every three weeks. Doc only precribed anti-nausea medication to take home, but to take only if I get nausea. Although I am seeing a lot of comments to take it before nausea even kicks in. Might take one later in the morning if I managed to fall asleep. Have my puke bucket ready beside my bed! Will see how my joints and limbs fare over the next few days, and report back! I had on gloves and soaked it in ice water, feet was in socks. I couldn't ice my feet at all. But had my fingers immersed in the ice water for about an hour cos I fell asleep, but woke up with tingling and numbness in my hands, probably from the cold. So I asked my friend to help take it away. The nurse taking care of me was also worried about frost bite and kept checking on me. Funny thing was my friend said I was severely pale during the icing, and almost immediately after taking away the ice, I had colour in my face and cheeks, like blush and lipstick. Doctor on call was amused by this but told me not to worry. My Onco recommended elastogel gloves and footwrap, so I ordered from Amazon. Let's hope that goes betters when it's here.",

I couldn't comb my hair on Monday morning after washing it, because the fallen hair was so tangled up with the still attached hair, yet any tugging just pulls the attached hair off. I felt like Gollum, clutching onto my hair. Just short of screaming my precious. I decided I don't want to keep feeling this way, waiting for it to fall and feeling upset about it, so the deed was done! Most difficult decision I ever made, because I love my hair, but a really good decision I don't regret. It feels so liberating! One less side effect to worry about! I then had a great week! Went for a Cirque Du Soleil show that is in town, my bloodwork came back ok. Liver is fine, kidneys are fine. And I actually went for a spot of cycling with a friend today, saw some fireworks and ended up eating fries and nachos at an outdoor music festival. Not bad for a woman who started the week crying over her hair, and a day after her chemo! I really hope taxol will go as well for the ladies on AC first, then taxol. So far the side effects has been really manageable for me. I do have some rashes here and there. But not much nausea and fatigue has been getting better. My appetite has been too good though. =P I am a little worried about AC. It seems like it really packs a punch. But that is two months later me's problem. JenRuns, I chuckled when I read about your post about falling pubes. Mine is falling out too, and I was really hesitant telling anyone about it.

I did get diarrhea after my third infusion last week, had to go at least three times. Almost did not made it to the toilet the first time. But I was at home, so not so bad. But seems like my side effects are not consistent. No diarrhea this week yet. Question, do any of you ladies develop any kind of allergies to foods that you never had any reaction to before chemo? I have always been a seafood person and have no problem with shellfish, but I have been seeing some rashes form after having some shrimps. They are super itchy. Just wondering if it's something that develops with the treatment and if it will go away. I love seafood though, if it's permanent I will be so sad. It happened after my review with my Oncologist last Tuesday, so I have to wait another month before I can ask her. Guess I will have to avoid shellfish for the time being. Anyway, I do want to share some tweaks my Oncologist introduced into my chemo regimen to help manage the side effects after my review with her. Remember I mentioned that I get a very noticeable reddening in the face which feels really warm after the infusions, and the day after the session? I really felt fine but the nurses and pharmacist seems really concerned about it, so my Oncologist introduced a higher dosage of antihistamine for my pre-meds, and also slowed down the speed of the taxol infusion. Now instead of half an hour of pre-meds and one and half hours of actual taxol infusion, it's two hours of taxol infusion. And it worked! No tomato face this week! It's a slightly longer session for me, but I am just sitting there anyway.",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2017 11:14AM - edited Jul 21, 2017 11:30AM by Matryoshka Hi ladies! Teese, thank you for constantly keeping me in your thoughts! I been in a somewhat fatigue mode, and between keeping up with work and managing rest, haven't been coming on the boards much. How was Dunkirk?! I am such a huge Tom Hardy fan!!! Anyway chemo day is always on a high from steroids day so here I am! A little report on side effects for me thus far on Taxol. Hair thinning out, and seeing piles of my fallen tresses everywhere. But still observing to see when I should shave it all off. I developed a rash on the fifth day after round 2, but doctor says it's quite unusual to have it after round 2 and so many days after. Got better today. They adjusted my pre-meds today to see if it will help the rash. Got a cream and oral antihistamine too if it develops again. And I am still getting face flushes during the chemo and after. Last week and today, they stopped the chemo halfway to put me on an antihistamine drip before continuing. Also having a little tingling in my hands, still trying to improve the way I ice, because of the lack of freezers, my icing gloves and foot wraps gradually lose their coldness halfway through. Today was funny, cos I had them pull the curtains on and told my friend who was accompanying me to go have her lunch since I was drowsy and sleepy anyway. Suddenly I felt this sudden hot sensation spread across my face and chest. It was quite gentle though, not painful or uncomfortable. But I buzzed for the nurse since they told me many times to notify them if I feel anything differently. Two nurses came RUNNING in, just when my friend came back from her lunch. And she thought something happened to me. So the nurses were talking really loudly to me, thinking I have coded or something, and my friend kept asking me what's wrong! The drama! It was really sweet of them. But I was really fine and was laughing when I said I really feel ok, but just reporting the hotness experienced. Really appreciate the care though. =) Otherwise, overall still fine. I am getting breathless easily now, so I am learning to walk slower. I have a somewhat busy bee walk, so I tend to go really fast especially when I am on a task. I walked up to my boss' office really fast the other day, and was totally out of breath. Had to ask for a minute before I talked to him. He's a good sport though. I wear a mask whenever I go out now. Other than that, appetite's ok though a little picky on what I want to eat, lots of soup and fruits. Oh but my white blood cells count was borderline today, luckily my Oncologist reviewed my stats and deemed me ok to go for chemo. Really hate to miss any sessions! Been trying to read up a bit on how to keep the white blood cells count up, and found manuka honey quite recommended. Anyone has tried before or have any other recommendations? I am already taking some manuka honey, not daily since that stuffs' expensive but if it helps, I would like to try it. My Oncologist is very strict on her no supplements rule unless cleared by her, but no restrictions on food. Not about to defy her since she's my \"drug dealer\". Heehee! Will see her for review on coming Tuesday and see what she says too. A little more to add about mouth sores and constipation. I had neither. Not sure if what I am doing helps, but sharing anyway. I rinse after every meal with a baking soda and salt water mixture. And also with Oasys moisurising mouthwash once a day after brushing my teeth before I go to bed. To prevent constipation, I eat a little dried apricot, dried prunes or prune juice. I don't do all on the same day. Just a bit of each in different days. Worth a try if any of you are experiencing mouth sores or constipation.",

Had quite a bit of flushing on my face during the chemo, and they gave me another dose of Benadryl on top of the dose already given during premeds, to prevent allergy. And I realise that it's what makes me buzzed. One dose is lightheaded, two doses and I am a high like a kite. It's now almost 8 hours after? And I am still gigglish. Gonna try to sleep now. Will try to give more coherent updates when I can. Managed to find out the premeds and dosage of chemo too! But the whole task of unzipping my bag, taking out thefolder, taking out the piece of paper and typing it here, just feels teeheehee! Have a good day, hope you all meet Ben C lookalikes or even Ben C himself! =D  ",
