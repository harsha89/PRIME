Stripping the drains is just holding the drain tube between thumb and finger and gently sliding down the tube, this helps to keep the drain tube free of deposits and not get blocked.  I only did mine when I could see there was deposits building up.  I only had my drains for about 6 days when I had my BMX so I am hoping for about the same ths time.

Did it spread? It's only after the surgery that you will know for sure. Please tell your sons they will want to help you, let them be strong for you. gtgirl, good luck with your surgery, having a blood issue to deal with as well as all this makes it hard. Finding out all the options available is a great thing and I found the ladies here to be so supportive I found out so much just from reading. Nancyjean1967, I hear you about the constipation...

Now it's 2013 and I can't remember where or when I left those fears all I know is I don't live in fear everyday.
