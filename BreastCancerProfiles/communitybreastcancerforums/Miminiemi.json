Will you be the person to take her daily?  If I was doing that with my mom now, I would try to make each day a \"just us girls together\" kind of time.  Try to enjoy the opportunity to share the time.  Believe me, I have experienced caregiver exhaustion so I don't offer that suggestion blindly.  Sometimes I felt just plain cranky and impatient.  You can complain here and not be judged.  We all have those feelings.  It may be harder for you than her.  I hope they will let you be present for the consultation/simulation.  Maybe even watch on camera the treatments.  Also hoping you can be present during visits with nurse and radiation oncologist (RO).  They will help know how to deal with any side effects.  You did not mention surgery, so that has to be factored in if she has had any.   Don't be afraid to ask questions here.  I found lots of answers here.  Others feel free to add to or disagree with what I've posted,  thanks",

But I am happy to say the we're all healed exactly two weeks after rads were done. I went braless, kept lubed well to avoid friction and to allow healing, also used Domboro soaks to relieve itch and keep old skin together as much as possible to let skin under it grow back before old skin tears. I'm editing to add some thoughts about our care in general.  I wish they would tell us the \"why\" of things more often.  It would help with patience and even follow through.  All the instructions about skin care seemed contradictory and the nurse even remarked about that.  But after lots of reading I could understand why I was alternating a drying astringent with moisturizing ointment.  Even that small piece helped me know what to apply where, exactly where!  I am hoping this all goes fast for you now.",

It sounded like they were saying the chances were just as great that some other problem was more likely to present itself and harm us as cancer recurrence.  But we must remember that those are group statistics and not individual.  My doctors never considered not recommending radiation, and in fact the surgeon said if a lumpectomy then radiation was important/necessary like they were married.  Since my mother lived to be 94 and died of Alzheimers my financial advisor seems to think I need to plan to live a long time.  Keep up the rads and certainly don't jump off the table while it's buzzing.  I'm on day 3 past my last treatment and the itching is letting up.  And I have an excuse to sit quietly and not do anything that might injure my fragile skin!  I'm not using Bag Balm - but they sell it everywhere here and the farmers swear by it.   The radiation machine reminds me of puff the magic dragon looking me in the eye from one side and then swinging around to look at me from the other angle.  So I called it Puff.  The techs laughed and told me they always call it Ursula.  I don't know why.  Night all.",

I don't really know if the local radiologist reviews the results. The surgeon warned me they will takeouts more pictures than just a regular screening and not to be alarmed. That was my first clue last December that something was wrong. They kept sending me back for more with no explanation. And then an ultrasound before the radiologist came to see me. Ugh I'll be glad to get it over with and hope we both are fine and pain free. ",

I think it also prevents the skin getting itchy to some extent, but doesn't control itch on that rash. They told me to continue even after rads were done.  Now my skin is just peeling in tiny soft balls of old skin revealing new skin beneath.  The cornstarch helps keep you dry to avoid skin rubbing on skin when sweaty.  The domeboro soaks are astringent.  Astringent tightens the skin and helps hold it together.  Since your own skin is the best bandage on top of new skin (even when it is damaged) I think it helps hold it all together as long as possible.  I finished rads two weeks ago and was the most itchy the last few days and about a week after.  Now I'm back in my bra, no itches, and new skin looking good next to old gray skin that is pilling off like wool on an old sweater.  Hope this helps.",
