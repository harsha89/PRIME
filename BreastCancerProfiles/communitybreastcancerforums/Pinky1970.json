I am 42 years old, I have had yearly mammograms in 2010 my report said my breast were very dense. In 2011 my reoort said there is persistant density in my right breast. They ordered a spot compression for a possible mass with oartially obscured and circumscribed boarders. 2012 normal mammogram with hetergeneously breast. Just had another mammogram which I was called back for the same breast. However the radiologist wants to monitor the area and come back in 6 months. He stated a biopsy would be to difficult to target. Its the same area. I don' t know what to do. I have gone to my appointments alone. I just feel like no one is listening.",
