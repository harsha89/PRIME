I just joined last night at 3am and by morning I had many replies. I'm grateful to all of you! My pcp gave me a prescription for just 1 pill of xanax strength 0.50 and told me to cut it in half. I also confirmed that I need to wait until after I sign the consent form before I take it. And confirmed I will be in an upright position for the mammogram guided core needle vacuum biopsy. I definitely will not look at the screen as I'd pass out if I saw an image of the needle going into my breast. I can't even look when I have blood drawn. Plan to close my eyes the whole time. Thanks for telling me what to expect!! I think taking tylenol before is a good idea too. I believe tylenol is safe and doesn't thin the blood. But I will call the facility to be sure that's ok too. Best wishes to all of you and thanks again!!",

The radiologist gave me more lidocaine, but by then, I almost fainted, literally. And my breast was still in the mammogram machine with needle injected. So thankful i stayed conscious so they could finish it. They laid me down as soon as they finished which restored the blood flow to my head. And gave me juice. Once home I went to bed and iced the breast every 30 min. I have architectural distortion. They got 8 tissue samples. Said I'd have results in 2 to 4 days. I'm terrified and my gut tells me this is just the beginning rather than the end. I'm praying that I'm wrong. In scared I don't have the strength to face bad news.",

I'm scheduled for a mammogram guided core needle vacuum suction biopsy in 3 weeks. I have small breast (B cup) with dense tissue. I barely endure the pain of my breasts being smashed during the mammograms and screamed from the pain. Can someone tell me if during the biopsy, will the breast be compressed as hard as usual? I know I'll get lidocaine, but not until they find the exact site to biopsy. I'm terrified I won't be able to endure the initial 20 minutes of the procedure due to likely pain. I've never taken xanax before, but wonder if that might help? Any information or experiences with mammogram guided biopsies or taking antianxiety meds prior would be greatly appreciated!!
