So, I guess my Ki67 wasn't that big of a factor after all. I haven't seen the full report yet, so I can't provide any other details, but if/when I learn more, I'll post an update. Good news of all this is that I don't need chemo. I'm very happy about that! :-)",

I could've gone back after 2 or 3 days. I'm wracking my brain trying to remember my aftercare instructions. I think I was allowed to take the bandage off after a few days? But my memory is a little fuzzy, so don't quote me on it. I would just follow up with your surgeon's office (or nurse) to see what they recommend. I've updated the member list to include surgery type - good call! :-) Good luck tomorrow HockeyChick!!!",

I wonder what your age has to do with it? Personally, I would insist on to meeting with (or at least speaking on the phone with) the surgeon beforehand just to understand what exactly they plan to do. At the very least, it should give you some peace of mind. Here's a good list of questions you can ask them: https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/lum...

Of course I want to believe the pro-wine nurse, LOL, but I will probably play it safe and abstain. I've got my overnight bag all packed.

I hope your tests come back favorable for avoiding chemo! Christine, so sorry to hear your Oncotype was so high! I hope your chemo goes as smoothly as possible. I had my first MO appointment yesterday and am currently waiting for my Mammaprint results to determine if I will need chemo. I should know by the end of next week. Even though I am Stage I, Grade 1, no node involvement, my Ki-67 is very high (60%) so the MO just wants to make sure my cancer isn't a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\", as he put it. Not to mention that my final pathology report after BMX showed multiple cancer sites. Best to do the test to see what we are truly dealing with before we write off chemo. He also wants to start me on Tamoxifen. So that is something else to look forward to, ha! Hope you all are doing well, healing quickly, and enjoying the holiday season! Cheers!",

I am not that young, but I am 40 (relatively young for BC), and I have had 8 core needle biopsies, with as many as 3 in one visit. I may be odd, but I don't find them to be so terrible. I mean, the first one was terrifying because I had never had one before, but after that one, I knew what to expect, and my doctor was very good about making sure I didn't feel any pain beyond the initial numbing injection. I definitely understand your concern for your daughter having to go through something so potentially traumatic at such a young age, but local anesthetic is much safer than general, and the procedure itself is just too quick to justify general anesthesia. Plus, it's nice not feeling loopy and doped up for an entire day. Yes the biopsies are kind of scary, but surgical mass excision (I've had that too) is far scarier and riskier, with a much lengthier recovery. I wouldn't advise pursuing that unless they actually find something concerning in the biopsy. Hopefully you have a good doctor who is well experienced with biopsy techniques and will make sure pain is minimal. Like I said, I felt no pain after the initial burn of the lidocaine injection. Just pressure. Plus, I always had a nurse holding my hand and talking with me to help distract me from what was going on, which helped immensely. Make sure that will be provided to your daughter as well. (((hugs))) to you and your daughter during this emotional time. I'm sure she will be just fine! :-)",

Ugh. borogirl, you had me cracking up with your playlist song choices! :D \"All of Me, Why Not Take All of Me\" feels sooooo appropriate! LOL! For those asking how they know what stage their cancer is before surgery... we don't really. The doctors have only given us their best guess based on what they've seen so far. The stage will be finalized after surgery. So, my surgeon told me mine was probably Stage I, but that could change based on what they find in surgery. BluGene, you are relatively young like me (I'm 40). Have you done any genetic counseling yet? I have an appointment on Nov 6. It will be interesting what comes from it. I don't really think there's a genetic component to my cancer, but who knows? I hope everyone is having a nice weekend!

I see my PS this afternoon for follow-up, but I doubt my drains will come out since I'm still getting 30-40ccs / day in each. Another week without a shower, yay. I saw my BS yesterday and she was pleased with everything. I've now been referred to an MO to discuss next steps in my treatment. That appointment is Dec 10. Really hoping I don't need chemo. FaceForward, welcome! So sorry about your toothache possibly interfering with your surgery! I would be stressed about that too. Hopefully you will get good news from the dentist so your surgery can go on as planned. Fingers crossed! Dyannah, great news on your pathology! Heather, so glad you found a clever solution to your sore drains! With regard to Tegaderm: be careful if you do end up buying some, as some people (myself included) are highly allergic to it. My docs and hospital love to use that stuff and I had to keep reminding them not to get it anywhere near me (even though my allergy is listed in my records). It's a bummer because it's great stuff and does such a nice job protecting your incisions. So if you get some, just check your skin for any reactions and remove it immediately if you do experience any reaction. Wigging, oh dear, I can't imagine getting my period the day after surgery! Mine just came yesterday, but I have recovered enough that I can fiddle with all my accouterments no problem. Not sure I could've done that very well the day after my BMX! Debkap, so sorry about your increased pain AND yeast infection. Talk about adding insult to injury! I hope you feel better soon! MCBaker, how great that you slept the whole night through!",

I am looking forward to going back too, but it doesn't make any sense for me to go back before the holidays since we start new projects in January, and all my existing projects have been taken over by my peers during my absence. So I guess I'll just have a very extended holiday season! I'm REALLY going to want to go back come January, though. Kerri, so glad you are having such a wonderful recovery! You seem to be recovering similarly to me. I was off the pain meds at 4 days post-op. Wigging, sounds like you are having a great recovery too! Wonderful! I had my 3 week follow-up appointment today (can't believe it's been 3 weeks already!) and everything is looking and feeling great. Now I can turn my focus to my upcoming oncologist appointment. That's next week, so I guess I'll just occupy my time with cheesy holiday movies, and playing piano with my cats (they like to \"help\", lol!).",

I had an excisional biopsy last year that was about an hour long, no overnight stay, and that's really the biggest surgery I've ever had before.

Fortunately, many people in my life have stepped up and insisted that I accept their help, so I didn't even have to ask. But if you need help (and you will), know that it doesn't make you weak to ask for it. It makes you SMART, because you'll be ensuring a good recovery. :-)",

I think your surgeon should be able to tell you what to expect in terms of recovery time and return to your normal lifestyle. I'm having mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and was told 6-8 weeks for recovery. I'm hoping it will be closer to 6, as I will go stir crazy being off work that long, but we'll see. :-)",

At first I thought I could get away with just ibuprofen for the pain... BIG mistake. Once I started taking the Percocet, even though I didn't like how it made me feel, I realized it was so much better for my healing to not be in pain. I could actually sleep! And that is so important for healing. We are all going through something that is extremely traumatic to our bodies; there is absolutely no shame in taking the pain meds. MCBaker, I was also recommended to get a lymphedema bracelet. I have Googled them and there are some very pretty styles out there that look very jewelry-like, if you want something other than the traditional medical bracelet.",

I'm doing pretty well with my recovery, but very sick of these darn drains, LOL! I'm up to walking 5 miles a day now which I think really helps. I'm a runner though, so I am longing for the day when my surgeon gives me the green light to start running again. She said I have to wait 4 more weeks for that. So, walking it is until then! borogirl, how awesome you got your drains out after only 9 days! I'm hoping I'll get mine out at my 2 week follow-up on Tuesday, but I only have 2 drains doing the work of 4 drains, so they are still collecting quite a bit (about 30ccs / day now). I'm super-envious of your shower. I can't WAIT to take a shower!!! Oya80, go easy on yourself. Your body has been through a lot! It's totally normal to feel wiped out from doing things you would normally consider routine. It is hard to resist holiday activities, though, I understand! :) MCBaker, I also got the bupivacaine injection during surgery, and it really helped for about 2 days... then I needed the Percocet. But I was definitely thankful for those 2 days! Debkap, so glad to hear your BMX went well and your nodes were clear! So sorry to hear you are struggling with pain. If it's unbearable, ask your doctor for a different pain med. You don't have to suffer! RosieRed, I feel you - I also want to sleep on my side. I'm soooo tired of sleeping the recliner, but it's the only way that is comfortable-ish and keeps me from rolling over. Ugh! I miss my bed! Kerri_Oz, I will keep my fingers crossed for you on Thursday! The good thing is that even if they do find cancer, it will probably not have spread. I had multiple cancer sites found in my BMX pathology, but my nodes were all clear, because it was all caught very early. Sounds like you have caught things early too, which is good!",

My preferred attire is a zip up hoodie that has inner pockets that my drain bulbs fit perfectly in. Heatherautumn, I hope your drain isn't too infected.

I have a post-op appointment tomorrow too, and am also hoping to get my drains out, but they're still getting about 30cc's/day, so I'm not sure I'm ready yet.

I was grateful for this because I don't really have anyone else to drive me to my doctor appointments. Now at least I can get to those on my own. I've just about reached the end of my rope with these darn drains. They have been stuck at 30 ccs/day for a week and a half, and I just want them GONE.

Part of me was hoping the mastectomy would be the worst thing I'd have to endure, but I have a feeling the MO will have more \"fun\" ahead for me. At the very least tamoxifen, which I dread. And chemo isn't off the table either, pending further testing. I guess there's no point in worrying about things I don't know to be certain yet, so I'll just try to keep it off my mind until Monday.

RosieRed, I don't know for sure yet if I will be facing radiation (and/or chemo) after my BMX, but it is a possibility for me. TBH, I haven't really thought that far ahead, but I have heard of radiation affecting implants. I don't know much beyond that though. I figure I'll cross that bridge if/when I get to it. If I find out any useful info, I'll be sure to post here! cbmom3, I hope this will be your last surgery! Debkap, I have IDC in my left breast, and am having both breasts removed. Given my history, it was a relatively easy decision for me, but everyone is different. In my case, I am young and have had 8 biopsies in the last year, with varying degrees of findings in both breasts from benign, to ADH, to IDC. I have \"busy breasts\", according to my doctors. They're always up to something. ;-) If I don't get rid of 'em both, chances are, I'll just have to keep getting multiple biopsies every year and more bad stuff will pop up. But if I were older, or if I didn't have a history of having lots of activity in my breasts, I would probably be more inclined to keep the \"clean\" breast. Only you can make the decision, and I don't think there's any wrong decision. jamiesue, I want to know the answers to these questions too! I wish my pre-op was sooner than the day before surgery so I could feel a bit more prepared. I think every surgeon is a little different in what they expect for post-op. Some people aren't allowed to shower at all until the drains are out, and others are. So it's all a mystery to me! ",

So far I have only been taking ibuprofen for the pain, but I know my surgeon injected a long acting local anesthetic during surgery that will wear off during the next couple of days. Hoping to not need any stronger pain meds though, since they make me queasy. I\u2019d rather have some pain than any amount of nausea (I\u2019m emetiphobic). Honestly the most painful areas are my drain insertion points. Yeowch! I\u2019m also a little sore under my armpits. Otherwise not bad. When I look down at my boobs they look just about the same as before, which is really cool. I also managed to escape this with only 2 drains (I was told I\u2019d probably have four).

I have also been spending most of my time in my recliner which has been great. I thought I was going to have 2 drains on each side, but I ended up with only 1 per side... so they have quite a bit of drainage still since they're doing double duty.

I'm now 5 days post-op and no longer need any pain meds. I took 1 ibuprofen yesterday afternoon after a walk on the treadmill that may have been a teeny bit too long (oops), and haven't needed anything since. I still get the occasional stabbing pain from one of my drains if I move a certain way, but it's so short-lived that I don't need meds for it. My range of motion is improving every day. I was encouraged to stretch my arms from day 1, and it is definitely helping. Interestingly, my range of motion is better on my cancer/nodes side, but I think that may be because it's the drain on the other side that causes me that stabbing pain. Overall, I'm really pleased with my progress. :-)",

Have you asked your doctor why he did this? coclico, everybody is different, but starting a new job only 19 days after a BMX does not sound like a good idea. My surgeons told me I would need to be off work at least 6 weeks following my BMX with DTI. You might want to see about delaying the start of your new job. After 19 days you may still be on painkillers, or still have surgical drains in, or still be unable to drive.",

So sorry you've been struggling with pain, but remember you're only a week out from your surgery and it's very normal to still be experiencing significant pain. Take the pain meds when you need them - there's no shame in that. Keeping your pain at bay will help you heal better, since it will allow you to rest and relax. It is wonderful that you are seeing good progress every day in getting your strength and range of motion back. I received my final pathology yesterday and my grade/stage did not change, however they found multiple other cancer sites and pre-cancer sites in both breasts, which made me very glad that I opted for the BMX. Good riddance, my little cancer factories! I am surprised that some of you did not receive final lymph node pathology during surgery. My nodes were sent to the lab at the start of surgery and immediately evaluated for cancer so I found out as soon as I woke up that my nodes were clear. I thought this was standard procedure so that they would know whether they need to take axillary nodes as well. I would go crazy having to wait a week or more to find out if my nodes were clear, so I really feel for y'all!",

I fully admit I did not read this entire thread, but skimmed the first few and last few pages (lots of good info, and this seems like such a supportive group). I figured I'd just jump in now and then get back to perusing the many pages. Clearly, I am not alone! I received my ADH diagnosis yesterday. A little background info: I am 39 years old, and went for my first mammogram ever a couple of weeks ago. I have some risk factors (BC on both sides of my family, but not following the traditional genetic pattern; early onset of menstruation), which is why my OBGYN ordered my first mammo a year earlier than usual. Per the radiologist, my breasts are \"very dense\" with \"a lot of stuff going on in there\", and they called me back for a follow up mammo on the right (suspicious microcalcifications) and US on the left side (possible mass). They didn't like what they saw in the follow up, so I went back a couple days later for 3 CNB's. They didn't get the location of the mass quite right for one of the biopsies, but I already was at my limit for lidocaine, so I have to go back next week for yet another biopsy. Me = Human Pincushion! YAY! So the results from the first three biopsies came back yesterday. The two from the left boob were benign (probably because they were taken in the wrong spot, duh!), but the right boob with the microcalcs has ADH. I had never heard of that until yesterday. Thanks to Google, I now know way more about it than I ever wanted to. So it's not technically pre-cancer, but it sort of is? Well, isn't that just a happy little grey area?! I've been referred to a breast surgeon, who I will meet with after the results from next week's biopsy are back (just so we have all the information). It sounds like she will probably want to do an MRI and/or excisional biopsy or who knows what. So I am in double-limbo land, waiting for one more biopsy PLUS now I have ADH. I am generally an optimistic person and I will take whatever life throws at me, but of course I am worried about all this. I never thought I'd be dealing with this sort of thing at my age (I am an otherwise very healthy person). What should I expect from my meeting with the breast surgeon? What questions should I ask? What can I expect in terms of monitoring of my boobs from here on out? Thanks for \"listening\"! -emily",
