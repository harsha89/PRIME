I mostly lost the lower portion but kept the top.  I did shave it close because I was losing so much, but I'd say I still have about 1/5 of my hair, all on the top.  I'm glad to hear about the woman that was getting tx with you whose hair grew back. That gives me hope.  Now what about brows and lashes?  I still have some, but they are thin.  Thanks for your info!",

I have a tendency to get bladder infections and had one following my first tx. My WBC has been so low that I've had to go on antibiotics so my energy level is zilch. Also, the Neulasta shot causes me to have awful back pain from day 4 to 9 or so. Luckily, my nausea has been fairly easy to manage. Emend is wonderful. I have that and dexamethasone that I take for the first 3 days and 2 other meds that I take for breakthrough nausea. Honestly, I take a pill at the slightest twinge of nausea because I don't want to go there. So, all in all it has been manageable, but it does take a while for me to feel back to normal regarding energy, pain level, appetite, etc. I hope everyone has a day free of SE's. I envy those of you in other areas as it is still in the triple digits here in Austin, TX. Once fall and winter get into full swing, I'll feel lucky to be here, but this heat is wearing on me!",

I feel like I have a hangover that won't go away.  It was so bad this time, that I asked the NP at the Oncology center if they mistakenly gave me a bigger dose with the last tx. They reduced it the second time because I had so many SEs and I felt certain that they must have gone back to the original dose.  She assured me, however, that they gave me the same amount as they did for the 2nd tx.  Maybe it's just cumulative.  Who knows?  Capinva - Emend is awesome.  I've had a 3 day pack with each tx and I've never thrown up.  I'm so glad that my onc. prescribed it.  Stroz - I chew papaya enzyme tablets for heartburn.  I have used them for years and I wasn't interested in adding another medication to my long list.  I chew a few and if that doesn't help I chew a few more.  I've never had a time where the heartburn did not go away.   I find them in the \"Healthy Living\" type department at my local grocery store.   Vivie - I'm intrigued by your posts and I see that we both have lived our lives before cancer with a disability.  I'm a paraplegic, so when I get stares the viewers have to decide if they want to stare at my wheelchair or my bald head.  I prefer to just go bald or put on a hat if it's comfortable. I don't know why that's hard for others to accept. Since I don't live near my mom, we haven't clashed over any issues.  I do, however, see my MIL frequently.  She has been very helpful, but is definitely getting on my nerves.  Apparently, she thinks I've lost some of my mental faculties. She comes around at least 3 x a week to drive me places.  She does the grocery shopping and has moved LOTS of things around in my house.  Recently, we went for coffee.  The barrista gave me my usual iced latte with the espresso poured on top of the milk and ice and my MIL said, \"You'll need to stir that.\" Oh really?  How did I make it through 40+ years without her around to tell me such things?  I'll probably go to hell for saying such things and I should be grateful for her help but sometimes I just need to feel independent and convincing others is difficult to say the least.  I just counted and my last chemo won't be until January 6, 2012.  I have one more AC on the 29th.  Then I have 12 weekly Taxol treatments.  Once my chemo is done I still have 6 weeks of radiation (every week day) to look forward to.  Ugh.   I'm planning to have my hair stylist shave the remaining sprigs of hair that I have.  I would prefer my head to be cleanly bald.  Even though I buzzed it close when I started losing it, some of this hair isn't going anywhere.  It's not growing, nor is it falling out.  My eyebrows have thinned quite a bit and this is bothering me almost as much as the hair loss did.  As if I don't look sick enough with a bald head, now I'll have no eyebrows to enhance my alien-like appearance.  Anyone else losing their brows?  Lashes?   Thanks for the opportunity to vent.  Hope you all have a nice SE free weekend.   edye ",

It's a more natural approach to the problem and since we have to take so many drugs right now, I'll take a natural alternative when I can. They provide almost immediate relief and I take them any time of the day, whenever symptoms start. You just chew a couple or let them dissolve in your mouth. If that doesn't work, I take one or 2 more and I've always gotten relief after that. They're available at Whole Foods and lots of grocery stores carry them in the healthy living section.

I'm afraid the smoke will bother me as I can't tolerate strong smells. About the rads, I also had a grade 3 tumor and I will be having them once chemo is done in January.

It is on a shelf in my closet. He barks and growls at it when he sees it so I close the door. But if the door is ajar, he can't resist prying it open to take a peek and bark and growl all over again. He doesn't bark at all if it's on my head.   JMULL- Tx #3 was tough on me, too.  I hope you feel better soon.  I just had tx #4 yesterday so I'm crossing my fingers that the SE's don't last as long.   dianamaps- I had AC #4 yesterday.  My nurses all congratulated me and again assured me that Taxol will be easier. When I went back for my Neulasta today, they congratulated me again as I won't have to have them with Taxol unless I have problems with my WBC's.  Now I have 12 weekly Taxol tx to do.  How many do you have?   I hope everyone has a great weekend free of SE's.   edye ",

Unfortunately, I don't get to ring it until January 13, I think I'm the last to finish on here and I actually started onJuly 29th! At least the nurse told me today that my hair was definitely starting to grow back. The crispy hair that remained must have fallen out because now I only have white fuzz all over my head. My brows seem to be starting to grow back but my lashes are still MIA. I've heard that lashes and brows may come and go a few times before they stay put. I figure that once the under arm hair comes in then that will show that the hair is definitely coming back. I hope everyone feels well and enjoys this weekend. Edye",

I'm day 3 post  3rd AC and I'm feeling okay, actually better than usual at this point.  I hate to speak too soon because I know that this can change at anytime and I can be achy and down in the dumps at any moment.  Just some aches from the Neulasta shot is all I can really complain about at this point.   Theatrecat - I would definitely make sure that your ONC gives you different meds for nausea. Mine has prescribed Emend ( a 3 pack that I take one hour before treatment, and the other 2 on the 2 following days), Dexamethasone ( for days 2, 3 and 4), Granisetron (daily as needed) and Phenergen (as needed, I carry this in my purse for any breakthrough nause I might incur).  I admit that I take something at the slightest twinge of nausea, but I have not thrown up once since I started chemo.  I think Emend is a godsend.  Koalakid - I hear you about the prosthetics.  I live in Austin, Texas where it has been way too hot to consider wearing one.  I haven't even pursued ordering one yet.  I have a little cheap form that I found, I call it the \"equalizer\", that I put in my camisole when I feel like it's important to look somewhat even.  Otherwise, I go without it.  Same with the headcoverings.  I've only worn a wig twice and just found a hat that I can tolerate. Definitely looking forward to the cooler weather. Robyn - We're in the same boat it seems regarding our DHs.  Mine is transitioning between jobs (he was recruited around the time I was diagnosed) and works every day until he drops at night. He does still manage to go to all of my appointments and makes sure I'm taken care of, but I do miss our normal interactions.  His mother has been around to pick up any slack.  I don't feel as though I can bother him with all of my whinings, etc. while he is so busy trying to make sure that he meets deadlines and keeps track of our finances.  Luckily, I have a friend who is 4 years post BC treatment and is also a counselor.  She tells me that this is a fairly common situation with couples in any sort of \"crisis\" situation.  While one is in crisis, the other one holds things together.  She told me that once she was deemed \"cancer free\", her DH finally broke down and let his emotions show.  I hope that you will soon regain the interaction with your husband that you are missing.  I have one more tx of AC on 9/29 and I can't wait to get that behind me.  Three weeks later I'll start 12 weekly TX of Taxol.  I spoke with my ONC about the shortage of Taxol and he did not think that it would effect my treatment. I'm happy to hear that as the infusion nurses keep referring to it as \"chemo lite\".  The NP also told me that I will find it much easier than the AC.   There are many other posts that I read that I could respond to, but I forget as I keep reading. I'll start taking notes as I read.   I hope you all are having a nice weekend free of SEs! BTW, is there anyone else from Texas here? edye ",

I have a backache and I'm tired but my appetite is better. It took nearly 3 weeks after my last AC to recover. I didn't leave the house for 2 weeks because I felt terrible. I could hardly eat or drink anything and I cried EVERY day. Most of my brows and lashes are gone and I just plain look sick. On top of that, I developed blisters on my legs and feet which quickly became wounds. I'm a paraplegic so it is difficult enough to heal without the low blood counts. Needless to say I've been pretty down. Since changing to Taxol I do feel better and even made it out to a fundraiser for the pug rescue group that I work with this weekend. Nothing like 100+ pugs dressed in silly costumes to cheer a girl up! I'm hoping that I can keep a more positive attitude and finish up this crappy chemo and move on to rads.

I had my 2nd AC on 8/18 and I've felt like myself today for the first time since. Taste is back to normal and and my energy level is better. I, too have had a difficult time with the hair loss. Once it started falling out, it went quickly. My hair stylist buzzed it really short on day 16 after 1st treatment and I kind of liked the way it looked. Then it continued to fall out and I began to see the alien in the mirror. It actually stopped falling out as much, but looked terrible so I started wearing hats. I'm hoping that since tomorrow is the 14th day post the second treatment that the remaining spigots will fall out. My scalp has been extra sensitive for the past couple of days, more than it was after the first treatment. I don't have children, but my 6 y.o. nephew did have a strong reaction when he saw me without my hair. He asked me to wear a hat so that he wouldn't be scared. By the end of his visit, however, he told my sister that he wanted to shave his head \"because it's too hot to have hair\". This made me smile. Since I have dogs, I've enjoyed reading descriptions of the reactions of some of your dogs. My older dog is blind so she has no idea that anything is different as far as I know. I'm involved in a pug/pug mix rescue and I have 3 pugs. They don't seem to notice my bald head, but they bark like crazy at my wig. I keep it on a shelf in my closet and they cautiously peek through the doorway and immediately start growling when they see it. Once it's on my head they don't seem to care, but seeing it on the styrofoam head really gets them going. I'm very thankful to have this group even if I don't post much. It's great to hear different perspectives and ways to cope with SE's. Thank you all!",

I know it has caused problems for me but at this point I don't want to take another medication. I try to take advantage of the bit of energy that it gives me the first day or so, but the inability to sleep is frustrating. It usually lasts 3 or 4 nights and then it's almost time for the next tx. I've used melatonin and chamomile tea with some success. I hope it gets easier for you soon.",

I have AC #4 on Thursday and I'm sooooo not looking forward to it.  #3 was terrible.  I felt like I had the flu for the first 10 days and it took about 15 days to get my taste buds back, even now it's not 100 percent.  I hate that just as I feel better, it's time for another treatment.  The good thing is that this time I'll have my last Neulasta shot. The bone pain from those is awful!  I'll start Taxol in 3 weeks and I'm hoping it is easier.  I don't like what I'm hearing about the nails though!   Although time seems to creep by, we're all getting through this! ",

I started tx in late July, but most of you will finish before I do.  I have my 3rd AC next week, and 1 more 3 weeks later.  Then I have 12  weekly tx of Taxol!  I am stage IIIc, though so that is probably why.  I also have 6 weeks of daily radiation following that.   Justina - I believe we have the same treatment regimen as far as chemo goes.  I'm going to ask my Onc about the shortage of Taxol that I've been hearing about.  Have you asked your doc about that?  I'm wondering what the solution is if there is none available.  ",
