My brain just shifts into overdrive at night, and I end up wide awake for hours. I try to put on such a positive face during the day (I have a 9 yr and 15 yr old) that I think my worries just bubble to the surface when it's quiet. So in order to help with that, I've started writing a blog. I don't know if any of you would be interested in reading it, but just in case: chickyunfiltered.home.blog. Good luck and hugs to all going through their treatments, dealing with SE, or starting next week like me! ",

No hypersensitivity (I have food and drug allergies/sensitivities) or other problems. I made a mistake and forgot to spread the lidocaine cream on my port prior to arriving for my lab work so that hurt. My port is still very bruised and tender. Now I'm just tired (Benadryl during infusion + no sleep last night because of pre-med steroids), and my tummy is trying to decide if it's unhappy and how it would like to express that unhappiness. Still, a positive beginning!",

I'm doing chemo prior to surgery so my surgeon and oncologist decided to do imaging yesterday to see how the tumor is responding. The radiologist could no longer find it! So in a way, it makes all of this worthwhile. I'm starting to have issues with slight neuropathy in my fingers, and I'm going to bring this up to my oncologist when I see her on Tuesday. Best wishes for everyone!",

The echo happened last Tuesday and showed a borderline low ejection fraction which is worrisome since Herceptin is known for its effects on the heart (specifically lowering the ejection fraction). So now I have to meet with a cardiologist later this week to see if she will clear me to start treatment, or if my oncologist needs to come up with a different treatment plan. The uncertainty is driving me crazy and ramping up my tendency for anxiety! I just want to start doing something - either killing the cancer cells with chemo or surgery to take it out... In the meantime, I'm cooking like crazy to stock the freezer with meals for my family and for me. I enjoy cooking and it keeps my mind from racing! At this rate, I may need to buy an extra freezer!",

My side effects from the first infusion were primarily terrible stomach cramps and body aches the night of the infusion and the following day. By Thursday, only my fingers and hands ached. My stomach is touchier than usual, but no big issues. I was able to hang out with family and friends Friday- Monday. It will be interesting to see which side effects I get this time! I guess my hair should start thinning or falling out soon. I have crazy, thick, curly, shoulder length hair. I'm thinking of getting a pixie cut this week to ease into baldness, but I look like a poodle with short hairðŸ˜€ All the best to everyone wherever you are on your journey! Chickywicky (aka kaari)",

Originally, my surgeon had planned to do surgery first, but once testing came back indicating ER-/PR-/HER2+, everything changed. I met with my medical oncologist today, and will now start with neoadjuvant therapy with Taxol weekly and Herceptin every 3 weeks. My first treatment will either be March 19 or 26 depending on when I can schedule port placement and echocardiogram. I've had numerous surgeries in the last year (2 melanoma excisions, a lumpectomy for a weird, but benign cyst, and a hysterectomy) so I felt comfortable with the surgery route. Chemo first has thrown me for a loop!",

Never thought I'd be excited about that, but I'm just anxious to start getting better! I also had my port placed on Monday - was much more painful than I expected, but I figure that the discomfort from the port is probably less than the cumulative discomfort of weekly IVs for the next 12-15 months!
