Age :41, unmarried, pre- menopausal Recently diagnosed with Invasive breast cancer (lump on the right chest wall-upper inner quadrant) lymph node and axillary node positive. Prognosis : ER+, PR+, her2 -. Size of the tumor is 2.7cm..and they say its a LABC (locally advanced breast cancer) . Done with the first chemo on 24th feb with CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil)..and further chemos will be done on 3 weekly basis. The reassessment will be done after 3rd or 4th chemo whether to continue the chemo till 6 cycles or surgery and then chemo, radiation and hormonal therapy. Here I see vast information about the disease and it's management and the drugs u have got. I am really worried about the chemo drugs and the way it is administered. My drug is CEF and it was directly given with the injections in the hand vein after putting the cannula. And all the medicine was given with injections in just 15 minutes. It would be really really helpful for me to know. -Is the regime CEF is good as compared to AC/T in relation to reoccurring and survival. -Is the way of giving chemo in 15 minutes is safe and can be tolerated well. Please reply soon..as my next chemo is due for next week. Thanks all.. Log in to post a reply",
