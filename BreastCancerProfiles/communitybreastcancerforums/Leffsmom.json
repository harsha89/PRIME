I was scared about doing radiation treatments. I have 4 small tattoo marks. Radiation treatments are a bother to your daily schedule and working adds to the difficultly. My Radiation team is great. They work to limit your time with them. It takes longer to change clothes. You will get drawn on to show your radiation treatment area (washes off) so that you will know where to add your lotion.Treatments become a routine and will become less scary. My skin has slowly turned to red and began to itch. I use an over the counter 1% hydrocortisone cream for the itching. My RO recommened using Udderly Smooth body cream from day one. They gave me samples. I also use it in the morning and before bed. I began using Aquaphor lotion along with the Udderly Smooth cream after my second week of treatments in the morning and evening. To limit my skin reaction I use the Udderly Smooth body cream after my treatments before I get dressed. It also made my breast feel better under my clothing. I had stabbing pains after the lumpectomy and they continued with radiation. My pain with the radiation treatments is manageable. Ibuprofen helps. I am a belly sleeper so it is tough to sleep some nights. You will get tired. I take naps sometimes to help. I also took half days at work when needed. Clothing is the worst. I wear a cami bra without lace and limited seams with loose tops. This is difficult with work but a necessity for me. Good luck. Power through.",
