A new study found that certain women getting a lumpectomy may not need an operation to remove underarm lymph nodes, a procedure that can leave them with painfully swollen arms. Compared with not removing the nodes, the surgery did not prolong survival or prevent recurrence of the cancer.",

The conclusion of this study might not be palatable to all clinicians, admitted the lead investigator. The fact that axillary dissection is not needed in women who have positive sentinel nodes is \"counterintuitive and hard to accept,\" because it means not removing all the cancer, said Armando E. Giuliano, MD, director of the John Wayne Cancer Institute Breast Center in Santa Monica, California. However, when Dr. Giuliano presented his findings, he received warm applause and no combative questions from the audience. It's hard to abandon it. \"Since we have always done axillary dissection, it's hard to abandon it,\" Dr. Giuliano noted at a meeting press conference. No Difference in 8-Year Survival Dr. Giuliano led the trial of 856 women with clinical T1-2 N0 M0 disease and 1 or 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes. In the study, which was sponsored by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG), the women all received a sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and were found to have at least 1 positive node. They were then were randomized to either no further treatment (n = 436) or ALND (n = 420). The investigators found that, at 8 years, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients treated with SLND alone (92.5%) and those treated with completion ALND (91.8%; P = .25). There was also no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients treated with SLND (83.9%) and those treated with ALND (82.2%; P = .14). Only older age, estrogen-receptor-negative disease, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy - not type of surgery - were statistically significantly associated with worse overall survival on multivariable analysis, said Dr. Giuliano. However, William Wood, MD, from Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, who acted as the discussant of the study, suggested that the trial does not apply to all women with early breast cancer and positive sentinel nodes. \"I call your attention to the caveats in this trial,\" he said. Dr. Wood noted that the study excluded any patient who had 3 or more positive sentinel nodes, matted nodes, metastases in a sentinel node detected by immunohistochemistry, or third field nodal irradiation.",

They have known for years that removing nodes in breast cancer patients --even if they are cancerous--does not extend survival. So removing nodes has no therapeutic value and obsolete staging value.

Just like the \"guidelines\" recommended chemo for ER+ women until ten years ago when they found it didn't really work and many women suffered for nothing. Now the \"guidelines\" recommend various hormone blocking strategies which will no doubt be replaced by a different strategy in another ten years. And regardless of what the Uber researcher Fisher found many years ago about removing the nodes providing no survival benefit, no doubt, needless crippling surgeries will continue, regardless of recent or previous studies showing lymph node dissection to be without survival benefit.",

Although the lymph node dissection group experienced fewer recurrences in the treated lymph node basin, this improvement in local control did not translate to a benefit in overall survival. In fact, when these patients did have recurrences, these were more likely to be distant disease. Since Fisher's landmark study, five RCTs evaluating ELND in breast cancer patients have failed to reveal a statistically significant survival advantage for patients treated with ELND.[16] The lack of evidence supporting the value of ELND for breast cancer patients in these five trials raised significant questions regarding the dogmatic but unproven traditional approach to surgical management in patients with cancer.",

Read the consent form before you are flat on your back in pre-op, vulnerable in your hospital gown. There will be a paragraph that reads, you consent to have the surgeon and his/her designates do anything they deem necessary. You can cross this part out and write in that they can do anything necessary ONLY to SAVE YOUR LIFE. Taking extra nodes is not a life-saving procedure so if they do that you can sue them because they will have violated your expressed directions. There are a couple of well known breast cancer advocates who had a cordial relationship with their surgeons UNTIL the surgeons decided they would remove a boatload of nodes while they were out cold. These women are crippled for life. I apologize if the previous posts seem off-topic. I would argue that they are on topic. They will certainly seem on-topic a month or year from now if your arm swells up, a nerve is cut and you are unable to lift your child or carry groceries be cause of out-dated \"guidelines.\" Best of luck to you, Karen.

I'm just presenting years of evidence. Statistically, node removal has never shown any value in delaying disease progression or survival. The evidence shows you would have done just as well without node removal.  If you read the article, you will see that the premise of how the nodes function must be questioned if removing them provides no survival advantage. Clearly, evidence of cancer in the nodes, which are an entirely different functioning organ, is different than cancer tumors in the breast. If it seems counterintuitive to leave cancer cells trapped in the nodes, then the premise that nodal cancer leads to spread is wrong. As the evidence clearly shows. Best continued good health.",
