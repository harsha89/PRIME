      "Content": "jep wrote: I have to say I have been reading this discussion board for the past 3 days none stop and I am amazed at the guidance, support, and comfort found on these pages. The reason I am seeking support is that  I had an abnormal mammo last week-- then this week had a repeat mammo with ultrasound.  Ultrasound report was that I have a 1.0cm mass with irregular border-BIRAD 4.  I am scheduled for an ultrasound with biopsy next week and will get the results the next day.  I had an abnormal mammo 4 years ago with followup MRI and stereotactic bx which was neg.  I see a surgeon every year for manual exam, alternating with my primary doc every year for manual exam.  I have had mammos every year since I was 26 because my mother had breast cancer 36 years ago.  (she is 83 now and doing great)  My doctor also started ordering MRI's two years ago because of my high risk status.  My last MRI was 7 months ago.  After that MRI, I received a letter in the mail that stated the MRI was normal.  I never thought to ask the results/findings. (STUPID)  Last week I asked the breast nurse to read me the results of the MRI from 7 months ago.  It said 7mm cyst noted in left breast.  I wonder if they/I  dropped the ball!!??!!  Anyways, not much I can do about that now. (I plan on talking to the surgeon about that on Monday am)  I was doing okay with this until yesterday, and now I can't stop crying!  AAGH!  I have really learned alot from reading about others experiences and hope that will help me get through this waiting hell!  I have only told one person about this.  Husband is out of town/country till next week.  (don't want to share it with him till he gets home)  I am so glad I found this site and plan on continuing to read the great advice and suppport offered.  Thank you all from the bottom of my heart!   Here I go again..... can't stop crying!

I know that I shouldn't be going this crazy now, but I just feel with my high risk status this might not turn out so good.  I also am worrying that my MRI from 7 months ago was misread. I am going to try to take yours and others advice and try to stop thinking the worst-since I know that there is nothing I can do until I see bx results.  It is easier said than done. I keep thinking of my kids, our plans-graduations, vacations, etc.  Lord, it just doesnt' end!  Thanks so much for your caring thoughts.  I am trying my hardest to stay steady and be positive.",

(now I wonder if that was the right advice-I've been doing what I am supposed to be doing except I don't think I have advocated for myself like I should've have been-)  After the first biopsy (4 years ago) I met with an oncologist to discuss risk factors. (which I pretty much was already aware of)  Yesterday my surgeon called me to discuss the abnormality they found last week via US and mammo and verified that what they found on US was a 1 cm solid mass- gray and white with some depth and some irregular edges.  I've never been able to palpate the darn thing either.  Today I go for my biopsy-tomorrow I get the results. I do not think this looks good.  I'm trying to act like nothing is amiss since my daughter is graduating in a week from HS and this type of info right now would crush her.  Husband comes home tomorrow from being out of town for several weeks for business and I will break it to him then.  Well.... gotta go get ready for  my test....upset stomach, dry mouth, headache, tears and all......... ",

I'm glad you are through with the test and hope you have a relaxing and enjoyable weekend.  I'll be watching for your update. Take care!    ",

I can't stop thinking that the radiologist misread my MRI 7 months ago --even 4 years ago and I should have been receiving treatment.  I know this sounds crazy, but it's how I'm thinking right now.   I have been following Catwood on another thread and feel her pain and panic.   Sounds like you (like others)  have been through alot. When my mom was dx many years ago, she insisted on having a double mastectomy. I'm glad your mastectomy and reconstruction went well.  (can't believe in the same procedure- holy cow!)  I'm encouraged and feel uplifted by yours and others response.  Thanks for sharing.",

I have never had them drawn either but am thinking I should be doing that.  The DOC's should be initiating this discussion.  You know... we have to always advocate 100% for ourselves.  I feel like in the past I have dropped the ball on not getting information about myself. You see.. I, too, am a nurse and I should really know better. I think I was in a state  of denial.  After reading this forum for the past week or so though, I feel empowered to get the info I need to take of me.    I have, in the past week, requested all the reports of the tests I have had done so I do now have them in hard copy.(instead of on a million little pieces of scratch paper)  My problem is that I always wonder if the correct evaluation has been made.  MRI's and other diagnostics are very accurate----but they are only as accurate as the person evaluating.  Right??  My husband got mad at me today and asked me why I think I always know better then the docs!  I don't.... I just want to make sure that everyone is doing their job.    Anyways.......... Eileen.....please know that I am and will be thinking of you and praying for you in the next several weeks.  I hope your night is calm and steady.  Please hang in there......   Here's to self advocacy!",

(It will actually be 4 months b/c I am going to be gone for part of August for vacation.)  OK- about the radiation-- well I do think about that. I don't really have an answer.... In the last two weeks I've had three mammos alone.  I have actually had mammos done every year since  I was about 28 or 29. (I'm 50 now-don't feel like 50.  In my head I still feel like I'm in my 30's! In fact when I was in the hospital looking at one of my medical documents it almost was surreal that it reported me as 50!  I thought, \"that can't be!--who is this woman!\")  Oh well..... time marches on.  I have talked about Genetic testing with an oncologist several years ago after I had my first bx, and I think he recommended that he didn't think I needed to have it done.  I was in a state of denial back then (stupid).....  This day is different.   I am actually going to call and make another appt with him to discuss some more things that are on my mind.  Remember------ As everyone else has reassured me,  80% of  these findings are B9.  You've got everything in your favor.  Stay positive. Since I just went through it, I know this waiting is about to drive a person to go crazy.  Keep telling yourself that things will turn out well.... Try to replace the negative, scary thoughts with positive ones.  Imagine yourself actually getting the good news and how you will feel as if you were actually experiencing that situation.  These are approaches that I have used.  And actually, once I had the bx completed and was able to talk to the radiologist (who is awesome) and the RN navigator I was much calmer.  Of course, that anxiety still reared it's ugly head here and there and then the crying started...... BUT......... maybe if you try some of the suggestions above (for the most part they worked for me)  it will help.   I will be thinking of you today and am sending you B9 wishes and prayers.  Stay positive and try to have a good weekend with your beautiful young children. (I have two kids---a boy, sophomore in college and girl graduating from HS in about 8 days who will be going to the same college as my son. These children of ours grow up sooooo fast!) Please let us know how it went today...... I'll be watching for your post.   I'll be thinking of you............ Stay strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     ",

(although I feel bad that you had a bad scare.  That sucks!)  I had my US guided biopsy today and it wasn't bad at all.(similar to my bx 4 years ago) My radiologist is great.  I saw the mass and it is black and has a long like string.  Weird!  It took the radiologist a while to get a good picture because this black mass kept moving It was really weird.  It took him awhile but he inevitably got it for the sample.  Now I have the compression ace on and applied ice to the bx site.  I will find out tomorrow afternoon what the results are.  Today I requested a copy of my MRI that was completed in Oct. (7 months ago)  The radiologist that read it in Oct. gave it a BIRAD 2 but noted a new 7 mm cyst in the same spot as this black mass. Hmmmmmmm.... Now I 'm wondering why the surgeon wasnt' more aggressive and investigating this \"new\" finding in Oct. The radiologist that I had today said that he looked at the MRI from oct and did not see the mass I have today.  IDK.....  Anyways.....I don't seem to be so \"NUTS\" today now that the bx is done and I've talked to the breast navigator, radiologist, and techs.  Well, thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  Until tomorrow.............................",
