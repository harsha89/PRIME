It almost looked like the aerola itself had spread upward. It's probably swollen in a circle about 3/4 of an inch. Also, it seemed like my left nipple was a little bit darker than the right one. I felt around the area, and thought I could feel a bump, but when I checked a second time, I felt nothing. I am scared to death, because I have been googling the symptoms and the first hit I always get is inflammatory breast cancer. I am only 21 years old, I know that it is still possible, but I really hope that is not it!Â  I've always been kind of a worrier though, so I am absolutely freaking out about this. I have a an appointment with my University Health Center tomorrow, but I am afraid I am going to be skeptical of any answers they give me as University Health Centers have bad reputations. I don't know who else to go to. I don't have any health insurance or a primary doctor. Should I go to the emergency room? I want to stay on top of this, as I realize early detection is absolutely vital. But without health insurance, this is going to be hard! Log in to post a reply",
