      "Content": "rooster7 wrote: Hi, I'm 26 years old and just started going back to school for a second degree. I moved states, and signed up for healthcare through healthcare.gov a few days ago. Unfortunately, since I signed up after the 15th of January, my coverage doesn't start until March 1. I had Maryland Medicaid before I moved to my new state, but obviously cannot use that outside of Maryland. I noticed a lump in my left breast two days ago. It is in the upper, outer quadrant towards my armpit. It is rather sizable and firm, and I can only make out two sides of it. I am unsure how long it has been there. It currently has a dull pain, but I'm pretty sure that's because I've been feeling it non-stop since I found it. I know I need to get this checked out but am unsure what steps to take next and I definitely don't want to wait until March 1 since I'm already losing my mind after 2 days. I am willing to pay out of pocket for a breast exam / ultrasound / mammogram or whatever is necessary. But, I don't have a doctor here. Doesn't it often take a while to get an appointment at an OBGYN? Do they usually let you pay cash? I'm very unfamiliar with the doctors and I don't really know how it works. Should I call around and tell them I have a lump and hope that they can get me in quickly even though I would be a new patient? Any advice would be appreciated... Log in to post a reply",

I am still going to call Monday and see if they make exceptions. I will also look into planned parenthood. thank you",
