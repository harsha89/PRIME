I understand that the first step will be to meet with the oncologist to discuss the cancer and suggested treatment. I was told that I should see someone within a weeks time What happens after that and how much time usually passes before chemo starts?  Are there any tests? My hubby and I were planning a small getaway week after next just to get a break from the stress before the next stage starts but I don't want to delay anything!

Last June I felt a lump in my left breast - the only one I had as I was only born with 1 - had a mammo and ultrasound and was told it was nothing and no biopsy was needed. 3 months later the exercise was repeated. On jan27 this year I felt a large lump under my arm. A few weeks ago I was told that there were cancer cells in my lymph nodes and this past Monday u had a mastectomy and all lymph nodes removed. My question is - when u record the tumour size is this in reference to the tumour in the breast or nodes?  I have no diagnosis yet but expect to get that at my follow up appt on April 2. I've convinced myself that I'm a stage 3 but have nothing to base it in other than what I read on cancer sites. I am one of those women that had no symptoms. I wasn't losing weight. Didn't lose my appetite. Still active. So I am hoping that this is somewhat positive. To this day I still feel like me other than recovering from surgery. I do know that the mass under my arm felt fairly large but the lump in my boob felt no bigger than 2cm. The surgeon said that I could have had a partial mastectomy but I chose to relive the whole thing. I look forward to hearing from u!!  :-)",

As I read through the thread it seems that this topic may have started something that it was not intended to do. I too have heard so much about healthy rating however also have a friend who us an 8 year cancer survivor yeh continues to smoke and drink socially. I certainly do not judge her although I do with that she would stop smoking. As for me I do enjoy drinking socially with my friends but do not do this every weekend. Here I am at 50 and a musician that plays in bars with my band. Alcohol is everywhere and I do enjoy a good drink every now and then bad can also polish off a bottle of wine if it's moscato!!  Having said that will I change this now that I gave been diagnosed?  Well I had a burger and fries last night however will be eating pasta and veggies tonight. I haven't gad any alcohol since bring told that I have cancer cells and plan yo have a party with my friends prior to starting treatment. However I agree that moderation is key. I recognize that I can eat healthier - I just purchased walnuts cranberries (albeit sweetened) and green tea today while grocery shopping which is a first!!  I also intend to get more active. But will this help me beat cancer and prevent it from returning?  Who knows. My hubby and I are also increasing eating poultry and oily fish but will still eat red mean a few times a week. I realise that there is no bight answer. My objective was to hear from women in similar situations to understand the impact that this has had on your life. Please keep sharing. Thanks!!",

The surgeon wouldn't share anything else ie stage or grade of tumour. We will probably get that from the oncologist. I'm healing well but he drew a lot of fluid out. About 2oz. Yuch!!

Not bad for someone that doesn't cook!!  Lol. So many perspectives on this topic!!  It's do interesting!!  I don't think I was ever a terrible eater but in retrospect did rely a lot on processed foods like frozen dinners. For the past 15+ years I've worked 10+ hour days and then barely had time to do stuff for myself when I got home. Not complaining. Just reflecting!  So now I plan on using my time off to try and cook more. Again those that know me would laugh and say ang is cooking????  What did she just say?  But I'll still visit fast food once a week and will drink socially every now and then. What I truly want to get back into is the gym ASAP. I hope that I can continue this throughout treatment!!",

My treatment is FEC-D followed by herceptin for approx 1 year then tamoxifen for 5-10 years I've been thought the chemo class to educate me and had a tour of the chemo suite at the hospital so I know where I'll go for treatment My MO told me that I am very healthy and he expects that ill be fine and he is of the opinion that all of the cancer was found. Up until now I've had no major health issues and rarely took a pill for anything.  I exercise 2-4 times per week at the gym and am fairly active. I am aware of the many side effects and understand that everyone is impacted differently.  What truly scares me are severe long term effects to the heart. I know that the medical team will watch me very closely but I want to be able to continue to be active and do things like travel My DH and I are actually on vacation this week to celebrate each other prior to the start if my treatment yet I can't stop thinking if what is to come I would appreciate anyone sharing how they find life after chemo treatment as your successes will be my inspiration!  Thanks!!!!!!

I had surgery on  March 17 bit must admit that I am somewhat confused as to why some women seem to know more about their cancer before surgery than I do now My follow up appt is on April 2 so am hoping for the best but can't help but expect the worst What bothers me most is that prior to surgery I was told that all lymph nodes would be removed. I was then told that 10-15 nodes would be removed After surgery my husband was told that he looked for certain points and that he couldn't or wouldn't say how many he took.  I understand that I won't know my stage or additional details until my follow up appt but just wonder how this has worked for other women My challenge is that I'm always thinking 10 steps ahead which can be a strength and weakness so I'm always trying to read more than what was said. In think it's also know as second guessing I look forward to hearing from others Many thanks!! Every negative has a positive!!

We are planning to go on a short getaway to Ottawa tomorrow night until Monday so what better place to lose hair then at our nations capital and in a hotel? Lol My MO confirmed that I can swim so swim I shall!  Can't wait. Some people are surprised that I have permission to swim given the risk of infection but I was told that I'm good to go :-) I know that it's hard to forget about the cancer crap and treatment. Yesterday I started reading stats again and told my DH that we have to be prepared for me being gone in a couple of years. He looked at me like I was crazy Then I told myself to shut up. Stop reading. AGAIN!!  With or without cancer we never know what tomorrow will bring. So I have told myself to move on. Live life. If I have a SE deal with it. Focus on me and playing guitar meeting new people and my new life As I am fortunate enough to not have to work right now I do have a new life. I tell myself   that I am in retirement rehearsal. Yesterday when I went for my walk I saw a cardinal and a chipmunk. I would never have noticed this before. I have time for friends and to do stuff that I want to do because I am no longer working 14 hour days.  We all go through ups and downs - the roller coaster ride of life whether it's because of cancer or something else. For me it's all of you that make the downs easier to deal with and the ups all that much more fun and enjoyable So let's keep going up!! Have a great day all !!!!",

I find that my 2 nd round was easier than the first. My period lasted one whole day!!  Lol Now I'm  all freaked out about diet again!  As a triple positive I have heard it all. No dairy. No sweets because of sugar. No meat. Eat like a rabbit.  Well I had cream of wheat this morning with brown sugar and bran buds. Strike 1 - added sugar. I had a dark green salad with salmon for lunch. Ding - that's good. I can't live like this! Hubby and I are going away to Niagara Falls tomorrow night returning Monday. I plan to eat like I always do and did. Pizza?  Probably when watching the hockey game. Oh oh!  Cheese!  Steak?  Yes, we have to go for a nice steak while away. Burger and fries?  Probably!  Even so we both don't eat burgers and fries 7 days a week!  But we did have smoked meat, fries and chopped liver on Saturday with my 91 year old mother So, am I killing myself?  Some claim to know so much, others say we know nothing. I plan on eating from the four food groups which does include junk every now and then Argh!!!! Had a band practice last night !  It felt great to play guitar and sing again!  I also will be volunteering for the Canadian cancer society as an outreach volunteer and am so happy about that!   Cold love the pink wig!  I want one!!  Lol Ddkath your hubby is a king!  What a wonderful thing to do!!!!

It hasn't changed. I had mentioned it to my family dr last year and she wasn't concerned. I also mentioned it to my onc during my last visit and he wasn't concerned either This morning I researched dr google and found subungal melanoma. Some of the images that I found look nothing like my nail but done do. It seems strange to me that this line and my lump appeared very close to each other So now I'm freaking out. I'll mention it to my onc again today. Hopefully he can relax me - again!!!!",

My stomach started to get watery. Talked to my nurse. She said that I must take the percs and if I can't get fluid into me that she will order an IV The percs do help with the pain but I feel so lousy and light headed as a result of taking them. I know that I have to eat but just don't feel like it. I did  manage to eat another English muffin and some almonds. I am going to try Rice Krispies soon Was drinking g2, apple juice and water plus ice chips Now the pain is coming back so I'll have to take 2 more percs. Atleast it seems that they are lasting 12 hours.  I feel so bad. This morning I just wanted to die!  This pain is brutal and I hate taking meds So I'll take my percs and hope not to pass out My nurse asked me to give her an update tomorrow.

He said that with my type of cancer he expects that I will be fine and live a long life. He did mention that they never know what cancer might do 100%, however he said that in my case things look very positive. Then he gave me some medical jargon to support his view. He also mentioned that they can unfortunately tell with some women that things do not look as positive I find it funny that even once he explained this to me I still feel worried. I feel like it's not good for me to feel relived because I'll jinx myself into having something bad happen. Crazy I know!!!!! Today I will be in the chair for round 3 of FEC.

Suspect that I will continue weekly for my last few weeks but I'll know more next tues when I meet with my onc. If I maintained my schedule it would be 2 more rounds every third week but given my reaction I see this changing  As of today tummy is much better. Taste buds are off but atleast my tongue is not burning. I've also noticed that my nose is very dry and whenever I blow, seems bloody. I think that there are dry blood clots in there. Anyone else have this? Having lost most of my eyelashes my eyes are sticky most mornings and often continues for the duration of the day. I sure hope that eyelashes grow back quickly! I am finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning but have my hubby set the clock for 8am. I must admit that I'm having great sleeps although I something's wake up drenched or restless    I still have enough energy to exercise. Going on treadmill soon followed by weights. I hope that this helps!  I try to maintain this as much as possible My left foot sometimes feels strange -weird  tingling or slightly numb but nothing too bothersome Wishing you all a great day!",

My butt feels like it's been ripped apart!  Guess I'll take a sitz bath. Got \"tucks\" and baby wipes. Hopefully that plus my meds help Last night we confirmed a gig on sat oct 25th mississauga Ontario. Hoping to have 4 bands. Now the work gets started to design a poster, print tickets, tshirts, ask for volunteers to run a silent auction, get stuff for silent action and stuff for small giveaways!  All to raise $ for cancer research etc Hope that my SEs don't get too much worse. I still have a few aches and still get so hot at night. I haven't slept one full night since I can't remember when. Hopefully exercise will help! Enjoy your day!!",

Went to the gym today. 30 min cardio and some weights. Yesterday morning before chemo I did approx 40 min of arm weights. Feels great but my thighs always feel tired.  Have a band practice for bare rump reunion this Sunday night. Our classic rock band is called lefty and the goons and we rehearse next tues. Can't wait!! I find it very nice when survivors share. It gives hope and I find it so positive. What surprises me us how many survivors I have bumped into As I continue to plan the benefits I met a lady who owns a store and is a breast cancer survivor. A guitarist that we are auditioning a week Saturday is married to a woman who is a colon cancer survivor. My friend is dating a woman who is a cancer survivor. Good grief! The key word here is SURVIVOR Remember this when you're having a down minute, hour or day. We are survivors. There is no cure for many diseases and we live with them. We will be here many many years from now. I am convinced of it!! Keep strong my sisters! Love u all!!",

So, I awoke this morning with discomfort from the port.  Yuch!  I actually felt a bit nasuous last night - perhaps from the sedative.  I called my Nurse and asked for painkillers as Tylenol Extra Strength just aren't cutting it so I have to pick that up at some point today. I will be having my first infusion today - it's scheduled for noon.  For breakfast I had oatmeal with bran buds and a banana.  I'm bringing 2 hard boiled eggs with me plus an apple and celery plus 2 bottles of water.  I'll try a salmon sandwich on all grain bread for dinner with dark lettuce.  I already drank 2x500ml this morning and am working on a third!! I hope that the chemo goes well today and that there is no pain.  Yesterday when they were drawing blood from the Port, the nurse mentioned that it was difficult to flush and that she had to push the port up to facilitate the process.  Why must they mention things like this?  It only made me more anxious.  The process didn't hurt but now I fear that it will today and was only pain free bacause I still had some freezing let over at the site. I'll do my best to update timely. Have a good day all!!",

I was very open about sharing my cancer diagnosis . For me I found it very helpful. 2 of my colleagues had cancer - one with a very similar diagnosis to me and both are 5+ year survivors and moved on along time ago I shared on Facebook and reconnected with people that haven't spoken with in 39+ years !  The women on this buses have also been so helpful!   For me I Aldo find that getting involved by volunteering and participating in support groups help. It just reinforces that we are not alone and that cancer has a face ! So far I am thankful that my SEs have been very manageable. I had nausea and a bit of vomiting the day if infusion and a few wired days after that followed by mild stomach cramping but after day 8 I was rocking I have been trying to walk atleast. 5 miles a day as many have told me that walking and fresh air help to minimize SEs   I wish u the very best with ur treatment.  Mommyq I live in Ontario canada and did not tip the person that fitted me or who shaved me.

I took 3 yesterday So far no vomiting and nausea yesterday was better than first go round. Today so far so good Now I wait for my nurse to call for my neulasta shot  I was told to use spf30 sunscreen. I he's ombrelle but will try to hang out in the shade this summer. :-( Tonight is my ranger game so hope that I don't nod off like yesterday!  I'll Aldo try to get a walk in Wishing all a great day!  ",

I know that this sounds foolish but it really concerns me Also I have had a pain in the centre of my chest that's been there for approx a week. I have mild reflux and have had it off and on for years so have been popping Prevacid. I don't know if it is reflux but I've had this discomfort before. Sometimes it's not so bad. I saw my family dr today and called my nurse. No one is concerned. It seemed to have started in late January when I felt the lump in my armpit. It also starts sometimes when I'm walking.

I have had some mild \"gut rot\" - anyone else feeling that?   Hopefully things stay this way as it is fairly doable but I fear that it won't.  Funny - I can't bear the though or sight or smell of celery and veggies do not seem appealing to me at all.  I'm focusing on fruits and trying to get veggies when I can.  It anyone else is on FEC-T treatment, I'd appreciate hearing about your experiences.  Enjoy your day all!",

I had to keep the bandages on and keep it dry. I received a pamphlet saying not to let the port rule your life. Swim run exercise etc. as others had shared with me the discomfort which is originally experienced will pass. I still feel the odd twinge but it lessens each day.  I have decided to train for the breast cancer walk held in early September each year. Not sure if it is realistic to commit for this year. It is approx 40 miles over 2 days. I always liked to walk but am really getting serious about it now. Bought proper sneakers yesterday a water bottle belt a pink beanie and an iPhone armband. I'm ready!! :-) Each participant has to raise $2k. My concern is that I have no way of knowing how my SEs will be as I continue forward. 2 more rounds of FEC then 3 of taxotere / herceptin with herceptin continuing for a year While I know that everyone is different does anyone have or had experience with taxotere/ herceptin?  My MO told me that fatigue is the worst hot most people At this point my chemo is scheduled to end in mid august so if I train now I should be good for the walk I might register just to have something to work towards Live my DH but since his severe case with shingles in his head and eye last year he has been snoring so loud that some of you might have heard him!!  Now that I think I can sleep he's keeping me up with his SNOORING!!  lol Linda love that captain America!  Remember 3d rocks!!!!!!  :-) Have a great day all!!",

I feel strange that so far my SEs have been what I would consider minimal. I'm on day 12 now and I've felt awesome since last Thursday including  today. I've been walking a lot including 4 miles today When I look at life after my first round of chemo I seemed to have had SEs for the first 8 days starting with nausea and a bit of vomiting with fatigue to being wired for a couple days to stomach cramping. Since  this past Wednesday I have felt awesome. The only new thing is the itchy scalp but once I put conditioner on it it calms down. Even when I felt wired I was still able to go out with friends.  I hope that my SEs stay like this bit after reading what may of you are managing through I suspect that after my 2 nd round on May 21 things might change I wish you all minimal SEs and the best of health.

Since today is the ranger game I better find a way to stay awake tonight!! As for my scalp it's sore in spots too. Some of the remaining hair is very brittle so I'm afraid to shave it.

Mine is actually the same as what they use for a child because it was inserted on my right dude where I have no breast muscle. I was told that they had to put it on the opposite side of the breast cancer The procedure was truly nothing even though I was nervous as hell The longest part was the prep. I was in a room full of nurses who prepped me. They hovered me and prepared the area. They taped me down, put oxygen in my nose, put something on my head, sterilized the area. I think that this took about hslf an hour. Then the radiologist came in I felt a pinch when he injected the freezing. Then he injected a sedative and next I knew I didn't care what he did. We chatted about hockey. I felt nothing My hubby said that the whole thing took about 90 minutes.  When they were done they wheeled me to an area where I recuperated for spprox30 minutes then I walked out with my hubby and got my bloodwork done using the port As my chemo was the next day they left the port active meaning that the needle and IV was still inserted. It was fine I felt a tad sore afterwards for approx a week and it was a bit difficult to get comfortable when sleeping but I don't even notice it now I do weights and was told that I can swim. I don't feel needles going in Ike out and live it just like I was told I would I get nervous before any tests and procedures but this was really nothing Let me know if u have any other questions",

Just to continue the chat about people and comments; staring etc. being born the way I was I've  experienced this my experirnced life.  Oh you poor thing. - I'm not poor and not a thing How do you mange? - same as you You look so wierd /different/strange/funny - that's what makes me unique. I am different and proud to be Then I went through things like not getting picked in school to play sports in gym. I've heard you can't catch a ball, swim etc Well I was a goalie in hockey and will STILL play, played baseball, football, play guitar using a prosthetic to hold the pick, swim, do weights, ride a bike, tie my shoes, cut a steak and on and on. Lol Comments and stares all made me stronger. It pushed me to never give up or give in to others. If I want to do something, I'll find a way Did I have escape mechanisms?  Sure. I dressed up as gene Simmons of kiss which forced people to look at something else first other than my arm Now I've survived breast cancer and comments continue. If I want to go bald I'm going. Will I feel a bit uncomfortable?  Honestly - yes. But people will be looking at something other then my arm. Lol Overall I don't think that people intentionally mean to hurt us with their comments / stares.   It might scare them - force them to recall an experience close to home - or they just don't know how to handle things and don't know what to say. Or they ARE just stupid and ignorant Isn't it human nature to focus on the negative?  I know that I've done that and still do. How often do we write a note to compliment someone yet are ready to share a bad experience?  It doesn't make us evil - just human I have a big mouth and am always ready to share my opinion. Now I've tried a different approach. If I get stared at - yes I STILL have to say something - lol - I'll say do you have something that you'd like to ask?  Depending on the person sometimes I might be a bit sarcastic. With children I'm very understanding. They are the only innocents The dumbbell who was at the LGFG class that I went to said domething stupid. I agree with the comment that she wanted attention. I believe that she is scared stiff of her condition and inside is very scared and weak. Of course I STILL wanted to say something but the glares from my cancer sisters did it for me So I believe that I have a slight advantage of dealing with the \" idiots of the day\". Lol Try to be strong - let the comments and stares fuel your strength. Remember that you are unique and special and beautiful. You are loved. You are friends, mothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and on and on. We are united and we rock!! It is for reasons like this that I always shared my message when playing with my band - don't judge people by how they look And honestly wouldn't you glance at this? I sometimes catch myself looking !!  Lol ",

Despite very kind and empathetic nurses I started balling. They let my hubby in while they discussed where they would insert the port. Since I had cancer on the left side I was told that the port would be inserted on the right. The dr looked at the right and left sides of my neck and upper chest then decided on a spot on the right side The prep for the procedure seemed to take 20 minutes. The nurses sterilized the area and covered me with blankets. They taped my skin down to ensure that the area was right. Then put an oxygen mask on then the dr came.  He applied freezing and then came the meds. They didn't knock me out but I was sure relaxed. Nothing hurt - the port was inserted - stiched up then wheeled to recovery where I stayed for approx half am hour with my hubby.  I then had blood work using the port. Then met with my MO. He said that he fed that there is an 80% chance that the cancer will not return and dies not think that I will have a hard time with SE other than bone aches and tiredness. He suspects that I might gain up to 10 pounds and told me not to worry about it. He is wonderful to work with Everyone et the credit valley hospital has been awesome So I'm ready to go!  Bring it on!!!! Funny. One of the nurses at the chemo suite has seen our band perform.

It is so true - how do you know what is a \"normal\" reaction until you have experienced it yourself?  I have had pain and discomfort my whole life in my hips and lower back.  I just kept plowing on.  Yesterday, the Nurse explained that I must stay ahead of the pain.  I should take the meds.  My problem was that I didn't even try percocets until Monday morning at 3:30am.  Up until that point I thought that extra strength tylenol would be enough.  I just hate the thought of popping pills and have to get over that.  In my worst dreams I never thought that things would progress to the point that they did.   I never even thought that the burning tummy could be reflux.  I have a mild case of reflux that flares up every so often and pop a prevacid for a week.  Then I'm all good.  When I chatted with hte nurse about the Dr giving me zantac, she explained that the burning was reflux.  I always thing of reflux as acid backing up into the throat and forget that this includes acid burning in the stomach as well.  She suggested that I pop a prevacid every day and that this well help prevent this from happening.  I never even thought to ask about this or discuss with my Onc.  All things that you learn. What I truly love about my medical team is the kindness, empathy and support that I am getting.  Not once did anyone point fingers or make me feel like I had brought this on myself.  Even when I said that I was stupid to ignore this like I had, they jumped in and disputed my way of thinking.  We all know that there are some very poor bed side manners out there so I am thankful. I have complete trust and faith in all of them - especially my Oncologist who leads the charge.  His hug meant the world to me.  I will discuss the go-forward plan a week Tuesday. A nurse explained to me that unfortunately, others have gone through what I did and explained why it is so important to raise concerns early.  I did contact my MO's nurse Monday and she suggested an IV based on my feedback.  I turned it down thinking again that \"tomorrow would be better\".   Plus I didn't want to be a bother to anyone.  I didn't want my hubby to have to take time off of work.  As it stands, he ended up coming home from work Monday to be with me and took me to the Dr yesterday.  I worried him sick with my pain and crying so really did nothing good for anyone. Hindsight is always 20/20. So, now I just feel tired.  Still have some pain in my tummy but now I'm on the side of healing. Two more treatments!!!  Can't wait for the football season to start because then my chemo is behind me and I can focus on better things! I propose again that a get-together must happen once we are all done our treatments.  I'm definately in!!!!! Love you all!!!!",

Funny how you can feel wired and tired at the same time!  Still no change with taste buds or appetite. My weight is steady. I did have a few aches during the night and my chest is a bit achy but can't complain. It's all good and the sun is actually shining!!!!! ",

For example I love oil of at Shea butter creme and body sips but they both contain the bad chemicals. But it stops my itching!!  Ugh!! Met with my onc today. He is switching me from taxotere to taxol and I will have infusions for the next 6 weeks. No more neulasta. I will continue the herceptin on a 3 week cycle for 1 year So hopefully my SEs will be minimal - this is what my onc expects. Minimal pain and tummy issues I love him. He is so easy to talk to but it's funny how one can interpret things. He mentioned that he wants to get me through treatment with minimal SEs so that I can move on for months and years I walked out telling my hubby that this means I don't have a long life expectancy. Hubby said that's not how he heard it given past things that my onc had said which included my onc previously saying that I have a good prognosis based on my type of cancer Funny how we interpret things So hopefully things will be better after tomorrow's infusion. Now instead of 2 more rounds and being done with chemo by mid august, I have 6 more rounds and will be done with chemo the week before Labor Day. I'm cool with that as long as I have a less SEs I also got Tylenol 3 incase of pain as percs went straight to my stomach I'll be in the chair tomorrow at 10 then countdown every week!!!!",

I hear good and bad about tamoxifen which I'll have to take for who knows how long What really upsets me is not do much dying but how. I told my DH that regardless of when my time comes - 2-3-5-10-15-20+ years I just don't want to ever be a \"head on a stick\". We lost a good friend to a rare form of skin cancer last year and he got so sick towards the end. It's thoughts like that that I have to push from my mind One never knows what will get us or when but having cancer makes me think the worst if I allow it to creep into my mind And now it seems to be everywhere even when I don't think about it. We watched a rerun of criminal minds and one of the criminals had breast cancer. There she sat bald as she was told to do the right thing despite being stage 4 and  not having much time left. I nearly lost it Then I pick myself up and say f@ck this just live!!!! Hope the bloodwork doesn't hurt tomorrow. They'll go through the port. The first time they did as well but the needle was put in during the procedure so I was sedated at the time. I bought the emla cream so I might use it :-) Sorry if I brought anyone down.

After that I get bloodwork then meet with my MO. This is the same day as the procedure!!  Then comes April 30 and the chemo I've laughed I've cried and just can't get my head wrapped around this as I feel fine.  My treatment plan consists of 6 chemo cycles given on a single day every 21 days For the first 3 cycles I get adrucil (or fluorouracil) plus pharmorubicin ( or eplrubicin) plus procytox (or cyclophosphamide). The last drug is IV and tablets The next 3 cycles will be taxotere (or docetaxel).  My treatment plan is called FEC-D At some point herceptin ( or trastuzunab) will be introduced for approx 1 year every 3 weeks Then I will take tamoxifen for atleast 5 years In my binder I have print outs of all the chemo drugs and an scares sh*tless!   For now I try to put this out of my head. My DH and I are going away for this weekend to relax and enjoy life before all this crap starts So we will eat all the wrong foods and booze it up. Then I will have 1 week to prepare I ordered my wig this past Tuesday but also plan on wearing my favourite sports caps a lot  I plan on sharing once I get started.

Since being home, I\u2019ve had appointments - slept because my DH and I both caught cold while away, studied my chemo regimen, went grocery shopping, cleaned the house - huh - I NEVER do this!! Last Tuesday, I had my SYMA (or MUGA) scan. Very bizarre. The tech explained that there would be an IV so I asked where he would put it since my right arm has no veins that you can find and the left should not be used due to the lymph nodes being removed. He asked how my other tests have been done. I responded that I have not had any since surgery. He then asked me what I wanted him to do. What? Really? So for some stupid reason I started to cry. He then changed completely and became very empathetic. He went off to speak with a Dr. who said that he could use my left arm. I wondered later how they do this test for people with no arms - where do they put the IV then? Anyhow - things proceeded well after that. On Wednesday I met with my Surgeon who is happy with my healing process. He made it clear that he does not want me to lift any weights until after my treatment is over. We shall see about that!! I miss my weights and want to atleast try to do some light weights after 8 weeks of recovery. I plan to speak with my MO next week. Thursday afternoon I too got a pixie cut. I also got in touch with Wellspring and registered for a few sessions in May - Breast Cancer support group, Nutrition for Breast Cancer and a Look Good Feel Better class. The first class is on May 8 - the day I get my head shaved and have my wig fitted. I hope that I will feel well enough to go!! My nephew\u2019s wife gave birth to a beautiful baby boy yesterday shortly after 4pm named Aaron Michael Sandow - 10lbs 3 oz - can you say OUCH? Wife had a C section - baby, Mom and Dad are doing fine!! Today my hubby has arranged a pre chemo party so we are expecting approx 30 people tonight. Should be very nice!! Tuesday April 29th is when the fun starts! My port will be inserted at 8am, then I plan to eat, then I have blood work then meet with my MO to talk cancer - ugh!!!! Wednesday April 30th at Noon is my first chemo infusion. I am scared to death!! I read the chats about chemo with great interest. This is really NOT something that I want to do and am thinking that once the port is in, I am tied to this until the MO decides that I am free! Having said that, my MO is the Head of Oncology at Credit Valley Hospital and actually led the development and building of the cancer centre at the hospital. The details of my tumour and treatment are in my bio - I do know that my cancer was aggressive at stage 3 and that the two nodes which were impacted with macro. I know two people who have gone through similar treatment and they are fine today; one is 5 years out, the other close to 8. Right now, I am very healthy with the exception of the cancer which tried to kill me so hoping that I will be okay as I work through this. I know that I will be monitored very closely. I too was told that the chemo is precautionary as my margins were clear as were my Bone and CT scans. I sometimes think - what if I did nothing? I suspect that the truth is - no-one truly knows!! My thoughts are that I could possible have microscopic cancer cells floating around just waiting to wake up. If I do, chemo should wipe these out and prevent any new ones from growing. But it can also increase the risk of other cancers or health issues. So - it's only 6 rounds - FEC-D also known as FEC-T. 3 rounds of FEC followed by 3 rounds of Taxtotere. Then the hercepton for approx 1 year and Tamoxifen. So - do I walk away and say forget it - whatever happens happens? I don't want to end up like a good friend of mine who had a rare form of skin cancer - ignored it - then by the time it started to grow and ooze it was too late! So, I'll give it a go I guess. Funny - I have reflux - very minor - and while we were i n NYC, my chest began to hurt while we were walking. This is the 2nd of 3rd time that this has happened since feeling the lump in my armpit on Jan 27. So, I started taking my Prevacid a few days ago. This morning I can still feel the pressure a bit - funny - my hubby told me - don't even say that this is lung cancer!! He reminded me that I have experienced this for years especially when I am stressed! I find it off that I now feel somewhat relaxed - more so than when this started.  I also have had allergic  reactions to penicillon at times so say - BRING IT ON!!  I admire each of you and draw strength  from you!  I plan to start sharing as I work through my journey and see you all as invaluable support!",

When my hubby and I met with the counsellor 4 weeks ago she alluded to the fact that she would be surprised of I was BRCA + due to the fact that my mother had cancer in her 70s and that neither my sister nor any of my cousins or blood relatives had cancer at younger years. My aunt had bc at 80 and my paternal grandmother had colon cancer at 80 So now I have to wait until then end of June for my results.  If I'm positive I suspect that this would mean a hysterectomy and having my right boob that never developed but that just hangs there removed Would that assumption be correct?  Anyone test positive for this?  If so what were your next steps?",

I love my MO!!!!!  Here is my update; Today at 8:15 I was at the hospital for my appointment with my MO and his Nurse - Angel #2.  I was in such pain this morning having woken up at 2:30 in the morning for yet more diarreah which has just about ripped me open and left me with a burning stomach and more pain elsewhere. In walks the Dr.  I start to cry and he hugs me.  I open my diary and tell him the hell that I have been going through - trying not to cry.... I felt like a little girl talking to my dad.  I told him everything.  The aches, the pains, the constipation, the diarreah, the minimal eating and drinking, the percocets.  Upon review, the pains really kicked in last Friday night.  I told him that I had lost 5 pounds since Saturday and that last night my temperature spiked to 100.4 for approx 2 hours last night.  He listened to everything - did a physical exam;  asked a few questions.  My hubby said that the Nurse had tears in her eyes. He explained that my body was reacting negatively to taxotere.  He explained that he would have me feeling like myself again very soon.  I even asked him if I was going to die.  He said absolutely not.  I was sent upstairs to the chemo area with an order for an IV.  When I got to reception, I lost it and just started crying.  I was in so much pain. A Nurse held me for atleast 10 minutes, then rocked me and hummed to me.  Then I cried even more because it made me feel like a little girl with my mom.   Once they calmed me down, they took me to a stretcher, gave me warm blankets and I was put on a 3 hour IV of fluids, a bit of morphine and zantac.  They also took some blood.  I slept a bit, ate a bit and was told that I would also get Home Care for the next 3 days so my port was left active.  My hubby wanted to stay with me but I sent him to work.  My girlfriend picked me up and we went out to eat.  TO EAT!!!!!  I felt approx 80% by that time - I had half a veggie omlette with some potatoes and white toast with strawberry jam, apple juice, water with lemon and a green t.  That was at 2:00 and I haven't run to the bathroom yet!!!!!!!!  I was told that I should take a percocet every 6 hours and that I should be at 100% before the end of the weekend. A week from this Tuesday, I will meet with my Onc to discuss how my last 2 chemos will be managed.  At this point, he anticipates that I will be given taxotere weekly with the herceptin still being every 3 weeks.  Weekly!  Ugh!!!!! The Nurses were awesome, my Onc was awesome - I can't believe how much better I feel in such a short period of time.  I swear to you that I was ready to die.  I couldn't take anymore agony!   Now I look back and say why did I wait so long?  My answer - I always thought that tomorrow would be better - that I had to endure a few days of hell.  I would wake up feeling a bit better then get kicked in the teeth later in the day.  Plus I dreaded the possibility of having to have an active port and to be hooked up to an IV.  Well, it happened anyways!! Thank-you to all for holding my hand, giving me hugs and for sharing your kind words and sentiments.  I might not be completely out of the woods yet, but am getting there!!!!! Thank-you all!!!!",

The first hour was all about the makeup and application - the 2 nd was about wigs and scarves So here I am in a group of approx 12 women - the majority fighting breast cancer when I hear the idiot beside me saying that she's so thankful that she's not triple positive as it's a death sentence.  Hi there!!   As I always have to say something I turned and told her that I am triple positive and that I'm going to rock this Oh came the response. I'm so sorry Whatever!  Here we are sisters on a journey yet that does not change who we are. Of course later she went on to volunteer to model the wigs and put on a show about not wanting anyone to look at her because she'd look stupid and how bring bald will make her look like a real cancer patient Good one again as there was a beautiful woman in the group who came to the class bald. No wig. No scarf. Nothing. And she rocked!! The class itself was okay especially for someone like me who for my whole life only pit on black eyeliner and eyeshadow. Concealer?  Foundation?  Pressed powder?  Huh ?  Lol They got me to put on lip liner and lipstick. That was it !  Lol. They tried !!  Lol. Overall the class was very good I would say that we got approx $2-300 of high quality makeup, cleansers and creams including suntan lotion. The volunteers packed it up in a box before we left I don't see cancer as a disease. I view it as a condition. I've been fortunate to live 50 years with minimal health issues. My hubby has been on meds for colitis for 15+ years now. Like breast cancer there is no cure. There's no cure for the common cold either. There's no cute for diabetes and lots of other things. Yet we putter on So I try to view breast cancer as a condition that I will have to live with. It's not a death sentence and hopefully I will have a good quality of life like many many women do.  My hubby told our neighbour about my cancer yesterday. While he said sorry he added that his family knows cancer including breast and that all are survivors. He also mentioned a woman up the street who has also beaten breast cancer When my time comes hopefully many many years from now ( I have  plans until my 80s), all I want is not to die forgotten or alone At times I have visions of being hooked up to machines and tubes not being able to eat or remember my name. If that happens hopefully the meds will be good and the rock n roll will be cranked to 11 Have a good day all!!",

We are either finished or in the homestretch!!  Woo hoo As for me my onc changed me from taxotere to taxol which I will have infused for the next 5 weeks. This means that I'll finish chemo the wed before Labor Day weekend instead of mid august  Yesterday I had my first taxol with my 2nd herceptin which stays on the 3 week schedule. In between herceptin and taxol I get Zantac, Benadryl and a steroid. I was so zonked!! So far so good but no poop today so I took my meds to try and stay ahead of the game I also got Tylenol 3 in prep for any pain because I hated the percs I have been told by my onc, nurse and pharmacist that this should be much easier on me.  I no longer need the neulasta shot so am hoping for the best Tomorrow night we are going to try and have a band rehearsal. Can't wait! Wishing a good evening to all!! ",

I'll go to the next 3 by myself. I've been okay the past few times and think that if rather snooze during infusion to make the time pass quicker. My hubby wants to go to the last chemo infusion. Don't know if I'll ring the bell as I'll still have 10 months of herceptin left. Maybe I'll ring it twice - once at the end of chemo then at end of herceptin.  Hope to hit the gym today Hope that all are well and that everyone has a great day!",

I apologize if I have caused any of you to worry. As you may recall, I am organizing two fundraising events. The first to be held Saturday Oct 25 in support of the Trillium Health Partner Foundation - Credit Valley Hospital, Cancer Services; the second to be held Friday, November 21 in support of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. For the past several weeks, I have been devoted to this. Both will be held under the banner name - ROCKING IT BALD. I have created t-shirts using my hubby\u2019s design, bought the domain name rockingitbald.com (the site will be up shortly - I have been working on it for weeks!!), trying to get items for door prizes and silent auctions, meeting with representatives from the Trillium Health Partners Foundation, updating my ROCKING IT BALD facebook page and trying to get volunteers for the events. On top of this, I have been rehearsing with my AC/DC tribute band BARE RUMP and classic rock band LEFTY AND THE GOONS as both will be performing at the events in addition to the Relay For Life, Friday, Sept 12 in Norval, Ontario. On top of this, I participated in a video to share my story sponsored by Scottie\u2019s in support of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. I have another video shoot this Friday for the cancer centre at the hospital where I am being treated - Credit Valley. In addition to this, I have been trying to go to the gym 4-5 times per week, and have been continuing my treatment. Needless to say, I\u2019ve been crazy busy so again, do apologize!! Tomorrow is my last chemo treatment of taxol. DONE!!!! Can\u2019t wait - I\u2019m too busy for this! I can\u2019t complain about the side effects. I had 3 treatments in a row then was off for a week, then the last 3. I am starting to feel some needles and pins in my finger tips and have an odd ache in my left rib. I\u2019m waiting for swelling due to water retention - after my first 3 rounds I gained 6 pounds of water. It was awful!! I\u2019v also had ringing in my right ear for WEEKS but this started off and on last year. My mom calls it \u201cage\u201d. lol I will also get round 4 of herceptin tomorrow which will continue every 3 weeks until the end of June 2015. If anyone wants to keep in touch, I would suggest hitting me up on Facebook if you haven\u2019t already. I\u2019m Angie Sandow and you\u2019ll see a picture of me in a beanie. I will continue to pop in but for now, I am soooo busy that I hardly have time to reherase with my bands!! I would also appreciate if you would \u201clike\u201d my Rocking It Bald facebook page. As I mentioned above, my website will be up shortly. In the next few weeks, I will start volunteering at Wellspring and hope to commence my volunteering with the Canadian Cancer Society. I hope to use this and my Rocking It Bald site to network in the hopes of starting a career in public speaking down the road. I hope that all are well!!!!",

This was due to how I was born. They'd look at me - then my arm and shake their head.  To this day I still get looked at but I've learned not to care less. You don't like it - don't look.  Since I've been dealing with this my whole life throwing my bald head into the equation doesn't seem like too big of a deal for me Then again I don't often go out bald due to the sun and heat. I either wear my sports caps or wig. But when we were in Niagara on the lake a few weeks ago hubby and I found a nice shady spot where we sat on a bench under some trees and I sat bald. People walked by - some did double takes. I just laughed. I couldn't care less Next wed I go for round 4 - my first of 3 rounds of taxotere. Hoping for the best. I'm just getting over my SEs from round 3 of FEC so bring it on Unfortunately my hubby's employer has decided to be a dick and told him that he can't accompany me to chemo anymore. My hubby felt like garbage yesterday. Like he would let me down. He would still go if I wanted him too but he has enough pressure His employer is the owner and a \"friend\" of his for the last 25 years. My hubby has worked there for the last 3 as a warehouse manager. It's a smaller company and they have been very good with him over the years. They just aren't polished. He was so upset  So his cousin will go with me which should be fun. I told my hubby that I think that it's good that he gets a break. I can't imagine the emotions that he has been dealing with. He will be telling his employer that he must go to the appointments with my onc and that if I can't get anyone to go yo chemo with me he's still going Fun stuff to have to deal with in the middle of all this! The weather is getting so beautiful!  I hope that you can all enjoy!!!!",

Nearly threw up but didn't. Bit of d. Drank g2, apple juice and water I've lost 4 pounds since Saturday. Called nurse to let her know where I'm at. Still have no fever Felt better lying down. It's 9:40am and I just woke up again. Going to try to eat eggs and toast with a banana. Eating just doesn't appeal up me. My tongue is on fire but I have no sores What I hate is taking the percs. When I have pain I don't feel foggy, nausous or dizzy. Just hurt. When I take percs I have these other SEs I can't imagine having to have two more rounds of taxotere. I just don't feel strong enough. A friend of mine had these pains for a week before they subsided Hard to believe that this will pass as I'm also hearing of so many women feeling crap with tamoxifen and I'll need to take that too. How will I have a good quality of life with this crap? I have to be able to exercise, play my guitar, sing..... On top of everything else I got an email from my company hr rep asking if she could give my personal email to my GM and director of HR. That really stressed me out. This is the same GM that hit me up on linkedin a few months ago as I'm getting treatment. I deal with my insurance company who deals with my employer. Even as a manager I was told that I could not deal directly with any employee who was off on disability  Every time I hear my GMs name I cringe. He couldn't care less if I live or die. I know that our a/r results have tanked in the months since I've been off. I'm going to tell them that I will continue to work through my insurance company and that they can do the same It's all I need right now Sorry to be so down all. You're really helping me with your virtual hugs. It's so hard to sit at home alone all day with my hubby at work knowing that he's worried about me and I'm too weak to give him a strong face Hopefully this will pass soon. I can't take much more! Trying to focus on nfl tickets going on sale for my jets tomorrow so that I can buy 2 tix for jets vs broncos. That same evening the rangers open their season against the toronto maple leafs my hubby's team. Hoping to get to both games! Wishing all of you a great day!",

I explained how my side effects though not bad are increasing. Aches, pains in muscles and joints, increased fatigue, continued flirting with constipation although I am keeping things moving, some abdominal aches and tingly tongue. Oh yes, I Aldo hear up like a furnace most nights which wakes me up. Do all of these SEs sound familiar to anyone?   The nurse told me that the aches and fatigues will probably increase throughout treatment although she does not suspect that it will get as intense as it was with taxotere Ugh! I've slept fairly well the last few evenings but today it's back to steroids and Benadryl. That = sleep for 3 hours after infusion then be wired and tired all night!!  Lol I've been on short term disability since my surgery in March and this ends sept 17 so now it's time to submit paperwork for long term disability. Funny how the thought of returning to work stresses me right out. I don't think I can handle my job until all treatment is completed. I remember all of the stress and pressure which I used to thrive in. Right now it's hard to get out of bed in the morning and stay focused on things. Being off allows me to do things at my own pace - stress free - and focus on me I think back to when this started. I chatted with my onc and told him that I wanted to continue working. I'm glad that he explained to me why I shouldn't. Have a great day!!",
