But mine is different in that I did have bc 5 years ago, my onc. says this is a left over from what happened in 2002. So the chemo did not kill it all! It was invasive ductal carcinoma ER +++ PR+, HER2-, moderately diff., Elston Gr II, T2 N1 MX, Stage IIB. The lymph nodes on that side were all removed, 7 out of 10 were positive. I had a mastectomy and chemo.  I thought I was rid of it, and now this neck lump came up 3 months ago, about pea size. I've had that lump for about 1 year, but I thought it was benign, as 8 years ago I had a benign lump removed about 1/2\" from that neck site. The lump was biopsied 3 months ago and dx as bc, ER positive. NED anywhere else in the body. They want me to have radiation but I declined. I have become vegan, and have gone the alt. route. I am on a cancer diet, no meat or animal fats, no sugar, no processed foods, no gluten, no dairy. I take immune strengtheners, colon cleanser, parasite killers, Barley tablets, green drinks, I am juicing (one pint of carrot juice daily). I also take COQ10, Zinc, Selenium, Pancreatic Enzymes, Vit. D3, Vit C with baking Soda, Green tea extract, L-Lysine, L-Proline, Flaxseed oil with Cottage cheese and Essiac. Altogether I ingest about 50 tablets each day. There is very little food I can eat, basically only fruit and veggies, and most veggies raw. My social life is down the drain, as I don't join the family any more with get togethers, restaurant visits etc, as everything centers around food. BUT: The lump is now down to half its size and it is getting soft. I am absolutely convinced that my bc was caused by Premarin, they put me on it after my hysterectomy, I took it for 10 years without a break, \"today they know better\". In 10 years time they will \"know better\" about the stuff they are prescribing us today !!! Now they put me on Femara, which attacks the bones and God knows what else....... As soon as my lump is completely down, I'll take myself off the Femara without even telling the onc. I am 62, just as a matter of interest. I must say I have lost all confidence in conventional doctors and dentists (they are still stuffing our teeth and root canals with toxic metals). I don't know if I am allowed to state that here.    ",
