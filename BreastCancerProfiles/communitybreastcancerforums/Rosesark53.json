She's at 11 years now no cancer. I took premarin for years also, had to stop it due to blood clots. Year later at age 52, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, dcis both of us. Also my little sister was diagnosed at 26 yrs old, she was only on birth control. My mom swears the premarin caused her cancer. I was lucky and not lucky that my breast doctor watched me like a hawk. I have dense breast, but my left he found a thickening he didnt like. Had biopsy, results fibrous tissue. Year later he gave me a dillon scan on same breast, found cancer, but it was the size of a bb. Really lucky he had that machine. I had unilateral mastectomy. 4 yes ago. Am on arimidex",

The lady was calling my name, but I didnt care, I wanted OUT. I had to come back another day on zanax. Now I have them put a wash cloth over my eyes, so that if I happen to open them, I dont see anything. I tried the headphones they have, but noise of machine was so loud I couldnt hear the music half the time. I'm glad to hear you made it through",

It drives me crazy, it is so realistic that you can feel it to the exact tip, and yes, I can rub, scratch, pat the skin and no relief! I do notice though, that it happens the most right after my bs and onc do their exam. And it still bothers me the feeling of rubbing over the numbness where my breast was.",

I would be very surprised if my bsbc covered it as this ins is very different and stricter than the one I had almost 4 years ago. I didnt have the testing when I got cancer, because my sister had it at 26, my mom then got it, then me at 53, and my cousin on my moms side was diagnosed a couple years ago . I just kind of felt like duh, kind of seems like it is in the family big time. My daughter has been able to get mammogram at earlier since she is high risk. I worry about my sister's daughter because she is just past the age her mother was diagnosed. Sister presented with lump under arm, then had lump in breast. Mom presented with lump in left front at bottom of bra. Theirs went into the lymph nodes big time. Mine was caught very early. I wish very much that I had had bilateral instead of uni, as still worried at mamo and sonogram. Am about to try for mastectomy for right.",

Whew! Prob seems kind of complicated when reading this. I have a niece 28, my daughter 34., being watched. My daughter had to get special approval as her dh is air force and they as others dont want to mamo girls early. I think no matter what a gene test said, my daughter, neice and me would still feel better with them watched closely. Also my niece has adaughter and so she would have had a mother and grandmother and aunt with bc, so I know her mom would rather have her watched. I just would rather be safe than sorry no matter what. I also forgot to put in that my mother had an aunt who had bc. My mom's sister died last year of \"stomach\" prob. My mom's family is old school and british people just dont talk about that stuff.so that leaves a sister bc at 26, mother at 73, me at 53, my cousin at 30, and my aunt from england prob had ovarian cancer at 80.div class='post_sig'>Dx 7/15/2009, DCIS, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2-",

Otherwise all of us know we are at risk for other stuff and will let family doc still do our prevention and just be diligent. When it boils down to it, I still think that a gene test will not make a difference to us. But thats just me",
