It is unruly no matter what I do to it. My hair looks like a pom pom. It has been shaped by my hairstylist. She only has so much to work with. I am still on Herceptin & Perjeta through December, 2017. I live in Massachusetts. I wish I could fly out to CA to have it done. I would love to have extensions. I would feel soooooooooooooooo much better about myself. It's not vanity. My hair was ALWAYS 'my thing', since a child. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!!!!  ",
