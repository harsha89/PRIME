I had a horrible scare last night.  It was about 6:30pm and the phone rang.  It was a male voice who identified himself as my gastroentrologist.  I just had my yearly colonoscopy on Friday and he had removed a polyp.  I freaked and said \"why are you calling me, what is wrong?\"  Usually doctors only call with bad news and especially when it is after hours. He started laughing and said he just wanted to tell me personally that everything was ok.  He said the polyp was a bit \"bizarre\" but nothing to worry about.  He knew I had a lot on my plate now and he didn't want me to have to make an extra trip back to his office for the results.  He even told me I could wait 2 years till my next colonoscopy.  Whoo hoo.  Believe it or not, the one I had on Friday was number 14.  My colon cancer seems like a piece of cake now compared to what this BC will bring.  I know I sound like a winey baby.  With the 8 months I took chemo for the colon cancer, except for uncontrollable diarrhea I had no other side effects.  I had to take shots of sandostatin monthly and daily doses of liquid opium to control the diarrhea, but that seems like a walk in the park compared to hair loss and vomit! I think it is time to go take a Xanax before I have a nervous breakdown. As my oncologist would say \"Better Living Through Chemistry!\" I will write again tomorrow after my meeting.",

This past October I went for my routein mamo and they called me back for some retakes.  After the retakes they said I should go for a biopsy.  Well, PS I had a lumpectomy on 11/2/09.  It was Stage 1, ER/PR+, HER2-, 1.3cm, clear margins and the sentinal lymph node was negative, I believe the cells are a grade 3.  My oncologist said I would need 7 weeks of radiation and 5yrs on Arimidex.  They decided to do an onco test and that score came back as a 38, meaning IV chemo.  I am so freaked out by that.  The thought of going through chemo again is almost unbearable, plus the thought of losing my hair has really sent me into a depression. I am meeting with my oncologist on 12/17 to discuss the options.  She briefly told me there were 2 choices. 4X a week for 2.5 months or 2X a month for 6 months.  She did not say what drugs would be used. I am now 57 and was wondering if chemo would really provide that much of a benefit.  Do the benefits outweigh the side effects.  Days of vomiting and hair loss do not seem worth it if the percentage does not increase my chances of reoccurrence significantly. I would greatly appreciate any input from those of you who have been there. :-)",

I have heard so many bad things that the chemo can do to your heart as well.  The radiation scares me it is so close to the lungs and heart.  I have major damage to my spine now from the radiation to my lower back for the colon cancer.  After a CT scan they freaked out and sent me for a PET scan.  They thought the cancer had spread to my spine.  Turned out to be \"just\" radiation damage. Can anyone tell me how \"the girls\" feel during the radiation.  My friend told me her mom's turned black.  Is that common?  Do they get burnt?  My butt was so sore from the radiation I used tons of Aquaphor and lived in the sitz bath.   The 2 weeks after the radiation was finished were the worst when things kept cooking in there.  I was in so much pain I actually paged my radiation oncologist on a saturday, the only advice she could give me was to come to the ER because she could not prescribe a narcotic over the phone.  I was home alone and had no one to take me and wasn't going to call an ambulance.  I took 8 advil and remember just rolling from side to side in the bed crying.  On a scale of 1 to 10 that pain was a 15,  It was the worst pain I ever had in my life.  Can anyone tell me how breast radiation compares?",

The following day I will go back to the hospital and get a shot of something to immediately boost my white blood count.  Maybe Neulasta, not sure.  Supposedly my hair will all fall out about 15-17 days after the first treatment. After the chemo ends, I will have a 3 week break then the 7 weeks of radiation will start.  At the same time the radiaton starts is when I will start taking the Arimidex.   She wanted me to start on Christmas Eve, but I have family plans for that night and for Christmas day.  So now I am starting on New Year's Eve.  My appt is 8:15am.  I will go back on New Years Day for my shot.   Hopefully work will give me off Thurs and Fri and I will have the weekend to rest up before going back to work on Monday.   I went out wig shopping yesterday after work.  Oh boy, to me they all look like I have a dead cat on my head.  The woman in the shop tried to explain that is was some sort of brain disconnect and it didn't look as bad as I thought.  Of course the first thing she says is \"oh my, you don't have wig color hair.\"  Everything was either too blonde or too dark.  I looked weird in the frosted ones.  I told her my hair needed to be dyed.  She told me to come back after I colored it and to bring someone with me who could be objective.  Have any of you felt like this when wig shopping? I think I will feel so self conscious like a giant neon arrow is pointing at my head going \"bad wig, bad wig\". Sorry it took so long for me to get back here.  Thanks to all of you for the well wishes.",

I took some percoset the first 2 days then just needed some advil.  I wore my tube top for about 3 weeks.  Now I can go bra less again when  get home from work. Yeah.  That was the only part I hated, wearing the tube top or sports bra 24/7 for a couple of weeks. Good luck.  Hugs to all my sista's out there. ",

I start my chemo on New Year's Eve.  I swear, if it weren't for the hair loss I don't think I would even give the chemo and radiation a second thought.  I was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer 6 yrs. ago.  I had a complete hysterectomy, colon resection, 8 months of 5FU with leukovirin and 28 days of rads.  Except for extreme atomic explosive diarrhea I felt ok. I went out to the food store today.  I forced myself to wear a hat with just my bangs hanging out.  Since I am not a hat person it was really hard even knowing all my own hair was under the hat.  I can't even begin to know how it is going to feel when it starts falling out. Is there anyone out there who didn't completely lose their hair on TC?",

Can any of you ladies tell me how bad the nausea and vomiting is?  I'm not good with that.  With the 5FU I was a bit tired and basically had major league diarrhea.  No hair loss nausea or vomiting.  The first time I went through all this I didn't know what to expect so you just go with it day by day.  Having been down this road once before I am a bit more scared.  I think the losing my hair thing is really freaking me out.  I'm not all that good looking to begin with and I don't look good in short hair. My hair currently is about shoulder length.  Plus it really sends out a signal to the world that something is wrong with you.  Execpt for the month I had to walk around with a pump attached to me, no one ever knew I was sick.  People kept saying how great I looked. It really makes it hit home everytime you look in the mirror.  People say how uncomfortable the wigs are and can't wait to get home and rip them off their heads. I think someone asked what my cancer was.  It was invasive ductal.  After I have my visit with the oncologist on the 17th I will write more. ",
