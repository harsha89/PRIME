My procedure went much as described above, except they had me lay on my side instead of my stomach. It was a lot more entailed then what I expected. They ended up taking eight samples and it took about an hour. I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old, so it has been difficult not being to pick them up. I should get results back this week, so I'm praying everything is benign. I'm really glad I found this web site to get some support!",
