Trying not to freak out, and really dont want my husband to freak so I am down playing my fears... Yes, everyone is right.... It is the waiting that is the hardest....

I have been good and not gone \"googling\" :) I have reasearched enough and keep telling myself about those 80% b9 results. When I was home last night and thinking about the U.S. I remembered that she kept going to one area, so I felt the area again and realized that it was thickening. My left boobie is soooo sore this morning from all the squishing, and I keep getting that damn tingly feeling in the nipple area... I am trying my hardest to keep busy, my fear is that my doctors office closes at noon on fridays and he may not get my results.... That would mean I would have to spend the whole weekend trying not to think about it..... I will spend the weekend making soap and body scrubs to pass the time.... Thanks again for being here.... Honoree",

There is an asymmetric apprearance of the breast with a focal area of increased in the upper lateral left breast without a defined wall may aspirated. Ultrasonography was obtained and in the area of the upper lateral left breast there is no ultrasonic demonstrable abnormality. The echogenicity of the breast parenchyma in this region looks similar to that in the inferior portion of the left breast. There are no suspicious calcifications. There is no definable mass seen in the right breast.  Impression: No significant definable abnormality with asymmetric residual fibroglandular breast parenchyma. Follow up with mammography of both breasts in 6 months is suggested to further evaluate stability. Birads: 3 If this were you would you consider this enough testing? I dont like the \"probably benign\" comment... What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance, Honoree Log in to post a reply",
