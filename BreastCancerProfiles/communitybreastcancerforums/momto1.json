Now of course that is good news to me but here is my dilemma...I went to get one because of telling my Dr. that I felt a lumpy area in my breast and he just sent me for a mammo anyway. He has never examined the area since I called him, although I just got my yrly gyno exam in Nov and he did a breast exam then and said he felt nothing palpable. My point is that during that exam he did not feel the breasts in any detail really so I would not think it was that accurate. Plus he has not really wanted to see me since I brought this up. I have heard tht ob/gyn drs really do not want to get involved with breast issues but anyway...do I just end this here or what? I am confused. I told the nurse at his office that I was not sure if the lumpy area I was feeling was normal or not for my breasts and I feel I need a \"professional\" opinion. she suggested me seeing a general surgeon...isn't that weird? She said it is because they would have to do any biopsies anyway and they could see if it needed to progress any further or not! CONFUSING!! I thought they would refer me for ultrasound but they have not. should I get an ultrasound? I am not sure what to do and now I feel like I am constantly anylyzing my breasts for whether they feel lumpy or not, etc and I have no idea what I am even feeling for anyway!! the report from the mammo said my breasts were \"fatty\" (is that a compliment) and they did not say anything about fybrocystic breats in the report but i was not even sure a mammo would diagnose that anyway. Also I am 38 and have no other visible symptoms of anything. I had a diagnostic mammogram and it was a digital one, which I have read is better for someone my age. momto1",

I am scheduled for a mammogram in a week. My ob/gyn just decided to send me for one since he said I have a family history (maternal aunt had bc). I have no other symptoms really other then one breast itches sometimes but not the left...and I have some breast achiness but usually before my period, which by the way is the time I felt the lump. He did not, however, exam me which I thought was weird but I am glad for the mammo anyway since I am a BIG worrier and I would want it done regardless. I am worried to death and cannot stop poking at that breast trying to feel it to see if it feels hard, soft whatever. there seems to be no real directed thing for lumps, some are soft and cancer and some are hard and cancer...very frustrating. I have rarely done b exams which I know is horrible and now I feel even more awful I never did them consistantly. I always get my yearly pap test and he examines them then but never in depth or anything. I am so worked up about it I can not stop thinking that I am going to not be around to see my daughter grow up, etc. She is 8. Anyway...I know you all must think I am a big wuss but I needed to vent somewhere and my husband is not the best person to vent to since he says...just wait for the results from the mammo and we will go from there. thanks for listening :) Log in to post a reply",

I am trying to get my mind off it until next week when I go to the mammo but you all know that is hard. I will let you know what ends up happening and I am sure I will have some other question anyway afterward. I know if someone tells me I have a mass  or uses that term I will probably faint and for sure throw up. My friend down the street had/has Stage 1 bc and she is 41. She is doing great and that is a nice reminder for me also and she knows a lot of stuff but is rather private person so I do not like to ask much about it and I have not told her my fears for not wanting to bring up her thing since it has been a year since she had reconstructive surgery and I think she is just trying to move on so to speak. I have these horrible thoughts which I know are crazy probably about Stage 4 and cancer spreading and then I was thinking about my aunt dying but that was in the late 70's and she was only in her late 40's! But I was wondering what kind of cancer must she have had to be gone at such a young age...it must have been really aggressive...guess they did not do much in the 70's though. anyway...I am going nuts again with these thoughts so I better go...thanks... momto1",

We do not have a breast cancer or other center such as that where I live so I guess that is why they are telling me to see the other guy. I actually have an appt with him and I guess I will just keep it and see what he says. I guess I also have the question that if they do not see anything on an mammo and nothing on an ultrasound then what would you do at that point?? Maybe he will do an exam and let me know what he thinks I am feeling? momto1",

I am in the process now of getting a lumpy area re-checked by a general surgeon since my ob/gyn pretty much washed his hands of the whole things after my recent mammo came back normal. I am actually thinking of chucking him altoogether as my doc because of his blase attitude about breast exams and health. I do not know if I have breast cancer or not but in reading this forum which is full of some really powerful women, I have learned a lot about bc and what happens everyday and we Do have to be our own advocate no matter WHAT the doc says and if we think something is wrong then we need to pursue it until we are satisfied with the results! He is always telling me to do self exams but never even tells you how or anything, no info, no demonstration. A majority of women do not even do exams and have no idea how to do them. I never knew the bc statistics for older women until recently and I bet if every woman knew them she would demand more education. momto1",
