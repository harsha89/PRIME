I was going to start a reverse bucket list thread since I probably won't reach my further bucket list goals in the future but it is SO good to remember the things I've already done that are bucket list worthy. Here goes, in no particular order: Go to a Duke basketball game in Cameron! DH and I did this and had fantastic seats next to the band with seats close to the action. Also had a tour behind the scenes and had a luncheon with some of the basketball staff before the game, including former players. Ride in an original Model A car. So much fun! Went to Disney World...the year it opened! Experienced Hale-Bopp comet. No other word than \"experienced\". I've been an avid sky watcher for decades, but this long term sky show was the most eerie feeling ever. (Second place goes to meteors that are big enough to make noise. Yep, I've seen and heard those too.) Watched a giraffe being born, live and in person at Natl Zoo, waaaaaay before internet star April was ever heard of. Rode a couple of laps around Charlotte Motor Speedway. So what if it was in a tour bus? It was awesome. I saw a ghost. Hard for me to believe too, considering my science background and skepticism. However, it's true. This was long before my mbc dx, but I wish I could see another one. I've got questions.",

At first it's creaky, hobbly, old-lady laps but it does smooth out if I keep going. I had to get 1 pound hand weights and do gentle arm and back exercises because, Lord knows I don't want to harm my weak vertebrae, but my muscles need to do something. Lynnwood, sending you good thought for your tests! Waving hi to all. It's sunny and bright here, at least for now. ",

I read it a lot when I was working but read it today from a different perspective. The Peace of Wild Things by Wendell Berry When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free. ",

At first, before any treatment, I went to another hospital for a second opinion and my onc was pleased that I did. I stayed with my first place after all. Once you feel like it, you might ask your current doctor a list of questions about treatment plans and whether you can have local treatment to your liver. Then take the same list to another doctor. Your current clinic will send your records ahead, with your permission. You may find, like I did, that both places would follow the same course. Maybe not. Then you decide.",

It wouldn't hurt to try ☺ \"To get your immune system working again, to bring those elusive WBC levels up is important to eat tryptophan rich foods which the body uses to make melatonin. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and one of the precursors to melatoninproduction. Increasing your intake of tryptophan-rich foods may boost melatonin levels. Some of the foods with the highest amount of tryptophan are spirulina, cottage cheese, chicken liver, pumpkin seeds, turkey, chicken watermelon seeds, almonds, peanuts, and yogurt. Garbanzo beans, however, win the tryptophan prize. They are loaded with free tryptophan (meaning it is not attached to a protein like in other foods) making the uptake of this source of tryptophan the best, and who doesn't love some chickpeas in a spicy tomato sauce with some chunks of chicken and green veggies?\" Edited to add link to the topic containing the post I quoted: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/772113?page=303#idx_9076",

I went once a week for ten consecutive weeks for taxol chemo. Then I started on Ibrance and Letrozole.

I agree with you completely that cancer happens to everyone, rich or not, and to our own doctors and their loved ones. They want to unlock it as much as we do. I don't believe in some shady element holding back cures or better treatments. As JFL said I'm worried that something old might be a big help but not many are looking at it because it's not a shiny new thing. Recently I've read of antabuse and statins as being interesting. I hope they will run those leads to the end. They may not be \"it\", but perhaps will lead to better things. There is a lot of money and brain power in this. I just pray the ones who decide where to use it choose wisely. I always like to read your posts.",

In my right arm and hand, I have a combination of neuropathy, lymphedema, joint pain and trigger fingers from letrozole, and perhaps some degree of carpal tunnel that was there before dx. The LE and neuropathy got very bad after taxol started and I have also noticed severe changes in my bicep especially. It's not exactly atrophy because I have used my arm as normally as possible throughout this...but...the muscle isn't in the same place as it was and it doesn't flex and lengthen as it did and as compared to the left arm. It was almost as if it had been torn, and it felt stringy, and had moved toward the inner part of my arm, yet I could still use it to some degree. Very distressing on top of everything else! Two or three months ago, I started using one- and two-pound hand weights again, trying to increase strength in my arms, chest, and upper back to support my spine which has mets and a compression fracture. These are gentle exercises but at first my 'bad' arm was just really awkward, although it would bend and lift in some fashion. Over the weeks it has gotten a little better and the muscle seems to be more in line with where it should be so I'm hopeful it will keep improving. It has been very weird and uncomfortable. ",

Yes I have liver mets ( I think I have four ) ,and I had some kind of lung involvement that seems much better now. I never got a very good explanation about the lung part of it and I'm deliberately not focusing on that other than reading the scan reports every three months or so. My breathing trouble is what led to my dx but it is SO much better now. Knock wood 😉 I'm sending you best wishes that they will soon get your liver straightened out and back on track! ",

I need to do better at fasting but at least I'm fasting at least 12 hours a day and often a little longer. The oxygen angle is intriguing. I still have my oxygen machine and some tanks. What do I do with them? Hmmmm. I'm looking forward to the tome you're going to post! Also sending all the best for you and for your focus on your family.",

I rarely watch movies but if I do, they are sci fi or comic book heroes because I like to escape from my all-to-real reality. I usually watch certain cooking, craft, sewing, travel (like Rick Steves) shows and sports. Tennis is my fave so I've been very keen on Wimbledon these last two weeks. Of course soccer and tour de France are going and there's usually a baseball game! I love watching the skill and grit from the pros!

KatyK, during the bone scan it is so hard to lie still for so long with that box just millimeters from your face to start with. I always plot a story the day before and spend the scan time 'inside my head' and mentally develop the characters and write the story. Even if I never put any of it down on paper, it's a pleasant way to pass half an hour. I shamelessly use a character from books I've read and see if I can weave a tale that would be believable. I like old fashioned mysteries, usually set in small villages, and it's entertaining to build and populate my own! It helps pass the time and is usually calming.",

My better nature agrees with the doctors who don't want their colleagues on boards and sometimes getting hundreds of thousands of dollars. The little gibbering part of me, deep inside is constantly whimpering 'I'm dying of cancer. I'm DYING of cancer! Do something. Do ANYTHING! Now now now now now...' Still, the old conflict is that maybe these experts can steer the resources in the right direction, but when might that moment come when the dollar signs cause them to divert away from a future cure to something less promising, perhaps when they don't even realize it? On the other hand this set up may have led to Ibrance, etc, but it also may have squashed something better. I hate to think a cure might not get the attention or that they might not fine tune existing treatments for better results and QOL because...where's the money in that? It's complicated. Katty, very interesting trial. I hope it continues to be so tolerable and that it will be extremely effective. I look forward to reading your posts about it. ",
