Today I saw the surgeon to discuss the report and to have my breast checked due to excessive bruising. The report says: \u201cmultiple cores of breast tissue show columnar cell hyperpalsia with atypia (ADH). Foci of microcalcifications are associated with the ADH\u201d. Is this ADH or is it columnar cell hyperplasia? I was under the impression that CCH was a benign finding? I didn\u2019t direct this question to the surgeon because she was explaining what ADH means and why we need to remove more tissue to be sure nothing else is lurking. I took my copy of the report and went home. I\u2019m now reading it over and feeling confused. Has anyone else has this type of path report? And if so, did you have a surgical biopsy following the core biopsy because of it? Thank you.

I did message her via the patient portal so maybe she can clarify. I just want to understand what is going on so I can assess my risk factor. Each of my mom\u2019s 3 sisters had BC and all of her 6 siblings died of some form of cancer, however my mom refuses to attend to breast or gyn health so I need to make sure I stay on top of my screenings and risk factors. I noticed your diagnosis and surgeries are pretty recent, so I hope you\u2019re doing OK. Looks like it was caught early so I hope you\u2019re over the worst of it. Wishing you the best",

      "Content": "TheresaNJ08 wrote: Hi all, 52 year old post-menopausal woman, not new to call backs on my mammos due to dense breast tissue and 2 prior implant surgeries. But this time I am scheduled for a stereotactic biopsy on the right breast on 2/28/19 for a fairly big area of microcalcifications that were described to me as pleomorphic. This area of calcs has shown up since 2010 but apparently either due to evolving changes in the area or the advancements in 3D mammos, the radiologist and breast surgeon think it warrants the biopsy now. My question is, has anyone had the prone position stereotactic biopsy done with subpecoralsilicone implants? I did go for a \"table check\" yesterday to make sure that the area could be viewed and targeted properly. I was told it was fine. I'm just really worried about puncture and healing issues. I am also worried about the pain involved in the procedure. I have read everything from \"it was not bad\" to \"it was torture\" so any input would be appreciated. I am contemplating using an anti anxiety medication prior to help settle my nerves. Thank you in advance for any input.

Also the fact that I had gone in for a \"table check\" really helped since I was familiar with the pre-procedure activities. I did take a .25mg xanax prior to take the edge off. I'm now icing as directed and starting to feel the lidocaine wearing off. Hopefully in 3-5 days the results will be benign. 👍🤞🙏",

I am now being scheduled for a surgical biopsy to retrieve a larger sample to rule out DCIS definitively. My surgeon was very encouraging that the chance of being \"upstaged\" is only about 10%, so I feel pretty good about that.👍 Best wishes! ❤",
