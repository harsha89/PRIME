I had my first appt with the BS on Friday.  She was absolutely incredible and put my mind at ease.  She said that, as cancer biology goes, mine is excellent (ER/PR +, Her2 -, well differentiated, MBR of 4/9 which is low grade.)  Due to the holidays, I'll probably have to wait until January for surgery.  I meet with my MO and another BS next week. Meantime, I'm struggling with the decision between UMX or BMX.  My \"good\" breast (R) is dense and lumpy.  They had been focusing on it last year due to microcalcs.  It also has a papilloma that they say is benign.  My last mammo (a year ago) on my cancer breast (L) was clear, only to find 1 year later that a 2.3 cm IDC was present and DCIS of 6 cm.  My BS said that cancer can be lurking for years and years, so if that is the case, it concerns me that nothing was seen a year ago. I have no risk factors, and this was a complete surprise out of the blue.  It makes me feel positive that something is lurking the my good/R breast.   I'm leaning toward BMX so that I don't have to worry about what they may find in the future.  I know it is a personal decision, but is there any advice you can give? Also, I've been told that all women have a 13% chance of getting BC.  Women who have had it have a 20-25% chance they will get it again.  Do you know what this percent drops to if there are no breasts?  I know there will be a little remaining breast tissue, but most of it will be gone. Thanks again for your help! Robin",

It was not something I felt, but then I have dense breast tissue and the always feel a little suspicious. An MRI on 11/2 found IDC of 2.3 cm and DCIS with the total area involved being 6.3cm. For sure it means a single mast. Trying to decide on the double. It is ER+/HER2-. I had no risk factors and no fam hist so this came as a complete surprise. I never thought I would hear the C word and now that I have, I'm certain I'll here it's in my other breast some day (already have micro calcifications and a benign papilloma on the good side) so why not just take them both off now and be done with it? After all, I'm almost 50 and my kids are grown. The only thing in the back of my mind holding me back is that I'd love to have some sensation left in my chest is you know what I mean. Aside from that big question, I'd like to know if I'm doing this right. I've already seen the PS but it took 2 weeks to get an appt with the BS. I see her this fri. When should I see the MO? I figured it would be after because she guides post surgical treatment options, but now I'm wondering if I should have already scheduled this. I hope this doesn't delay my surgery. Lastly, I really hope they can get me scheduled for surgery within 3 weeks because I just want this thing OUT! I'll just cry if they say I'll have to wait longer than that. How long did you have to wait between dx and surgery? What other test, if any, will they need to do? It's been extremely helpful to read about everyone's experiences on this site. Thank you for your insight into my situation and any guidance you can provide! Dx 11/2/2012, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
