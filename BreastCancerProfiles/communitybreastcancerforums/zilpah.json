Every doctor on their panel of experts should be asked to speak to this topic. We should be writing letters and sending petitions to our lawmakers and our hospitals. We should petition the insurance companies to join us in this. It will certainly cost them less to help us gain acces to investigational drugs than it will to pay for our palliative care and our hospices.",

Why are they still conducting placebo trials on humans with advanced breast cancer? Don't we all know what happens anyway when you don't treat advanced metastatic cancer? You Die! Why aren't they using updated statistical models that don't require the use of placebos?",

Shouldn't we be demanding more from the government, our doctors and the drug companies if we have advanced disease?  Why don't we have the right to try out investigational drugs if we have no other options available to us? Why do we need to have measurable disease to qualify for trials? Why are the doctors telling us NOT to resect tumors so we can have measurable disease in order to join trial? Why can't they set up parallel trials for patients who have had tumors resected and are NED?  Why doesn't our survival and longevity matter?   Log in to post a reply",

My amazing oncologist has had Oncotech testing done for me and I believe that it has helped me make treatment decisions. Interestingly enough, other esteemed oncologists have given me grief about even bothering with having the oncotech testing done! and these are the same people who have told me to not even bother to biopsy a recurrence and definitely not even bother to resect it! they would rather that I just let the tumor keep growing and join one of their clinical trials! And if I join their trial and end up getting a placebo then so be it! So what if I am not even 35 yrs old and have littel babies at home! So what if I have the most aggressive type of br. cancer out there? And how dare I even question their judgement! Have they become so desensitized to our suffering? Again you have to wonder, do they even realize that we are people and not lab rats? Do they truly just want to recruit patients for their trials without considering what are the best options for that patient? Is this more about their egos than about greed or money? Are they just vying to have their names appear first in the New England Journal of Medicine? By the way, I know I am not allowed to name names on this forum BUT boy would you be suprised to know how esteemed some of these doctors are. Again I feel I need to say that all of these issues need to be presented to the panel of experts that oversee this website. If topics like this are not front and center then what is the point anyway?",
