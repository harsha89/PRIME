They cut out about the size of a tangerine.  It was and still is very painful. During the first 2 weeks of my radiation they kept adjusting , trying to get more radiation in my lung in case any cancer cells got away.   I never had nipple pain, swelling , thickening , and so painful before the radiation started. I feel that my nipple is being fried. I am in so much pain today that im afraid to have the rest of my treatments if it continues to get worse.  Can't imagine this being cancer again. I have 6 treatments left and have been counting the days to having this over with.  I just don't know if I can handle more pain.",

I have been using Aloe and Glaxal cream and also polysporin on the end of my nipple because it is really red and painful. Helps a little , but my clothes rubbing makes it worse.  I seen the Oncologist today and he said this could be pre cancer   because most women don't have this kind of pain and problem with the nipple and so soon after the treatment started . Has anyone else out there had really bad pain and swelling with their nipple. I am really worried . Log in to post a reply",
