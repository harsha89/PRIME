I was diagnosed in late April with ILC in my right breast and then added an ILC diagnosis in the left breast and at least one left lymph node in May after an MRI and second biopsy. I also found out I have the BRCA2 gene mutation. Needless to say, I am having a bmx on June 30th with left axillary dissection and right sentinel node biopsy with tissue expanders inserted as well. (Pretty sure I don't have all of the lingo down yet.) Since my diagnosis, I have been keeping super busy - youngest daughter graduated from high school, graduation party, college orientation, wrapping up work projects, etc. I have generally been avoiding thinking about cancer, surgery or all of the coming nastiness. But now that all of the fun stuff is over, reality is hitting me in the face. In general, I'm a pretty practical, organized person, but after looking at the \"preparing for surgery\" thread, I'm pretty sure I'm totally unprepared. I haven't gathered anything it looks like I'll need and not sure where exactly to start - guessing I will be winging it a lot. Anyway, trying to handle it all with as much strength as possible and not breakdown emotionally. I want my kids to continue on with their summer and college plans - I don't want anyone sitting around feeling sorry for me. It's just not what I was expecting at the empty nest stage of my life. Take care of yourselves! ",

They did see a patch of degeneration on my spine, most likely osteoarthritis. No immediate worries and just a reminder that I am getting old! I started chemo yesterday and posted more details in the August 2017 chemo thread (for anyone starting chemo in August, you might want to join that thread as well, if you haven't already). Anyway, chemo itself went well but I started having stomach issues just a few hours afterwards and through the night. Have a feeling that I'm going to be dealing with a lot of GI issues during chemo. Still having pain, so thinking of pursuing some accupuncture and meeting with the pain management doctor. illimae - Sorry to hear that you still have a drain. That's rough. I really hope you don't have to have another special drain put in :( Hope everyone has a good day!  ",

I'm not sure what drug I will be taking after chemo, since I'm on the cusp of menopause - no period since February. But I'm also BRCA2 positive and will have to get my ovaries out at some point anyway. I feel much better today. A little queasy this morning but overall pretty good. I sent an email yesterday that I wanted to meet with a pain management specialist, and they scheduled an appointment for me today. They are wonderful about coordinating care and getting scheduled ASAP. Met with him today and he was wonderful. He specializes in cancer pain management, and spent an hour an a half with me, talking about all of the different treatment options. He believes in Post mx pain syndrome and said he would not give up. So it was a huge relief to find another awesome doctor!! Been pretty emotional today for some reason - lots of weeping. My baby daughter will be heading off to college for the first time in a couple of weeks. She has been my personal cook, driver, shopper and Netflix mate. I'm just so sad but trying to hide it from her because I don't want her to worry or change her plans. I want her to move forward with her life. It just stinks!! Thanks for letting me vent. ",

The first 10 days post surgery were a horror show for me, but my drains were removed on Monday (no pain at all during removal), and I'm finally starting to feel better. Pathology showed 3 positive lymph nodes, so moving on to chemo next. The good news is that they did not think I would need radiation after chemo, so hopefully treatments will be done by the end of the year. Met with the oncologist on Monday and will be starting the AC - T protocol. A number of people have mentioned this protocol in this forum, so it's good to know that it sounds pretty standard. The main issue I am facing - and I'm wondering if anyone else is having or had the same issue two weeks out from surgery - is nerve pain. I had skin sparing surgery, and every nerve on my chest feels like it is on FIRE. Also, my armpits and the back of my arms are numb but hurt at the same time. It is soooo hard to describe to people - how can it be numb and hurt at the same time??!! I don't know if this is normal or unusual. The PA said it takes time for all of the nerves to \"settle\" back down but didn't say how long before I can expect relief. All I can say is thank goodness for my wonderful Mother, who has been here since before my surgery and been the best nurse anyone could ask for. I am certainly blessed in that regard :) Hope everyone has a good day!   ",

So, I emailed the Physician's Assistant and asked again why radiation was not indicated. She is very good about returning emails. She emailed me back and said that the pathology didn't fit the radiation criteria: tumor sizes less then 5 cm; less than 4 positive lymph nodes; clear margins. At 8 p.m. that same night, she emailed me again and said she was going to consult with the surgeon, so she was obviously thinking about it still. Anyway, she called me this morning and apologized. Long story short, the surgeon said I should be referred to the RO for consult due to the pathology, my age and BRCA+. Not that I want radiation, but I want to be sure I'm addressing everything appropriately and have all of the facts to make good decisions. Lesson learned - make sure to ask questions and understand the recommendations. Misbehaving - my nerve pain sounds a lot like your pain. It hasn't improved any but I had to stop taking the pain meds because they were giving me the worse case of constipation. I did find a front zip sports bra at Walmart that seems to help somewhat, I think because it limits fabric from touching the skin....whatever works, I guess. I can't take anything but Tylenol for now, since I'm having a port put in next week. Don't know if it's an option, but I wish they would have put the port in during the original surgery instead of having to go through another procedure. :( My PS did not say anything about lotion for scaring but I know he opens the same scar to replace the TEs later. I am seeing him on Monday though and will ask. Hang tough!  ",

I had shingles when I was pregnant with my son, and it feels like the same excruciating pain along the nerves. Gabapentin is what they prescribe for shingles, so it's the same concept, I think. Everyone keeps saying it's normal and will fade over time, but it only seems to impact some and not others. I saw the plastic surgeon today for my first TE fill, and he was not helpful. I am seeing oncologist tomorrow for chemo training and am going to ask if they can provide some solutions. I read somewhere that rubbing a soft piece of flannel against the skin might help, so I'm going to try that tonight.",

Since I was having such bad nerve pain, I told the oncologist that I wasn't going to start chemo until I felt better because I couldn't image adding the Chemo SEs on top of the pain. That seemed to motivate them, and they talked with the surgeon and put me on Gabapentin (Neurontin). The pain is not entirely gone, but it has helped dull the pain at least. If this does not work, then they will refer me to an in-house pain management specialist. I'm also going to look into acupuncture, since a friend at work told me it helped with her neuropathy pain. I had a bone scan yesterday, and I got a bad feeling from it. After the scan, I thought I was good to go and then they made me come back in and take more pictures in my mid-section area. The technician was also acting different towards me, so I have a feeling she saw something bad on the scan. So now I'm waiting to get the results, which could take up to three business days. I posted this in the August Chemo thread, but I wanted to pass along in this thread as well, since a number of us will be starting chemo. In one of the other chemo forums, I saw this tip. I can't remember which forum though. There is a website, www.breastcancerfreebies.com where you can order some free things like a headwrap, hats, Quesy Pops, etc. I ordered a few things, so I'll let you know if/when I receive them. The other site I saw in a thread was Sparkling Earth Products at www.sparklingearth.com They have very reasonably priced skull caps - the caps in the Clearance section are around $5.95 with some cute patterns like plaids and florals as well as solid colors.. There is a section of hair loss caps too. At those low prices, I ordered a few. Will let you know how they fit when I receive them. Anyway, thought I would pass along the finds to everyone. Hope everyone is having a good evening!",

My daughter has convinced me to color my shoulder length hair a cool color before it falls out - like maybe a deep purple or pink. May as well do something fun and cheery with it before it's gone. btw, I forgot to post a discount code I found for Sparkling Earth - FACEBOOK10. I used it and got 10% off my order. I do plan to go bald sometime too - my husband and I can be twins!",
