And I didn't get sick, big plus.   They feel like they were able to remove the whole mass.  Dr. Lindsey also commented that the radiologist and him both agreed that the core biopsy in Madison did indeed miss the mass.  I guess they determined that by viewing the mammograms that were taken after the core biopsy.  So he reassured me that this was the best option to remove it all and get definite results.  They sent me home with ace bandages wrapped around my chest, I was supposed to leave them on until 8:00 pm. but I couldn't stand it anymore, they were carving my armpits, so I took them off at 6:30 and put on a supportive sports bra, which I'm supposed to wear for one week, 24-7.I fell asleep at 7p.m. in the recliner and slept until 8a.m. this morning.  Not much pain yesterday or last night, but I sure am sore today.   It is about a 2 inch incision near my left armpit.  I go for a check up and I'm assuming to get my results next Tuesday at 4:15.The waiting game is almost over.   Thanks for all the words of encouragement and support. ",
