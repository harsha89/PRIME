My bridge have started to break. I need to get my dental work done, but don't want to delay my cancer treatment.  What does everyone think? Should I do it before cancer treatment or after?

While searching online I came across this CO2 laser surgery options that is completely outpatient. It seems like a good option; given the fact that you do not need to check into the hospital but there isn't too much information about it out there. Does anyone have any experience with this surgery or knows someone who had it done? The doctors name is Dr. Vincent Ansanelli - does anyone know anything about him? Any information will be helpful and appreciated. Thank you in advance for everyone's help. Log in to post a reply",
