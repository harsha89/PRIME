The thing that really worked for me, which I wish I had discovered sooner, was sweet potatoes. They almost completely obliterated my nausea, and after eating a few bites of sweet potato, I was able to eat anything else I wanted. I don't know if the food taste thing is a side effect of nausea or if the chemo also has a direct effect on the taste buds - it may be both. Hang in there, it'll pass... Best, Summer ",
