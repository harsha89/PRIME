Whatever is going to be will be.. I just really hope it turns out to be nothing. I can tell you that i've been having discharge when i squeeze my nipple too. Like a greenish, yellowish, clear, and it's very oily. All the docs and np i've seen so far say, that there not worried about it because it's not coming out spuratically. But then again i havn't been getting the greatest care and am still trying to. I do hope that's not the case for you Tigger. Pejkug, it's really scarry to me that the discharge was your only symptom before you were diagnosed with IDC and it's only one of my symptoms of a few, and they tell me that they are not conserned. I wish i could be blessed with the type of docs that you ladies have been blessed with. Good luck tomarrow Tigger.. I wish you nothing but the best news wich is no bad news at all! Try and get some sleep darlin. WeeSee",
