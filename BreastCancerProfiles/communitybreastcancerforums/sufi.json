      "Content": "sufi wrote: I completed simulation and start treatment on Monday. Turning my head to side and lying on my belly causes pain in my neck. I have arthritis in my neck and a tendency to develop neck muscle spasms that can freeze my neck. I am concerned that my neck will freeze on me during the course of treatment. I had chosen the 6 week course of treatment, because I felt the more gradual dose would be better for my body. However, with my neck concern, I have opted to doing it in 4 weeks. I know I could switch to radiation lying on my back if necessary. So, it wouldn't be the end of the world if my neck froze on me. Just wondering if anyone else has faced this challenge. Haven't found that anyone has written about this anywhere. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Just speaking to her was very helpful. I will see her tomorrow. I got an order for PT today, although it was a tiny bit of a struggle but not too bad. Also, I figured out some self-talk that is helping me relax my neck more, so all in all I'm feeling more hopeful. Thanks again! ",

Saw the physical therapist and she referred me to person for cranial sacral massage. It released so much of pressure that had built up in my neck. I will continue with her and am feeling like I can get through this!!",
