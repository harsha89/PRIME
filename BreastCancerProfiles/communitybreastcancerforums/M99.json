I had a lumpectomy and will now continue Taxol in much smaller doses (once a week over 9 weeks) minus the steroid Decadron. The Decadron caused neuropathy and elevated blood sugar--borderline diabetic condition. After my first cycle of the new dosage, I feel fine. To fight the muscle and bone pain, the doctor has me taking 10 grams of l-glutamine powder in drinks three times a day for three days after treatment. You can get it without a prescription.",
