I had expanders placed when I had bilateral mastectomies done in October. I was fully expanded, then deflated for radiation one side and then they tried to re expand. The non radiated side was perfect but the radiated side was excruciatingly painful. The PS has advised that I have a capsular contracture, which is a common complication with radiation. So I was faced with a choice. I can opt to have the expander replaced with the addition of cadaver skin for support, knowing that there is a 40-50% chance f failure/complication. I can get what he really wants to do, which is a LD Flap. Or I can go in and have the expanders removed altogether and move on. I have struggled with back and shoulder issues since surgery I and radiation so the LD Flap is NOT an option I am willing to consider. I am struggling with buy image at the moment so I have chosen to give the expander swap a try but, should it fail, I will just have them removed and move on. The comments on this page have been very helpful in relieving my anxieties about the very real possibility that I will be living my life with a flat chest, so thank you ladies for your input!!",
