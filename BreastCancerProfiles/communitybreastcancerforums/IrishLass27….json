I haven't finished the antibiotics for the chest infection so I'm reluctant to go back to the docs until I have them finished. Doctor also said he wasn't concerned re. the armpit pain. Also I don't think I mentioned previously but I am only 22.",

I found a lump and went to the doctor who prescribed me Augmentin to treat it as he diasgnosed it as a cyst. He told me to return if the pain had not subsided and he would send me for a mammogram. Anyway, pain and lump went away so didn\u2019t go back. I have a very bad chest infection this week and I\u2019ve been getting severe pain under my arm and in my shoulder on the same side that the cyst was on. No apparent lumps or bumps and pain feels achey, like muscular pain. Everyone is telling me that it is probably glands from my chest infection and indeed maybe sore muscles. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe the cyst and this pain could be related? There is no pain in my breast at all at present just my armpit and shoulder. I am a really bad hypochondriac so indeed I could be overthinking and I am sorry for rambling. Many thanks x Log in to post a reply",
