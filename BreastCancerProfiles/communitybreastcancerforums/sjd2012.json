I do not want to worry about my other breast and want to avoid radiation at all costs. This is my second cancer in two years. First time for breast. A total of three surguries in two years and now more to come. can anyone please tell me recovery time for bilateral and reconstruction immediately following? Just my oppinion, but in my situation where l am constantly dealing with stress(major) and have a husband who is not supportive, can this contribute to cancer? I believe in my heart it does. Unfortunately when it rains it pours. I realy don't want to deal with another cancer after this. This is why l am choosing to remive both breasts and not one. Thank you for listening.",

It's ironic really, I just wanted a breast reduction not a complete amputation of my breasts. Should I decide to choose this option I will probably have a bilateral is well. reconstruction right after surgery. I know in my heart that a breast doesn't define who I am, but the pain is still there. Thank you for your response.",

Apparently, this is uncommon. Because they have discovered it this way there are no margins no base line and my choices are to have a mastectomy with radiation. not much of a choice is it. It's only my rIght breast. Since my breaSt reduction of 7 weekS ago, both breast have been infected both very red and warm to the touch. My question is has anyone here been diagnosed after a breast reduction and if so what are your choices? I'm devastated to say the least. I am having an MRI and diagnostic mammogram next week. Apparently, even if both tests are negative they have to treat it aggressively. I am very confused and scared. I welcome your comments. Thank you.",
