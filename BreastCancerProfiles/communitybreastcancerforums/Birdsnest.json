I've been waiting for a while to get my by biopsy date after a suspicios mammogram. I am happy that I have a date, but it falls on the day before the period starts (my body works pretty much like a clock), so my breasts will be super tender and swollen. And still hurting from the almost 2 weeks old mammogram.. I am getting another mammo followed by core needle biopsy and I am trying to figure out in how much pain I'm going to be. As is, just from the diagnostic mammo I have hard time when my kids lean on my breasts and pain in the armpit. Wondering if you were in a similar situation - having biopsy when your dense larg-ish breasts are the most sensitive. How was the healing process? When were you back to normal and not twiching in pain each time your breasts touch something? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
