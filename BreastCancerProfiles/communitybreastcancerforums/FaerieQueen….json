You keep me going. A long time ago I made a post about the Kanzius Machine and what it could mean for all cancer patients, including breast cancer. Dr. Stephen Curley worked with the machine's inventor, john Kanzius, when John was losing his own fight with cancer. Dr. Curley promised John that he would see the machine through to human trials. The time for human trials has finally come, though they will begin in Italy. Treatment in the machine will be an experience similar to a bone scan given to those of us with bone mets. No pain, no toxicity, and no side effects. It could be the cure or at least truly make the disease manageable & not life-threatening.

Yep, with all the research I did on LE, I knew about water's importance, but my leg lymphodema made my right leg over 1.5 times the circumference of my left leg--flat out scary. My right trouser leg above the knee was tight by 4:00PM, and I couldn't really bend my knee. My home is a split-level; steps were a nightmare. I had to off-load fluid. I couldn't even get my physical therapist to do drainage massage because, she said, I had cancer and she didn't want to take a chance on causing it to move around. I never deny myself water when I'm thirsty, but I used to have a water bottle in my hand all the time. No more--except in really hot weather when I'm sweating a lot. Truly, there is a water balance a person has to get to where lymphedema's concerned.",

I had to figure out what was going on myself; LE wasn't even on my onc's or physical therapist's radar. Since no lymph nodes were removed, they thought, how could it be LE? However, the lymph system is pretty delicate and easily damaged from the rads. I teach and standing most of my day made my leg get huge above the knee by the afternoon. I was miserable. Eventually, I hit on 2 solutions that got results. I couldn't afford compression stockings so I went to WalMart and got a pair of spandex leggings that went to the ankle and put them on first thing each morning and wore them all day. Then after I came home, I would elevate my leg and do massage on it, stroking from the knee to the groin. I also made sure not to drink a ton of fluid during the day like I normally would; the recommended 64 ounces was my limit. Very gradually, the swelling receded. The second thing I now do which is so incredibly helpful with lymphodema and pain is water-walking. I get into a swimming pool every chance I get for at least 30 minutes and take a \"hike\" in water that's about 2 inches above my waist. The even pressure of the water moves the lymph fluid out of the affected areas while also getting rid of the pain caused to my joints from the anti-hormonal I'm on. My hospital has recently joined the Star Program, a water therapy protocol for cancer patients. I rarely need even an ibuprofen anymore. By the way, it took me months to get the LE under control, but it was eventually. Don't give up.",

I managed to connect with my onc's nurse and she told me that the specialty pharmacy I will get this through is actually taking charge of the appeal and has started the wheels rolling. I don't know why my treatment history and my BC type isn't showing under my first post, but this would be a fifth line treatment for me. I've already been on the Afinitor/Aromasin combo, so I agree that the expense shouldn't be an issue. July 6th will mark my 5 year anniversary, and my goal is to be around for the Kanzius Machine's treatment. It's starting human trials in Italy this spring, & if it works as well as it did in the animal trials, it's \"game over\" for cancer. However, it will still be a few years out probably. I want to do everything in my power to make sure I get there in the best shape possible. Again, your support means a lot!",

I found that with the letrozole I would cycle through side effects. Hair loss was one of my SEs. The most shedding I had was a few months after I started the letrozole; after that, it was much less, but still noticeable to me. My hairdresser was much more positive about what he saw going on with me than I was, but the times when I'd cycle back into my hair loss SE, I thought the hair loss became much lighter. Also, the hair always came back in; I had no permanent loss. Since I've been switched to Faslodex, the hair loss cycling seems to have stopped. I never tried biotin although I have seen others remark about it on this site. Do a search here on \"biotin\" and I bet you'll quickly find some good info. As to your other issue, make sure you are drinking A LOT of water. That's what has always worked best for me. Best wishes to you!",

The second link, a video, was produced by the Kanzius Research Foundation (now defunct because they reached their funding-for-research goals), and explains the technology of it very well. The story about how John Kanzius and Dr. Curley met purely by chance (not included in these two links) reveals how pure chance can create momentous changes.
