I couldn't keep up my brave front for the kids so it helped to go for long walks.  My mind kept racing and I had so much anxiety.  So, I wore headphones and blasted inspirational music in my ears while waiting during the  many appointments.  And I spent time on this website learning from all the super amazing ladies here.  I was considered stage 2 at the time so had surgery and then started chemo and then had radiation.   But, I guess things changed in treatment so maybe if I was diagnosed now, they may have shrunk the tumors first with chemo and then had surgery.   I had two tumors of 2 cm or so each and whole breast full of DCIS so I didn't actually have a choice about lumpectomy or mastectomy.  But, I have friends who had have each .  I chose bilateral mastectomy .  My other breast was totally clear so I could have kept it.  It's really an individual decision.  There are many terms to learn.... but hopefully you'll have awesome doctors.  And the American Cancer society representative was really helpful to me too when I had questions.  And this website. take good care,blessings and prayers, Wendy",

I overheard him saying.... \" just get us a surgery date for tomorrow.\"   It scared the crap out of me because it made me feel like I was really in bad shape but at least he shortened the time I had to wait.  He told me that his own daughter had breast cancer at age 33 ( she's fine now) .  I was  39 at diagnosis.  It was a scary time... I'm praying that all this is caught really early for ya ... in my case... they didn't want to do mammo earlier than 40 as I had no family history... if I had it done at maybe 35 or 36 would have been much earlier stage... but that's water under the bridge.... I pray you have awesome docs and great care and good support... speedy surgery and recovery.... and hopefully no chemo... I had to do that and rads... not fun but doable.  prayers and blessings, Wendy",

BC.org has been an enormous blessing to me too.  Met so many wonderful friends and did treatment together.  The ladies here have always been so encouraging and yet willing to tell me \" like it is.\"     May you and all our wonderful sisters here have many more healthy days, years, decades.

I guess I came on BC.org and gained encouragement often and I took a break from some obligations and I also attended a breast cancer recovery retreat here in Wisconsin.  I think the retreat helped so much as I spent 4 days with other survivors on an island and we did stuff like throw stones in Lake Superior to cast away some of our fears.  I wish I could say every day has been wonderful since then but I'd be lying.  But, now three years after diagnosis I can tell that my life is changing and I'm moving on a little bit more.  We're thinking of moving-- it's not something I would have even considered a year ago.  I'll pray for you and your family.  Life is so hard especially with the added things of illnesses in our families besides us having had breast cancer.  I pray that you'll have some time to relax and regroup and for joy and peace during the holiday season.  blessings, Wendy",
