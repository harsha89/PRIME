The other day I was looking at the craft section at Walmart and thought....these quilt block thingies are sure fun! I took a large one home and realized it was the perfect size for wearing! So then I went back and got a bunch of fun ones!! Pretty ones, ninja turtles, wonder woman....I'm sure they thought I was making one weird quilt!! Lol! I also have a wig I wear if I have to go somewhere nice or if I just feel like dressing up that day. I have taken a step and really just done what makes ME feel good inside. I'm not one to have people look at me....now they do. But I try to look back and smile!!! Weird....but I'm gaining self esteem in the weirdest ways. This is a bizarre journey for sure...",
