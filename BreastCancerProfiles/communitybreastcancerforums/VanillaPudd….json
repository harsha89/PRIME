Here is some of the pathology from my Fibroadenomas: Apocrine Metaplasia, Moderate Usual Ductal Hyperplasia, Sclerosing Adenosis, all making them Complex. I also have: Extrememly Dense breasts < than 90%!!!, Diffusely prominent Ductal pattern, Segmentally dialated ducts, simple cysts, complicated debris filled cysts, septated, clustered, and bilobed and complicated multiloculated septated cysts, nipple discharge and a constant changing nipple.  It is growing.  So basically my breasts are very busy.  I currently have 30+ cysts and 4 Fibroadenomas on the right, and 25+ cysts and 2 Fibroadenomas on the left.  3 of the (suspected) Fibroadenomas are new since November.  My twin sister just had a Mastectomy in January due to all kinds of atypia, ADH, ALH, FEA, and PASH.  Everything I have is benign.  I just happen to have every single benign issue it seems.  Clearly I am progressing downhill, just not sure how to stop it.  I think my next step should be 1.) Biopsies x 3      then 2.) after final pathology, regardless what is says schedule at least 1 excisional biopsy.  I just want complete pathology,  not just a sample.  ",
