I had swelling in the breast (the right breast just looked like it was saggy) and I just thought it was due to ageing and large breasts, I was 46 at diagnosis. I work at a hospital and mentioned the swelling/sagging to my friend and she said it was not a good sign and insisted that I get it looked at. The mammo did not show anything but an ultrasound of the axilla showed a tumor in the lymph node. They could not see the breast tumor until they knew it was there. I now have LE after surgery. My new moto, do not ignore anything.",
