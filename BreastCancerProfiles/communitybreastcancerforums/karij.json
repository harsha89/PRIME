I have not been genetically tested for any genes assoc. with breast cancer and really do not know yet if I want too. My mom has been diagnosed with and has stage IV ductal carcinoma estrogen receptor positive. It spread from her breast to her back-thoracic spine area. She has been alive and it has been about approx. 6 years. She has a chrome cobalt brace inside of her that a wonderful doctor, Dr. Nockles at Loyola bulit for her and it is because of him that she is more mobile. I have never had this pain before as far as I know, but maybe I am just more alert, starting to pay attention to my body more because of my mom's situation. I have pain in my breasts. I understand that it is normal to have pain in your breast at different times during your cycle. My question is when exactly or approx. during your menses cycle - which phase - is it normal or common to have pain; and to what extent is common or average pain? Also, how far up or when in the breast is this average pain? I do not notice any lumps or anything like that. My periods are regular these days unlike never before (I do have a seizure disorder - myoclonic epilepsy), but my temperatures are usually not high. I understand that my body has other issues, but what scares me the most is the pain that I get when I have this breast pain is that it goes up into my armpit. Is this common when we have breast pain during our cycle? It is like by my lymph nodes, tender all around the breast closer to the armpit. I have gone for a mammogram before and all was ok. I do not go for another one until I am age 40. I can say when I have the pain it is for a few days off and on during the month. I do have chronic back pain, but I was in a car accident. I have a pinched nerve. This was 10 years ago. Log in to post a reply",
