The very next morning, I went in to be told that what I had did not look like a cyst or a fibroadenoma. The radiologist couldn't give me a straight answer. He believed it may not be cancer because it didn't look aggressive, but he wasn't sure. He requested that I had a lumpectomy because it looked like a Phyllodes tumor which cannot be confirmed with a biopsy. I met with a surgeon the next Tuesday and he scheduled my lumpectomy that Friday. In less than three weeks, I have found a lump, received an ultrasound, and a lumpectomy which confirmed a Phyllodes tumor. I will found out my results this Thursday of if the tumor is cancerous or not. The doctors seemed hopeful because of my age, but what worries me was how fast everything moved. I try to talk to my family and friends, but they tell me to be patient. I know Phyllodes tumors are very rare and I have not seen a lot about them online. I am curious about others with similar situations. Surgery 10/16/2015 Lumpectomy: Left Log in to post a reply",
