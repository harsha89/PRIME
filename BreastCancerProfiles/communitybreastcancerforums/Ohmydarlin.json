My MO didn't think we should jump back to chemo so she added Perjeta to Herceptin, dropped Tamoxifen and replaced it with Arimidex.  I have been fortunate to have no side effects since adding Perjeta. At this time a PET hasn't been scheduled so fingers crossed the changes are working!!",

At the time (2013) it was first visible on PET/CT, my MO dropped Tamoxifen and added Arimidex. She also added Perjeta to Herceptin. In December the uptake was stable so she recommended spot radiation. One dose of radiation was done in December. Last week I had another PET/CT. The initial spot is still visible but the uptake is around 3. There is new uptake on L5...barely lit up. MO said it is unremarkable. The other new spot is in my left breast...uptake 2.5. This is the opposite breast from initial diagnosis. MO ordered mammogram and ultrasound of left breast. The radiologist feels it is fat necrosis. I was given the option of imaging again in 6 months or biopsy. I chose to wait the 6 months. Of course if I notice any change I will contact them immediately. Here is my question....MO isn't changing my treatment. Is there the possibility of improvement to the areas of concern without changing anything?
