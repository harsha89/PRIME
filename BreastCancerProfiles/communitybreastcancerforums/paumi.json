Basically im 24 years old and can remember always having really sore breasts a couple of weeks before I start my period which last for a week and then go away. I have also got a couple of sore lumps in my left breast which I have had checked out twice in the past and have been told they are just fat nodules. The thing is that within the past year my grandmother and my dads sister have both been diagnosed with breast cancer and other types of cancer are really common in my family, especially on my dads side. I finished my period about a week ago on now for the past couple of days I've been getting a really sharp stabbing pain going through my left nipple and it feels like its going right to the back of my breast. this is the same breast ive got the lumps in too.  Im sort of worried about going to the doctor with this matter as I've been twice before and its been nothing. I would very much appreciate any advice. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Anne, the first time I was referred to the hospital I had an ultra sound which the doc said was fine and then the second time I had I biopsy but when I went to get the results the doc couldnt find them, after waiting 3 hours for results I was told it was a fat nodule. Thing is its quite sore when Im turning sides in bed or if I touch it. Does anyone know if fat nodules are supposed to be sore? Hopefully it will be nothing though and I will make my docs app first thing monday.",
