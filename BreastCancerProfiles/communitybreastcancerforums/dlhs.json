I don't think it's ethical for your doctor to tell you not to let the surgeon know! The surgeon absolutely has to know what she's dealing with. If there's the potential for complications during surgery or after or related to the anesthesia due to the injection you must let them know. I don't know if there are dangers associated with it but your surgeon will be able to tell you. I'm sorry you've had such a long process and I wish you good health and fast healing.",

      "Content": "Mar 27, 2008 09:25AM - edited Mar 27, 2008 09:27AM by dlhs Thanks so very much to Deb, Beesie, Debbie, Anneshirley and Wishiwere! Here's info from the mammo and ultrasound reports that you asked about: November 7, 2006 Screening Mammogram:  Heterogeneous dense breast tissue is present bilaterally. However, there are potential new areas of nodularity in the central right and 12:00 left breast for which additional imaging is recommended. No malignant calcifications are seen in either breast. Assessment: BIRAD 0 - needs additional evaluation. November 10, 2006 Diagnostic Mammogram:  Nodular Densities questioned on screening study are not reproduced mammographically. Ultrasound has been requested and will follow.  Assessment: BIRAD 2 - benign findings. November 10, 2006 Bilateral Ultrasound:  Sonography through the 12:00 left breast demonstrates the presence of an 8 mm cyst. Sonography through the central right breast posterior to the nipple demonstrates the presence of a 5mm cyst. No solid masses are seen.  Assessment: BIRAD 3 - probably benign finding; needs 6 month followup. May 4, 2007 Diagnostic Mammogram:  The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. The dense tissue may obscure some lesions mammographically. No suspicious masses or suspicious calcifications are seen. There is no suspicious architectural distortion or skin thickening. Spot compression views were obtained over the areas questioned on the prior study as well as a nodular area seen in the medial right breast on the current study. No persistent focal abnormalities were seen on any of the additional views.  Assessment: BIRAD 2 - benign findings. Request 6 month followup. November 8, 2007 Screening Mammogram:  The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. The dense tissue may obscure some lesions mammographically. No suspicious masses or suspicious calcifications are seen. There is no suspicious architectural distortion or skin thickening.  Assessment: BIRAD 1 - negative. The patient may continue screening as per ACS guidelines. March 7, 2008 Diagnostic Mammogram:  History - Palpable abnormality right breast.  Findings:  The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. The dense tissue may obscure some lesions mammographically. No suspicious masses or suspicious calcifications are seen. There is no suspicious architectural distortion or skin thickening.  Impression:  No mammographic evidence to suggest malignancy is seen. Negative or inconclusive breast imaging studies should not deter biopsy if there are clinically suspicious palpable findings. Because the breast tissue is so mammographically dense, ultrasound of the palpable abnormality will follow.  Assessment: BIRADS 0 - needs additional evaluation. March 7, 2008 Ultrasound of Right Breast: Sonography is performed through the area of palpable clinical concern. No cystic or solid masses are seen.  Impression: No sonographic evidence to suggest malignancy is seen. Negative or inconclusive breast imaging studies should not deter biopsy if there are clinically suspicious palpable findings.  Assessment:  BIRADS 2 - benign findings. So that's the scoop on the tests to date. When I see the surgeon on April 9th I'll definitely inquire about an MRI. Thanks again everyone - I really appreciate your input and wish you all the very best.",

      "Content": "dlhs wrote: Hello to all - I am 51 years old and in need of some advice. Short version of the story: 18 months ago out of nowhere the thought occured to me \"I have breast cancer.\" No symptoms - no reason - just popped into my head. Pushed it back in my brain and went on with life. Saw my OB/GYN a month later, no findings on her exam, she just told me to get my annual mammogram. Got called back on that mammo for compression films and was told it was birads 3 and come back in 6 months. Had the 6 month followup and was told no changes, come back in 6 months again. Saw my doctor again in October of 2007 and had no findings on her exam again. Had my  mammo in November of 2007 and was told all was well, come back in a year. In December I felt a small lump in my right breast at the 3:00 position. But my dad was dying 1,500 miles away so I spent many weeks with him and my mom. Returned home and found the lump again and called my doctor. Saw the nurse practitioner on March 4 - she felt what she called a thickening. Sent me for mammo and ultrasound on March 7. I can only feel the lump when I'm lying on my back with my right arm down. I can barely feel it when my arm is up in the usual BSE position and I can't feel it at all when I'm standing up. The mammo tech was rather aggravated with me because I couldn't put her finger right on the spot. She huffed and puffed and tsked a lot and said several times that she couldn't image it if I couldn't point it out. She pretty much acted like I was a huge idiot. She took three pictures and said they looked fine then said that what I feel is probably just a rib (I'm pretty small-breasted.) She then handed me over to the ultrasound tech. Nothing showed on ultrasound but that tech could feel the lump because I was laying down. A week went by and I finally heard from my doctor that the mammo and ultrasound were both clear, but they recommended following up with a surgeon to get another opinion. My doctor talked to the radiologist who said they couldn't biopsy something they couldn't image, which makes perfect sense. So they scheduled me to see a surgeon on April 9th. Now to my questions - I may well be feeling a place on one of my ribs but wouldn't I feel that with my arm up too? Is it possible that the little lump (feels hard and about the size of a pea) is in an area over the rib, maybe a muscle, that is being moved off the rib when my arm is raised? If raising my arm makes the lump less palpable does that mean it's nothing to worry about or follow up on (maybe that's why they have us do SBE's with our arm's raised?)? I work at a medical school and my appointment on April 9th is with the director of our Breast Center so I think I'll be in good hands. I just don't know what to ask or insist on so I need input from the very educated and experienced people here. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. Debi Log in to post a reply",
