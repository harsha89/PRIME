I had many many complications and lost both nipples, infections both incisions, and an incision that broke open. 6.5 weeks of two very strong IV antibiotics. But now now 7 months later I have both tissue expanders still in and my exchange surgery scheduled for October 1st.  A long drawn out process but moving foward.   My husband found a wonderful article about the grieving stages you go through after loosing a breast. It was so on target.  The emotions are raw and intense. There is fear, sadness, anger, depression.  Not all at the same time but then sometimes all at the same time. Sometimes more intense than others. I think the key is that we realize these emotions are normal for this life changing experience. It is so important to be gentle with ourselves and realize we are ok if we cry or get angry. The hard part for me was to realize people who said they were going to be there through the bad and good were really only there if I said everything was fine. The moment I wasn't the \"perfect\" patient and voiced my fear, anger, sadness dismay at changed body they were gone or telling me I shouldn't feel that way. So be selective about who you choose to share with. Make sure they are going to really be there for you.  It is hard but we are able somehow to get through it. My husband and I brought a notebook where we wrote down our questions and their answers and comments because it was too hard to remember it all.  Like all life challenges and grieving times ......... time helps. I hope you will find the support you need and the answers you seek.",

There is a grieving that you are going through with all the stages that someone who loses a loved one goes through. And it is fluid, sometimes you are sad sometimes anxious sometimes angry and it can go back and forth and all over. The amount of info you have been given in a short time is overwhelming. Decisions are stressful.  So it is no wonder you are tired and pain makes it worse. My husband told me the thing he really learned from me this past year is he doesn't need to fix anything he just needs to listen. Maybe that would help for your husband to know if he doesn't right now.  Be sure to have a list of questions for the Oncologist and something to write the info down on. Good luck we will be thinking about you. You can't be postive all the time and expecting yourself to be puts a lot of pressure on you. Be gentle with yourself.",

And if I hear one more person say  A breast does not make a woman I will spit.  Let me remove both of yours and see how much of a woman you feel like.  I get angry as you can see just writing about it.  So easy to say when you have both of yours. I know most people genuinely want to help. But I agree we can use this as a teachable moment at times. I feel like this is two diseases......  the breast cancer and then the mastectomy. My husband found a wonderful article about the grieving stages specific to loosing a breast or breasts and it was so right on it.  It said that on average it takes two years for full acceptance of loosing a breast.  I am at 6 months since original surgery, had two more due to complications, wound infections in both incisions, an incision that broke open, 6.5 weeks of two IV antibiotics then five weeks of balance issues due to one of the antibiotics after the IV was done. This is not over when the incision heals. I am venting. So frustrated by people thinking I should be back to normal. I am not. Not sure if I ever will be.",

My tumor was .7   I also had LCIS in both breasts. I had a bilateral mastectomy as well. My story is different maybe in the fact that I had every complication surgically that could go wrong. Infections in both incisions most likely hospital aquired. One incision broke open and took months to heal. 2 different IV antibiotics via PICC line almost going 24/7 due to dosing for 6.5 weeks.  Then an uncommon side effect of one of the antibiotics for 5 weeks that caused me to not have my balance. My Oncotype Score was 12. No chemo. Tamoxifen then an AI after I go through meopause. I am going to be 54 in Oct.  No family history what so ever and found on routine mamo.  It is overwhelming and I think you will find yourself having every emotion possible and sometimes without warning. My advice to you would be to surround yourself with trusted and I mean trusted individuals that you can truly share your emotions with, without worrying about being judged. You will find that many just don't get it. I have started eating almost everything organic, little processed, low surgar getting excercise almost daily. Stay away from Soy products and limit alcohol. There are things about this disease we simply can't control.  But those other things we can really do and it will help keep us healthy and help with reoccurance as much as we can help with that. There is a wonderful article on Breastcare.org I think it is that talks about the grieving stages you go through specifically to loosing a breast. It was very helpful to me. It helped to validate that the emotions I was feeling were normal and ok. Be gentle with yourself. Good luck and know there are many here on this web site that care and truly understand what you are going through.",
