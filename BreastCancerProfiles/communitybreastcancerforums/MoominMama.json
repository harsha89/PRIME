I have a doctors appointment in an hour, and while I know they won't give me answers there and then at least I've got the ball rolling. There's been no more blood thank goodness, but feel very tired and no appetite. Hoping this is just a reaction to my mums passing and worry over this rather than an actual symptom. Thank you for being there.",

I have no family history to draw on as I am adopted. There has been no trauma to my breast. A year ago I had an abscess that was treated with anti biotics in the same breast which seemed to go away fine. Ive never had a mammogram as I've never been called for one. It is Bank Holiday so can't phone a doctor until Tuesday and am going out of my mind. My mum passed away a month ago so on top of that I am just one big emotional mess. Just wanted someone to talk to I guess. Log in to post a reply",
