I had to be my own referral, asking for physiotherapy, prescription for compression sleeve and finally lymphatic drainage massage. While they all have been somewhat helpful, I still have an arm that is twice the size of my other and no one (except me) seems concerned. What dvd are you talking about and how can I get one? Thank you so much! Kathy",
