They never offered to have me see anyone else in their facility.I had heard of a surgeon quite a ways from us and went to him.I loved him, he was gentle and caring,never made me feel rushed.It is extremely important that you feel comfortable with all the doctors involved in this journey.My sentinel node biopsy was all done the day of surgery,results were back before I even really woke up.Another reason I chose this doctor,I did not want a second surgery for lymph nodes and wanted to know immediately how they tested.

Hearing from both of you really helps.I think part of my problem is boredom and anxiety that I will never feel better,I am always busy,I don't work but have a lot of pets and love to work outside in the yard.Yesterday I started very gentle walking for 5 minutes each hour and I think that helped,I was so inactive while I had the drains.Thank you again,it helps so much to be reassured by others who understand.",

I love my skim milk and yogurt,so think I am doing OK in that area.I do have damage to my digestive system from chemo,so have to supplement daily with B vitamins...which I forgot to take with me and had no time to buy any..then the surgery and was not even thinking about it...so I am sure that is playing a part.It is so kind of you all to take time to write,it really helps me emotionally and that of course helps physically!",

And as soon as my insurance approves it,I will get recon too....In the meantime, I check in here and sometimes get helpful hints.This forum is for women who are waiting for recon too,not just those who have totally decided against it.But I often feel since I am  not  anti recon,that I am not welcome and so I rarely post.",
