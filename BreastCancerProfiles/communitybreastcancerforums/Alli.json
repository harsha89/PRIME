During the next 10 yrs I underwent increased monitoring with alternating MRI and mammos. I had 4 b9 biopsies. All in all I tolerated the high surveillance well psychologically. After my first diagnosis both my mom and sister were diagnosed with BC. I had a recurrence 10 yrs and 1 month after my first dx. I always knew that I would choose BMX if I had BC again. I have no regrets about keeping my breasts for those additional years and I do miss them but have absolutely no regrets about the aggressive surgery this time around. It is such a personal decision but remember there is no wrong choice. It all boils down to what your comfort level is in regards to frequent monitoring and the possibility of call backs for biopsies. In my case, I was confident that because of increased monitoring, if I had a recurrence that it would be found very early stage which it was. Best wishes to you all struggling with these decisions. You will not make the \"wrong decision\". Many folks are way too free with giving advice that have not had to face these decisions.

I have to say that you all are an inspiration to me even though we have never met. There is so much strength and support here from women that really do get it. I have a few friends that have been down this road that can relate but have many more well meaning friends that are way too free giving unsolicited advice and have no clue what this is really like, emotionally and physically. My mom and sister have both defeated BC, so they are huge support to me. Someone a few pages back discussed how difficult it is to accept help. They sounded so much like me. My work family arranged a Meal Train for me. So, every other day someone delivered food to our home. The food was delicious and I really did appreciate it but it stressed me out so bad. I would worry about the messy house, how terrible I looked, and about the dogs jumping all over them. I am usually the one that takes care of everyone else and I like that role much better. The last meal that we got was actually a pizza delivery that a friend sent. That was a great idea I thought. No stress about entertaining the pizza guy, though the dogs did still give him the once over. I wish everyone the best no matter where you are with treatment. I know many of you are still in the waiting phase to find out what's next and I think that's the worst part. I'm a get it done and behind me asap kind of girl. During my first round with BC ten years ago, I did have 33 sessions of rads and took Tamoxifen. I have to say they are both doable. When I first started rads, I thought there is no way in hell I could do that for six weeks but before I knew it, I was done. Rads did have a cumulative effect in regards to fatigue. It was after I finished and went right back to working 12 hr shifts that I realized just how tired I was. So be good to yourself. Nap often! Good luck to all of you recovering from surgery, undergoing reconstruction, and beginning chemo or radiation. I cannot believe we are well into February! What a rollercoaster of emotions January was. Next year at this time, hopefully everyone in this group will have BC in the rear view. Wish we could all meet up in the cabanas! That thought is what kept my anxiety under control going into both of my surgeries! I am one of the fortunate ones that will not be joining the chemo group. BMX revealed a lot of pure DCIS-only. On Jan 20th-2 wks, after BMX, I had direct pre pectoral implant placement. That surgery was way more painful than I had expected. So far my radiated skin is healing ok. My skin was still very swollen and not very pliable apparently so only have smallish implants and will likely have some fat grafting and maybe attempt a larger implant in about 3 months. I believe both of my nipples will survive. So for now I'm done and just recovering and enjoying the beautiful coastal NC weather we have been having before I have to return to work in a couple of weeks. The bills are rolling in and the PTO is running out! Best wishes and hugs to you all! Alli",

I don't know what I would have done without BC.org and you ladies. DCBC good luck with your exchange and FG on Friday. Tomorrow is a week since my revision and FG. I am feeling very good. The donor sites and area above my implants is very sore but only taking occas Tylenol during the day. Still take oxycodone at night more to help me sleep than for pain. Have still been a little tired I think from the anesthesia. Today was my first day without a nap since surgery! The compression garment is hot but it does feel more comfortable with it on. My boobs feel so much softer since FG. I actually mowed grass today on riding mower and could feel my boobs bounce a little. (I hope that doesn't hurt anything) It was a nice surprise,before they were just tight and firm. I sure hope the fat stays. Please let us know how it goes. I am hoping it will much easier than your first surgery. 3Bears we live on the NC coast not far from the outer banks and we frequently go boating at Cape Lookout. I hope you have a wonderful time and can celebrate being cancer free though you still have recon ahead of you. The weather has been wonderful and water temp is a lovely 76 degrees Enjoy!  Much love to you all!😘",

My son is 20yo and I think my BC has affected him significantly. It's not so much what he says but how he has shown so much grown up genuine concern and love and helps me out with the farm chores and also taking care of my aging parents. My dad had a near tragic tractor mishap today and the tractor actually took out the whole back wall of his barn. He was just getting ready to plow his baby girl's garden-me. Thank God he wasn't hurt and my son came right over to help get the mess straightened out. Don't know what I'd do without him. Thinking of you all starting chemo or rads and some of you finishing rads this week. I found rads to be very tiring and it was worse towards the end. Take naps whenever you can. Hang in there to those still waiting on a plan. Good luck to the surgery girls this week-pamela and Bevmom! Remember the Cabanas......the frosty beverages will be waiting for you. Cowboyup-I also have 2 horses and it's amazing how much I've missed mucking stalls! I was at the barn today when my nephew came by to put the horses in the barn for me and it seems that my big boy, Elroy has redeveloped his nasty habit of rushing into the stall like something crazy. He is big enough to really hurt you when he pulls his shenanigans. I can't wait to get back in service to get his manners straightened back out. Horses have always been my therapy when going through tough times, need them now more than ever. Hope you are able to enjoy your horses again soon! I know many of you are having a hard time dealing with the Tamoxifen decision. I took it 10yrs ago after Lump and rads. I stayed on it about 2 years and then went off of it to attempt having another baby. Honestly the only problem I experienced was feeling moody, irritable, and mildy depressed. It may not have been the med at all but rather just the whole BC ordeal. In the end, we did not have another child and I did not resume Tamoxifen as I was supposed to for 3 more years. Now, here I am with a recurrence. Will never know if taking the med for the entire 5 years would have prevented it. Everyone has different experiences. I really did not experience any physical side effects. So, I would suggest you educate yourself but don't read too deeply on side effects and give it a try if your MO suggests it-they will usually give you all the statistics regarding recurrence rates with and without it. For those that had pure DCIS and a BMX-it may not be suggested at all. If you had lump or UMX and are ER/PR+. it will likely be suggested. Shellybeans-you look beautiful. Looks like you have found a great place. Love all you ladies dearly! Sleep well! ",

Learning to give up some control and rely on others has been so hard for me. I felt so good last weekend after having my drains out, that I really overdid it cooking and trying to clean a little. I developed seromas on both sides. They aren't painful, just annoying. So.... for those with drains still in, don't push too hard to have them removed if your BS is the slightest bit hesitant. And...when you do get them out, take it easy for a few days. I am returning to surgery tomorrow for pre pectoral implant placement. There is a possibility that I will end up with only TE since I am still very sore and swollen. My skin (even the radiated side ) looks good and nipples are coming along Not a pretty sight but they look viable -kinda pink and purple zebra striped. Since I had skin and nipple sparing, the PS doesn't want to wait longer than 2 weeks to start my recon. I sure don't feel ready for another surgery but am just trying to put my total trust in her recommendations. Good news is that I had pure DCIS so chemo is off the table. Good luck to all of you healing from surgery or in the pre surgery phase and to those of you in the midst of decision making regarding your treatment plan. The waiting for the plan to be put into place has always been the hardest for me. To those considering brachytherapy radiation-I had a friend that did this 10 yrs ago and she was totally happy with her treatment and remains cancer free. I had traditional radiation and had to drive 1.5 hrs each way for treatment. It was doable but I was exhausted near the end, probably as much from driving as from the rads. I will be thinking of you all as I'm heading to the cabana tomorrow! Can't wait for that frosty drink (aka Versed)! Alli",

As a nurse, I would strongly recommend a port for chemo. The medications can be very irritating to the small peripheral veins and even cause tissue damage if the medication leak outside of the vein. Also, most of us are limited to using one arm only for IV sticks/blood draws etc. due to lymph node sampling so that lessens the selection of useable veins for chemo. Port insertion is a simple procedure that can save you a lot of discomfort in the long run. Fightngirl-hope you received good news at the MO appt today ",

I have had an MRI or mammogram every 6 months for the past 10 years. Though it was inconvenient, it did give me a sense of comfort knowing that a recurrence would be found early. Are any of you that had bmx for DCIS and recon havIng any X-ray imaging to assess for recurrence ? I'm not comfortable waiting for lab work to reveal mets. On another note, I am so happy for you awesome brave ladies nearing the end of treatment, having exchanges, and moving on to a new normal life. Wewill all be stronger and forever changed from this experience. My plan is undergo one more FG procedure in September. My foobs are kinda quirky looking but look ok under clothes or a swimsuit.

Glad you have the new puppy which I hope will help lessen the pain slightly. Annoyingboob-Many surgeons are doing pre pectoral direct to implant placement at the same time of nipple/skin sparing BMX with very good results cosmetically and with less pain and healing time. It is a fairly newer procedure so not widely available but def worth looking into. I ended up having a 2 week delay between my NS BMX and direct to implant placement due to having previous radiation 10 yrs ago. The rationale for waiting between the surgeries was to see if my previously radiated skin would heal well enough to tolerate an implant. So far things appear to be healing well and I will have the implant surgery on 1/20. My nipples are not in great shape but the PS seems to think they will survive. The remaining skin looks great. PM me if you'd like any more info. Welcome to all of the newcomers. I'm sorry that you have had to join us but you will find so much support here to get you through this. I know that many of you have received pathology results after surgery that were worse than what was expected pre op.

You are a strong bunch and will no doubt get through this and do everything you can to avoid this crap ever again.

I sort of wishing I had taken it a little slower and gone the TE route. My implants are small and my radiation side is so tight. I think I will end up losing about half of the nipple on that side.

Looks like I'm the first case of the day so that means I will have to leave the evening before since it is a 3 hr drive. I was really hoping to spend the night before surgery at home with my furry kids since they bring me so much comfort. My son will move back in for couple of nights to care for the pups. I do dread the surgery and recovery so much but realize that this is my only sensible option. At the time of my first diagnosis 10 years ago, I chose lumpectomy and radiation. I have no regrets about that decision. At that time I had no family history but since then, both my Mom and sister were diagnosed. I knew that if I ever had a recurrence, that I would have a BMX. I am very comfortable with that decision but I will miss my breasts. I am glad that I was able to have them for those 10 years between cancers. It's not like they get much attention, but I have always enjoyed having them for those brief moments when they were getting attention. It's hard to get the hubby to say much about it, but I feel like he will miss them too. I have been off work this week and nesting big time. Wish my house were this clean without having to deal with cancer. Made the Walmart run today. Getting the hair touched up tomorrow and had my pedicure and wax last Friday. Nerves are kicking in. Hope it's ok to have a glass of wine (or two) this close to surgery. Apparently my friends from work are setting up a \"meal train\" for me. It's a phone app-go figure. I thought that was a neat gesture. For those of you starting our group out tomorrow, I wish you peace and comfort. Please keep us posted on your recovery.

Waiting for pathology results is one of the most anxiety producing parts of this process. I believe it is as bad as the couple of days just prior to surgery. I am the kind of person that just wants to know....good or bad so that I can move on to plan B. I am expecting my results tomorrow. To those that have just joined us, I am sorry you are here but you will receive a ton of support from some really great and funny girls. It amazes me how much post op protocols vary among physicians. My BS has me in a compression bra but does allow me to shower with the drains in. The drains are covered with an occlusive Tegaderm dressing and the incision has steri strips. There is a blister on my left side that is covered with Dermabond skin glue-for the life of me, I cannot remember how the doctor said that happened. I hope that my PS is ok with what my BS has had me doing. I will meet with them both tomorrow. I had skin and nipple sparing BMX and it is not a pretty sight. I am hoping that weeks down the road that I will be happy with my choice. Both nipples are very dark purple... lefty is worse (had previous radiation) and I'm not sure she is going to survive this. The plan is to return to surgery on 1/20 and have direct to implant placement above the muscle if all of my tissue looks viable. I cannot imagine going back in to surgery so soon as my chest is still very taught and swollen not to mention sore. Docmama- So sorry about the illness spreading through your family. I hope you continue to stay well. I cannot imagine heaving and vomiting with a chest this sore. I hate that your family is having to deal with all of the BC issues. The first time I was diagnosed, I was 36yo and one of the first things my MO did was send me to a genetics counselor and order BRCA testing. At that time, my only family history was a paternal aunt. We were considering having another child so I had gone in for a physical. Luckily my very thorough FNP sent me for a baseline mammo which found my early stage BC. I still get emotional when I think about what would have happened without her. I would have gotten pregnant and my BC probably would have gone undetected until it was far advanced. Since my BRCA was negative, I opted for Lump+rads and have not regretted that decision. However, 2 yrs after my first diagnosis, both my mom and sister were diagnosed (both early stage). I always knew that if I ever had a recurrence, that I would opt for more aggressive surgery. I was diagnosed this time 10 yrs and 6 days from the first time So, my family is considered to have a \"familial\" cancer. We are in a study at UNC-Chapel Hill that is developing testing for other BC genes. It may not affect my generation but hopefully by the time my son is having children, we will have knowledge that would potentially affect medical decision making for his family. The cancer genetics counselors are so freaking smart- I hope they can help sort things out for your family. Wishing you all a good day! I will be hoping for good reports for everyone waiting for results and comfort to every one during your recovery. I will forever laugh when I think of the bungalow. My surgical team was probably so glad to put out that cuckoo lady that wouldn't shut up about that bungalow and fruity beverage. When the anxiety creeps in-head for the bungalow!",
