You ladies on this forum are such warriors, I admire you all so much! For reasons I can't really get into, I can't be seen by anyone until after January 1st. Hopefully you all can read between the lines without comment ;-) It's just not an option... I do not have a fever, nor do I have any other flu-like symptoms. I looked at the pics of IBC on google images and most of them seem far more advanced than what I'm dealing with. My left breast just has a faint, almost lace-like area of reddish-blue, like a minor rash. No bumps/pimple like things are present except for the weird nipple bump. Some of the pics online do sort of resemble what I have, though. My left breast has always been just a bit larger than the right, which is normal from what I understand. But, now when I look at it, it seems to be maybe 1/2 cup size larger than the right/normal breast. It doesn't seem to be more firm than the other one, though. Recently, my night sweats have left only the chest area of my shirts REEKING, and the sweat has stained from yellow to a weird blue shade on my white nightshirts. I don't normally have BO, I'm extremely hygienic. I find it odd that there is an odor to this discharge...my aunt said that you can indeed sometimes smell breast cancer. (I wouldn't let her do a scratch and sniff though, LOL). Last weird thing...and I probably sound off my rocker...but my cat is suddenly glued to my side. He's normally pretty aloof, he's more of my buddy than my baby if that makes sense. He is sniffing me a lot, like I smell different to him or something. I'm trying to stay calm and level headed. I know getting emotional now serves zero purpose. I'm just eager for the next 12 days to pass!",
