Did not work at all, with infection, previous radiation (Hodgkins 25 years ago) and a diabetes diagnosis the same month the entire process was a mess. So nice to have the expander pulled out and a large whole left. Finished chemo in April, changed PS, hopefully this time I will have better luck. Have heard good things about DIEP as I have now found out probably should not have even attempted the expanders, at that point that was the only option offered, they discussed was aTram Flap and that sounded so scary...kinda feel like it was a bait and switch..all an all doing ok, just looking forward to getting it all finished and getting back to a so called \"normal\" life...is that even possible...good luck to all of you having surgeries.
