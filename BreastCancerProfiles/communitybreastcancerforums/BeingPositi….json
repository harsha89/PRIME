Yday it was all over legs, knees. Today it is lil betrer but looking forward to painless days. Did not shave the hair yet, guess not yet prepared. Have not yet shopped the wig either. Will see how it goes. All of us just got to be strong for us, our families and for everyone who cares for us. Im also keeping strong faith in God in this journey. Hope and best wishes.

Frankly speaking it gives support to see everyone has same fears and same positivity to still bounce back. I am really blessed to have found all of u here. Had my 3rd TC round yday and MO asked about my plans on surgery. I am still split between lumpectomy n mastectomy. One has radiation which I am afraid of considering my left breast and other has looooong recovery and even more time for reconstruction. These decision making sucks. MO asked to take decision n appointments soon so that after 4th round everything will be already planned. Seems I am gonna make a toss in front of God 😊 So far doing fine due to steroids. But as nuelasta will pinch in later in the day, body ache n bone pain will start. Taking advil in advance in the hope of minimizing the pain. Beeline, congratulations on the job! Hats off to your spirits. Piksie, i usually avoid makingfood for first 6-7 days after infusion. I don\u2019t think there is any rule like that. But feels safer to keep family away from any toxins that might be coming out through pores. And also reason to take rest and not sweat over what to make for dinner tonight 😉 i let dear husband handle it for few days. He has been so very supportive. ",

Asknomore, so sorry to hear that you had to be admitted. Hope you are feeling better now. I am Hearing about Kadcyla for the first time. Wanderweg, good to know that steadily you are feeling better and becoming mobile. Best wishes to join work tomorrow. I'm just 13 days PFC, so no update on the hair growth yet. But really looking forward to it. Are you ladies doing anything special to stimulate the growth? Beeline, wishing none/ manageable taxol SEs. Glad to know that you are feeling better after final AC. Starting Exercise sounds great. I'm not doing much but try to walk for an hour inside home. With it being so cold outside, can't think of going out. And don't want to start gym until after recovery from surgery to avoid infection. Even being inside, got cough and cold from son. Hopefully won't catch anything else as I too will start going to office from tomorrow. Finally I decided to go for BMX. Last few days have been very emotional and tensed. I don't think I can handle yearly mammo. Also my onco being too high, guess I will do all that I can to have better future prospect. I am really scared of the surgery, but looking at all of you and so many inspirational ladies on this board, I am hoping that I will be able to handle it. After my last chemo cycle, yesterday for the first time I went to a public place and all I could think of was how everyone else has normal life and why God made me go through this. Then I thought, if He has put me in it, He will take me out of it. But sometimes I feel, is this how my life will be here onwards?! Sorry for the rant, but I know only you ladies can understand it. As my surgery will be in January, guess I have too much time. Hopefully will use it positively rather than getting anxious and doubtful about future. Wishing everyone a peaceful week ahead",

Thankfully till now it is going good and seems doable. Good to know that your radiation is going fine and soon will be over. Hope the tongue bumps are not bothering you anymore. Fairchild, I don't know about seromas, but hope you are recovering from it. I specifically asked for nipple sparring surgery, my surgeon has said that as of now she thinks it will be possible, unless some unexpected things come up during surgery. So keeping fingers crossed. Brink, I am also going for DIEP flap but with BMX. Had my abdominal and pelvis MRA done this week, results are yet awaited. I don't have too much fat on tummy. But my breasts are small too. PS informed that reconstructed ones will be smaller than my current ones. But I think I will prefer if DIEP works for me. Wishing the best for your upcoming surgery. wanderweg, thanks for sharing your neighbor's experience on lupron. I hope 10 years down the line I too will be saying that it was not bad! Loved to read your encounter with the lady at Walmart and will take inspiration from you on being kind. I still get 'why me' feelings when I go out rather than being thankful that the treatment is working for me. Then I feel bad about feeling that way and I try to look at positives, but it is really hard. It is encouraging to hear from you that 'normal life is possible again'. I have a long road of surgery and recovery, but those words are good enough to hang onto until then! Thanks for that inspiration. Enjoy the time off! sunocean, that is such a lovely pic. Wishing that the next blood work goes fine and blood count improves. JNKK, hope the Taos trip is fun and that you enjoy time with your dad when he visits. The decisions are the biggest part of the treatment. Glad that you decided on T. Hope it goes well. Piksie, congrats on finishing chemo. Best wishes for next steps. My surgery date will be 1/18. This week I have been doing some or other test. Did my MRA, then baseline bone density, then met with a new doctor as 'Medical clearance' is needed before surgery. And I did not have any primary doctor, I know sounds surprising. But I was not very careful about annual checkups and thankfully did not have any health issues earlier. For small health issues I used to just find doc as and when needed. So met with new doc who has ordered blood tests and said will need meet cardiologist too. Both of those are scheduled for next week. On better news, my eyes are not watery anymore and ankle swelling has gone too. I have continued to walk for an hr everyday. I am trying not to think much about surgery during holidays and enjoy this time with husband and son. Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all!",

I haven't researched any studies on this, but based on the fact that I was asked to select between TC vs. ACT, I think there is not one standard treatment or a golden rule proving what really is the best. Somewhere we have to just trust that the choices we made are the ones that are best suited for us. If you have any gut feeling, go with it. I know this is not much help, but praying that you will have the answer soon. Hugs and good vibes....",

If after surgery path report had shown only fibrosis, this would not be the course. But the report showed that tumor shrunk from around 2.7 to 1.7. The logic is that if there are other stray cancer cells in body that had similar response to TC chemo and got resistant, then Xeloda will take care of it. My oncologist is from MSK. I know it is good hospital and all, but can't stop wondering if I have become earning machine for them. Xeloda is specially prepared in MSK lab for each of their patient needing it. Thankfully insurance is covering it. Have not even picked up yet. Somehow didn't feel like it. Maybe will start from weekend. So how is your migraine after break from tamoxifen? Hope you are feeling better. Brink, thanks, yeah have the same plan. Go with Xeloda and pray that it will do it's job. As of now don't worry about weight gain. Fo Diep you will need it. Wanderweg, Xeloda are daily oral chemo pills. 2 weeks on and one off. Hope vacation has rejuvenated you. But must be hard to be back on routine after a wonderful vacation. Fairchild, glad to hear from you. Praying for quick recovery. Take it easy. Sunocean, good to know that you too are healing well. Yay for all the drains being out. Everything just feels better after drain removal. Yeah, usually they have stage 2 surgery for correcting dog ears and other aesthetic points. I will have my stage 2 in April. ",

I am happy that this part of treatment is done now. Also as I had too many SEs from just one cycle of Xeloda, MO said benefits are not as high as the issues of SEs. She said it is fine if I don't continue with Xeloda and if I really want to try can go for 7 days on 7 days off. I had to stop it anyway before surgery. But still SEs continued. Had itchy skin, palm skin is still peeling off. Considering all these SEs, I have decided not to go ahead with Xeloda part of treatment.

I also observed that emotionally i was a wreak this time. Was either sad, hyper, irritated or frustrated most of the time. Got angry on my 7 yr old many times and later thought why did i do that. Hope this treatment will leave me as me at the end. Tigerlilly and wanderweg, thanks for your views on the surgery. Personal experiences are so helpful in decision making. I met with surgeon and radiologist. Radiologist confirmed that they have newer techniques which will not even touch heart. Surgeon said both options are good though with mastectomy recurrence chances are slightly less. But there is no comparable data available to see results after 40 yrs for both options(considering im 40 and avg women life expectancy is 80/85). Going to meet plastic surgeon and then will decide. Good news is, surgeon confirmed that tumor is responding v well to chemo and shrinking significantly!! Yeey, something good is coming out of all the pain. BoE, you are brave to even think of moving during the treatment. There are many days when i dont even feel like getting up from bed. I agree with other ladies, if you can wait and avoid the stress for now, that will help treatment and healing. Piksie, JNKk and wanderweg, good to read about the first hand survival stories. It is encouraging and gives hope. Thanks for sharing. Piksie, hope the bone pain is not troubling you anymore. I think taxol is same as taxotere. I take claritin n advil for bone pain. But could never avoid it. Kk2018, those experiences ( both, about the lady and PS response) are amazing. Both made me wonder how ppl respond uniquely depending on their individuality. Jnkk, good to know that you are rash-free and that ultrasound went find. I can relate to how you must have felt. I had same experience when they did my lymph node ultrasound before starting this treatment. Every min felt like ages!! Beeline, wishing no/minimal SEs for last AC round. You are so articulative about your thoughts. Well done, knowing and accepting what we think/believe in makes every decision worthwhile. I am currently in the process of finding it out as i decide on surgery. Wishing everyone good weekend, Hugs n strength....",

My labwork, chemo everything was scheduled for Monday 26th itself. I had missed it completely. Both of us had taken leaves considering 27th to be infusion day! On 27th went to hospital and told them abt it. They had backlog from holidays and were asking to come on 28th.

After that at least I started getting some sleep. I wake up a lot at night and find it difficult to get back to sleep. Towards end of cycle, upper part of mouth has started getting rashes. Going to discuss all this with MO before next cycle starts. I have 7 days of break now, but dreading the next cycle. I really wish I didn't have to do this part of treatment.

I selected TC considering it is less toxic (ha! what does less toxic mean and who really knows which one is less toxic). But for my peace of mind I selected TC. Looking at all you ladies going through similar experience and still keeping positive attitude gives me hope that I will be able to keep my mind strong.

I feel so sad with the thought that everyone will feel sorry for me and their looks will change and how will i go in front of anyone when i loose hair. I am 40 and my husband is very very supportive. I have tried to tell my 7 year old about upcoming changes with minimal information. But i am really scared of being social and not sure how i am going to handle that. It feels very supportive to talk with all of you about it. Thank you for listening and being there.",

Thankfully it was just thing of that day and did not feel anything afterwards. So MO is not worried. But had terrible lower back/hip pain for last few days and couldn't sleep couple of nights. MO suggested to take advil instead of tylenol to address inflammation and that finally helped. Today I am feeling much much better though cannot say I feel back to normal 100%. Hopefully will be there in next couple of days. Upcoming hair loss is making me nervous. Will go for wig shopping over weekend. Ginger, I feel you. But glad to see that you chose to look at positive experience out of it. You have very expressive eyes. Sadlynew, good to know that port installation went fine. Hoping that chemo round too goes easy on you. Best wishes. Fairchild, hope today is a better than yday. As you already said, we just have to hang in there. Wishing you strength and positivity. Pcranky, really sorry to hear about your allergic reaction. I had read that one can get it in any round. I salute your determination and mind power to fight back. Hope you are feeling better. Umakemehappy, thanks for posting your experience. It gives many good pointers. I am going to take inspiration from you on exercise. I do minimal yoga and i think i can do more, but just being lazy. Your exercise routine is giving me new aim. Thank you. And i am right there with you on attitude. I have also not shared it with anyone other than family and couple of best friends who are far away in my home country. I hope my upcoming hair loss will not reveal it and will get a good wig. So checking for work from home option. Heather, so sorry to hear about low white count. I have no idea about it. I am sure your MO is suggesting the best approach for you. Hope you will be back on track soon.",

Wishing you speedy recovery and minimal SEs for upcoming infusion. MandM37, are you icing your feet and hands during infusion? I have been doing that to avoid neuropathy issues from taxotere. Also taking B6 throughout chemo. My MO suggested it and seems it helps in avoiding neuropathy. Thankfully have not faced it in past 3 rounds. BoE, good to know that your neuropathy got better. Few days back we were discussing about starting chemo and our fears around it. Now few of us are already done and your taxol is almost done.

I had thick eyebrows, but have lost about 25% and can clearly make out that those are thinning. Now that chemo is over, will see how those react. Wanderweg, thanks for the kind words. Yeah, my oncotype is even higher, 41. Doing whatever I can. My hair growth is just like you described, can see it only when I'm close to the mirror. And wow, 6 months post surgery sounds good. Awesome that everything looks good, I giggled at the comment from nurse. M-andm, sorry that taxol is going tough. Hope next two rounds would be easier. I too seem to have got edema on feet after my final TC round and MO suggested the same, to reduce sodium. She also asked to elevate the legs. Hope your ultrasound goes well. Brink, great that you started gym. My office has gym, but I have same issues - what to do about head! I wear wig at office and not sure how to handle it at gym. Guess will continue walking at home and hoping that by the time I recover from surgery, will have good enough hair growth to start going to the gym. Fairchild, I too can't build up the courage to go bald in public. For doc visits I don't wear wig but wear my winter hat entire time. Beeline, thanks! Support from you wonderful ladies and my family is what keeps me going. And yay for running, doesn't matter how long or how fast, but doing it is awesome. Piksie, sorry that taxol is causing so much pain. Even I keep thinking how chemo is affecting other body parts and how permanent the effect will be. My eyes have been tearing frequently and MO said it is due to chemo, but will get better with time. Will see. Sunocean, good that you are able to continue with remaining rounds as planned. But sorry that you are feeling sick. It sounds terrible that insurance doesn't cover nuelasta. Hang in there. PNW, yeah, cancer seems to not only have presence in breast, but it takes over every aspect of life. I guess all of us feel at loss most of the time, but support on this board is great and keeps reminding us that everyday we are getting closer to feeling better. As my surgery can't be immediately after chemo (due to holidays, insurance change at my company), my surgeon and MO wanted to start harmone treatment. Earlier we had discussed tamoxifen, but met MO today and she said, lupron shots with letrozole tablets to put me in menopause will be better. She said considering my age, 40 and higer % of ER+ and high oncotype, she is suggesting this aggressive route. Took my first lupron shot today. Thankfully this doesn't have secondary cancer side effect, but causes bone density issues. Scheduled my baseline bone density scan next week. I am not sure how should I react to this treatment. Talk about cancer affecting whole life!!! Anyone else on this treatment? Will have to research a bit about it. Have calm and peaceful weekend everyone!",

I am really looking up to you how you focus on positive and joyous things and also putting your efforts on the exercise. I totally agree with your statement that when we stop living, we start dying. Virtual hugs and strength to you. I have been trying 'pranic healing' recently. It is similar to reiki and helps to heal physically and mentally. You can try it if you feel it might help. Sunocean, yes these decision making sucks. My surgeon had said UMX does not make sense. If going for invasive surgery (as opposed to lumpectomy), better to remove both and reduce the recurrence chance (though it is not that high). I tried everything - discussion with husband, writing down pros and cons, trying to 'feel' as if I have done lumpectomy vs. mastectomy etc. Nothing gave me clear indications. Ultimately I decided BMX based on my high oncotype and to stay away from fear of 6 monthly mammo. Wishing you the best to make the decision. As Sue said, there is no right or wrong, just individual preference. Elizabeth, you are so right, we feel so helpless in this situation. Sorry to hear about heart damage. Sending you positive vibes. We can just do what is possible and as Piksie said, can try to 'live' our life as much as possible. My blood work shows I am anemic and have low thyroid. Doctor said, in the week of surgery once again blood test will be needed to check the levels of these two. Anyone knows after last chemo how much time it takes for red blood cells to be back to normal? Will call my MO too to have her opinion on this. Thyroid numbers could have been affected due to my cough and cold, so doc started me on antibiotics. Thankfully my EKG came normal. Cardiologist suggested to do echo and stress echo. Does everyone going for surgery need these echo tests? I am going to ask my surgeon too. Feels like almost everyday I am meeting some or other doc and God knows what else is awaiting with each test. On positive note, had peaceful and joyous celebration on Christmas at home. Son was happy to get VR as gift. Going to theater to watch spider man movie today. Wishing Happy and Healthy New Year to all of you!",

My hair growth is at similar level like yours. surprisingly I am seeing more grey hair than I had earlier. But going to be thankful for the growth instead of feeling sad for grey hair. Learning to be thankful and to count the blessings. Great that your lab counts are good. And the conversation with your MO made me smile! I'm doing better now, 2 weeks after surgery.

Yeah, recovery is longer and tougher, but I am happy with the results. PS said that stage 2 will be in April. As always every option has pros and cons, select the one that you feel most comfortable with. Best wishes to hear back from the interview. How did the doc visit go for leg muscle pain? Fairchild, sorry about the pain, diarrhea and blood work counts. Really hoping that you can get some relief. Sue, feet swelling could be due to water retention. I had it after chemo and surgery too. Elevating feet helped. Wanderweg, even I feel chemo drugs are still working. My nails are turning blackish now. Earlier only thumbs were like that. And yes, I too have word finding issue. Feels weird and helpless that simple words won't come out! Glad that your port came out. And I can relate to the thought process. When this week had back pain, my first thought was oh, is it spreading though I am not even recovered from first one!! I too started searching and then found that it is main SE of letrozole. I am worried about it being SE too. Just hoping that it is nothing but body taking time to heal. Going to see what MO says tomorrow. What did your BS say?

I had used biotin mouthwash throughout chemo and I think it helped me. Yep, I too used to get hungry just like you. It's normal. I have heard about blurry eye vision on AC. But not sure what they do about it, may be doc will give some eyedrops. Tiger, sorry about all that happened on the trip. But good that they figured it as SE so that next time they can take care of it. Enjoy the upcoming vacation, sounds exciting. Sue, glad that you are healing well. Wishing the best for radiation. I get awed at the flexibility of belly dancers. Way to go, have fun with it. Wanderweg, congrats on completing 10 weeks on tamox without SEs. Awesome! My MO was not much concerned about backpain as i am still recovering and the pain is not continuous. But she gave me another news that kind of made me upset. She is suggesting to take chemo pills for 6 months as preventive measure on top of OS + AI that i am already on. She said she wants some more details on path report that came after surgery before deciding this step. As chemo was a first step for me, she wants to know what was the actual tumor size prior to chemo and few other points. She will be discussing details in next month appt though she said it wont have significant SEs as infusion has. I was looking forward to just get over this and be on the other side after recovery. But seems will have to give another 6 months. Since then of course i have googled about it and found SEs. Mentally not prepared for it, but on other side i want to be aggressive and do all that i can to avoid this in future. Anyone else here or that you know of is on chemo pills and what were the SEs?",

My hair had started to thin out from last few years. Was wishing that regrowth would be better. But alas! Anyways, gotta be happy for the growth. Don't know what will happen if I have to take chemo pills! Jnkk, I so relate to those thoughts. I too hope that I will get to see my 7 year old grow, graduate, get married and life will be kind to let me play with my grandkids. Is it too much to ask at 40? Only time will tell. Few things I have tried to change. I too focus on eating fruits, veggies, protein. I have been vegetarian all my life. So not sure what else should I do. I used to eat bread or biscuits with morning tea. Now stopped that, also gave up sugar. I don't like tea without sugar, but trying my best to avoid sugar. I'm also trying intermittent fasting as wanderweg informed. But I get very hungry by 10.30/11. Currently as I'm home, can make smoothie, omelette etc for breakfast. But was wondering what will I do after starting work. What are you ladies having for breakfast? Wanderweg, what do you have after intermittent fasting? I can think of only fruits and nuts as options then. First time posting a pic. Hope it goes through. My hair growth - ",

What a happy news that Ibrance costs zero copay for you! Just 4 more rads to go. Almost there 👍🏻 I wish I could burn the time when this tumor started growing! But as I don't even know when that might have started, I would just visualize that the demons of negativity, tension, pain, loss are burning through the fire. Beeline's idea to write down those emotions is also great. Sunocean, happy for you that you had a complete response to chemo. That is wonderful. Tigerlily, my MO had said that some ladies prefer ovary removal instead of monthly shots, just to avoid monthly hospital visit. Otherwise it is not different. As I started lupron even before BMX, had not considered ovary removal. As of now continuing the shots. Brink, good that AC is going well. Best wishes for the last one! Beeline, sorry that tamoxifen is causing so much trouble. Have heard that you got to give 3 months for meds for body to adjust. But you don't have to suffer so much. Will be good to bring to MO's attention. Fairchild, you are in my thoughts. Wishing quick healing for you. This week I joined back my office. Feels better to feel normal! But Met MO for monthly lupron and she recommended to start Xeloda as I didn't have complete response to chemo. She said may be tumor got resistant after couple of infusions or may be 4 cycles were not enough or maybe ACT might have worked better. No one would know why tumor just shrunk but didn't go away completely. Recent study shows Xeloda improves 5 year survival and reduces recurrence by additional 4-5% in such cases. Hand foot syndrome is the most common side effect along with nausea and/or diarrhea. She said dose can be reduced depending on SEs. I am thinking to give it a shot. Another 6 months!!! Hoping SEs will be minimal and will be able to complete 6 months. Let's see. What I feel bad about is that after going through all this, what stats talk about is just for next 5 years. Nothing says it improves chances for say 20 years. I asked her if I can participate in any trial as would like to help in any kind of research, but she informed nothing is going on as of now. Anyway, we got to stay positive and hopeful. Enjoy the weekend everone.",

I know at core all humans are good at heart, but just worrried about that pity. It is just the next day of chemo, thankfully not much SE as if now. But scared for whats in store for days 3-7. I am vegeterian so also looking at helthy food options. Going through some of the links And saw that smoothies work. But the sheet received from doc says avoid raw veggies and fruits. So bit confused. And should acupuncture be started only if u have neuropathy issues or doesit help in avoiding any other SE? m-and-m37, along with biotin mouthwash, i started using biotin fluoride paste even before chemo. And tried putting ice chips in mouth during chemo. As of now it seems ok, but it is just secod day. Wishing you best to overcome the mouth sore challenge.",

Only in this third week I am feeling better, else until last week I was getting tired towards end of the day. Will see how it goes for second round next week. I have started losing hair in lumps. If I comb, bunch comes out. Have stopped combing! And the roots hurt too. Not yet decided when to shave. Did not find a good wig yet for my hair type :( Beeline, you too are in the line of piksie and KK in being inspirational. It is awesome that in this situation you went for interview and rocked it. All the best for the positive outcome. I too have to look for opportunities. But after chemo, have surgery and possibly radiation, so can't join new company now because will not get those many leaves. My company got acquired and soon will come to know how many of us are being let go. It sucks, but I am counting my blessings that my husband is in a position where I can get medical insurance for rest of the treatment though the cost is going to be higher. Brinkofeternity, thanks for the info on tumor shrinkage. I am going to check with MO too. And I like how you are being humorous about shaving head and observing the dent. I am approaching that stage too. I hope I can be as positive as you. Good that acupuncture helped you this round. Congrats on being halfway through!

Hope days 3-5 are not too bad and SE are manageable. Sadlynew, sorry to know that you are facing extreme nausea. Call your MO and they should be able to prescribe something that works. Hoping that as days pass by, you are feeling better with nausea. Did you try ginger candy? I hear that helps. May be you can try acupuncture too as Brinkofeternity mentioned. MtKushmore, Welcome to the group that none of us wants to be part of but all of us are trying our best to get through. You too are a superstar as you are continuing the work, best wishes for remaining rounds. My second round of TC is on 16th and I am thinking I will be 50% done then!

I cried a lot when lumps started falling on day 15 and by yday was so ready to just shave it off. Hairfall and scalp soreness was bothering me a lot. I thought im mentally prepared for this, but when the moment came tears started automatically. The hairdresser was v nice and kind. She faced me away from mirror and helped with wig. I didnt see myself until we came back home. When i took the wig off, my 7 year old (we had told him already abt it) was standing besides me. I was looking for his reaction and surprizingly he kept v calm as if it was all normal. I started laughing and he asked why am i laughing. I told him i am looking so crazy without hair that it made me laugh. His reaponse was - \u201c i dont wnt you to laugh at urself. This is just for few months. I love you the way you are!\u201d I was amazed and felt proud of him. After some time came a real 7 year old ques- will you please wear wig when you pick me from bus stop? Ha ha! Then i was relieved that this process has not taken away his year appropriate childishness 😊 Tigerlily and wanderweg, sorry to hear that ladies from your close relation have to go through this tough journey. But im sure you will be their rock solid support and will be able to share your experience and positivity with them. MtKushmore and wanderweg, thanks for sharing those sayings. Both of those are so apt for our process. I like such inspirational quotes that help us moving forward.",

Your every positive step is just amazing and very inspiring. I'm glad that you received all the needed info and treatment plan is set. Also happy that your talk with Mom went well. Sending you good vibes. All pics shared by everyone are great. Good to see the progress. My hair is also growing though it is initial baby hair growth. I am getting ready for my BMX on 18th. Going through different tests everyday. Thyroid levels are still low in recent blood test. So PCP asked to see endocrinologist who thankfully said that she will clear me for surgery as this does not seem to be concerning. Today met with MO for my second lupron shot. She informed that my bone density level is normal. Tigerlilly, thankfully even I did not feel any SEs in first month of letrozole. Hoping that will continue. I'm having Hot flashes since chemo and guessing those are my friend for a long long time. But what is Zomata for? Wanderweg, why are you on intermittent fasting? That sounds tough. I also enjoy eating sweet, but will have to control now. Have a good and peaceful weekend!",

On day 14 after first TC, I am feeling back to normal. going to office and enjoying this time as much as I can as round #2 will be on 16th. Son's 7th bday is coming up on 25th and after first round until 10th day I was still feeling bone pain. So on weekend went for his bday shopping. Test buds are also back to normal and I am eating Taco, pizza, Panera soup/sandwich everything!!! Just hoping that after 2nd round bone pain would not be as painful. Have appointment for wig tomorrow. My hair are already thin and short, so will keep those as long as those will stay. Have a party to attend on 10th, hoping there will not be any drastic changes in next 2 days. But still worried for son's bday party. PNWC, I also keep checking the tumor and I feel mine is shrinking. But mine is around 2.4 cm. So sometimes I feel the shrinking effect could be psychological too. Will know more after they do respective testing. I will ask MO on next round if they plan to check it before 3rd round. Did you ask MO about it? Piksie, Obstacle course race sounds exciting and hats off to you for continuing these training. Wishing you the very best for next race on 21st. As long as you are enjoying it, nothing else matters. Robyn, it really depends on which SE are hitting you. Bone pain was worse for me and started late on 5th day and continued next 3-4 days. Best approach is to note down the SE and let MO know and then keep track of what worked for it. I was taking Tylenol along with Claritin as I was asked to take Tylenol for any pain handling. I wasted a day between without calling MO. But when bone pain did not subside, called Mo and she mentioned it could be inflammation due to Taxotere for which Advil works better. Advil helped me, so in next round going to take that beforehand. KK, I like the idea of fantasizing about travel. Automatically brings smile :) We are thinking to go to Hawaii!! I have couple of questions - 1. Are you taking claritin throughout the treatment or only in the week of chemo? I have TC once in 3 week. So, this week as I feel fine, should i still continue to take claritin as preparation for next week or should I start taking it from Sunday as round #2 will be on Tuesday? 2. I have to utilize this time to decide Lumpectomy vs. Mastectomy. Surgeon said, it is my choice as it does not affect survival or recurrence rate. How did you decide which one to go for other than the fact that removal of whole breast vs. local surgery? I am not sure what all points should I consider in this decision. Thank you ladies for the continuous support. Love and hugs to",

It feels unfair that everyone else around me is living a perfectly normal life with normal problems while i have to face this. In such low phase i start counting my blessings. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But we are with you in this. Dolceb70, welcome to the group. Hope your first round went fine and wishing that you will have minimal/manageable side effects. NewfromNY, hope you are coping well after first round. Good to know that SEs are manageable. JNKK, sorry to know about the rashes. Im sure MO will guide you through this. Hang in there. Wanderweg, great that you will be done with chemo after the forth one on Friday. Best wishes to have an easy round. So glad that soon will be on the other side. I am done 50% after the second round on 16thThankfully did not have nausea and managed bone pain well with advil. Flu like body ache and weakness were the worst symptoms. From 8th day of infusion attended 2 day exhaustive classroom training at the office. I was apprehensive to go to office with wig for the first time and irony is that i had to go to a conference room full of all colleagues who were attending the training. But everyone thought I got a new haircut and complemented me!! I personally dont feel myself in the wig, but as no one knows about my treatment, they did not feel odd about this hairstyle!! Also celebrated son's 7th bday. Had a very active and happening week. Currently my only complaint is that my scalp gets v itchy even when im not wearing the wig. I put oil after every 2 days and in next shower i use shampoo. Going to try to do it everyday. But i am not sure how will it impact the wig, i fear oily scalp may make the wig slippery. Will have to try it out. Any suggestions?",

Such happy moments bring us back to wonderful life. Missouri, i have same experience as everyone has already explained so well on the patch. I had bone pain the first round though was taking claritin. Based on MO suggestion started taking advil and could manage it well in second round. Will continue it for next 2 rounds too. I had readabout icing and MO said i can do it as many ppl do it. They have ice at the center so my husband puts the ice in ziplock and those bags in the socks which i wear. I put icechips in mouth too during infusion. Had minimal sores in couple of rounds. I also use biotin mouthwash every couple if hrs. When i had throat pain in first round, MO suggested to gargle with warm salted water which helped. So i am continuing that for next rounds. One good news is that the 2 days training session that i had attended after second chemo round inspired me to study further. Past week i studied for the certification and passed the exam on Friday. Felt good that i can continue normal life during this treatment too. Piksie, beeline and all of you wonderful ladies have been my inspiration to think that i can do it. Thanks to each one of you! Have a great weekend and lots of hugs to all.. ",

Other problem I am facing is that my feet are terribly swollen. I feel all veins from my knees to feet feel stretched. Anyone faced it? What can be done? Asked PS, he said to elevate feet. Trying that every few hours. Walking hurts my lower back, so not able to walk much. On brighter side, 2 of the drains are coming out tomorrow. Wanderweg, bravo for going topless. I go topless only to hospital/doc visit. Didn't gather courage yet to go like that anywhere else.. KK, sorry to know about shingles, but good to know that rash is mild. Last chemo sounds wonderful and trip in Feb seems exciting. Tigerlilly, I hope now you are back to good mood days. We have been going through a lot, so those feelings and tiredness seems reasonable. Hope your Texas trip is fruitful. Beeline, are they asking to skip a week and still continue the full course which could be lil delayed or they are asking to skip this infusion all together? May be you can talk to them once again for your peace of mind. Stay warm everyone!",

MO mentioned that recent studies show benefits of having chemo pills for residual tumor. My surgery path report came with no node impact. But the original tumor didn't go away completely after neoadjuvant chemo though was shrunk significantly. Beeline and Piksie, MO has not yet shared details of the chemo pills. But she mentioned 2 weeks on, 1 week off, so assuming it will be Xeloda. Have been researching it's SEs. Seems those are manageable. But still dreading it. I think letrozole has started causing back pain as I am facing it intermittently. On top of it chemo pills seems too much to take. Will discuss benefits vs SE risk in next month appt with MO and then will decide. Wanderweg, good to know that mystery is solved and bruises are gone too. It is such a relief to have answers for the 'why's. Brink, so the mouthwash seems to be working. That's great. My MO had mentioned that even after OS + AI, there could be spotting and then will have to see other options. So definitely check that with your doc. Beeline, hope the rads planning went fine. Wishing minimal/ no SEs. Piksie, so good to hear from you. Glad that SEs have been minimal. Best wishes for continued rads and upcoming MRI. Wishing all love and peace on this Valentine's day!",

It's been years that I posted anything or even visited. I think that happened when Whatsapp took me over. All those who really matter to me are on WA. So stopped visiting FB. I have also not shared BC news with anyone other than family and couple of close friends. Now that I am almost done with treatment (though may need another 6 months of chemo pills), may share it with others. But not sure yet. Tigerlily, thanks for the breakfast tips. I like the idea of adding pea protein in smoothie. Love your hair! So thick and dark. Hope now you will get some rest time before next travel. I love travel and visiting places ( even if it is just a day trip) as long as I get veg options to eat. It feels rejuvenating. But haven't been anywhere since last year. Looking forward to some trips this summer. Meredith, y'day I couldn't resist and added lil sugar to my tea! I am thinking maybe once in a while having a bit of what I like will keep me sane and will boost to continue healthier habbits other days. Hoping that rads will go well for you. The toughest part of the treatment is behind you and the end is in sight. Wanderweg, I appreciate how you have continued intermittent fasting. I am trying it just from couple of weeks, but sometimes find it hard to wait that long and sometimes even after eating fruits, nuts etc. still feel hungry thinking I fasted so long and ate so less! Yeah, will try smoothie, fruits and nuts once start the office. You can see some gray on both sides in my pic. And I have even more of it near the ears. Hope you are staying safe and well in those crazy flood situation. Irene, good that second round has been better than first. Knowing what to expect takes away half of the tension. Wishing no/minimal SEs. For neuropathy, are you icing your hands and feet? I had done that and feel it helped me. Try not to lose weight as you have Diep coming up. But if possible try also to exercise, even if just 10-15 mins. I had continued walking whenever possible during chemo. Staying active prior helped me in surgery recovery. Fairchild, how are you now? Hope antibiotics are helping. KK, those are great pics. Seems you had fantastic time on vacation. Must be revitalizing. Sheri, yay for going topless. Good to know that rads are treating you well. Have heard that it causes energy slowdown. So yeah, good way is to take it easy and listen to the body. You have been so active always, you will bounce back after rads. Have good week ahead everyone.",
