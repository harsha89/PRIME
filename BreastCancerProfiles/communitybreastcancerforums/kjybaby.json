    "Content": "kjybaby wrote: I was officially diagnosed on Halloween (how fitting?) at 27 years old with IDC and DCIS of the right breast. From what I know now, it's stage I-early stage II, grade 3 with a high ki-67 rate (94%). I guess the \"good\" news is that it's ER+ and will respond to hormone treatment, and that the left breast is completely clear, and I've been told it's unlikely I will have to undergo radiation, though of course we won't know until the auxiliary node dissection the day of surgery. However, the HER2 test came back inconclusive and is currently being re-tested. I've been told I will definitely need a mastectomy (skin-sparing but not nipple-sparing), and six rounds of chemotherapy. As I understand it, though HER2 positive means a more aggressive cancer, Heceptin is extremely efficient at targeting it. I'm not sure if I'm hoping the results come back negative or positive. Honestly, none of this feels real. I understand what's happening, but I am unsure as to whether or not it's hit me yet. I'd like to say it doesn't run in the family, but I met with the genetics specialists yesterday to undergo a panel testing (inclusive of BRCA 1 and 2, along with P53 and 23 other genes). I won't know the results for 3 or 4 weeks. I think I'm having mostly good days with moments of feeling overwhelmed. Not that there is a good time in life to get cancer, but the timing is so incredible: I found out I had cancer the day I signed the lease on my first apartment and during my final semester of college. I've already had to drop the classes because I fell behind and was unable to concentrate on schoolwork. I have so many questions and so much confusion about how this happens to anyone, but especially at such a young age. Trying to find the positives in this ordeal but what are they??
