On around the 8th out of 30 treatment,  I started having extreme pain in my neck,  throat,  chest and heart.  I couldn't barely breath or lay down to sleep.  I went to my treatment crying not being able to breath and all nurses and doctors denied that this symtoms could be radiation related by any means and told me to go to the ER.  The pain intensified to the point I thought I broke a neck or clabicle bone and went to see an orthopedic specialist.  He immediately got a nurse and sent me to the ER concern that it was my heart.  I was hospitalized and found my heart and lungs were perfect but inflammed with water on them.  My diagnosis was Radiation Induced Pleurisy -inflammation of the lining of the lungs and heart only on the left breast area (the side being treated)  After I got out of the hospital 4 days later I went to my Radiation Oncologist and they continued denying the side effect.  They told me it could be stress or maybe Fibromialgia.  Not a very comforting diagnosis since the last thing you want to hear is that you have another disease in top of breast cancer. I feel so much better rignt now knowing I'm not the only one going through this. I'm terrified this condition could become chronic and I would very much appreciate to hear from others that have healed from it.  Thank you everybody and I wish you much health. Gloria",
