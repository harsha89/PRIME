Some months I feel pretty normal while others I seem to feel like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck for a few days... Just still not sure what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d with all these meds. I am grateful for the medicines but sometimes I feel bummed that my body has a rough time with the side effects. It\u2019s a beautiful day outside and I can\u2019t seem to get out of bed :( bumming! 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ 💫 🧚🏽\u200d♂️ 💫 🧚🏽\u200d♂️ 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ 💫 🧚🏾\u200d♀️ Dx 3/25/2017, IDC, Right, Stage IV, metastasized to bone, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- (IHC) Hormonal Therapy 4/5/2017 Femara (letrozole) Targeted Therapy Ibrance (palbociclib) Log in to post a reply",

I have gone through some sleep trials and tribulations with regards to insomnia due to all of the following issues (since being on cancer treatments): hot flashes, anxiety, pain, night sweats (are these the same as hot flashes?), etc. One thing that is currently happening to me is that I am sleeping like CRAZY! For the past month, unless I have to get up for some reason, I have been sleeping until 11:00am. My family tells me not to stress about it and that it is just what my body is needing. It is as if I have some entity pulling into sleep and I simply CANNOT get out of my bed until I fulfill the hours of sleep that I clearly am needing. I am sleeping about 12 hours a night. Is anyone else dealing with this? I just wonder what is \"normal?\" What is \"healthy?\" My therapist thinks I need to force myself to wake up earlier. I tried to do this and what ends up happening is I hit snooze continuously for one hour and then finally turn off my alarm completely. I seriously can't stop sleeping! I feel otherwise pretty well during the day, not fatigued during the day. Energy is good. Mindset is pretty good. Gears are a little slow to get started moving but a cup o joe helps the ol brain to start functioning. I exercise regularly and that helps me feel more \"human\" too. Just curious if anyone else is sleeping as much as I am? Also - for the record, I am on Lexapro, I take melatonin at night to combat the insomnia (I usually wake up almost once an hour), and use a little bit of medical marijuana before bed to help with the insomnia too. I fall asleep very easily usually and then wake up like I said about once an hour most nights. Perhaps this is part of why I am sleeping so late! UGH!
