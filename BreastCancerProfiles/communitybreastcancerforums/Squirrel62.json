Thanks.  I am going through a rough patch my doc says but I think sometimes you have to hit the rough to get back to the smooth....forever fighting!!

Doxil was the next drug that did nothing for me.  I will keep you posted on how the Ixempra goes.  I am not on a clinical trial but who knows what the future holds.  I am thankful for each day!   Hoping the best for you all  too!",
