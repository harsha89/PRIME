I'll meet with the breast specialist on Tuesday for staging (really not looking forward to that), and genetic testing. I meet with the oncologist Wednesday to come up with a plan. I also learned that I'm ER-/PR-, HER2+. I'm still trying to figure out what all of that means.  It's definitely a relief that the scans came back normal. But why do I still feel so hopeless? Someone please tell me that I have a chance at winning this battle. ",

She told me that I have blood and lymph involvement and although I can feel a lump under my arm, she didn't do a biopsy on the actual lump I feel. I meet with her on Tuesday to discuss all of this more with her. I hope she's ready for my 10,000 questions. I'm pretty freaked out about the size of the mass on my breast though, and wondering if it means that I'll automatically be put in a higher stage because of the size?",

The tumor size is estimated at 6cm. I started chemo on March 13th. I'm having A/Cx4 and then Taxoterex4. Surgery will be sometime in September, and the plan is bilateral mastectomy. I found my mass while nursing. I had a regular breast exam at the beginning of pregnany (nothing felt). By the time my baby was 5 months old...6cm tumor. We just assumed it was stubborn clogged ducts or mastitis, until I felt swelling under my arm. That started the tests. I'm trying to stay positive, but there are still days that my mind goes on that crazy train of dark thinking.",
