I've learned a lot from reading your posts. I know my skin is sensitive (I'm a ginger) but even my medical team has been surprised with the tissue breakdown radiation has caused. I'm in a really good deal of pain. It effing hurts. I have 5 more treatments to go and each one brings new elaborate pain with the changes in tissue damage. I had no idea that these could linger after the last treatment! I thought I'd be home free after the last zap. Thanks to this thread I will be diligent with my monitoring of my own healing and let my doctor know of what seem like delays or setbacks as soon as I notice them, rather than wait for them to go away. Please post as you all heal and let us know what worked for you and what we should look for regarding the early signs of problems, and the trajectory of healing. I'm all alone out here and I really appreciate everything I learn from this community. Cheers, Mum",

I asked my rad-onc about this and he said it was a good question but that there was no science to support any concern or any increased incidence of melanoma for those of us who get radiation and have previously been treated for basal cell cancer. My radiation hasn't started because the mastectomy wound hasn't healed - but should start by August 15. I expect to use a good lotion (recommended by my dermatologist) called \"Cereve\" - it has stuff in it that is more than just moisturizer but I don't recall exactly what it is, but it's a healing ingredient. This derm said he even used that product himself. It's available over the counter at drug stores for about $14. Not bad. And in a pinch I use it on my face, even though I'm still prone to acne at 49. I hope you'll talk with your rad-onc about your concerns to be sure, but this is what mine said.  All the best, Mum",

The last two routine RO check-ins have left me with new topical Rx. They provide brief relief and i keep the whole thing well lubed other than just before the rads appointment. But once the pain sets in (can't lube for 2 hours prior to tx- and I get pain if I don't lube it every 10 minutes) it's really forever to get it under control (so far today, 4 hours and we are not there yet). The the pain is like crazy. I'm worried what the last 5 sessions will do, especially after reading about the lasting effects some of you have experienced. There is also fatigue. Hats off to you who have been able to continue working. I just can't imagine... Exercising was my plan (yoga and hiking/walking) but I broke my right foot 2 weeks into rads and have been on crutches ever since. So getting myself around (including up and down a flight of stairs a couple of times a day) has been my primary workout. It hasn't been a comfortable transition, but my arms and shoulders are recovered from the mastectomy much better as a result of all the arm work. To avoid falling on the stairs I've been sitting on my bum, lifting one or two (triceps lifts) steps at a time. The reverse for going down. I'm happy with the effect on my arms (strength, flexibility) so am counting that as the silver lining to the broken foot during cancer treatment. Thanks to all of you who contribute. Reading your notes helps me know I'm really not alone in all this. I can get though it just fine because I see the ways that you all have been able to make it through your own stories, and are still making it each day during treatment, too. Love to you all, Mum",

I haven't had a lumpectomy but I know that after about 3 weeks following my mastectomy and reconstruction, I could get around fairly well and slowly start to resume activities. One thing that is really important is making sure that you rest when you are healing. Lots of us feel like we have to get back into action right away, or as quickly as possible, and push ourselves too hard. I'm the bad example. Went back to work full time at 2 weeks and ended up with a severe infection in the reconstruction. I'm having surgery tomorrow to remove it. I think I've learned my lesson - REST (the new normal!).

The thing that helped with healing the most once it became unbearable, was saline soaks, followed by silvadine cream (antibiotic) for the open sores and a super thick cream called pro shield for the rest of it. My mother was helping me with the treatments because my back was very severely burned in addition to my chest. I couldn't reach my back well enough to do the treatments myself. She said that the heat radiating out of my skin was melting the creams as soon as she put them on and they slid right down my back. BUT, the good news is that you can put all the creams in the fridge (even the hydrocortisone, which I also needed for severe itching) and that there is no limit to doing the saline soaks. They feel like those pauses between contractions when you're in labor - heaven! And it seemed the more frequently I did them, the faster I healed. I think if I'd been able to stop somewhere around 15 treatments it would never have gotten so bad. That last week just put me over the edge. The other good news is that once it started to heal, it healed FAST. I'm 6 weeks out and the tissue is barely pink and only needs lotion a couple of times a day. I love aloe, but it did not help my radiated skin and made me itch so remember everyone is different. Find what works for you and don't be afraid to talk to for doctor if what you have is not working! Good luck to you!",
