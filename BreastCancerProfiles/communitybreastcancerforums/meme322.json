My breast was initially painful and swollen, and red, and so I went to my internist. Within 18 hours I had had a mammogram, ultrasound, and needle biopsy. Its no longer painful or swollen, probably just one of my 1000 cysts acting up, but I am looking forward to having the PASH tumor removed! (It feels about acorn sized?)",
