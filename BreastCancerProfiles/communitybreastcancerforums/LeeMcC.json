That's what you'll read on this site from all these very strong and knowledgeable women. It depends on your age, what you think about your breasts/body image ... and how you veiw the cancer ... just a bump in the road? a scary monster? etc. My mother had DCIS 17 years ago at age 55 and she had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, and then took tamoxifen for 5 years to prevent it from going to the other breast. She's still cancer-free at 73, but doesn't really like how her breasts are different sizes and shapes. I'm 47 and I have extensive DCIS (and they removed a 4mm invasive spot). I'm going for a bilaterial with immediate DIEP reconstruction, because I don't want to live the next 30 years worrying ... and because I want a matching set! I view my dense, lumpy breasts as disease-filled annoyances and they are a droopy set of barely-Bs. I'm going for perkier full Bs (maybe small Cs)! My surgery is Sept 22 -- but I took a full 2-3 weeks to talk to other survivors, research the options and consult with plastic surgeons. Unless your doc is saying you need to rush, take the time to do your homework and think about what's best for you. Hugs! Lee ",

I'm meeting with PS this week ... and I have to look at my options, There isn't anyone local who does DIEP. So I guess I'm going to start with looking into TEs and implants, and see what I think.

I was diagnosed in July with an extensive mix of both in right breast ... with a tiny (4mm) invasive, which had broken out of the duct. This is what I've learned: LCIS is controversial and most docs consider it NOT to be cancer (but it likes to hang out and be around cancer cells). DCIS is considered Stage 0 early cancer contained within the milk ducts. IDC is when the cancer has become invasive, or infiltrating, and broken out of the ducts (or when DCIS becomes Invasive Ductal Carcinoma). I think it's fairly common to have a mixture of LCIS and DCIS in the same area. Lee",

It showed LCIS, which is stage 0 and a marker for being at a higher risk for bc. My first biopsy six years ago came back b9 -- which MOST of them do ... so stay positive. I'm very hopeful this lumpectomy also will come back b9, but even if it's something else, I know it's very treatable and there are tons of women here to support me!",

I'm having a lumpectomy/\"generous\" excisional biopsy as the surgeon wants to see what's also lurking there with the LCIS. He is very suspicious of DCIS or invasive. So I am on the roller coaster with you! The nurse is scheduling the surgery for me tomorrow; should be in a week or two. I'm having it with needle localized/wire, which will be inserted prior to the surgery (even though I have a \"clip\" in the LCIS area from the stereotactic needle biopsy). I had a lumpectomy for b9 fibroadenoma in 2003 ... and the one thing I learned is ICE, ICE, ICE and a good sports bra!",

I expect there will be radiation. So I've been reading these threads to learn more about it. But I also expect he's going to need to go back in and get lymph nodes to biopsy and maybe want to get more tissue (clear margins). I don't think my path report had any staging. When will that come?

I've had a stereotactic needle biopsy and MRI (lots of anxiety and waiting since May 15) and everyting confirmed LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ), which nowadays they only consider to be stage 0 and a \"marker\" to be at high risk. The surgeon wanted to take part of the mass out to see if anything else is lurking there, too. I'm small-breasted, so he couldn't take the entire 5cm without completely distorting me. I'll get the path reports next week and then be able to decide what to do. I'm very dense and have very hard to read mammos and MRIs, so I'm not thrilled about the wait and watch if it's only LCIS. (I have prophylactic BM in the back of my mind.) Anyway, the getting the 2 wires inserted (to guide the surgeon where to go to find the mass) wasn't too bad. They did mammos, and then the radiologist gave me 2 shots of novacane (which were right at the edges of the nipple - oh, such a sensitive area!). Then, the radiologist pushed two long needs/wires in ... all the way to nearly the chest wall. I really just felt pressure. I had to get up out of the chair and get the boob mammo'd  again with the needles/wires in to make sure they were in the right place. (I asked, \"Does anybody pass out from this?\" and the nurse said, \"Oh yes, quite a few!\"). To keep the wires in place while I went back to the surgery center, they put a big Styrofoam cup over the top of my boob  - I looked like Madonna! The surgery went well; it was about an hour and I was completely fine in recovery. The nurse said I talked to them when I was waking up (still in the OR!) but I don't remember. I just have a small bandage and I'm home icing inside my bra and resting. I have Hydrocodone to take, but I'm kinda afraid to take it. Maybe I will to sleep tonight. It's already really achey, especially deep, like at the chest wall. I go back to the surgeon next week to hear the pathology report. Good luck next week Blieuxgirl ... I'm wishing the best for you!",
