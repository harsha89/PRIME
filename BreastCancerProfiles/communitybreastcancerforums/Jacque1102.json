Usually, when a physician leaves a practice their contract with the hospital requires them to give up to a three month notice. A letter is sent to patients with statement about keeping records confidential, turning over care, etc.. Unless, something personal has happened. It is becoming not uncommon for physicians to have feelings of burn-out or as I call compassion fatigue. Working in the medical field, I see this happen first hand; physicians leaving practice. Don't even get me going on the movement towards the RVU system of payment. Please take care of yourself and know that you are going to grieve this loss of your doctor. Jackie",

I continued working fulltime in a hospital which I loved. My work week was typically 60 hours perk. My hubs and I do not have kids. I continued working because I enjoyed working and I cover our health insurance. I work out 3 times a week and eat a plant based diet. I do take suppllements as well. For being 55 years old I am told I look pretty good for my age even with the whole cancer treatment every three weeks. This cancer deal is tricky as indeed we are all different. I agree with Jen that ongoing research will be the key to this mystery. I give credit to the Herceptin for my longevity. Hope this helps. Cheers, Jackie",
