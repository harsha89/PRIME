It would be good if you could find an alliance where they work as a team. Your surgeon, mo, ro, radiologist, pathologist etc. it's comforting when everyone is on the same page. Best wishes!

I have a full body bone scan and a chest abdomen and pelvis Ct today. I'm scared because I felt like I fell through the cracks and was ignored before and maybe this all doomed me to more problems. But at first I thought I'm gonna freak if I have breast cancer. Then when diagnosed I thought \"I'm gonna absolutely freak if I have To have chemo\" well i have breast cancer and I'm having chemo and I'm getting ok with it. So I know, even though I feel scared, that I am capable of adapting eventually. Again, though, I think for me I don't feel like I have control. And not knowing things definitely makes one feel out of control",

I got my port a last Thursday What's crazy in my mind is that I went in on the 5th to have my full biopsy results and had the port put in 3 days later. Seems like that was so long ago. Weird. I got the results back from the Ct and bone scan and at my tumor board meeting they discussed some nodes, a spot by my spinal cord and a spot on my lung. My oncologist didn't think much of it but the radiologist insisted on a pet scan and ultrasound. So I had those Friday. I go to radiation oncology Tuesday and back to oncology Wednesday to get the results of the last two tests. Oh and maybe my brca but I know that can take weeks. Anywho oncology said chemo should start this coming week or the week after if Nothing showed on these last two scans. I hope you get through the waiting for results game quickly! It's definitely hard on the nerves!  Also lol beach, I started taking my lorazepam and it's helping!!",

So I have a lump, dent below lump and nipple retraction. Mri appointment Wednesday (2 month follow up Mamo and us said more imaging needed) then appointment with surgeon next week. I am 41. Non brca family history. Both paternal aunts had bc a couple years ago. I have nipple discharge when I sleep. It has no color and is not very much. Just the one breast. I cannot express anything. I also have an annoying letdown feeling in that breast. Could this be something related to whatever my breast is doing? Should I mention this to the general surgeon or call my family dr? My son is almost 6. I haven't nursed in 5 years. And had no discharge until this week. I think on my diagnostic us that I had 4 month ago (they did a repeat follow up two month ago) that they said my ducts were enlarged. I don't have my reports. Again sorry I got weird and reacted by deleting. I work in a memory care in a nursing home and with the heat and everything we've been short staffed and it's been crazy. I have been a little on the tired side from work. ",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2017 05:02AM - edited Aug 12, 2017 05:03AM by Mojojennijo I am having trouble wrapping my head around the drs words. I was getting mad cause he repeated that I had breast cancer like 3 times. Which is funny cause when I went with my best friend for her biopsy results I was angry that they kept saying it to her. I called breast health already and they are just waiting for the dr to fax back the signed requisition and said would call me back today to schedule. I'm confused right now. I didn't expect this to be the outcome of the MRI. I expected to have a biopsy but not a diagnosis. So I'm gonna still cling to maybe the biopsy will show benign. My bestie said I should arm myself with knowledge but dr google is a jerk. I really just don't know what to think. I have been through this diagnosis with my two aunts, my best friend, my niece and my mother in law. But when you're faced with a probability of something that could possibly be real to yourself, it just feels weird. And ugh it had to be a Friday I am told this lol. Again thank god I work all weekend. I am going in late today so I can wait for the scheduler to call from breast center. But really I'm itching to head in and get busy taking care of my favorite demented seniors :)",

Unless they weren't looking at the same spots that showed up on MRI. I have dense tissue, does that make it harder to see? But I have only had one area of concern show up and they thought it was a cyst. Never heard I had three. When they read the report they did say what you did. Us for location then us guided biopsy. So my dr probably shouldn't have said it's breast cancer just yet...Cause it's highly likely they will see the same thing on us as they did a few weeks ago. Again I didn't know you could diagnose bc from an MRI. I still don't feel like that's the final answer.",

Good thing I work evenings for the next 5 days. Also this is once I'm so glad we are short staffed. There is some confusion about who's going to give me the MRI results. At the MRI they said the breast health center would be calling me in the next 24 hours. But I didn't go through a breast health center. My pcp and the radiologist talked and pcp ordered the MRI and scheduled an appointment with general surgeron next Thursday. So I have no idea who will give me the results or when. So I guess I shall wait and see! I'm really thankful for this site. It's made me less concerned. I feel more sure than ever that the odds are low of it not being benign. Thank you to all that put in the time to chat with people who feel co fused about how this line of testing works! It isn't greatly appreciated!",

All that time I had a lump, an indent and nipple retraction it got worse and worse.they also had been noting thickening on my Mamo. At my last annual Mamo and us (late July) i got dressed and the radiologist came in and was saying he thought it was a cyst and nothing to worry about, I showed him my breast and told him my concerns. He said he'd order an MRI to er on the side of caution. Boom breast cancer and it also showed my lymph were lit up (but only biopsy can say why). I do not know how all of them missed a 7.3cm tumor and a satellite 1cm tumor. 7.3 cm is pretty Big. I am just completely stumped and angry. I have to have 6 months of chemo before I can even have surgery. I'm a stage 2b without nodal involvement considered. I'm also having a full clinical staging work up Tuesday to get more accurate staging. Ct, and bone scan both of chest abdomen and pelvis. Then an echo. I wish they would have found this sooner. It's rather frightening. It was so easy for him to order the MRI. I had it approved in a couple days.",

Had a MRI was apparently given a 5 (my dr actually called me when he got the results and told me I had breast cancer)and then went to a different radiologist for a location ultrasound and she had trouble seeing anything (I don't know if it's cause I'm super dense or if it's just bcause the masses are deep) but she said \"I'd call this more like a 4\" but I'm having biopsy with MRI next week. So I'm not sure what led her to downgrade if she can't see anything. Or if that's why she did. I don't know how that works. Or if it's because I didn't tell her until after she said that that I had retraction, a dent, and spontaneous discharge (no color), if that plays a factor. Or if it's because the lump I am feeling is a cyst and the suspicious areas are not near that. So that would leave me without a palpable mass I guess. Unless you count the hardening under the dent. Haha I don't know. But I'm just gonna wait and see what the biopsy says. Cause I've been trying to figure it out and it's bugging me. Bottom line is they scheduled me for the first available hold slot for MRI guided biopsy and stents making me sit and wait long. Maybe my surgeon appointment Thursday will have more info.",

I had for the last year been asking my dr why my nipple had been starting to pull in and why I had a growing dent in my breast. They kept looking at the dent in ultrasound and saying they just saw a cyst. My mamos reported retraction and thickening. I think I've had 2 diagnostic and two yearly sets in all of this. I kept getting told to come back in two months. I even went to a surgeon for a second opinion who said it was just fat causing my weird looking boob. At my last set which was my annual back in July the radiologist came in to talk to me and said he wasn't especially worried. I showed him my breast itself and he ordered an MRI. They called me on that and told me they were sure it was bc. They also said the scan showed nodal involvement. Biopsy confirmed ILC. I know ILC is sneaky but I had symptoms. At my biopsy the radiologist said my previous mamos and us had been looking in thebwrong place on the diagnostic. I'm beyond frustrated and angry about this",

So in the end, I was prepared for the results I got ahead of time, so for me a call was best.
