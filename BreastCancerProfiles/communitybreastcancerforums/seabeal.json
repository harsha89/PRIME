Don't get me wrong I've enjoyed my life and it's been interesting but there are so many doors I never opened much less explored because there was a question of \"acceptability\". If cancer did nothing else for me it took my morality and rubbed it in my face! Since that day I'm healthier (except for the cancer), happier, my marriage is stronger and I look forward to living my life trying something new everyday. I'm now the proud owner of Harley-Davidson Dyna Low Rider and sometimes I ride without a helmet just for the thrill of feeling the wind (Maybe a little stupid, but the point is that I'm trying to overcome my fears and live my life for the joy of it and not to just get to tomorrow because we don't know how many tomorrows we have whether we have cancer or not) After shopping for tattos the question now is how many, what design and where?

I traveled from Taos NM to San Antonio TX to use this specific PS and before he would accept me as a pt I had to agree to have radiation done in San Antonio using the radiologist he works with because all radiation is not equal. It seems that some like to use a little heavier hand because if a little is good a lot has to be better. Although there were extra expense this was the best decision I have made although I have had some healing issues due to the radiation to the second surgery which involved fine tuning and nipple reconstruction. If there is one thing that I've learn that is consistant in the tx of ca on these boards, it is the inconsistancy in the manner of tx each of us receive. Not to say that one way is better than another but due to continue research, new knowledge, so much to learn and just what a doctor feels comfortable with these inconsistancies will continue. It seems it is up to us to each research, question and go with what we are comfortable with because in the end we are the only ones who live with the outcomes.",

Arrived in SA late Sat afternoon and have spent the last two days settling into our temp home (included a shopping trip to San Marcus) I'm not so much afraid of the surgery, though I'm dreading the pain, as I am of the knowledge afterwards whether I will need chemo and/or rads. I know that I'm in good hands and have confidence in my surgeons and have made a promise to do whatever I need to do to decrease the risk of going through this again no matter how uncomfortable or scary it may seem. Nothing can be worse then this limbo I've lived in for the past 2 months. Don't know when I'll be back but be assured I'll be here as soon as physically possible.

I haven't had time to ski last year or so far this year because of starting a new job involving the night shift and started back to school to finish my BSN (I'm an RN for 26 yr with an AD) Going to step back from school this term so I can concentrate on this and not knowing what issues are in store. I've only posted a few things here but I've read until my eyes are ready to pop out. I've learned so much from everyone and still  know so little (I'm an ICU nurse at a small rural hospital, not onc) My family thought my computer activities were what was depressing me but quickly let them know that all I've gotten from reading the threads are encouragement, support, and knowledge that the not knowing is so much more frightening then knowing.

I went skiing with DH today and it was the first day since I have gotten my dx that I went hours without it once sticking it's nose in my face. I just enjoyed the sun, snow and wind in my face as I flew down that mountain and kept thinking why haven't I taken the time to do this in the past 1 1/2 years, thats why we moved up here in 2004. I'm from Amarillo TX but my soul has always belonged in the mountains since I can remember and this is my dream come true. We were suppose to be retiring up here but with the economy and now with the future medical expense I don't see that happening for a while if ever but it shouldn't stop us from enjoying our lifes. It seems like once again I got caught up in just existing to live instead of living to love. This has been a wake up call that though the bills need to be paid life needs to be enjoyed NOW cause no one knows how many tomorrows they have. I'm not letting this whip me and as I heard one of you say, I want to throw everything there is at it including the kitchen sink! Anyway I have two full days with no doctor appointments except to get my Siberian Husky to the vet. Hate that I have to take her but sure glad this appointment isn't for me! Hope I can hit the slopes at least one more time before surgery but if not I'll have to work extra hard to be there next season on opening day (if the snow is any good).",

Dr Chrysopoulo from PRMA was my surgeon and you are right Sherry, they are all spectacular and do amazing work. Still have a few more hurdles to get through involving the pathology report but after this I think I can face anything at this point. We are going to stay here for a few weeks then travel the 15 hours back home but broken down into 3 stages. Hopefully the pain will have improved by then. Of course if radiation is put on the menu this change some of our plans but will cross that bridge when we get to it. Happy Birthday Truebff! Hope it was a really great one for you. I use to think those days weren't any big deal and just another pie in the face for getting another year older but this experience has really changed my perspective about getting another year older.

Be persistent both here and with your doctors, knowledge is your greatest weapon. I started this merry-go-round 2/17 when I got the news after a routine mammo and it is a crazy merry-go-round. I've been an RN for 26 years and you would think I would know something but when its in your own backyard you have just as many questions and realize just how much you don't know. Vickie is right about the worst part is waiting for the medical people to point you in the next direction. From the date to dx to the date of surgery was only 2 months but felt like 2 years with so many test, CTs, MRIs, scans, labs and exams that if a stranger came up to me today and asked to see my breast I'ld probably open my shirt without giving it a second thought. Don't do anything until you have all the information you need and want from as many places and physicians you need to visit with. This is an excellent place to start as these ladies \"know\" the questions to ask which I felt so dumb I didn't even know what to ask first. Make sure your web sites are reputable which this one is and read, read and read some more. I have just started my journey of recovery having had a DMX with Diep flap reconstruction in San Antonio (I live in Taos, NM) on 4/17 but with the knowledge I gain from the questions I asked I feel very comfortable with the decisions I've made so far and with many more to make in the future. Hang in there and ask all the questions you feel the need to ask. Although I'm a real newbie myself, I will help you in anyway that I can. Don't be afraid to ask for support from both family and friends including the ones here. Being afraid, angry, depressed or what ever holding hands with those who care is far better than being alone in the dark. I know because it is very difficult for me to reach out when in need.",

Not much sleep Friday night or Sat but I couldn't drag myself out of bed until 1:30 this afternoon. Like you I've been blaming myself thinking of all the not so wise choices I made in life. I was on replacement hormones for 15 years after my hysterectomy and quit smoking 12 years ago. Although I have Type II diabetes I have got it under control and got my weight back down also. To tell you the truth I've never felt sick and thought I was in pretty good shape for 62 years. I love to ski and hike and had trained for the Susan Komen walk last November but missed it because we weren't able to raise enough money for all of us to go (We live in a small town in Northern NM, sorry I missed the walk but happy we were able to raise as much money as we did). Like you I just want this out and move on or at least know what the next step is. I've never been a patient person, once I make a decision I wanted to get on it yesterday so this is like water torture for me. I've been an RN for 26 years and had started back to school to finish my BSN, guess I'll place that on hold until I know whats going on. I have 1 more week to complete this semester so I'll finish this one up but I'm a bit driven regarding grades and probably don't need the additional stress (not dealing with the cancer but what if I didn't get an \"A\" !) I'm just going to put it on hold, not giving up. I'm sorry I'm so wordy but I haven't felt like I could really talk to anyone about this as my husband is dealing with this through denial right now and I'm trying to respect what he is going through as well. I think it's so cool that you are a photographer. I love taking pictures and have the cameras and photos to prove it but I'm just an amateur. I love anything dealing with creating and have dabbled in painting, spinning, weaving and knitting. Maybe I'll have the time now to play with my hobbies a little more.  Please keep me posted. I feel like we're sisters now and so grateful for all the sisters that are here but wish none of us were. ",
