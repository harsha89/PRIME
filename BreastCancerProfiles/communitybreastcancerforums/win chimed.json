When I went in for my initial BMX the anesthesiologist didnt give me much anti nausea meds, which I was fine after surgery just a lil nautious when I got up to pee the 1st night after sugery. Now when I went into surgery a 2nd time (for margins) I had a diff anesthesiologist and told her I get nauseated sista girl hooked me up, I woke up and was good! So before you go under, TELL THEM, SPEAK UP its your body and you want the best comfort after surgery!!! \"Tell your storm how big your GOD is!\" *givin shuga* ",

They pay for your flight but you are responsible for paying for your room(45-50 bucks a night) and me being a single parent won't work. But they were willing to offer me the same treatment as my Onco in my hometown, so its just best that I just go with my treatment closer to home.

So why does my Oncologist want me to do some aggressive chemo? I feel that if 16 nodes were pulled and only 1 was cancerous(the lump I found), margin was good too, why is she wanting to give me heavy chemo as if the lump is still present? Is there alternative chemos that are not so heavy as AC->taxotere? I am really leaning towards a third opinion for an oncologist. Im confused. ~giving shuga~",

To back up a step I went on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network website and read the regimines for Stage II, HER 2 negative which is: dose-dense AC, four 14 day cycles then paclitaxel four 14 day cycles which all total in 4 months. I asked her about this regimine and others and it went thru one ear and out the other, she even shot down the Onco dx and mammaprint. Need to remind you all this is my 2nd onco dr. she never told me that my treatment is based off how big my tumor was (tumor was 2.5 cm, size of small grape) path report stated 16 nodes pulled, 1 cancerous(tumor), mass in breast was so small it barely registered but spreaded to the lymphnode, margin was free, so why the heavy stuff? Isn't there a lighter chemo for TNBC? As of right now I have to wait til March to get a Circulating Tumor Cell test and I have opted to do radiation. Because she not EVEN trying to hear me on chemo options she just straight focused on the heavy hitters for clean up. Ok im done venting. ~givin double shuga~ Link to NCCN: https://www.nccn.org/ It won't let me link the booklets, but under the Select \"breast cancer\" and then \"NCCN Guidelines\" ",
