    "Content": "Sarahalizabeth wrote: I am completely new to this forum- or any forum, so bare with my please! About 4 weeks about I found a lump in my left breast. I had a breast reduction so I thought maybe it was scar tissue, but I asked my dr to check anyways. I also get weird shooting sensations across my breast occasionally. Anyways, dr found lump, I had an ultrasound. They said it doesn't look like anything that is benign. So tomorrow I am having a core needle biopsy, ultrasound guided. Per request from the dr I have also been digging into my families medical history. Turns out I have an aunt and 3 cousins who had breast cancer on my moms side, an my aunt on my dads side died from it. My mother had cervical cancer and pre cancer cells on her left ovary. I am just not sure what to think but I have a deep feeling that I am going to be diagnosed. I have two young children and my worst fear is having them cared for while I recover from whatever is next! I mainly am posting this to stop internalizing it on my own, and to reach out to any guidance, support, or stories that may help me through this wait. Log in to post a reply",
