I had expanders switched to implants in February and i was really hoping that i would bring releif, but nope. Underneath my arm and into my armpit, my tissue has hardened into a rock and it totally adhered to the ribs. It does not move. I now have patches on my upper foob and in between foobs and underneath that have also hardened and adhered to the bone underneath. Literally will not move. The radiated foob also has scar tissue from surgery and capsular contrature. It is very painful. I have been to everybody about this. The thing is, radiation fibrosis is different than just normal post surgical scar tissue. I am doing PT, stretching and a deep tissue like massage where the therapist is working to try to free the adhesions off the bone. I spoke with the radiologist and right now, there is not mich else to do. Ive heard about hyperbaric oxygen but was told to stay away because its contraindictated for cancer. I was told the best bet is to have a flap surgery where they can remove some of theradiated tissue and replace with real living tissue. I feel like you - desperate for something to help. The deep tissue massage has been the only thing so far that is really doing anything",

I went through chemo (ACx4, taxol/herceptin/perjeta x 16), had mastectomy with full ALND (non nipple sparing with TE's), then did 6 weeks of proton therapy (participated in clinical trial) radiation to chest, axillary, supraclavical, and boosts to internal mammary nodes (which were cancerous and couldn't be removed ay surgery). I continue with the H/P immunotherapy. After mastectomy/ANLD surgery, i developed severe cording from the lymph node removal, so bad that i could barely get my arm overhead for radiation and it was pretty excruciating. Then, after radiation, which finished in April, I developed severe capsular contracture of the tissue expander and surrounding tissue. The skin looks good but the underlying tissue feels like its completely adheed to my ribs and thr TE is totally \"stuck\" in place. I am eligible to have exchange surgery in mid- november (7.5 months post rads). I am not a candidate for diep, etc because I'm 5'6 and about 115 lbs (ive lost a bit of weight during this journey and its a struggle to keep weight on). If you had capsular contracture post rads, did it return after exchange surgery? Anything I can do to help it? Does masssage help? Ive been doing PT, but it doesnt really help with the CC. Would it be better to wait longer for exchange? I desperately want to be rid of these painful TEs ive been carrying around since January. Any advice appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
