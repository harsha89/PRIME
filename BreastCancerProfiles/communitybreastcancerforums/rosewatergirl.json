    "Content": "rosewatergirl wrote: A couple of weeks ago I found a lump on my left breast.  It's located close to the armpit.  It doesn't really hurt, but it is uncomfortable when I examine the area.  I had cervical cancer 8 years ago and breast cancer runs in my family.  I've talked to a couple of friends, but I am getting a different answer each time.  One says it's probably a swollen gland, another says it's calcium deposits.  What are my chances that it is breast cancer given the location of the lump and my history?
