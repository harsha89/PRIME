I just met with a rad onc last week, and am expected to begin 6 weeks of rads in January.I recently had lymph nodes removed from under my arm, so I have to heal a little more before they will begin rads. Good luck and I look forward to everyone sharing their experiences/tips as we get through this together. Thanks, ElizabethAM !",

I haven't noticed any changes on my skin, but I did have a big wave of fatigue hit me late yesterday afternoon after work & rads. Problem is, I don't know if it's the rads or one of my other meds (that typically causes fatigue). I will say that this felt different than my normal medicine-induced fatigue. It will be interesting to see if I feel that way when I get home today. Of course, part of me thinks that I'm making myself crazy, just \"waiting\" for the side effects to start. :) I'll keep you posted. Annoyingboob, I get my rads after work. I'm still very early in this process, but I thought I might do better getting rads at the end of the day and then heading home. This has worked for me so far. My goal is to continue to work full-time, but I am definitely prepared to go on leave, if I need to. I'm just taking it one day at a time! :) Welcome to the new members! Good luck to you.",

It's quite raw. Nurse called me in a prescription of silver sulfadiazinine cream, so I 've added it to my routine. I'm just a little uncomfortable, but manageable right now. Curious what this last week will bring to these very sensitive areas. Other than that, I am good to go and ready to get this week wrapped up. Welcome to the new members. You will find great info and support here! Continued well wishes for everyone!",

I thought I was all ready to go . . .positive attitude, plans to take it easy in the evenings after work, got my Aquaphor and aloe vera, etc. Then BAM! I had a complete meltdown this morning on my drive in to work. I guess it is fear of the unknown. We all know what the docs say to expect regarding fatigue, the effects to the skin, etc., but we just don't know how it will affect us until it actually happens. I have since gathered myself, and now I'm fine. LOL ! Guess I just needed an emotional release. I'm so thankful for this group, and the great info shared here. It helps to hear of the physical reactions that everyone goes through (or doesn't go through), as well as the emotional ones. We all have our good days and bad days, and its great to know that we aren't alone on this roller coaster. So, I've got my chin back up and I'm ready to face day 1. Continued prayers for all of you, and best of luck. I look forward to all of your updates! We can do this!",

(After two years of cancer, I've learned not to sweat the small stuff so I thought no big deal, this will just carry over to next week.) Showed up Tuesday and my RO looked at my skin and decided to delay until next week to give my skin some time to heal. Disappointed? Yes, but it's just a small delay. Very thankful for her realizing it wouldn't be best to move forward at this point. Ready for next week to get this wrapped up. Hang in there everyone! . Stay positive. We can get through this!",

It's the little things. LOL! I will have 13/28 today. Ironic that I am having #13 on a Friday. I have to find the humor in this somewhere! So far, so good. Skin has a few, very mild color changes, and occasionally I get achy at the previous site of my primary tumor. RO said that is typical and not to worry. Can't believe I will be half way through this on Monday. Time flies. Hang in there everyone! Have a great weekend!",
