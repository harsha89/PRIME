Ideally, a patient would go to a clinic (or have someone come to their home) daily for 2-6 weeks for measuring, MLD, bandaging. The patient would wear the thick bandages at home for 23 hours, come back the next day for more MLD and bandaging. After several weeks, after the volume of the limb has stopped decreasing, the patient is \"discharged\" and put on \"maintenance\", meaning they and their therapist select daytime/nighttime home garments, and the patient learns self-care/donning, and doesn't have to be seen again for 6-12 mos until it's time for a checkup. Because the daily visits are so hard to get in, patients discuss with the therapist what they can manage, perhaps MWF, for example.",

As for exercise when you have LE, my cancer exercise training suggested that you start with only a few minutes. If you do any type of exercise, if your limb feels hot, heavy, or swollen the following day, you've done too much and you need to back off that exercise a little bit. Just be mindful of how much you are ready for right now.",
