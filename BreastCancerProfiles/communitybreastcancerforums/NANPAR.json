In other words the risks of her feeling worse or getting sicker during treatment outways the overall benefit.  However, the choice is still my mom's and she can choose to go through the treatment.  My mom's got the next month to make her decision since treament cannot start until she's had an MRI of her spinal vertabraes and a bone density test which will determine which drug to put her on for the next 5 years.  Should we be looking at this as a blessing or a curse?  Has anyone else gone through this?",

My mom is confused and is not sure what to do. She has some time to make her decision since the oncologist has requested an MRI for her spinal vertabraes and won't begin the treatments until the results of this scan comes back. Should we be looking at this as a blessing or a curse?  Has anyone else gone through this dilema?  Should we go for a second opinion? If yes how do I begin that process?  The most important thing for me is to make sure she's got a good quality of life. I don't want her to suffer more then she has too.  I will support her through whichever decision she makes.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks again !   :) Log in to post a reply",
