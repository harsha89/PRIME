I go in for another mammo tomorrow to check the titanium clip but also because I have a small mass ( close to the already diagnosed mass ) the doctor wants to look at. I assume it is also cancer since the first one was. It is 9mm and the doctor stated she was less concerned about it than the first one. Not sure if she is going to biopsy it or not though since I am scheduled to see the surgeon Thursday morning to schedule surgery. The reason the 2nd mass wasn't biopsied when the first one was is because she hit a vein and it bled enough she needed to apply pressure. When they looked on ultrasound for the 2nd mass, they had manipulated the breast tissue too much and couldn't find it. At any rate, I'm a hot mess. Scared they will tell me I'm metastasized. My only symptom was a deep achy pain sensation in my right breast that I assumed was hormonal since it came and went. Oh, no... It's cancer! My fear stems from I have that same niggling achy pain below that same breast so I've worried myself that it's metastasized! Especially now that I know any size mass can spread. See, I'm a hot mess!

It is smaller than the first mass (the first mass is 8mm).  She said the 2nd mass sort of collapsed the minute the needle hit it and she feels it is benign. I did tell her of my terror of metastasizing and she said it was nearly impossible for my 8mm mass to have metastasized so I should try to let that go.  (I'm still scared though, but am keeping her words in mind!)

The reason no one has explained what it is is because they don't know and can't know until the biopsy results. I don't know anything about Kaiser but really you need the biopsy and those results. I hope it turns out to be nothing. We've all been worried and some of us get good news and some of us get bad news, but all of us are glad to just finally get an answer. Be well. Chrustine",

Your Birads 4b can go either way, and then if it's malignant, you have to get biopsied to learn type of cancer, grade of cancer, hormone receptors, etc. Then only with surgery will you learn the truth of stage. It's normal you're having dreams; you're worried. I get that because I'm worried and everyone here has been worried. The waiting is hard, but I hope you'll get good results. Oh, and it's not stupid to ask anything. I'm coming up with some doozy questions of my own! Be well.",

On March 16th, I had a lumpectomy with SNB and pathology came back Stage 1, lymph nodes clear.  Then I got my ONCODX score of 18 which carries an 11% recurrence rate.  I was so bummed that it was in the indeterminate range, but my OC said chemo was not recommended as it brought only a 4% benefit.  Over the weekend I came to terms with this and was still waiting for my BRCA results.  Today I was told the BRCA was negative, but I had an indeterminate PTEN gene.  I have been reading more about it, but apparently there isn't a lot known about it.  I feel deflated.  I felt like, \"Okay, it's Stage 1 and small and all cut out and lymph nodes are clear, so I'll go through radiation and hormones and take care of myself.\"  But now this PTEN business and I just feel down.  I read in another thread about a woman who also had a PTEN of \"unknown significance\" and she wound up getting ovarian cancer, which is interesting because I was told today that PTEN was not linked to ovarian cancer but it WAS linked to uterine cancer. At this point, I feel like cutting off both boobs and reconstructing and cutting out all my female junk. I just don't know. And, I don't know what to do either. Thanks for listening.
