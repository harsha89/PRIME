I hope folks can take my comment constructively...if you want to reach others with good information...and I know that you do--it's important to be very accurate. That is what you are asking for from Ms. Schockney. Most commenters have not appreciated that she has trivialized the issue and I understand that...But mixed in there have been comments that stated that she has said that SNB carries no risk and that is not true. I totally apologize for my \"tempest in a teapot\" comment now that I know the background attempts to resolve this issue--and I NEVER wanted to make light of the heartache and hardship of lymphedema.",

I am sorry for the frustration it can cause, and appreciate the desire to have others understand it and avoid it. I have had a sentinal node biopsy where two nodes were removed and whenever possible I have blood pressure and blood draws from the opposite side. There have been times when that was impossible, and I suffered no ill effects. Having said this, I have to say that the tone of the above comments sound like a \"tempest in a teapot.\" Rather than an attempt to educate they come across as having a rather mean-spirited agenda to discredit Lillie Schockney. In re-reading her advice in context, I do not hear her saying \"there is no risk of LE from SNB and to ignore risk producing behaviors\" as claimed. Regarding the blood-sticks and blood-pressure she is right to have the woman be sure that she indeed had nodes removed from both sides. If in fact the woman has had nodes removed from both sides, but can't have blood draws/pressure taken from her legs she can be reassured that the risk is low--not zero but low. Regarding hot tubs, she made it clear that everyone needs to make their own decision and that she is not aware of anyone with just snb that had a problem. Sounds like good info to me. Are you aware of info on this that says differently? If so share it...otherwise you actually weaken your position when you sound so cranky.  Having said all this, perhaps Ms. Schockney can clarify her advice further in the future--so ask nicely. Life is too short to get worked up and throw stones at someone who is trying and usually succeeding to help others.",

I am careful about avoiding certain things and think it is prudent to err on the side of caution.  I had not realized that people had tried for a long time to resolve this issue in other ways and I hear your frustration. I hope you get some satisfaction, because it is an important issue.  I do think that it would be more helpful to say you don't think that Ms. Schockney has taken the issue seriously enough--and I definitely agree that most physicians don't educate nearly enough on this. I don't think it is helpful to make it sound like she has said that there is no or zero risk with an SNB, because that is not accurate and hurts the credibility of those making those kind of statements. Best of luck to you all. ",

These are tough decisions and I have been experiencing anticipatory grief over the loss of my breasts. I think it's good to mourn--I am not my breasts, I focus on other attributes, I will make the best of things. BUT I am losing what I have always considered the most attractive part of my body and it makes me sad. Last week I went to the plastic surgeon and concluded more surgery and the possible complications outlined on this thread were not for me. Today I went with my daughter to the Breast Prosthesis shop and it helped immensely. I am having custom radiant impression forms made and we picked out the color and cast my nipple so they can use that when they make them. The selection of ready made forms are also excellent. Things have come along way with breast forms and I know that will help my adjustment. My husband and I also did a tasteful \"photo-shoot\" the other night as a farewell ritual--that was bittersweet--but also fun and healing as well. Blessings to all on this journey...  Sara",
