I would welcome any replies from others who have had similar ghastly results and had plastic surgery to tidy up.  I am not having reconstruction right away, and perhaps never.  cruzsuz Log in to post a reply",

Talking to the surgeon about it, he just shrugs his shoulders and gently informs me that it can be fixed if I don't like it.  It makes me wonder if he expects me to develop some sort of affection for this unsightly disfiguration! I will try to be patient and see what develops. Susan",
