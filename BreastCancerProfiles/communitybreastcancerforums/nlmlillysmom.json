I was told I have dense tissue.  The area sometimes swells when I exercise and can ache.  I was referred to a surgeon because my PCP was not satisified with the fact that it couldn't been seen on imaging and that it was indeed there and definitely different than all my other breast tissue.  I saw the surgeon today and his first comment was that all my images looked great. Then he asked to feel the area.  While feeling around, he said, \"Oh, it is pretty easy to find if you know where to look\" and \"I hate lumps like these\".  He said that rather than biopsy it, he wanted to remove it.  He told me that some call it a surgical biopsy,  some call it excision, and that it can also be called a partial mastectomy.  He warned me that my orders would say \"lumpectomy/partial mastectomy\".  He said that it would be sent to pathology and that 10 days post-op he would see me for follow up.  He said ne NEVER gives results over the phone and that his nurses are not allowed to give me information because all they could do is read the path report word-for-word and that it allowed for too much grey area that way.  On one hand, I am relieved in that I don't want this in me, even if it is benign.  It is foreign and uncomfortable and I don't want it there.  On the other hand...Holy S*#!t.  They are going to remove part of my breast!  I don't even know exactly how much they are going to remove.  He is going to \"take a look, take it out, examine the other tissue\".... Are second opinions recommended? Should I request an MRI? Would that even do any good?  Will my breast be deformed? Dimpled? BWAHH! Advice? Guidance?  I have surgey on the 19th.

I was a complete nervous wreck from May 24th until the lumpectomy. I am still really nervous about the pathology,but I have to confess, knowing the mass is gone has really been a relief. I realize I am not out of the woods, yet, but I am so glad the lump isn't in me anymore. In retrospect, I am really happy the surgeon by-passed an attempt at a biopsy and just took it out instead.

My follow up is on the 2nd of July.  I have about a 3\" incision from just between my armpit and breast towards the upper-center, then I have a 1\" incision at the base of that one, that runs perpendicular, that is about 1\" in length.  He did some extra poking around in there, so I have some burning sensation in my upper chest.  I am a bit tender in that entire quadrant, but I have managed to stay off the pain medication. I have used ibuprofen and ice, mostly.    I went to the gym today and did a good lower-body and ab workout. It helped SO much to sweat out all the crap they pumped into me yesterday.  The surgeon said I could resume my workouts as soon as I was comfortable, but to avoid jogging and jumping for a bit.  Here's to one step closer to knowing what was in there.

Am I the only one that became hyper-aware of the slightest twinge or swelling after starting the dx process? I really have felt more sore in recent days. Also, I feel like I need a plan for if it is cancer. I can't stop playing the various possibilities in my head. It is like I don't want to be caught off guard. If I prepare for the worst,and better than that happens, yeah! But, how the hell does one prepare for a cancer diagnosis? If I don't prepare for that, I think it would be harder to take.

I am not on any pain medication at all, and only took ibuprofen and Tylenol after leaving the surgery center. I have had some mild discomfort in my breast, primarily when I can feel that it is swelling. Anyone have any idea why I would be so stinking tired, teary, pissy, and scattered?

Pathology said it is benign, dense, fibrous tissue.  The doctor said I will likely have similar masses like this as I get older and that it may or may not react to my hormones fluctuations.  I had a hysterectomy, but kept my ovaries, so knowing my cycle is pretty impossible.  He said I should continue to get mammograms annually, do self-exams, and that it is possible I will end up having further lumpectomies in the future to make sure that anything that does turn up is also benign.  I was relieved after the lump was removed, and of course, I am even more relieved now!   I want to express my gratitude for the encouragement and wisdom that the ladies here have patentietly handed down.
