I'm on perjeta/herceptin/taxotere. At the end of January scans at MDA showed resolution of liver met, possible progression in lungs (although unknown tumor size due to infection and inflammation in lungs so radiologist said progression and onco said no way to know). Also, spots on spine to be confirmed by bone scans end of next month. Anyway, one tm at MDA was down very slightly and the other up a little after 3 treatments. After 4th treatment here at home markers up from high 280's to low 360's although they are still pleased with liver scan and are not changing anything until my markers from today come back. Then I presume they will send me for earlier scans. Sigh. Anyway, I know markers can rise with initial chemo but like I said doing round 5 today. Just so frustrating as I want this to work....as we all do. Any experiences anyone can add for those of you that generally have reliable markers? Did you see rises later in treatment or rising markers combined with regression and progression. Also, I don't necessarily see these as high jumps although it's disheartening nonetheless. This stage IV business is such a roller coaster. Just keep reminding myself that beyond the treatments that it is all in God's hands.

Not to the same extent at taxotere and perjeta but everything is a little off or leaves a bad after taste. Anyone else? Also since my infusion some of my mets symptoms have been more pronounced. I have lung, liver and bone.  I've had heaviness/breathlessness in my chest since Sunday that comes and goes in terms of severity. I've also had some neck pain.  Anyone on any type of chemo have physical signs of regression. I imagining that my lung tumor is breaking up or something and that is why its bothering me. Wishful thinking?  Lol. I won't know anything until tumor markers are ran at next treatment.  I'm putting so much hope in this drug and I just don't want to be disappointed obviously. Anyway, how is everyone else doing on this? Thanks for any input!",

There was some sort of communication breakdown between MDA and my local oncologist office (plus I was at Disney when local oncologist was trying to get ahold of me). The pre-cert was submitted to insurance last week as an expedite so I have been stalking them daily waiting for an answer. Finally, someone this morning is going to try to have to have it approved within the hour.  It's nice to have a little break because I feel almost completly normal other than lingering fatigue. However, my spine mets cause me intermittent pain and it is just a reminder that the cancer could be having a huge party while I do nothing. I'm praying I get started tomorrow!

I think a lot of us have put a lot of eggs in our baskets for this treatment.  I have an MRI on Monday just out of an abundance of caution (I don't have any symptoms that would indicated brain mets other than just high risk factor). I'm still nervous as all get out.  I have had respiratory problems off and on since this Stage IV journey began last summer. I had a pulmonary embolism probaby as a result of the tumor in my left lobe pluera lining.  Sometimes symptoms are worse than others.  It's been mentioned and I think my oncologist is more concerned with another embolism than anything else. My INR levels are monitored regularly.  So it may be combination of lingering damage to my lung and the tumor. It's just strange how it comes and goes and how it was more noticeable after TDM1 infusion.  I'm just hoping for the best. I had nausea but no yacking so I only took Ativan as needed.  They said they would call me in zofran if I needed it but so far so good. I know i just need to relax. I get so hyper vigilant and anxious whenever I am aware of my cancer symptoms or what appear to be cancer symptoms.  I just keep reminding myself this is so not in my control and I just need to be patient and live in the moment.",

However, it would seem to me at Stage IV that is not as important as your lung met diagnosis. I would suspect since your pathology on both breasts is different you will first get chemo with herceptin.  That is a good thing believe it or not. Have they talked about doing a biopsy on the lung mets to determine pathology that would seem very important? I agree Ebru about spending some time on the Stage IV board and reading the posts. You can usually tell by the heading whether it will be an uplifting post or something depressing and stressful.  Some days I need a dose of reality and I read the scary stuff and then some days I just want positivity so I stay away even though I am always praying for all of us.  You are at the beginning stages of diagnosis which is so scary. Trust that there is hope and that they will find the right treatment for you. Also, because of your \"rare\" diagnosis have you looked into a second opinion at one of the big research hospitals? MDA, Sloan, Mayo, etc?",

My local oncologist got me an immediate appointment with Kimberly Blackwell (head of breast oncology at Duke and primary researcher for tdm1). I liked her a lot. I have to come off tdm1 because even though keeping systemic mets stable does not cross blood brain barrier. I haven't been on a ton of chemos so we are going to try Tykerb, Xeloda and Herceptin. I know lots of women don't get a response but I'm hoping and praying for best. Dr. Blackwell said nowhere near ready for hospice. Besides stability issues at times and fatigue and minor headaches I feel healthy! Really disappointed with MDA docs attitude although the center itself is still top notch in my opinion.",

After a couple months on perjeta, taxo and Herceptin I had minor progression and high tumor markers. Switched to Kadcyla which I have had a great response. Unfortunately the cancer took off for refuge in my brain. I did 14 rounds of WBR. It was tough afterwards too. My first 3 month follow up MRI showed regression but still activity. My second follow this week showed growth and worse, new lesions. I got my MDA appt pushed up to little over a week. I don't want to go off Kadcyla but I have feeling they are going to want me to go on tykerb and xeloda. Any experiences with similar situation? Cyber knife not option and want to keep 2nd round of WBR later (especially with side effects). Anyone taking Kadcyla and Tykerb? There is also a clinical trial that the research nurse thinks I should qualify for but I don't know any details. No scary stories please. I'm emotionally fragile. :) \"Be Brave\" Dx 6/19/2010, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 2/9 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Surgery 11/29/2010 Mastectomy: Right Dx 11/15/2012, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 2/9 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 11/28/2012 Perjeta (pertuzumab) Chemotherapy 11/28/2012 Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

I know it's because it's so aggressive and I know we are lucky to have so many treatment options but it's just so depressing. It seems like there have been a lot of us lately on the boards moving to stage IV or having progression. I need some positive thoughts and support. Do you all think we truly have the best prognosis as many of our docs are trying to tell us?
