My stresses came from a great deal of loss just about a year apart for each one firstly my mother to suicide, then my father to cancer, then my paster to cancer,then my 97 year old nana and her mother died at 95 so on the female side strong genes, then my sister in law to suicide and it was after about a year and a half after this loss that i descovered a large lump. I am very thankful that since finding out I had cancer I had some great delivering prayer on my mind and spirit so I am not walking around anymore with the darkeness I had as after all these losses I can say that i was starting to loose focus on those here still and had more focus on those who had passed away , and especially with two being suicides and all that comes with that. So I may have cancer but I can say I am happier in myself now since receiving the prayer I got and looking at living my life to the fullest.",
