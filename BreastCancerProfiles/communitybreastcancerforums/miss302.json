I appreciate the prayers.  I am really down and do feel lonely with all this crap. I am so angry that here I sit at 39 years old with bilateral afos to just below my knees (they are like wearing CAM boots all the time. So bam there goes any ankle side to side, thus limiting my ability to walk, squat, etc. Now effing cancer is also going after my left arm and hand. I can see the decreased size, increased pain, and furthering increasing disabilities. I just cant believe I get all this rare crap. Im afraid this will be my last summer water skiing with the left arm losing function. I used to race karts and stock cars and here I sit barely able to drive my stupid SUV. Last night at supper my 7 year old says \"mom do you remember that doctor saying your arm problem is rare?\" (I crossed paths with my plastic surgeon a month ago and asked him about my left arm issues and with my kids present he says \"wow, that's rare, no I have never seen it\") . so much for hiding it from them, my kids probably know way more then I would want them to. oh well, maybe I can try my best to live well and enjoy life with my family? just having a really hard time wrapping my head around this RIBP.  I get so mad at my husband and kids joking that I take so long to get ready to go. like I effing choose this crap? ",

And my plastic surgeon whom I have been talking with about RIBP talked with the OTs and I feel good about getting support as they are consulting outside doctors. plus the mayo clinic scheduled me for may 14 neurology so that I hope will be good news too!  I do not have a night sleeve but I am hoping to get one now.   thank you so much for the response.   I have another question: I am worried the mayo clinic will want to emg my left arm but I have stage 2 lymphedema and I don't think risking infection and cellulitis will we worth the emg needles. we know surgery, radiation, and chemo all assaulted this area?  would love feedback.",

I am depressed because im only 39 and that's a lot of life left and maybe progression on my left arm and hand issues. I got severe chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy 12 years ago from taxol and just had to go to bilateral afos to keep walking, was warned I may end up in a wheelchair if the neuropathy keeps progressing. so mentally spent. yesterday had STAT PET_CT and mri because onco said cancer. grr. that was not fun thinking I had recurrence for 6 days.  my left arm and hand have shrunk in last 2 years. I have pain from the side of my neck to my fingertips. losing use of thumb and pointer finger, wrist and elbow unstable and dislocate easy. I hate cancer. my lymphedema sleeve is hurting the webs between my finger, we even added silk 2 years ago to help but I think its progression from RIBP that cause so many issues for my left arm. ",
