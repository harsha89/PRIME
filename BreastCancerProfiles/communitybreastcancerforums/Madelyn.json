At the funeral, my friends and I cried like babies, like I said earlier, no having nose hairs can be a real bit@h.  Her family and 3 kids were amazing. I sobbed liked a faucet having flashes of \"wow, this is what my own funeral would look like with a lot of the same people.\"  What a pity party of wasted energy!  There was so much to learn from Kathy and I was completely wasting time worrying about all the wrong things. Girls--EVERYTHING WE ARE GOING THROUGH IS TEMPORARY.  We will get our life back!  We can do this and get it done! We all talk about the healthy food options for our body but we need to keep our emotions healthy too.  Feeling sad is fine but when is rolls into days and days it doesn't help anyone.  Find ways to do things that really make you happy.  Sometimes thats not always possible when the bills are piling up.  Kathy gave me great advice once and told me to find 3 things that you are grateful for everyday. Sorry to ramble on but I thought maybe this would help as just knowing Kathy helped me tremendously. Hey Emilybrooke- just a want you to know I was at a party once and I met a woman who had the most incredibly toned arms I had ever seen.  I asked her if she lifted weights to get the result.  She said all she does is cycling and yoga.  She doesn't touch a weight.  Trust me she had killer arms! Girls I wish you peace and love... ",

I DO NOT get a neulasta shot before taxol, I did before AC. Because I do the spread out 12 weekly taxol, I get the steroids with my treatment, not the night before. I guess the trade off Is lower side effects but longer treatment time. So interesting to read everyone's experience. At night sometimes I experience a dull ache in my legs, my onc advised always wearing slippers around the house, especially on cold bathroom floors. The cold floors can aggravate nerves in the feet--seems to work well so far! Also, the accupuncture is great! I know some of you get the herceptin also, I don't so how is that going?

Today I walked 2 miles again and feel good.  I know my hair will be coming out soon so that is the next obstacle.  I think the best piece of advice is to look at this as a journey.  Thursday is your mission and the quicker you complete it, the sooner you can go on with life.  I found humor and laughter works great.  Also, I learned to really put myself first...right now I am concentrating on washing my hands and staying close to home.  The NADIR for AC every two weeks is Day 5-10.  So I just want to keep the white blood cells happy and steer clear of a temperature.  Neulasta shot was fine, I did take the Claritin.   For anyone with the constipation SE, I recommend Fiber One Honey Squares Cereal.  I alternate between this and a protein shake with half a bananna every day.   P.S. Had a great chuckle telling the telemarketer yesterday that I had BC.  They told me they were sorry and said \"have a nice day.\"  Maybe this disease can come in handy for something! for anyone undergoing AC chemo coming up and is having a hard time...send me a private message and I will give you my cell number.  I realize every experience is different--but we are all in this together!",

I don't know where you are -- but it's 99 degrees in Virginia.  So \"hot\" foods just don't seem appetizing.  I'm so over the water drinking too, but it does help keep constipation away!  I asked if the next 3 AC treatments will be the same or will get progressively worse.  I was told the fatigue will increase. Okay one down, three more AC to go we can do this! Wash your hands, drink that water and hug those boys! Madelyn ",

TeeBallMom, Mamabr, Ann- we all started our chemo on 7/11...so glad it's all behind us now.   I just wanted to share some of my indulgences.... First off, my hair has grown about an inch and a half...I am thrilled, I need 4 inches by May to get the extensions...so the salon tells me I'm on track and things are looking good.  HOWEVER, it came back 30% gray...HELL NO to that.  I went and bought Clairol Root Touch Up--it is boxed hair color that is semi-permanent.  It is used to touch up \"regrowth\"  but I used it all over because it was just the right amount.  It turned out awesome and when I told the hair stylist she said it was fine.  I used just a tiny tiny part on my eyebrows...I love the way it turned out.  It gives color back to my face.   Second, the monkey face thing is just out of control.  I bought the NO-NO and it helps knock that sh&t right out! It is not a razor but a hair removal device.  It is an indulgence...maybe a Valentine's day gift to yourself!  Whatever you do do NOT shave it...it will come back thicker. Third, I invested in the nutribullet.  I was like, \"how am I going to get all the Damn Green Leafy vegetables and antioxidants in my diet?\"  I make a great breakfast drink--I use stuff like spinach, apples, flaxseed, raspberries and spring water.  It is really good--trust me-- this is the girl who only ate Taco Bell and yoohoos on AC.  I like the nutribullet because my jucier doesn't get everything, the stuff left in the strainer is where the nutrients are. I justified these things because I went back to work last week.  Someone asked what I do for a living,,,I can't flip back to see who it was or I'll lose the whole page,,,sorry!  I am a school teacher.  I teach middle school kids that have been long term suspended and try to rehabilitate their behavior.  I also do real estate on the side...",

Roadwarrior and Emilybrooke- It's crazy as everyone says Taxol is easier but somehow I was sooo nervous before it.  It could be that we were used to AC and now we have to get used to something else.  I just had my #2 Taxol treatment this morning.  The benedryll knocks you on your butt.  This is definitely not the chemo treatment to drive yourself ...you will need someone to drive you.  I started at 10:00am I was out by 12:30.  The first Taxol treatment will be longer as there can be some allergic reactions, they will monitor you very closely.  I did not have any reactions.   I do not have herceptin, just taxol.   You get more steroids administered with Taxol than you do with AC.  Last week I was alphabetizing the spice rack again, and cleaning the basement.   You come home and sleep because of the benedryl.  And BTW when they administer the benedryl, you might get a littlke Restless Leg attack.  I remember TellBallMoM saying her left leg twitched and was uncomfortable-same thing with me.  You just have a hard time getting comfortable in the big girl chair as you get very sleepy.  Right now the benedryll has worn off and I feel fine.  I know I will take Ativan tonight to help fall asleep.  Maybe some tossing and turning but fine. Friday the steroids will wear off but I will not have the \"down\" day like AC--THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN AC!!!!!!!  Nails are another concern on Taxol.  I just use Sally Hansen \"Hard as Nails\" everyday.  No problems yet. I did tell my MO that I feel the \"Restless Leg\" at night, not srong but mildly...she said no holding anything cold or hot.  When the weather gets colder wear gloves outside.  Keep slippers outside the bathroom as to not walk on cold bathroom floors.  Any hot and cold sensations aggravate nerves in our hands and feet. I am going to the acupuncturist next week ..I'll let you know how that goes. Every minute is a little bit closer to the finish line... Madelyn  I said it before and I'll say it again...a little restless leg is soooo much better than the \"crap queasy half speed mack truck hitting feeling\" of AC. ",

My AC treatment started at 9:00am and I was out by 12:15.   I didn't really sleep too well last night, kept tossing and turning.   I woke up and just started drinking water and more water.  When I got to the infusion room, the nurses were great.  They had me look over the orders...simple stuff making sure my name was on all the meds.  Lidocaine with saran wrap worked like a champ--I didn't feel a thing.  Saline first...then steroids...then nausea meds.  I didn't realize adriamycin was injected into IV.  This took 15 minutes to get it through-super fast! Nurse whispered to me and said it would make my urine pink.  She was right.  Cytoxan was fine also.  I had the ice chips and before I knew it it was over.  I go back tomorrow for a neulasta shot--I'll make sure to take my claritin an hour before I go.  So, so far so good.  I realize the steroids are helping me get through and will wear off by tomorrow...but until then I hope to be SE free and wish the same for all of you. All my respect and love, Madelyn ",

Well, it is day 3 of my first Taxol Treatment. If this is what I can expect --then things are looking good girls.  Because of the steroids, sleep was hard the first night, a lot of tossing and turning, just trying to get comfortable.  But no nasty half speed queasy feeling.  During AC, Fridays were my \"out for the count days\" and now I feel good.  My appetite is good, a little too good...I've gained a little weight :(  Now, I understand that Taxol can be cumulative, so maybe there are harder days ahead...but for now I am enjoying getting out and catching up on errands.  \"Life is not the way it's supposed to be.  It's the way it is.  The way you cope with it is what makes all the difference.\" Have a good weekend... ",

Sorry I was \"absent\" for a while my daughter came down with Strep Throat and it was like \"code blue\" in my house.  I have tried to be so good --washing hands, using shirt to open public doors and now this!  I called my onc and I had to take a  Z-pack of antibotics just to be safe.  But of course the antibotics do a number on the stomach--ahh good times.   Tellballmom and I must be kindred spirits.  I too was looking into acupuncture--as a way to counteract any joint/bone pain!  But my onc didn't give me a coupon for it like some people :) Before all of this I was such a believer in vitamins and supplements.  I love reading and learning about the newest and best....I just read about turkey Tail(help immune system) and glutamate(great for stomach) today....but with my taste buds the only thing that sounds good is Taco Bell and Yoo-hoos.  Go figure... My sense of smell is crazy.  I could moonlight as a bomb sniffing dog.  Don't know why, but some plastics just seem to smell horrible. My complexion is gettting better...I used to have clogged pores-those seem to have \"cleared\"  Maybe it is the chemo, I was trying to convince myself it was all the chicken bean burritos from Taco Bell. I've tried to read all the discussion posts for TAXOL, and it seems to be really doable.  Everyone seems to have VERY different experiences with additional hair falling out and when it returns.  And yes--I'm holding on to each eyebrow hair--they have thinned but the pencil with brush on the end does fill in nicely!  Taxol bloggers seem to really hate the Benadryl that they get with Taxol.  I'm thinking I will definitely have someone drive me since I know how that effects me--just makes me very tried.  No biggie though.    People have mentioned a couple of different things for nails...soaking in olive oil a couple of minutes/per day, icing during tx, I'm going to use Sally Hansen \"Hard As Nails\"  because the onc nurse recommended it.  Some people said they lost toe nails, one woman said it might be do to the fact she walks 3 miles/day.  They do grow back.   As far as the neuropathy is concerned, the whole reason why we are on a weekly basis is so we can communicate with our doctors and they can adjust our tx.  It seemed 50-50 with the women on the other blog who had pain and those that didn't.  Again ...a little joint pain sounds sooooo much better than gagging on my own metal tasting saliva.   My concern about Taxol is--Will I have a down day(s) and how long will it last. When doing this weekly we don't leave ourselves much time to bounce back if we are down for more than one day.   It seems to be Day 3 is the \"down\" day when the steroids run out but can last one to three days depending on the individual experience.    I asked my onc nurses about Taxol and will it be cumulative.  They told me that if any side effects show up it will be around tx 5-6.  Wow..do I actually get a break here?  Sounds good to me. My first Taxol is Wednesday...I will let you know how it goes! Please everyone have a safe and relaxing Labor Day Holiday, hugs to all!  xoxo  Madelyn ",

I finished AC chemo and I'm now on Taxol.  Next week will be #5 out of 12.  So far so good. Taxol is so much better than AC!   I hope you feel great and keep up the good spirit! ",
