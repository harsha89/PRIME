I ended up having 5 nodes removed (all tested negative for BC post chemo) + radiation. Took a while to recover, but my arm feels normal now - no problems. I based my decision on a second opinion I received from a major cancer center, as well as the results of the Z2011 study - landmark study which showed that SNB is not inferior to ALND in cases where there is limited node involvement. Posting a couple of links to the study, and hope it helps future sisters facing a similar dilemma make the best decision for them. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21304082",

The complicating factor for me is that I had neoadjuvant chemo without fully assessing the nodes (one appeared enhanced on imaging and palpation).  But now, we won't know if the nodes are clear because of chemo or if they were always clear.  Based on your signature, it looks like you had SNB before chemo, is that correct? Do you by chance know....if SNB post chemo can determine if nodes were previously positive?  Also, if nodes are negative post chemo, is that as good as if they were always negative?  (I will probably have radiation to the axilla).  This is the crux of my dilemma over whether SNB is sufficient or if ALND is the more prudent route.",

I sought a second opinion and the surgeon suggested performing an SNB at the time of my lumpectomy; if a quick section shows nodes are negative, no ALND, but even one positive node buys me a ticket to ALND.  Like most, worried about the long term side effects. Interested in learning if anyone had chemo first and how lymph nodes were managed in this situation?  Would also love to hear how you're doing post ALND and length of recovery.",

Leaning towards doing the SNB first, and hopefully we'll be able to determine if cancer was in the nodes at some point. If not, may proceed to ALND.  Afterall, we can always take out more, but can't put anything back once its gone. ",

All these different treatment choices makes treatment almost as stressful as the diagnosis! ",
