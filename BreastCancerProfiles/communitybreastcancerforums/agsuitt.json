There I was, a wife with nine (yes, 9) children. When they gave me the news, I couldn't imagine HOW to tell my family (I got my news over the phone). My husband lost his first wife to this horrible disease. So I had to tell him and my stepkids that they had to go through this again. Not to mention my two biological children and the rest of my family. On my first consultation with the surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist (they were all in the same day), I had TWELVE people with me. That was my first clue that I would not be fighting alone. It's scary. And it sucks. But you CAN get through it. These ladies here are amazing. Just reading some of the posts has helped me so much during my fight.We support each other because we are all in this together. Good luck and I'll be praying for you.",
