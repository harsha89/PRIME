I'm pretty sure federal law requires insurance companies to cover breast reconstruction after mastectomy.This forum won't allow me to post links--I think you have to post a certain number of times first--but you can google \"The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act\" I don't know for sure, but I would think little to no growth means that it's just adh and nothing else underlying. If it were cancer, it seems it would be DCIS and confined to the duct and they would likely get it all during surgery.",

It's not something they can see when they operate, which is why they use the wire guide, though to be honest, I really don't quite get how that works. Once you get the pathology back from the surgery, you'll see how much they removed, or you can ask. The scar from my adh surgery from 7 years ago is about 1.5 inches. Two weeks does sound like a long time, but I guess if you do a lot of lifting and physical support of patients, that could be why. I found the surgery easier to recover from than the needle biopsy. Good luck! Mine is scheduled for about 3 weeks from now.",

Now I'm dealing with it again (after a benign needle biopsy 2 years ago.) Thanks wonderwoman. I'm meeting with my breast doctor tomorrow and I go to Johns Hopkins, so I feel like I'm in good hands. I did more digging and did find a good source of information generally--Annals of Surgical Oncology. I did a search of \"atypical ductal hyperplasia\" and found a bunch of studies--all one page abstracts, so not too hard to read. The most recent was from Jan 2017 and basically said that women who have don't have surgery and are followed closely are at no higher risk for developing breast cancer than women who do have surgery. BUT, women who had ADH and surgery and were \"upgraded\" to cancer were excluded from the study. So they only looked at women whose surgery still just showed ADH, and women who didn't have surgery. But I guess those women who didn't have surgery were at no higher risk of cancer. So it's a little confusing. I also wonder if the women who DID have surgery just had higher risk to begin with. I tried to post a link, but it wouldn't allow me to. I guess I'm too new here or something? I also found various articles that said that if there are fewer foci or fewer ducts involved (not sure what foci are--I mean I know what they are in math, just not what it means here and my path report didn't say) there is a lower risk for upgrade to cancer after excision, so excision may not be necessary. But it does seem like excision is still the standard of care because they really just don't have enough information. I'll find this out tomorrow, but I'm worried that I'll need a mastectomy because my breast is so small and I already had a lumpectomy for ADH 7 years ago. So that opens a whole new can of worms with deciding on reconstruction or not and if so what kind and what about making the other breast match. Part of me feels that my breast is so small, I'd hardly notice if it were gone and the feminist in me thinks I shouldn't care (and I'm 52 and married and don't need to impress anyone with my body). But another part finds the idea upsetting and yet another part thinks that if I have deal with this shit, I should get reconstruction and come out of it with bigger boobs and actually be able to fit into clothes properly.",

I found this: On analyzing the women's absolute risk of breast cancer from the time of biopsy, they found that it increased by more than 1% each year; 7% of women had developed the disease after 5 years, 13% had developed it after 10 years, while 30% developed breast cancer 25 years after biopsy. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287536.p... I'm 7 years past my first adh diagnosis. uneedaklu, yes, it's scary. But for me, I just really make a decision not to worry until I need to worry. It doesn't always work, but it mostly does. I first had adh in 2011. Then another concerning mammo followed by needle biopsy in 2016. That was one was negative. Then another concerning mammo in March 2018. I was in tears thinking about yet another needle biopsy just 2 years after the last one. But I calmed down and awaited results. Adh again, so surgery. Again. I was actually not worried about the surgery, except getting the IV, which can be hard on me. And the area was small, so I wasn't expecting cancer. I've had 2 surgeries now and both times it was easier to recover from than the needle biopsy. But yes, after the most recent mammo, I was ready to hack that breast off. Then I started reading about mastectomies and the decision to live flat or get reconstruction and decided that that all sounded really complicated and I wanted to keep my breast. Even though it's small, they were able to remove the adh and keep the breast. I may look into plastic surgery, because now it's smaller than the other by a good bit, but the point is, yes, I feel that way sometimes. I have a follow up mammo in September because there were 3 areas of microcalcs, 2 had changed so they biopsied the 2, and one was adh, which they removed. So there are still 2 areas of microcalcs that need to be followed. If that mammo is ok, I think I go back to yearly screening. If it's not ok and they want another needle biopsy, I may just lose it at that point and tell them to go straight to surgery and take it off. Of course, I'm guessing insurance won't cover that and I'd have to get the needle biopsy first. In any case, I'm just not worrying about it until I get results. I'll go for my mammo in September and see what happens. I'll see my breast doctor in Oct for next steps. Hang in there. This is new for you. People handle it and process it in different ways and freaking out a little is totally normal.",

Some percentage of that will happen sooner rather than later. And I think they check every 6 months for 2 years to check the area that was of concern. If it doesn't change in 2 years, then it's not as much of a concern anymore. I don't know. I can do math, but I was always bad at statistics. I should ask my kids. My doc has recommended yearly MRIs in addition to yearly mammos (once I'm allowed to go back to yearly mammos), so I'd be checked twice a year. So far I've declined the MRIs. Just seems like more false positives and injecting bad stuff into your body. But it would be a check of some kind every 6 months.",

After excisional biopsy, my breast surgeon suggested seeing an oncologist, which I did, and I declined medication. I think I had mammos every 6 months for 2 years, then back to annual, but I'm not sure. Then in 2016 I had another area of concern (microcalcs), but this time a needle biopsy was clear. I was again sent for mammos every 6 months for 2 years to keep an eye on the area. At the last one of these every-6-month mammos, they found 2 areas of microcalcs that had changed. I had them both needle biopsied and one showed adh. Had surgery last week and just saw my bs for a followup. Different surgeon than the first time. She said to get a mammo in 6 months because the *other* microcalc is still there. If nothing has changed, then I'll go back to annual. But the microcalc that had adh is gone, so if it were just that, I wouldn't have to go in 6 months. So that may be where your bs is coming from. That was my understanding anyway. And she writes my mammo orders, not the radiologist. She decides the course of action. I was under her care (she is a breast specialist) before this round of adh was found. She has not sent me to an oncologist. nash, I'm in the same boat. Right boob is now a good bit smaller than the left. I got the names of some plastic surgeons today from y bs. I don't know if I'll do anything, but I will explore my options. I don't know if insurance covers post-lumpectomy \"reconstruction\" or just post-mastectomy.",

Had a needle biopsy of 2 suspicious areas on Tuesday. Results today--adh in one area. I have a consultation with my breast doctor next week. I'm wondering about over-treatment. I read that adh isn't cancer, but then read that after cutting it out, sometimes it's found to actually be dcis or invasive cancer. And the percentage seems high--15-20%. And Robin, who posted above, is getting mastectomy because she's so tired of this cycle. I remember reading about some women doing that and thought it was crazy when there's no actual cancer, but now I completely get it. I'm tired of this and this is only the 2nd time (3rd biopsy) finding anything. I'm pretty sure my doctor will recommend surgery, but I'm worried that my breast is too small to do a lumpectomy. Another dr told me last time (when it was benign) that if I needed surgery, I might have to get a mastectomy. Does anyone know of a good source of research with statistics on adh upgrade to cancer?",

She did, however, do a risk assessment on me. After my last needle biopsy, I had to go for mammos every 6 months, but this time my breast surgeon (I wasn't under her care last time) said that I just need to go 6 months after surgery, and if that looks ok, then go back to yearly.
