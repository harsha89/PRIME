No reconstruction, so hoping for a fast recovery. On the subject of bras, any suggestions for what to wear a week after? Don't want to be lopsided when meeting the extended family at Christmas.",

      "Content": "Dec 11, 2013 01:18AM - edited Dec 11, 2013 01:19AM by Undercat Most breast cancers are painless, but that doesn't mean all are. Some women do experience pain. But it doesn't mean what you're experiencing is cancer. I had some very similar symptoms (itchiness, pain that ranged from dull to shooting, an area of increased thickness that felt like a lump, a slightly \"thicker\" breast overall, no change with menstrual cycle). I also had bloody nipple discharge. I had a surgical excision (I wanted the lump out: it hurt!) and it turned out to be stromal fibrosis, which is benign. (The nipple discharge, otoh, was a sign of cancer in my case. But the lump wasn't.) Make an appointment. It's probably not cancer, but if it is, you need to know. Btw, ever since I had that fibrous growth taken out, I haven't experienced any breast pain aside from healing from the surgery, which was quick and easy. Edited to say: imaging saw absolutely nothing in my case, so be prepared for that possibility.",
