I've had pain from fibrocystic breast disease for yrs and had diagnostic mammograms every yr since I turned 40 last yr I forgot but I'd been having pain on my left side and up into my left shoulder blade. The night before my mammo and ultrasound I began to spontaneously bleed out of that left nipple so I know how scared you feel especially since I'm 45 and the dairy has been closed for 23 yrs now so to speak!!!! I told them when I went in about the new symptom and they were very thorough doing my mammo and ultrasound they were both perfectedly normal. The radiologist came in and told me if the bleeding contined to see a surgeon ASAP so I had a lumpectomy on jan 21 just 3.5 wks ago and even though my surgeon thought I should just wait a few months to see if it stopped um no buddy I don't think so well the biopsy came back benign but it says I have atypical ductal hyperplasia which is pre cancerous but he took a large section well 10 cm x 4 cm x 2 cm but the margins were clear so it means no unhealthy cells were found it was all in the duct the milk duct. So had I waited a few months who knows I am following up with my doc on Monday to see what the next step is but you are young so most likely its a duct that got irritated somehow and its nothing to lose sleep over but you still need to have it thoroughly checked out to be safe had I never had any bleeding I would have never known in my case which given my age and medical history is so different then yours I am very lucky my body let me know something wasn't right and like I said dont panic just be proactive have it thoroughly checked out and if you get the sense that your not comfortable with your doctors explanation then see someone else you have age on your side and just keep your spirits up. No matter what the outcome you will be just fine. Much love & prayers All my best to you <3",

Remember to do your yearly diagnostic mammo & u/s. I'm like WTF did you mot understand? The only reason I saw the surgeon was b/cause the night before the mammo I started bleeding out of that side told the rad tech they took extra pis and I very lengthy u/s radiologist came in and said everything looks great but if the bleeding doesn't stop see a surgeon ASAP . Had I never bled I never would have seen the surgeon so its not like they can just keep going in there looking for trouble She totally put all her faith in mammos and u/s next yr as what I should do from here on out. I was expecting what I've read here and everywhere else that I'd be closely followed and perhaps an MRI. She acted like I was asking for some radical voodoo or the like. No I won't stop the University hospital in Denver is an hr away they are one of the 61 places listed by some accredited cancer organization as having an high level clinic and treatment facility. I found the link on another board I shouldn't have even wasted my time today I'm about ready to voluntarily have them removed its too stressful with 3 kids by myself and my oldest isnt well I need to be realistic I'm 45 as long as I'm healthy and my kids are healthy nothing else really matters.

I had a lumpectomy in Jan due to BND and chronic pain in my L breast and up in to my shoulder. Surgeon took a large amount of suspicious looking tissue out - path report dx ADH. Was told that due to my hx of being on HRT for 16 yrs, having very large dense breasts mammo & u/s haven't been useful diagnostically and being a DES daughter, my PCP advised me a consult with an oncologist would be the next logical step. And I wanted to know whether any bloodwork specifically the blood test that can determine if your able to suppress tumors etc . She had t had a chance to review any of my medical records so she asked me to tell her why I was there to see her etc. when I asked her given my hx if a MRI would be warranted and she's said no yearly mammos and ultrasounds would be able to find anything suspicious - this is 10 seconds after I told her they failed to pick up a 10 cm x 4.5 cm x 2 cm mass of In my surgeons words \"junk\" When I explained to her that I needed a treatment plan in re the path report that dx said mass as ADH with none present at any margins, she said no you don't have ADH im it seeing that stated anywhere on here I had to tell her its the second line under diagnosis she looked at it again and said \"Oh okay I missed that\"' and she's skimming thru my surgical report and post op notes she asks me why I \"enjoy going to the ER so frequently cause it says here you went 3 times over the course of ten days just because you had some bruising and one of those times was by ambulance just 5 hrs after you were discharged from the surgery center\" well I told her I woke up from surgery in the most extreme pain I've ever had and pleaded with them to let me stay overnight because in 90 minutes 6 doses of hydromorphone was given to me thru my IV and I was still crying I was afraid to be sent home in that much pain. If IV pain meds aren't giving me any relief how was I to expect pain pills at home were going to help?? And I didn't just have some swelling and brushing I had a massive hematoma that was getting worse by the day I was running a fever and couldn't sleep my pain was so intense and I luckily I had taken a photo of it ( originally to send to my surgeon cause it was after hrs and I knew it wasn't normal but he refused to let me send it cause he was sure it wasn't any thing he hasn't seen before) so I pull it up on my phone and she immediately apologize that no that would be alarming and it must have been extremely painful (yeah I know smh) Then I'm trying to ask her what she think my risk factor is and what I can do to lessen my chances etc and she tells me well since you had it removed \"its obvious your risk factor of getting breast cancer is practically non exsistent \" Then she starts asking me all these personal questions about my life and how they relate to the whole reason I wanted a consultation with her I will never know. \" how do you cope with your sons illness, who all lives with you, where does your daughter to to school, is my son able to work, do you ever get respite care for him, did you graduate high school, did you go to college, what's your degree in, did you ever work in that field, why not, do you have any family in town. are you in a romantic relationship, what's a normal day like for you, do you have any close friends that you could turn to if you were to ever develop bc, is that all your real hair, do you want to have any more children, where did you get that Coach bag it must have been a fortune how could you afford that and qualify for Medicaid, why do you take Ativan and how long have you been on it ????????????? I can't you how upset I am that she didn't answer any of my questions, a huge waste of my time and I can only guess as to why she was so dismissive. Maybe I shouldn't have listed my sons disability and mental illness on the intake form. I don't know where she was going with all that, was she trying to determine if I had some type of disorder that caused me to have a rough recovery from the lumpectomy?? I did everything they suggested I never was rude or demanding or thought I knew better than anyone else, Its not my fault I couldn't get my reg bra or the extra sports bra I brought to wear after home from the surgical center, I asked to be ace bandaged, my daughter asked if they could ace bandage me to prevent swelling and support , they refused both times, no one warned me if I didn't compress the surgical site it would swell up and cause serious problems that would take weeks to resolve and its not my fault I had to have ER surgery 10 days after to evacuate the area or that I got a staph infection . But that's how I honesy felt when I left her office with none of my questions answered. Like I had caused all my post op complications and was over reacting about my path report. So there's my rant I'm just so upset and I'm no further ahead in understanding what I can do if anything to prevent myself from someday developing bc. ( Oh and the Coach bag I got at Goodwill in Boulder for $15, while my son was an inpatient at the hospital across the street) now I feel guilty for having one nice thing that's how much she frazzled my nerves Dx ADH 01/27/2013 Surgery 1/24/2013 Lumpectomy: Left Dx 1/27/2013 Dx 1/27/2013, 6cm+, 0/0 nodes Log in to post a reply",

I talked to my PCP who is going to refer my to a good ob/gyn whose also known to be proactive with her patients who've had breast issues. Also because my mother took DES there is a special type of pap I'm suppose to be having every year that my PCP whose a resident (2nd yr student) doesn't have the experience and would feel I'd get better care with this new ob/gyn so that's next week. So at least they're trying to get this resolved my surgeon who was just a general surgeon isn't willing to write an order for a MRI of my breasts he said I'm just being paranoid and he's sure \"I have nothing to worry about because he removed it all\" so I want to ask if hell put that in writing so if I don't get to convince the ob/gyn that i would really like to have a MRI. I have made an appt in Denver at the University hospital as a backup they have a high risk clinic and take Medicaid I thank you all for your advice and taking the x to share your thoughts For some reason I just am feeling like I have to get a MRI done soon maybe its just me being anxious or the fact that my son is stable and I don't know how long that will last so I just want to get something's taken care of and have a plan in place. I need to make sure I'm taking care of myself so I can be there for him. Thanks again you ladies are amazing !!!! Love & prayers to everyone for good health & happiness have a lovely evening 😊",

      "Content": "ElleRusin69 wrote: Ok this all kinda went in not the normal order of how things are suppose to go. I am 45 had diagnostic mammo and US in early January. Have always had very dense heavy fibrocystic breasts. Suppose to go every yr since I was 40 but last yr I just spaced it out. In October began having pain in L breast and pain up into L shoulder blade saw PCP she thought it was just hormonal but I disagreed since why would only one breast hurt and I had a total hysterectomy in 1997 she couldn't tell since I'm so fibrocystic So the night before my mammo my L breast starts spontaneously bleeding bright red blood no warning nothing had touched it just felt my shirt was wet looked in my bra and omg scared the hell out of me. Called my PCP next am before I had test done just do she knew and if she wanted anything else done shed have 6 hrs to send over orders. Told the tech about the BND she lets radiologist know they do a few extra images of that L breast then I go across the hall for an ht long ultrasound which hurt like I've never had one that painful before I know they are trying to find anything to explain bleeding. Radiologist comes in after days everything is fine nothing suspicious BUT if the bleeding continues you see a surgeon ASAP So of course after a few days of reading what BND could indicate and it keot randomly bleeding I called around and took the 1st appt I could he was a general surgeon in a large practice nurse assured me he could take care of my problem he does breast surgeries at least twice a week. So I meet with him he says its prolly nothing your imaging test are all normal just give it a few months I'm like no way I want to know why its happening what's the best way for u to figure it out ? He suggests removing the duct that's bleeding and having it biopsied . Awesome how soon can we do this had surgery 4 days later. Wake up in horrible pain nurse says something like well lumpectomies are painful hun especially when you have alot of tissue removed ?? So I'm a little confused but thinking ok if he saw something abnormal its a good thing he removed it .just nothing could have ever prepared me for that intense pain had 3 c sections and a hysterectomy I know you are going to wake up in pain but I ended up crying cause nothing they put in my IV helped. He stops by tells me to calm done and I ask to be admitted scared to go home in that much pain he rolls his eyes at me says there was alot of gritty fibrous junk in there so I took it all out and I think the duct that was causing the bleeding has a very small tumor or papilloma but I didn't open it up I kept intact with the rest of the tissue and sent it to pathology. Ill call you next week Next week comes nurse calls very excited to tell me everything's fine nothing to worry about !!!! Next x I went in I asked for a copy of my path report got a little resistance why do you want it ? You wont understand it anyway !? Wow really they gave it to me cause I wasn't leaving without it and I read the dx which said 10cm x4cm x 2 cm tissue sample... Dx atypical ductal hyperplasia none at margin then some other stuff that I know now isn't significant. So after that I started searching and getting upset. I know I should be and I am very grateful it wasn't cancerous but it would have been nice to know something was not quite right. At my last appt last week the surgeon said oh that's nothing to worry about it just increases your risk of getting breast cancer but its not pre cancerous DCIS is precancerous what you have is not considered to be pre cancerous. Stop looking for trouble where there is none he says So in an hr I have to go back to my PCP who got my radiology report which said nothing's wrong repeat in a yr. the radiologist never mentions I have visible BND and her rec to see a surgeon. So now my PCP is aware of all this now but what the next step?? I really want some more imaging done I want to see an oncologist I want a treatment plan I am seen by the residents student docs at the local hospital so this isn't their forte what if anything should be done now since my mammo and US were normal I don't want to rely on those to find anything else. My shoulder pain is still there I'm still taking estrogen don't know if I should stop and oh yes my mother was given DES shots to prevent miscarriage when she was pregnant with me. So sorry this is so long I'm just lost ANY advice as to what's the next step would be greatly appreciated!!!!

I felt like I was better prepared and it really helped me calm down, which for me is sometimes a struggle before any of this started. And I was the last patient of the day so he spent over 45 minutes taking to us -I brought my daughter along she's almost 18 and would never had let me go alone she's very mature & level headed always has been So my PCP recommends sending me to see an oncologist whom ironically I had met before and I was very impressed with her -,my oldest son is disabled he has schizo affective disorder and Aspbergers one of the only medicines that has helped control his pychosis can cause your immune system to fail so monthly blood tests for past 5 yrs he's never had any labs come back abnormal its a rare but serious side effect this past September he had a 104 fever and nothing I gave him brought his temp down took him in they ran labs and his immune system markers were bottomed out so they admitted him to the oncology unit and pulled off all his psychiatric meds that was the scariest week of my life he's only 23 and such a great kid and to see him come unglued in order to figure out what was going on just about broke my heart anyhow that's how I met the oncologist I'm going to be seeing next wk she also took the time to answer all my questions addressed all my concerns etc he was so sick they were thinking of doing a bone marrow biopsy thank God in a few days his labs came back up to normal and they slowly added his meds back on board and he continued to improve they never figured out what caused that to happen but I felt like he was in good hands with her - I got the sense that she truly cared about as much as I did about him . To me personally that's a huge factor in deciding whom I'm going to let take care of my kids especially when its as serious situation as that was So ok getting back to me and getting a treatment plan going yes my PCP strongly urged me to stop taking my estrogen but I am on a very low dose and don't take it every day when I forget to take it for 4 or 5 days I am not right in the head I have trouble finding the right words I struggle to communicate I know it sounds bizzare but its how having no estrogen in my body affects me mentally. Like I have dementia and I get really emotional over the slightest things. Now I know that might sound assinine to think I'd rather be emotionally stable and be able to be articulate vs reducing my risk of developing cancer but I am the sole caregiver for my 23 yr old son whom is doing well and after yrs of hell is making some progress and has been stable , so if I come unglued he's overly empathetic and can become very obsessive over things so much so he can become paranoid so its not his fault its just how his brain works everything is either black or white it takes alot of discussion to get him to see the shades if grey and its emotionally draining on me and my other 2 younger kids so until I know for sure what I'm dealing with ill cut back as much as I can on the estrogen but there's no way I'd stop cold turkey . I've got to keep myself together and my PCP understood he just would feel better if I stopped completely . But I don't smoke drink take drugs I eat organically and keep my weight around 120 I'm 5 ft nothing and I think I have 10 lbs of breast tissue I'm a 34 DD some bras DDD so though this may sound totally insane I'd be willing to have a BMX if I could have reconstructive either done at the same x or shortly thereafter if it meant I could still take a very low dose of estrogen. My PCP was very surprised I was willing to go to that extreme but with my sons illness I have to be stable there is no one else willing to step up plus being his caregiver is my only source of income he requires 30 hrs a week of care from medication management to protective oversight. I've been struggling for yrs raising 3 kids all by self and trying to care for him until the social worker finally told me about a little none program that he qualifies for being disabled its been around for yrs would have been helpful to have learned about it 5 yrs ago when he really hit his lowest point and had a total psychotic breakdown so yeah my stress level over the yrs has been pretty high to say the very least but he's my son and he's not ever been violent or aggressive to anyone or anything if that were the case then no I would have to had him institutionalized. I would never put my other kids safety at risk or my own if he had any aggressive behaviors . I'm very realistic and have my priorities straight at least for me . It isnt easy sometimes but it could be so much worse. So thats what I'm seriously considering given the fact that I've always had too much boobage and I'd love to be able to not get constantly asked who did my augmentation but more importantly if I can reduce my risk dramatically now by such a huge percent then to me and for my families sake I don't really want to be living in fear I don't do well with what to me would feel like a 300 lb weight on my chest , so well see what the oncologist says and go from there Thanks for letting me vent and ramble on . I do so appreciate anyone's advice or differing opinion We've all got our own battles to fight and personal reasons for our decisions For me this just seems to be what feels right . Love & prayers of hope to you all Elle",

I don't know if it would help to ask your mom to try and remember how she felt when she had to go thru this? Was she scared? Who was there for her? Or calmly explain you feel like she doesn't care and that's making your anxiety worse. Maybe no one was supportive and she had to deal with it alone and now you're going having to go thru this brings back bad memories for her.
