I kept thinking something must be wrong, but never could figure it out. I now know that is what it was. I have completed my surgeries and am waiting to start radiation, so I will probably continue the fatigue for awhile. I've started anastrozole and my body aches. Not sure if this is just a side effect of the Als or not. ",

I too was DCIS grade 2,  but in my right breast. I've talked with the oncologist for radiation but he hasn't given options yet. We're waiting for the path from the sentinel node surgery and the Oncotype test. I hope all goes well with your surgery and path results. XOXO ((hugs))",

I'm so ready to get this over with too. So glad they got the pockets drained for you. I know it feels better. So far, so good on mine. I'm back to work today but trying to take it slow. Let me know how it goes moving forward. ((hugs)) to all.",
