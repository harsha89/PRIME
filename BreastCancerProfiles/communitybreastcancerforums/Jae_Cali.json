I had a routine mammogram in November, was called back in the following week for a repeat mammogram with ultrasound. The following week I was sent for a stereotactic biopsy. I was officially told I had DCIS the day before Thanksgiving. It has been scary and overwhelming to say the least. I feel like there is pressure to \"make a decision\" even though at times I do not know what it should be. I do not have breast cancer history in my family, so this diagnosis came as a shock! I started reading about DCIS and options\u2026 Since it is Stage 0, I opted for a lumpectomy, which seemed to be the reasonable choice. Surgery was preformed January 11th. There was a delay getting the pathology report (two weeks). My surgeon called to let me know that my case needed to be presented to the Tumor Board (the board meets next week). Due to the location of the DCIS, my surgeon was not able to get the enough margins, as it was against the chest bone. I will find out next week what the verdict is and may potentially have to have surgery again. I have met with the oncologist (and honestly, I really didn't know what to ask since I had not reviewed my pathology results before the appointment). I will be meeting with the RadOnc next week to discuss radiation therapy. However, depending on the outcome of the discussions at the Tumor Board, therapy might be delayed. I was finally able to read my pathology report (yesterday) and after reading my results, high nuclear grade DCIS, I'm concerned about the potential for reoccurring cancer. I feel conflicted about what to do and I'm now questioning if a mastectomy is a better option given the grade. I would love to hear your experiences and thoughts about this. Scared and conflicted!
