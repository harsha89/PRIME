It is the absolute best thing ever written, and even though a few years old it's still right on the money, every word of it. My wife was home two hours after her surgery. I was the primary, only, caregiver, changing the drainage bag, cleaning her with those packaged wash cloths, showering with her, and being absolutely terrified and trying not to show it.  You're going to feel very marginalized for the next six months to two years. All the focus and attention will be on her, as it should be. But it's tough for the guy. Silver's best advice is, \"shut up and listen.\"  I'll check back here to see if you have specific questions. My wife chose not to get reconstruction. she asked me and I said I couldn't care less. If after 30 years she wasn't more more than a pair of matching boobs, then I would have been a single giant boob. The heck with your paying job. Your new job is taking care of her for a while, even though there are limits on what you can do. Looking back it's still horrible, but last year our older daughter had our first grandchild, and when my wife picks him up she looks as young and happy in the face as she did more than 30 years ago.  Get the book and read it now. Trust me.",

If the news from the biopsy is not good, the surreality continues and increases but the fear can decline. On the other hand you're likely in a survivable situation. Since my wife was diagnosed, had surgery and chemo I've come to know many breast cancer survivors. In fact I do not know anyone who has died from the disease initially or from recurrence (my wife ended up having a lumpectomy a year after chemo on the remaining breast). It sucks, it's terrifying, it truly is surreal. There is no return to \"normal\" because those days are gone. But we now have a one-year old grandson, and when my wife picks him up her face is brighter and as pretty as it was 35 years ago.",

Do not, whatever you decide, base your decision on anyone but yourself. My wife did ask me, and I said I couldn't care less. If all she was to me after 30 years was two matching boobs I should have had an elective head-ectomy. She chose simply to get a (pretty realistic feeling) prosthesis and a special bra with a pocket from Nordstrom's (the weenies at Macy's stopped the service). Around the house she wears t-shirts and no bra, but going out all looks just fine. I occasionally ask her to \"whip out righty\" (which subsequently had a lumpectomy too), which she declines but finds hilarious and laughs her butt off. Ask for support but be your own counsel and take your own choice.",
