Still nurse my 2 year old, right breast only. She never liked nursing on the left side. I do express it (the left side) a tiny bit once daily just so it doesn't dry up, but we're talking drops. Two weeks ago, my left breast started hurting, excruciating to the touch, in the inner lower area only. Hurts nonstop, no burning or itching. Just a constant sharp pain. No lumps felt, everything looks the same. I called the gyno first and have an appt next week. Just wondering what yours turned out to be and if it resolved?",
