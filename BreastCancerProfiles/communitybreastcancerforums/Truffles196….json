The scheduler is trying to coordinate the doctors and the OR to get me in the first week of December, so I am calming down, 2 weeks earlier is 2 weeks of less stress. They think they will be able to tell me a date on Monday the 9th (my original surgery date). Dtad that is exactly what the surgical oncologist at Hopkins said, the surgery is not a medical emergency since ILC is a slow growing cancer. It has been there for a long time- but I didn't know it. Now that I know I want it OUT :-) Lekker thank you for that idea, if I did neoadjuvant I would feel like I was doing something to get the cancer but they don't do it pre surgery for my size tumor. This is such a wonderful support network, I would be lost without it.",

How do you all know your grade and stage and node involvement before surgery? I was told I would find out after the surgery from the oncologist, who I meet after the surgery.",
