      "Content": "Jun 22, 2018 01:12PM VVV wrote: I just finished day 9 of radiation. I've had very little skin reaction so far and I'm happy to be done for the weekend. I also restarted herceptin infusions but side effects for both aren't bad so far. I'm feeling a bit healthier because they put me on a beta blocker & I've been getting a lot of walking in since I'm using public transit to get to my appointments every day. 6+ hours walking each week for the past three weeks with a little bit of other exercise thrown in. I can't believe how much muscle I lost during chemo. It's ridiculous! I can only do the easiest of exercises right now but I'm hoping to graduate to more strenuous stuff again soon. Daniz, it's good to hear from you and it sounds like you're in good hands with your new oncologist. I'm happy you were able to find another treatment option even if it does mean more chemo. GenevaC, taking a few weeks sounds smart. I'm feeling pretty worn out as well and had an especially tough time first starting radiation. I had some sort of anxiety attack that forced me to figure out what contributed and I realized there were a lot of things stressing me out constantly so I've been working on minimizing stress and so far it's helping me feel less overwhelmed & hopefully it stays that way! Mindy- I think the best part about the herceptin study is I'd feel a bit more comfortable if I had to stop infusions early. I think it's such a big jump to go from 12 to 6 months that they probably need more evidence first.",
