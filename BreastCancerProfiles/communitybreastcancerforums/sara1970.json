Of course I'm bummed out about this, but the research I've done in the past few days tells me it could be much worse. I live n NYC and have scheduled consults with Dr. Elisa Port and Dr. Alexandra Heerdt. Can anyone respond here (or PM) if you've worked with either of them, or give me other ideas for consults? One can see me next week, the other not for 3 weeks... I really want to get this started. Is it worth it to wait for that 2nd consult, or am I putting myself in danger by waiting to make a surgical decision?  Also, because I have very small breasts, a mastectomy seems probable. Could anyone point me to any info on the pros and cons of reconstruction?  Thanks in advance.   BMX with TE's on 6-27-11: IDC/LCIS/DCIS on R + LCIS on L Dx 5/27/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Shira - are you saying that you believe that MSK has inadequate plastic surgeons, or that you were just disappointed in that they would not give larger implants? Your post implies that you suggest women go elsewhere for recon. I would like to know if anyone here believes that MSK has plastic surgeons who are at the top of their game insofar as the actual surgery itself, drama-free healing, and good rapport with patients. I am not concerned with size.  When someone states that MSK does \"not have good options for plastic surgery\" that freaks me out... I thought they had one of the top breast cancer teams in the country. Ladies? Help! ",

Port and Heerdt, and honestly I could've gone either way. Obviously both are at the very top of their field. I thought things went astonishingly smoothly at MSK - I ended up seeing a genetic counselor and tested for BRCA, and had an additional MRI. From place to place, it was seamless. That said, I'm choosing MSK. With my relatively young age (40) and likelihood of genetic mutations (1/2 Ashkenazi descent) - I'm opting for a double mast although the 1 cm tumor on the R side is all they can see as of now. Dr. Heerdt works with 3 surgeons, and one of them is Joe Disa - of whom I've only heard good things.  I certainly wouldn't mind some feedback from you ladies if you think I'm making a sound decision. Again, many, MANY thanks to you - the comments and notes I've received have been an amazing resource. -Sara ",

My tissue expanders started feeling especially hard and clenched-up following the chemo - the onc's nurse swears that it is not related to Chemo - uhhh, okay - sure. They'd been feeling pretty good for the two weeks prior. Anyway, glad to be here. I've enjoyed catching up on the posts on this thread - lots of witty minds and fierce senses of humor.",

I don't think that the satellites would be indicative of lymph node involvement - apparently that can only be determined via a biopsy which would occur during the surgery. I have been 'cramming' before my surgeon's app't next week, and I definitely feel empowered by the information I've gathered. There's lots of info on this site if you have time to comb through it. Would love it if you could say more about \"Mell-MH\" which I've never heard of - I'd love info.  Hoping your appointment goes well tomorrow - if at all possible, bring a close friend or family member with you to take notes along with you, or ask the doc if you can audio- tape the conversation.
