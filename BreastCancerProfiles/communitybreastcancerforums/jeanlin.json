Since I received all of my chemo in CA, and have moved to OR, I was a bit freaked out in general when I started the treatments. I have since learned that the fractionization reduces the total amount of rads that I will receive (a bit) and my treatment will last a total of 22 days, of which I have completed 1/2. Some pinkness, which is increasing as treatment continues, and a bit of difficulty swallowing, which i did not expect. I am using aloe vera for the skin, and monitoring the \"lump in the throat\" this weekend. I am wondering if there are other Inflammatory BC patients who have been undergoing this treatment form., and how you're doing/did with it. Jeanlin 63 years old, diagnosed 3/31/07, TAC chemo started 5/9/07, bilateral mastectomy 8/16/07, Taxol infused 9/8/07, fractionated radiation (2x per day) started 11/ 14/07.",
