There's no way to know for sure if I got a full dose, partial dose, or none. As of now the plan is to check my white cells on 10/5, week after chemo. I just hope I can get my next chemo as planned on 10/12. I am so hoping to stay on schedule so I can be in good shape when my mom visits. Log in to post a reply",
