I am just here to support her choices and spend time together as a family...",

I have actully done the home health eval and when I was not there and they came to check on her she refused to let them in..lol I am a nurse of more then 15 years and have worked hospice many years ago. My mother in law was a social worker in long term care so we have had extensive conversations on her wishes in regards to her end of life choices. I have to say that even with years of nursing experience, I feel the stress when it comes to implimenting the choices we have so often discussed.. I thank everyone on this website as they have been my education and my strength even if I am not posting, just reading helps me understand options and see there are struggles out there like my own...",

She doesn't have a regular MD as she is very anxiety prone and getting her to the onc appt's was a challenge...My question is really when will the onc agree to hospice if my mother in law is refusing all further treatment including scans or repeat PET/CT?I know that she will agree to labwork during clinic visits and maybe by the tumor makers the onc will feel more comfortable ordering Hospice.. I just really feel that we have been left to fend for ourselves at this point... They talk to you if your activly seeking treatment but want nothing to do with you if treatment is refused.....",

She is 74 years old and in the past four years has had 3 complicated operations. A hip repair, Masectomy, and also colon resection each time has had reaction to medications and suffered from what I would call severe dementia and panic disorder.. The AI's that she has taken over the years has caused her general health to decline and increased her pain causing a decrease in quility of life. That is why I trully support her when she stated that she did not want to cont treatment... I do feel that the Onc has put us aside now that we arent active in seeking treatment but will now go the way of social worker... I really find support in this board as my mother in law is unable to trully talk about these issues and alot of it falls onto me...",

We just found out that her Stage III er+pr+ ER2- has mets to her chest wall. Due to her high level of Anxiety and her inability to leave the house alot of the times.The Onc and I have arrived at a plan of care to provide comfort and also fight the mets.. She has changed up her Femera to Aromasin and feels that due to her current symptoms ie:confusion,nausea and weight loss of 20lbs it may have mets further?? The question I have is the hardest to answer that I know. How much time do I have with her ??.. I have to plan for home health or move her in with or closer to us and I don't know if I have months or years to get all these things in order?...I would like to redo a room for her in my home as I promised her I would never place her in Nursing home or Hospice home (she is 73yrs old). Does anyone have any advice to help with time line.. Vicki Log in to post a reply",

I believe this to be because she had hyster many years ago but spent 2 years on tamoxifen..Also area could not be rules out by her left hip. My mother in law has refused all further treatment and the oncologist is very very hesitant to give time frame on life expect ency due to the fact that she is refusing Brian MRI or spinal tap to rule out CNS mets. With my mother inlaws insistence I begged the oncologist to give us a rough time frame so that she could get her stuff in order and we could spend our time together as a family .... The oncologist refused to recommend hospice with-out further testing and gave the time frame of one year?I am discouraged with the care of the whole Onc team and now feel that I am left with taking care of my mother-in law and have no support from the MD because we refused further testing....How long do I have with her and how fast can cancer spread?? Her follow-up appt was made for 4 MONTHS after her last PET scan..She was given Zomag and Xanax and now we are on our own!! Does anyone have any suggestions or assistance in what I could be doing to better assist my mother-in law.... Vicki Log in to post a reply",
