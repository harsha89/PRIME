I have a question for momoschki...I think I read you went to Dr. Guth, I did as well, she also did not recommend the 6 month MRI, and only annual mammo for me. I was trying to research this on this board, found it interesting the one person I could find who was told no mri, went to the same BS, did you get a second opinion?  Thanks ",

After all my research I do not feel comfortable with this plan. It's usually recommended that follow up shoul also consist of something at the 6 month mark as well, usually being an MRI. I also have dense breasts which is another factor. Anyone else struggling with this?",

Going crazy waiting for my appt with BS for wire/biopsy, my core biopsy showed ADH columnar and papillary types , does anyone know much about these subtypes and if they increase the chance of it being DCIS? I have been doing a lot of reading as I wait, but can't find much regarding subtypes of ADH (only DCIS).  thanks everyone!",
