It started about a year out of tx. it kept getting worse, just random episodes of fluttering. Wore the monitor and they were able to catch it when it happened so, now I take a beta-blocker. Cardiologist wouldn't say for sure it was chemo and rads but said it didn't help. The beta-blocker sure makes me \"chill\" which can be a good and bad thing :) But it has helped with the fluttering. My intermammary nodes were + so they had no choice but hit my heart and they warned me ahead of time. Who knows, it is what it is...guess I was having myself a pity party last week. Don't get me wrong I'm so happy that's all it is, just sad things keep coming up for us all.",

I reluctantly decided to tell my MO, she did a CT scan and bone density (due anyway) and I prepared for the worse. After only 5 years on Aromasin, it's happening, osteopenia. I just did a density scan 3 years ago and I was fine....that was quick! As for the clavicle they said it's radiation induced fibrosis to chest and necrosis of the clavicle. I'm already on a beta-blocker because rads damaged my heart (which they won't admit to but I know). I'm only 40!

So I had a few freak out moments over that...it's crazy what we get nervous over. These stories are awesome and needed.",

I think it's the positioning during surgery and I was told there is no cure...just exercises/stretching.   ",

I want to break down but I'm at work so trying to hold it together....save it for the ride home I guess. Like you I've had a terrible cold/sinus infection and I'm hoping its just that. When I ask my dr about this she didn't seem to think it would make them go up. I hate this crap, its so hard to be positive and move on when this stuff happens. Thanks for listening to me vent.",
