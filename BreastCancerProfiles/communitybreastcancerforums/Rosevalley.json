They have a very low rate of complications compared to other IV lines PICCs etc. If you are not having any side effects and can have it flushed at least every other month, why not keep it? What are your veins like?  I have terrible veins and am an awful stick. They can only use the right arm which is shot. So I wouldn't get rid of mine. There are folks who don't like they way ports feel, and it's scary to have something implanted. Then take it out. I find it scarier to have multiple nurses poke me again and again.. bruised and sore. ",

There is lots of uncertainty and fear and unknowns about life in cancerland. Especially with young children and all the roles we need to play. IT'S HARD!!! Pat yourself on the back that you recognize you are having difficulties and are asking for or thinking about interventions. If you need antidepressants try them and it doesn't mean you will need them forever either. If one doesn't work, there are others. There are lots of threads where the women talk about different antidepressants and the SE and how long they took to work. It might be good reading to check those sites and see if any of the meds appeal to you. Then ask your PCP or MO and get more information on what suggestions they might have. We take so many meds that getting clearance from your PCP/MO about what you are taking and what options will work with your treatment is a good idea. Have you used a therapist or know of one who might be able to help you? I wish you luck getting relief. Vent and explore your feelings here - we all get it. BCO is safe territory. I have been very depressed before (arimidex made me depressed) and it so sucks! (((Hugs))))",

Sometimes I get cramping and it aches and or I just get tired and have to lay down. The main thing I want to impress upon you is that your quality of life will improve immeasurably once that catheter gets placed and it heals. It hurts a bit to put in, take your meds and in a couple of weeks you won't notice it. Then the fluid comes off easily! Relief is at hand. They send the bottles to your home. I hope my story gives you some hope. I pray you get the catheter and can enjoy the holidays with your little boy. By the way the Tuesday before my pleurx placement they took off over 3 liters. That following Friday they placed the catheter and took off 2.6 liters just 3 days later. I could breathe and did much better after that. I noticed you also have Lobular breast cancer. It's hard.

My Grandmother had IBC, Mother's Sister Ductal and a Great Aunt with premenopausal breast cancer who 20 years later died of ovarian cancer. I have estrogen positive lobular breast cancer. Like you we came back no genetic markers. You have lots to choose from for treatments so I would think you have potentially a very long time to live before the cancer has the upper hand. You might die of other causes before the cancer kills you. Folks can live with bone mets for years and years. Good luck with your treatment and spend your time healing from surgery. Welcome again and take care!!",

Still we both marveled at the history of the March of Dimes, and the Jimmy's Fund. I was struck with the second episode at how political things were and how behavior was manipulated by products. The example in 1900 lung cancer was rare, no one smoked. Then WWI troups were given cigarettes, got hooked, brought the habit home, thus was born a lucrative industry. Lung cancer deaths soared.. it took decades before the statistics matched what was told consumers! Here we always think \"SCIENCE\" drives medicine. I think they made a very good case that aint always so! Even that one high powered surgeon smoked and died of lung cancer. It wasn't until the government stepped in to force the issue, put warnings on cigarettes, tobacco was too big and powerful. I wonder how diet and soda now plays into this now, and electronic toys, exposure to phones and such. I was also astonished at the insulated opinion camps and how those believing in one paradigm refused to even entertain any truth from other camps.. virus, chemicals and genes... the blind men describing the elephant. Wonderful analogy. Now that the science is proven and the data in we can see how wrong and harmful these treatments were. Open minds work. I love the quote- by the fellow who drove the mastectomy off in favor for the lumpectomy- show me the data. The public and God can have trust and hope, but science needs data. If some were not brave enough to question, to be the Galileos and stand truth to power, where would we be? Still thinking the earth was flat and treating with leeches! This is a very powerful film. I have learned a lot. I am sure that woman with the triple negative who got the first dose of herceptin and is cancer free just feels like the luckiest guinea pig on the planet. Can't wait for episode 3.",

The information sharing is wonderful and I wished I had logged on back in 2007 when I was diagnosed with stage IIIA Inv. Lobular Cancer. The treatments etc. is below. I was diagnosed in April 2012 with wide spread bone mets, multi. rib breaks, \"avid\" spine, humerus, femurs, ribs, clavicle, sternum and pelvis. I was sore but really had a hard time believing the extend of the bone mets. I had a couple of stunning bouts with back pain, but it got better so \"how could it be cancer?\" Denial is a wonderful thing I guess. But once treatment started killing the cancer and my counts dropped off, 2 units to bolster what was left of my bone marrow's ability to make blood and the reality sunk in, yep stage 4. Since starting faslodex and zometa my TM have dropped from 768 to 68. Pet scans went from loaded to clear in Sept. so I dare to breathe and plan again. This stage 4 thing does a number on long term planning and picturing yourself in the future. My Grandmother died a particularly miserable death of IBC when I was in college. The images and fear I had around that have been hard to shake. I know things are different now. Tamoxifen had just come out for my Grandmother and it was why she lived well for 2 years before the cancer overwhelmed (bone, lung, brain mets) her in the 3rd year of her treatments. I did get BRCA testing since there is  quite a bunch of prostate cancer, breast and ovarian cancer in our family. thankfully it was negative. I have been married for nearly 25 years, to a great easy going guy. He's been very supportive. We have 2 adopted kids ages 19 and 11 and a wonderful surprise gift (age 17) in the middle. Our 2 imported models are deaf (the first one we didn't know and the last one we requested a deaf child). My kids are just terrific and all so very different. I figured with all the breast cancer stuff we had enough on our plates, but apparently not, because in 2011 our oldest child's liver started to fail and she is being watched for eventual transplant. Never a dull moment here! Otherwise we are all healthy! We  all love animals, so we have 3 cats, 3 dogs, one rabbit and a canary. My husband grumbles that we needed a barn -  not a house! Oh well a furry lap warmer for everyone!",

What would happen if there was a campaign with large signs that stated - Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer. A sort of Awareness campaign like they did with autism. The numbers are stunning. What if all over the country these signs were posted in October to illustrate the extent of the problem. Or bumper magnets. I know it's giving up a degree of health privacy but silence betrays the sheer numbers affected. Do any of you think that might fly? Imagine driving through the neighborhood.. oh there's another sign... and another..... and another.. It hits home the extent of the problem. Frankly, I think signs should go up showing the astronomical numbers of all women affected by breast cancer. Imagine what seeing a sign in every 8th front lawn would do to people's complacency.

I took  Emend and when that stuff wore off, I found the inside of my mouth just sweating saliva. I mean I drooled uncontrollably, I was so nauseated! I leaned my head down and saliva just fell out of my mouth.. gross. I had compazine but it was oral.. I thought what a joke trying to swallow that. I did manage to get it down. My onc at the time was like why didn't you take the compazine?  Well I generally wait until I have a symptoms before I take a med like that.. who knew how long the Emend would last? Emend is great stuff. Chase it with compazine or ativan when it wears off, otherwise it's just unbearable.  AC is damn awful. I won't share the rest of my journey. I did manage to get through 3 cycles of AC but it was truly one of the worst experiences of my life.  It so sucks. The Cytoxan burned my bladder and now I have no feeling in it. I have had 2 UTI's in the last year and could feel no pain. The only way I knew I had the UTI's was my urine stunk so badly I asked for a UA to check it out. I drank tons of water after the infusions just like they said, but it didn't help. Taxol was no better.. the neuropathy has plagued me everyday of my life since I finished 4 doses. Had I to do it over again.. I wouldn't touch taxol with a 10 foot pole. So kudos to you for getting through that!  Get Emend; try it.   You know I am curious - you are stage 4 right? Why are they slamming you with AC? I took ACT when I was stage 3A. It was my understanding that once you are stage 4 the name of the game was smaller palliative doses that check the cancer and keep it from spreading. You can't cure it. Ask your onc to reduce the dose. If you are getting the big bang doses they give to stage 1-3 BC patients then I wonder why? AC has risks.",

Not good to dump those cold turkey... nasty side effects.  I do not generally crave sweets. I love crunchy salty things. I will say you can train yourself off certain tastes. I have edema and some heart issues so i need to be on a no added salt diet. My daughter has liver failure and she had to be on a no salt diet. So we started being the typical salt junkies like most of America. It's been 3 years and now regular lunch meat makes me gag! It tastes just like nothing but salt. Most processed foods are inedible! I love no salt chips and salsa. I don't even enjoy or like the tastes of regular salty food. SO it can be done. Once in a while I will get french fries... then I'm good. I try to get the value fries because the portion is small. I know that many sugar free foods are pretty darn tasty! Baskin Robbins has wonderful sugar free ice cream. Sugar free candies are pretty good. A piece of dark chocolate is a real treat.  The trick is, limiting it to once a week. Don't try to go off all sweets cold turkey. Gentle changes are easier to keep. If you tumble off the wagon, be kind and loving to yourself. Then hop back on. Really good ripe fresh fruit can be just as good as sugary sweet things and way better for you. Put lite cool whip on it.. yummy. I just thought of something we do that might help. We all like melon. So I buy it and cut the whole thing up in chunks and keep it in a big bowl. Sometimes I add strawberries or grapes. So there is always this bowl full of ready to munch on fresh fruit. The kids like it in the morning with vanilla yogurt on it. I can eat it either way. It keeps you full and your potassium up with out breaking the calorie bank. ",

If you are ever able to walk through most ICU's it will amaze you how many folks are frail and elderly. Do their families not expect them to die? Why are the end days of life spent in such a place? It's miserable and there is little spiritual quiet healing or preparation for death. We should all want the best possible death for ourselves, one considered and thought out, met head on! It's our right! If you were healthy and got in a car crash and needed support and life saving measures - GREAT! They can do that for you. Or a life threatening infection, surgical complications, organ failure, on an on.. then yes ICU will throw all they have into seeing you through. Yay for medicine and advances!! But when you are 85 and have multiple medical issues.. why put yourself through that? A code is pretty drastic and many folks are never the same after they have been through one. My own Dad was a train wreck at 74 when he died. He looked 100! Thankfully he put his requests into writing. Age is very relative when it comes to health. I have seen 55 year old train wrecks and 95 year olds who looked like they were 60! Best we put our wants and desires clearly into our advanced directives! ",

I think that perspective is missed by others. It also sounds like you really get around! That's super makes life interesting. Even rock climbing wow! I am afraid of heights so rock climbing is out. Thank you for sharing part of your life. Your attitude is awesome. My Aunt raised a zillion Golden Retrievers for Canine Companions for Independence. CCI trains these dogs mostly Goldens and Labs for wheel chair assist dogs. They can open doors, pick up keys and dropped items, and help in so many many ways. It is just incredible what they teach these dogs to do, plus they are \"companions\" too! I am a  dog lover, so I agree with you if you think you need a dog then you do! Finding the right fit so that you both benefit, is the part that takes a while. I would ask CCI if you would qualify for one of their service dogs. They really are just fury angels. I have a disabled daughter (autism, MR, deaf and CP right) We got a Golden retriever for our daughter and he was her constant shadow and keeper. (Our service dog was a CCI reject, failed their testing for wheel chairs but was a fantastic companion animal)  My daughter and Banner were joined at the hip! I knew he would keep her safe and focused and she dearly loved him. We had him for 10 years and he died of cancer at age 12. Even though she would sign to him and she doesn't talk, their bond was remarkable. Truly they communicated in ways others just do not understand. He was our furball angel. I hope you find a dog that bonds with you in the same way.",

IV Zometa is a very potent long acting biophosphate. It's over kill he thought and more is not necessarily \"better\" medicine. As Caryn pointed out all these drugs can have risks and everything you take has to be cleared out of your system by liver or kidneys (few other ways but mostly those 2). So just take what you really need. It's interesting to share the dosing schedules with others here, because it shows how things are changing. I have noticed that I had an increase in peripheral edema with zometa and faslodex together. Since being off, the edema has tapered back nicely at the end of summer, still get some, but not as bad. I have absolutely NO idea if this is related to anything and might be utter coincidence. (Obviously not scientific.. etc. and there could obviously be other reasons.)",

You might remind him that he can get custody after you pass... which hopefull will be years!! hang on to spite! There are so many laws that require spouses to stay within a certain distance in shared custody. Require him as part of the divorce to keep you and the kids on his policy... most judges will allow that. You could get that. Ask your MO to help you file for SSI as in the post above. Wow after all the health issues to have this too. It surely seems unfair. I'll be thinking of you and your kids. hang in there. I hate cancer too. ",

I asked repeatedly about why it felt so different, thicker, like a dense nurf ball. I was brushed off and told i was a worry wart and to relax.  I do have family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I had had 8 mammograms by the time I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer at age 48. I had had a \"clear\" mammogram just 8 months earlier. What I had was lobular breast cancer, which doesn't show up worth a damn on films. If you line up my films side by side you can see it growing and pushing out the tissue. Every year or two, I  got my \"clear\" report.  By the time they took the thing out it was over 6 cm. You could see it with the naked eye on my breast. It measured 4x5cm and all that showed up on mammogram and ultrasound was 1.5cm. They did a core biopsy and found cancer and still believed the damn films instead of what they could see and feel and measure! I had a 1.5 cm lymph node full of cancer that didn't even show up on any film! They found that during the sentinel node/ lumpectomy. So don't let them blow you off. Demand more investigation. I believed my professional OB-GYN, Radiologists, Surgeons, oncologist etc... and they were all wrong. I have 3 kids and was diagnosed in April with wide spread bone mets. Not to scare you but lobular breast cancer is 15% of all breast cancers and the least likely to be picked up with films and most likeley to be underestimated in size. It is still just as deadly.    I'll be praying that you have a big old cyst but make sure you check it out thoroughly -especially if it stays.",

It takes fortitude (more than denial ) and discipline of living moment to moment and refusing the pull towards darker thoughts and leaving loved ones behind.  We can not escape sickness and we can not escape death. By living mentally in the present moment we transcend fear and loss.  It is hard to get to know these lovely women by their posts and wit and humor, only to see them suddenly vanish. Spam girl and Chickadee hit me hard. It's a virtual world here but too surreal when the women vanish.  So ENJOY that 50th Birthday! You have lived it. You have earned it.

I thought maybe they wouldn't give me sleep meds because of that. I was never given more Norco then 1-2 pills a day for sleep. How could anyone get addicted on that? It's such a low amount. It didn't work anymore, for sleep. Maybe the contract was something they sign on everyone no matter the reason. I figured the celebrex could do in a pinch... but they stopped that too.

I am told I don't need that, and it will go away what ever it is. It is so frustrating, like the movie Ground Hog Day.. he wakes up to relive the same day and same dialog - over and over.  I just pick up and leave since it's a Sisyphean task to stay and continually bring up issues and have them ignored or swept under the rug. The pain thing mystifies me.. it's not like you can fake a PET scan or xrays.. no I fudged those mets and rib fractures! If most mets patients live for 26 months why are the doctors so stingy??? I do have great pain tolerance; lots of practice.. I just keep on going, but aching gets old. If you wait until I am in serious pain to scan, then you might as well send me to hospice. I have had 3 scans in my cancer journey-one at the start, one 6 yrs later and one 4 months after that to see if tx was working. The 2nd one was loaded. It took 6 years for an oncologist to check a tumor marker and when I finally got one it was 768.  I still did gardening and carried on..sore. It was like I had to prove having a problem and I can't prove what I ate for lunch. Our insurance does limit what is available as far as choice in doctors. I live in Oregon. I don't know if what you have in your relationship can be found here. I am so disgusted I don't know how much effort I want to put into it. My husband tells me.. if not for you - then do it for the girls. if I was single... I would have thrown in the towel by now. I bring very specific written questions to my daughters GI and liver transplant appointments. If I can't be there, then I give the question list to my husband who takes her. Pediatric physicians are much less gamey and as direct as they can be. If they don't know, they say so. I love that. I actually get an answer to my questions, even if it is \"we don't know.\". You can't say they are not as over worked as the adult side.. their offices are jam packed and appointment list a mile high. Our experiences in Peds offices are totally different then adult medicine.",

      "Content": "Rosevalley wrote: Since I have noticed others use the kindness of the boards for rants and release... forgive me I am going to do the same. It's cheaper then counseling. One year ago I finally got a GI doctor to do a PET scan and diagnose wide spread bone mets, small compression fx T something and multiple rib fractures- everything but my head, hands and feet lit up. I went to an oncologist (my6th - oncologists 3,4,5 refused to do any labs or testing of any kind)and this doctor did a bone biopsy (yep same ILC same grade etc..) and started me on faslodex. He gave me a script for norco written 5/300 no refills... it's supposed to be 5/325. So of course the pharmacy wouldn't fill it and had to call... this is day one of our relationship. Seeing the no refills I asked my PCP to fill the Norco she did but required a narcotics contract be signed and placed in my chart. That pissed me off - who does this to a stage 4 bone mets patient with rib fractures? Anyway, it took a long time but the ribs healed and things got better. Except for sleep, can't sleep for beans. I toss wake up etc. So I was using the Norco for sleep, gradually weaning off. My PCP knew this. I have chronic back pain and have for years. I took Celebrex for a little over a year and it worked great- LOVED it... until it started giving me stomach pain and mouth ulcers. NSAIDs all of them do that to me. Great drugs.. mouth ulcers suck. So make a long story short. No more NORCO. Fine. I go to renew the Celebrex... no more Celebrex either. I asked the MO and PCP for sleep meds.. sorry no sleep pills of any kind- try meditation or relaxation tapes. Ya right. I have one place on my back that gives me constant aching pain. The Mo said your tumor markers have gone down to 48. Your last scan in August was clear, the cancer is there but nothing active. So no new scans. We will stop the zometa and maybe make it once a year. hmm. It's just your chronic back pain. I can't argue that. I am frustrated and tired. Everytime I see the NP she tells me \"how refreshed I look!\" She changes the subject when I bring up the sleep issue. So I changed MOs. The one good thing that Mo did was increase my diuretics to get the increased edema off my feet and legs. I had neuropathy from the taxol that I thought I beat..but the edema was irritating the nerves and it came back. The diurectics worked great. Couldn't stand the new MO. Called back and said I'll pass. She said she wouldn't scan unless there was something new. Agreed with the other oncologists I saw who did no labs or testing - no scans zip. You have to wait until symptoms warrant it. I said you wouldn't even do a tumor marker check? No she said they aren't accurate on everyone. I said if you never check them ever -how do you know if they are meaningful for that patient? No answer. They happen to be accurate or correlate with my scans. How can you tell if you always have pain issues? \"I still won't scan.\"  I have a redundant colon and always have digestive issues.. so nothing is new. Everything is a matter of degree. None of it feels good. The faslodex increased my leg edema, made me tired, made it harder to sleep, sometimes transient nausea, but was better then the AI's which I refused to take.  Needless to say I thought why sign up for more of the same with this oncologist. I called back and said no thanks this isn't a good fit. I wished I had them flush the port.. it hasn't been flushed since March. I can't stand the irritation of going into another doctor and feel I need a break from this carnival ride. I hate the idea of ever going into a oncologists office again. Then there is my DD deaf daughter who was diagnosed with end stage cirrhosis at age 17. We have been worked up by a CA transplant team and need to wait until she gets sick enough. Slowly over the months they have increased her diuretics. She is 19 and on 100mg of spironloactone and 40 of lasix and they can't increase because of her kidneys. She is tiny 4 foot 8 inches. She should weigh 80 to 83 pounds. Over the last month her weight has increased from 87 to 90 pounds,; we used to freak when her weight hit 85. She has had pleural effusions from ascites. None right now. She has stretch marks across her abdomen, butt and all the way to her knees. Her belly is bloated and full. Her labs are all normal. Hows that for compensating.. except for low creatinine clearance and INR (which they fix with vitamin K). we are waiting to see an nephrologist.. there is talk of lupus, maybe or kidney issues on top of her needing a new liver. You can't get a MELD score until your labs go higher. So we wait. Last night she said she was full. She wouldn't finish her dinner. This morning she woke up, said she was full - we tried on so many pants.... none fit. (No more 14, 16, into junior 2, 3... thank goodness for sweats and leggings. Her little arms and legs are so skinny.). I ask continually -\"can't you do something about the edema?\" I am told to wait. So we wait. This is so frustrating.

Not only do we have to put up with the other side effects, there is sleep deprivation. I am convinced when you get a good nights sleep everything is more tolerable. I think you have less depression, less pain, better tolerated side effects when you have had enough sleep. Why NPs and Oncologists are stingy or overly sparing with sleeping pills & stage 4 cancer patients is a mystery to me. Ativan doesn't do anything for me. Restoril made me move constantly all night like a whirling dervish. My husband called it \"restlessville\" instead of restoril. Melatonin 6mg doesn't last, although it sometimes helps get me to sleep. Melatonin has a very short half life and is safe and won't make you groggy in the morning. Sometimes I will listen to meditation tapes or soft music if I am too wide awake. Mostly, I find that by the end of the day I ache enough, back and feet bothering me, that pain meds are what get me to relax enough to fall asleep. Otherwise I just toss and turn and can't get comfortable. Thankfully I can have meds for that. I feel your pain, as this has been an ongoing issue effecting my quality of life for 7 years! We have lots of company. I wish there would be a sleep med just for cancer patients.   Good luck.",

I think once I get past that 3rd year I'll be able to relax. I try not to think about it. I do wish someone on this stage 4 forum would talk about what works for getting and staying asleep. Sleep and not having it be broken up into 2 hour blocks drives me nuts. Everything looks better when I get enough sleep. Why would binding estrogen make sleep so disturbed?",

They don't want to bother the doctor and they don't want to admit failing in their ability to take care of themselves. So if you ask out right, then folks will sometimes fess up. Amazes me how frequently folks trip on area rugs.  Next time you go in, ask them why they started asking you that. ",

If you have a craving for orange juice - you probably need it.  After this year when my Mom's sister got breast cancer and all the others in my family, I figured well it's in the genes.

If anyone has ever had a toddler you know how notoriously difficult they are to feed! Picky, obstinate and they like something one day and refuse it the next. It's enough to drive a parent crazy. Well in the study they allowed toddlers access to a buffet of options and just let the little ones eat what ever they wanted out of the food options. They recorded the end total in nutrition, calories etc. You know what they found? If tiny 2 year olds were left to choose, they actually met theeir nutritional requirements over the course of a week, not each day - the sum total of what they ate was enough. So that meant the kids knew intuiatively what they needed to eat. Internal cues were telling them - carrots today, little more protein tomorrow.. citrus! Here in America we have access to a fantastic variety of food year round even, so it is easy to \"eat well.\" I think Americans worry too much about food. If we just use variety and stop eating when we are full, we will more than meet our requirements. I agree with Caryn, eat what you enjoy and ditch the worry. There are some things to be careful with. I had all my kids vitamin D levels checked and mine, right before I was diagnosed with BC in 2007. We live in Oregon where it is cold and rainy 8 months or more a year. So folks are not always out getting their \"sun.\" I came back low. My one daughter was critically low (turns out her liver was no longer making/ processing the  vitamins A,D or K) and she had chronic liver disease, any change in diet wouldn't have helped. My other healthy kids were also low  or barely normal. We eat a great diet, varied etc. But you need sun light. So now everyone in the house gets 2000 units. So depends on where you live and exposure. Most supplements only give you expensive pee!  I can see where Dr. Valero makes a nice case that \"You have lived with cancer for a very long time and functioned well. Things can continue on the same path indefinitely.\" Maybe what he says is true in the institution where he works. Maybe they look for recurrences and treat accordingly and follow-up on SE and symptoms. I hope for your sake that it true. I certainly have not had that experience at all.   ",

Having to cycle through many treatments and have them not work must be frustrating and scary all at the same time. Maybe an antidepressant might take the edge off? None of them work right away but your PCP or Onc might have a suggestion for you. Perhaps it would help? You are in tough times and \"going into dark places\" is not unusual. I am sure your husband and sons don't want you to feel like you are putting them out!  I almost went to hospice in Jan. I didn't want to try anything else -sick of all of it. Sick of being sick, anemic, pain - feeling like shit. My daughters - all 3 of them wanted me to try anything - something else. Pleeeease they begged. I was useless.. I spent days getting blood transfusions, was too tired to do squat. The kids wanted me there anyway, even all gimpy and useless. It took a while to find something that worked, and that has side effects too. All the treatments do. The name of the game is to treat the side effects not just suffer in silence.  When I was bald my kids were embarrassed of me too. I remember taking my hot wig off in the car driving down the freeway. Here I looked like Uncle Fester from the Adams Family - fat, shiny bald and puffy from prednisone! What a sight! My daughters slunk down in their seats horrified.. \"Mom people are staring!\" I said let them! I'm too hot with that wig on! We tried to make it a joke after that. Since I couldn't fix it might as well laugh at it. They lightened up after that. I teased them and gave them dark sunglasses.. then they felt silly. I wish you fortitude and patience with your sons and how you feel. You are not alone and you are not unusual in how you feel. I am sure most women with kids and stage 4 cancer/ treatments could affirm they understand completely!! This is crazy hard.  Lots of ((((HUGS))))",

Each person will describe something a little bit differently. prior experiences play into our perceptions too.  For me the joint pain of arimidex was like ground glass in your joints, just unrelenting aching and pain. I just didn't want to move. Even my accupuncturist tried leaving the needles in and could not get rid of the hip pain. I used to just LOVE my sessions, because Tagasshi could get rid of all the pain after chemo... I slept at times during accupuncture. But 6 months of the joint pain.. whew did me in. I wasn't given any pain relievers. I finally quit the drug and that got rid of the pain. Neulasta shots were horrid. Like an intense pain from the inside out, everywhere and nowhere specific. Intense... it was doable because you knew it ended after a couple of days.. take the percocet. ugh.. nasty. In the weeks leading up to my PET scan in April of 2012 I kept feeling this odd tingling sensation in my sternum and different places. I never felt anything like it and didn't know what to make of it. I couldn't decide if it was painful or just wierd. It was bone mets, but I didn't know it at the time. I also had a rib that clicked when I would breathe, but it didn't hurt. Then my other ribs started to ache on the right. That was small fractures, couldn't lay on my right side after a while. All of this annoying, but didn't stop me from activities. Those feelings were all bone mets; they hurt but didn't nail you. Interestly, once the treatment started the faslodex and zometa made the pain worse not better. It took months of treatment to really feel better. I have one area in my back that when I stand for long periods or sit it just aches like heck and won't stop. Yet the scans say clear.. the pain stays on. Oh well. To this day when I think of a pain score of 10, I remember splitting the bone in my lower leg as a ten year old. I fell off the edge of a barn roof.I screamed and rocked back and forth on the ground, in just crazy intense pain... off the charts. That is still my \"10.\" To this day nothing hits that level. Four huge gall stones and a \"knife in your back\" and I would rate that a 9. I have had a couple of crazy painful back injuries and still 9s..8s. Bone pain like a quick long fracture is the worst. I was just frantic I hurt so bad and could hardly pull it together.. crying and gasping. I spent the entire summer on my back... leg up. ugh. I have heard that bone cancer and bone pain is excruciating. This I can believe.How is it in some cultures a woman is supposed to be silent during birth and in other cultures scream through it all? Is it expectations and patterning, \"it will be like this\" and you behave accordingly? Like little kids who skin their knee and if they are engaged keep playing, but if Mom is watching... on come the tears!",

I was taking Norco at night for rib and bone pain, and it worked for that and helped me sleep. The ribs are healed which is good. The Norco doesn't help me sleep now-good for back pain and headaches. I am chronically tired. I tried a ND recommendation of valarian and HTP that seemed to work maybe 1/2 the time. But my husband pointed out I stayed up all night one night and crashed the next, so maybe he was right. I need to take a fist full of melatonin and it only works for an hour or 2. I asked for prescription sleep meds from my PCP she said no. It was a battle to get 0.5 mg ativan (no refills) and it didn't do much if anything on a recent trip. As a matter of fact I am wide awake 11:30 and I took 1 mg ativan 1 1/2 hrs ago - zip -  I am up writing this and reading posts. My kid's need to be up at 5:45 to catch a 6:20 bus and I can't wait for the alarm to go off so I don't have to toss and turn, up and down. Lack of sleep is the single biggest irritation about the whole cancer experience, and nothing seems to work. Then the next day I feel so tired I just kind of fog through the day and doze in the chair. Thank goodness for dermablend make-up to put under the bags under your eyes. Great stuff!

I felt horrible that she might lose her Mother TWICE. How could I do this to a little kid. My guilt just knew no end. Until I started to come around to understand life is precious because it is fragile and brief. No one wants cancer. I vowed to love my girls best i could for as long as I could and give up some of the anxiety, fear and saddness.  This didn't happen over night, so be gentle and kind with yourself. You deserve compassion and time to get through this initial shock. My Grandmother died of inflammatory breast cancer so I had watched that as a college kid decades ago. Breast cancer just scared me to death. I had to reevaluate my old fears, because treatment options have changed so drastically. You can live for years and years managing breast cancer like a chronic disease. So if you have fearful cancer memories examine them and know that many things have changed for the better! Laughter helps alot. When I shaved my head at the beauty parlor, my 6 year old blurted out, \"Daddy's gonna be mad at you!\" I laughed. We teased our border collie with the wig I had. She barked and flew around like it was \"alive!\" My kids roared. It was hilarious. I mortified my 11 year old by driving down the freeway bald and beautiful. She slunk down in the seat horrified. We teased each other and laughed. You will too. Humor helps so much. Also, use the ativan, the anti emetics (emend rocks) and take your pain meds. Be comfy and there for your child by taking care of yourself too. It's a big club and we are all in the same boat.

My daughters graduation from 8th grade is next week Thursday. I will not be able to eat anything at the BBQ. I will need to load up on zofran and reglan. I need to be at that graduation. No bucket. I need to say good bye to folks and celebrate. The Ibrance isn't working and neither is the faslodex. My bottle of Ibrance says expires 5/2016. It should still be good. This is happening faster and harder then I expected it to. My DD3 has camp planned and I haven't told my DD1 and2 about the decline. DD2 just finished her exams today and thinks she did well. I was so happy for her. She's worked hard all year. I want her happy and feeling good. I will call my oncologist and ask her if there is anything to do that would get me through to August. Just so my DD3 doesn't have 7 weeks alone. If nothing works or the SE are too ugly then it's time. We go for broke cause the cancer is having an explosion inside of my gut. The cancer will win I know that. I am selfish I want 10 weeks. I might not get them. Need to pick out a cremation place. No services or obit... blow the sand away.

I can't take these premeds benadryl and all and drive 2 hours to the cancer center. I fall asleep. Traffic is hideous. So DH drives me. We found a private nursery near us that sells nothing but shade plants. They had tons of different types of hostas from tiny to giants 6 feet across. We were smitten and bought 6 different types to put along the East side of our house. The hostas are doing really well. We mix them with foxglove. I never knew how many types of hostas there were since you usually only see 2 varieties. It's going to be 90 degrees today. Sunny! DH and DD2 are going to a soccer game! We are soccer fans big time.

So far it's had no effect on the ascites. It is interesting that it appears to lessen the intestinal cancer grip and stomach but not the ascites. Weird. We were all talking about our poor dogs suffering last night through illegal fireworks. My nurse had a border collie mix she gave her benadryl and stuck by her. My chemo neighbors the next chair same deal with their dog. My poor border collie was hiding in my daughters bedroom.. between the beds at 11 pm. Hopefully tonight will be better. DD2 and DH and I all had lunch together. They sat with me at the cancer center. It makes me remember taking all three girls to radiation when they were 12, 10 and 6.

Best bird it did make me feel like a seeder of the future! Pitching seed pods into the meadows and sprinkling fist fulls of seed. I could just imagine the foxglove dancing in the wind along the banks in the dappled sunlight. They only bloom every 2 years so it will be while. I probably won't see my seeds bloom, but in my mind's eye and my heart the flowers have been planted and the deed done. We have lots of hummingbirds and bees here so they will so enjoy the flowers. I am collecting the very last bucket full of seed spires. Amazing how many seeds are in each pod and each plant. Planning now where to take the last of them...:-) This has been a bumper crop of foxglove and I am happy to use them all. Love to each of you. It looks like I will see August and meet the summer.

Not taking enough calories in to maintain myself. Zofran and CBD oil and relief. I got the gemzar today.. yay lightening fast approval. I also got steroids but I don't feel them.

You do have to train yourself that tiny baby bladders need frequent trips out and all positive rewards. Praise and tummy rubs and positive reinforcement. If our puppy went to chew something she shouldn't we had a can with pennies that made a sharp startling sound that we shook and then said \"no!\" That worked. Then give them puppy nyla bones, kong toys with peanut butter are a great treat. No raw hide. It's all about learning what is ok to chew and what is off limits. We don't allow dogs on the beds. We have a huge Costco round bed and our border collie sleeps in her bed. Not on people beds. So you have to decide on what rules you want to enforce. Make sure you give her a good quality food. Enjoy her she is sooo cute. Nice to have a dog and cats. What do the 2 old brothers think of Stella?",

Pretty grateful to have a nice day with DH and the kids. Trying to remain positive. Chemo tomorrow.",

So not much improvement. I do not have the tumor markers back. I am not as tired today because of the steroids. Tomorrow will be fall off day. I also got my Polst paper for the frig in that alarming shade of bright pink. I know DD3 will want to know what it is so I am wondering where to put it where it can't been seen all the time. My onc knows I won't do any harsh chemo and the ascites is worse and more uncomfortable. She asked about interperitoneal chemo and no other folks thought it was worth the discomfort at this point in the game. She has one more gentler chemo to suggest and we might try that. I am tired and ready. My 58th birthday is coming up and I want the gift of release and free and loving send off when the chemos stop. I am going to ask my kids to give me their love and hugs and be gracious to believe in their strength and lives and let Mom go. Even with that said I am I guess still useful. I do wait and watch my old 16 year old male cat who has renal failure and hyper thyroid disease. He's wasting away and will drink tons of water and puke, but he is still eating. I need to talk to the vet and ask when to put him down humanely. I hate to see him wretch and vomit but then he recovers. Hmm. My DH is kind and loving but never puts any of the animals down. I have done it all. He doesn't have the stomach for it. I love this cat to pieces BCE on his chart even (Best Cat Ever the vet tech wrote). I don't want him to suffer.",

When you watch kids do you get a sick day?? NO you work sick or not. There is no calling out for sick days. The only time I completely fizzled was on chemo in 2007 when the kids were all home sick and I spiked a fever and crashed. My neighbor got my Z-pack from the pharmacy cause I was too wonky to drive and get it and I had to call DH home from work to watch the kids. I passed out fever and chills. Amazing it didn't land me in the hospital. I woke up a day later. Other wise I was Mom through out back pain, flu, bronchitis, stomach bugs and diarrhea... stay the course. How many men would do that? Not many. Women do it all the time. There are no sick days for stay at home Mom's and Dad's.",

My liver labs are back to normal and the rest of my labs look great. My albumin and total protein even improved. So WTH??? I still have clicking ribs and hip pain which leads me to believe the breast cancer in my bones is still active and maybe that's what is driving the tumor markers up. I think the chemo is working on the gut portion of my cancer misery. Maybe there is something a little different about the gut cancer compared with the bone mets. Sigh...complicated.

The Portland Rhodie Garden is also magnificient. There is a part of me that wants to hang on to see my DD3's birthday in March and the Rhodies bloom and the earth sings in flowers...azaleas, rhodies, tulips, cherry blosoms and tiny crab apples.. my favorite time of year. I got hydration therapy finally that will access my port and I will be able to give myself fluids 3 times a week. Thank heavens.. my kidneys are singing. The pole and fluids came today.

The doc said she never sees faslodex work so fast and she is learning new territory from my body's response and how dire my situation was (and how many chemos I have pooped out on.. doxil, herceptin, xeloda, ACT from 2007, aromasin& afinitor, arimidex and femera.) We talked about adding Ibrance but not yet. I told her my drain amounts have been slowly decreasing. My albumin and total protein is better, not quite normal and my liver enzymes are perfect! Kidneys and blood counts are all normal. I have cancer in my mesentery, liver and lung, omentum and bones. So I got my faslodex shots and xgeva shots and will forge ahead. I still need the reglan and have to eat a low residue diet for food to go through and my stomach to empty, but I will take it! Thank you for all your prayers for well being, because they are working. May we all be happy and free from suffering. Hugs. love to all rosevalley",

I was so disappointed because even at 1mg it seemed to have no effect at all. I was wide awake. I have never taken valium or Xanax, so I can't offer any opinion. I did try buspar years ago and it made me feel very weird and out of it and I didn't like driving with the med on board. Needless to say I didn't last long and quit taking it. Ironically it made me anxious worried about driving while taking buspar! Ha ha. Doctors don't ever give you enough of any of the anti-anxiety meds too see if it has any effect long term, so you're right back where you started. I figure I just have to put up with it, at least anxiety is transient not constant. Which doesn't answer your question. I feel the same way about pain meds you just have to put up with it. Relief isn't an option. If you find something that works that a doctor will actually prescribe - post it!",

I have also had coworkers whose marriages have failed because of the stress of a special needs child. Some special needs kids are very sweet and the journey is hard but not evil hard. Then there are those few kids who are non verbal, very destructive, busy and aggressive when their impulses are restricted. It can literally be a safety issue for parent and child. No one deserves to be hurt, bit and hit. There are special homes where staff are trained to deal with persons whose behaviors are challenging. There is no shame in admitting a child is out of your league and you can not parent them effectively or safely. It's ok to admit that and move them into an evironment where they can get what they need. I hope that Mom can find such a place. I was walking my dog yesterday and it started to rain. We were hurrying to get back home. I started to walk past a neighbors fence just next to her driveway and she pulled into her driveway so fast she nearly mowed us down. When she opened the garage door to pull in, her dog barked and my dog spooked and pulled my arm. I lost my footing and fell in their driveway a real belly flop on the cement. It really hurt. My knee is banged up and with wide spread bone mets and being 57... I am so SORE!! I hurt everywhere. My neighbor who did this just stood in her garage and didn't even go out and try and help me out. I live 2 houses across the street from these folks Some man in a car stopped to ask if I was ok and I managed to get up and walk home. Nothing broken just sore. Note to self no falling on the cement at my age!! Rules to live by. Thank you for all the wonderful pictures. I love them. I wish I had a Iphone so I could take pictures of my garden. It's so pretty.. rhodies and lenten roses. Irises and so many blooms.. violets in bunches. I will have to wait to weed until my knees heal. Chevy your garden is so sweet.

I had a little cry over my disappointment at faslodex fizzling out and decided I have xeloda and Ibrance yet to try. My oncologist wants me to start Ibrance Wednesday to line up with my next appointment and labs. So down the hatch on Wednesday. Pray it gets me through the summer. The thought of leaving my 15 year old alone in an empty house while DH is at work just upsets me. I feel like I failed everyone. I know in my heart this is not my choice or fault, but when you are a Mom you agree to be there for the long haul...18+ years. The unspoken Mom pledge- I will watch your back, feed you, take you to appointments, support and love you.... every day until you fly off on your own. Unless cancer mucks up the works. I am sad about Nancy dying. Glad she is free from cancerland and suffering, and sorry to see a wonderful soul leave. I know we all die and I accept that, but she was young and loved. It's hard. Some how when you are in your 80s it seems ok to die and natural, but before that it seems sad. Realistically I have packed a lot of life, learning, love and experiences in my 57 years and feel my life was/is really sweet and fulfilling. I didn't miss anything. Not that I wouldn't love to see marriages of my daughters, graduation from college/ highschool and Grandkids someday and to grow old with my DH, but I feel I packed quite a bit into my 57 years. It's been a good life. No regrets when I die. Life is good. I am grateful. Thankful for everybody and everything. Lovingkindess to all. Speckle neckle the chicken is very pretty! I like to watch chickens they have a lot of personality. My oldest DD loves to feed the chickens at a nearby community. They eat right out of her hand and she just laughs and squeals with delight. They are also beautiful.. blacks, speckled, brown and white chickens. Some are quite big.",

I spent the first part of the morning with my Siamese cat Emmy purring and curled up on my lap. I got up for a second cup of coffee and Percy came in for a snooze on my lap. It seems I am a cat lounger! They do this every morning. Sometimes one cat will come in to see if the lap is taken or open... they will look and if it's taken flatten their ears and go sit and stare down the offending lap cat. Makes me laugh. Stephanie thank you for the beautiful photo. I have two bushes of open petal roses one in red and the other pink that bloom prolifically all summer. I really enjoy them. I decided that draining every 3rd day makes the morning of the third day icky. So I drain at night before going to bed on the 2nd day. Then I just am done and my recovery is finished by morning. The company sent me boxes of supplies. I feel better every other day. You understand the issue I am sure. We have had our drains longer than most folks. The Ibrance hasn't made any difference in the fluid. It's only been a few days so we will see. I am an experiment! A big guinea pig as far as the pleurx drain and cancer goes. I am hopeful to be here for the summer. It's cool, damp and cloudy this morning and makes me sleepy. Lovingkindness to all. May you have a wonderful weekend. rosevalley",

She would say to me \"You look so refreshed!\" I complained over and over about insomnia and achiness.. and was met with silence, no support  and \"you look refreshed!\"  I finally said, \"yes dermablend at 35$ tube can cover the darkest of under eye bags.\" So we try and muddle through, cover up our cancer and minimize the SE.

I really like this person and she is usually pretty nice funny. That took me off guard. She emails frequently but doesn't mention cancer too much. She will ask about the kids. I appreciate that. I keep her posted about our kids, which are nearly the same age There just isn't too much you can do with folks who are uncomfortable with stage 4, dying or being reminded that folks do die of cancer and that it can take years. I think they run out of things to say... oh you are still here.hmm Now what do I say - kind of thing. I am always reminded of how insensitive folks can be. I have had a number of neighbors ask how long do I have. Like I know? I hope years.. I would never ask anyone that question. I guess you just grease the social wheels in your family and try not making a big deal of their goof ups.. moving on. Maybe to show them how to behave. I also think it's good to just ask folks for what you need. Sometimes we just have to take care of ourselves and not worry about what the others are doing. ",

Your cat Arthur looks so much like our 15 year old cat Percy. Who was angry at us for locking the cat door in the garage so he couldn't get out. He jumped up on my bed and peed on the comforter... right in front of me! He's not done something like that for years. My husband said that's his answer for closing the cat door. Take that. He knew we would throw him outside which he wanted.. after he gets his meds. We shut the cat door because he needs thyroid meds twice daily and we frequently can't catch him in the morning to squirt the liquid down. So locking him in means we have time to catch him for a dose. Now I have to wash the cover... ugh. Dang cat. Xavo- I have lots of Lenten Roses/ Hellbore around our lot because it is very shady. They do well and are hardy plants, blooming early. You are right we are hardy like them. Well the Ibrance went down without any fanfare. I hope it does the trick. Buying me some more time. I feel pretty good today. I like Thursdays because the new episode of \"Alone\" is on the History channel tonight.

It's interesting my kids were raised Quaker for most of their young lives and then I began to attend a Sangha and learn about the teachings of Buddha. We once went to a retreat at a Buddhist Monastery and got an interpreter to make the event accessible for them. It was wonderful. But then my cancer came back in 2012 and slammed me. I have not had much energy to engage in Sangha. I practice at home but not outside. Sitting meditation and walking mediation needs to be done as I am able pain tolerance and all. Most of my reading is Buddhist in content. But I am very familiar with Christian teaching having taken Old and New Testament in college and done much reading. My youngest has decided she wants to join Deaf church and be Baptized. I respect her decision to follow Jesus if that gives her life more meaning and purpose. We all have to find our way. My DH's first boss was a Catholic who fell in love with a Muslim Indonesian and converted. They were so happy together. I went to a Franciscan College and became friends with the some of the Sister's and have so much respect for them. Through the years meeting folks and listening to their stories I have met many from different faiths who have been happy and fulfilled. They have been my world religion teachers. I now know that there are many paths up the mountain. I know that my path may not be my daughter's path and I support and respect her right to choose her own way. They seem very nice at the Deaf Church. We have gone with her to services. I still feel lousy. bloated and queasy. The Ibrance needs to get swallowed yet. ugh dreading it. I am tired of cancer. I want to be open and brutally honest about the effects of cancer. Why because our society has turned it into a pretty pink ribbon. There is nothing pretty about the reality of breast cancer; it's awful, disfiguring, life altering and kills way too many of its victims. I like the roses. Will you make a blanket? My MIL made us 3 crocheted blankets and we fight over them they are so warm and toasty. Today was almost 100 and no blankets. Whew I will be glad when the weather breaks. Too hot.

I felt much better after stopping the Ibrance. Hopefully the Taxol will work better on the bowel constriction like it did with Hummingbird's situation. I can drain the fluid off and get more comfortable that way but it's just temporary. My labs all looked fantastic. Except calcium which runs a tad low. It is hard to decide which drug or issue is causing which symptom. I don't understand why the ascites fluid has increased and yet the tumor markers dropped. Hmm puzzled. My poor body is weird. My hair is sooo thin.. I look pathetic. My oncologist doesn't think my hair will all fall out but it is coming out in handfulls. It was dropping out like crazy before the Taxol.. My 8th graders graduation is tomorrow and at least I will have some hair for that. WooHoo. \"Always look at the bright side of Life.. la la la la...\" Monty Python!! Ha ha... gallows humor. I am warped. May you all have a great day. (((Hugs))) love rosevalley",

I would love to sit in your garden and enjoy starbucks with you. The office emailed me that my UA was positive but the NP didn't send in antibiotics. So here it is 5:30 pharmacy closes at 6pm. Why email a positive results and not order anything? What's the point? Sometimes I wonder what folks are thinking. Guess we wait until Monday doubt anything will be done on a Sunday.

Try being sad and miserable in a beautiful garden.. nearly impossible. Like trying not to smile when a baby giggles, children laugh or small animals are being playful. It lightens the heart. When my DD1 was in the hospital we walked around the garden at the Children's hospital and we did it daily ski jacket on over hospital jammies and admired the plants, sculpture and small birds that lived there. It helped us heal as muchas the testing and medicine. Good for the soul. Ok you stage 4 folks will appreciate this. I went shopping for a few things for my youngest kid. Jeans on sale and got a great deal. I never buy things for myself thinking I am going to die within the year and what's the point? So I have lost weight and many of my clothes look like sacks.. one set of pjs fell off. I had to get rid of those. Kohls had a tremendous sale and I bought 4 shirts! I just can't believe I did it. They were crazy mark downs under 8 bucks each! (They had been 36$) So if I drop over on Friday's infusion I told my friend they are hers. She said I was crazy. But I keep thinking should someone with cancer everywhere and malignant ascites buy new clothes in the light of such a limited life span? I have to admit they look nice and feel good. Well as nice as a boobless, left arm bigger then the right (lymph edema), middle aged woman with thinning hair can look. Good thing I love being alive more then I care what I look like. Zoloft helps too! Thanks for listening to me and for all your kindness, support and sharing. Coming here makes me smile. JLF I am going to ask about Taxotere if it might be better tolerated. Thanks for the heads up.",

I am happy there is a taxol I can take since it clearly works against my cancer. .. for now anyway. I am a little frustrated with my body's acceptance of these drugs. I seem to always have some issue. I had forgotten that the 3rd dose of dose dense Taxol 2007 made blisters break out on the soles of my feet. They dropped the dose by 33% for the 4th dose and I had no feeling in my feet at all. It took months to return and the feeling is not the same. The fluid they gave me today had given me pretty severe edema.. had to get out the lasix to get the fluid off. Way too puffy. I met a neighbor today undergoing breast cancer treatments, brain, bone, liver... we connected instantly through our gardens and mutual admiration of plants. We live just around the block from each other. She is taking a combo that I tried and I told her the taxol story. We both love the same types of shady plants hostas and rhodies and our husbands were commiserating. Small world. We are probably near in age even. There are just tooo many of us with stage 4 cancer. It's awful. I liked her and hope she does well and we meet again to talk. We have lots in common, sadly. I took 2 walks the steroids make me antsy. My neighbor said all the brain radiation makes her tired. Cancer is hard. They heal in their garden just like we do at our house. Make me well or at least feel better dear plants - heal me. Calm my mind, clear my thoughts and capture my imagination dear garden, keep me grounded and still to grow. Plant therapy. Good night all. (((hugs)))",

It's my fault since I gave her donut pans and all matter of baking items. I love to cook, and like trying out vegan recipes for her. I just wish she was vegetarian since there are so many things to make, vegan is harder. She is an art student and there is by nature a creative energy and mess that goes along with good art. She's a good kid, hard working great grades and works part time at a coffee shop. Then there are friends and places to visit. Cleaning in't her thing...pots and pans especially. :-) So I clean periodically... oh well. Makes me happy spoiling her. Mominator- You really did get close to that bunny. When I was in our Pennsylvania high school a friend and I would wake up hours early and ride our bikes through Ridley Creek State Park and up to high school. Kathy and I enjoyed our startled pheasants, quail and bunnies we would see riding in the early morning. It was magical -deer in the fields and so many animals. It was worth the cool morning ride and painful steep hill at the end to bike through the park before school. I rarely see bunnies here in Oregon maybe because there are so many raptors- Eagles, Hawks, Kestrals, Owls are just every where. I know back East bunnies were much more prevalent. Up at the cabin I saw Owls and Eagles and Osprey but rarely bunnies. In the 8 years we had the cabin I only saw maybe 8 rabbits.. and lost count the number of owls and osprey and eagles. I miss seeing the salamanders and slugs and mushrooms I would find on my walks. I miss the old growth woods. Yes I ate my comfort grilled cheese and tomato in my new shirt. It felt wonderful to have something fit. To be able to eat something and have it nourish and feel good and not make you sick. That's a blessing. Simple things really are the best. Like cool lemonade when you are thirsty. A homebaked cookie warm from the oven. Nothing fancy just good and simple. Company with friends. Prayers and meditation time to center. It's all good. Making a life while having cancer takes intention and thought. Lovingkindness to yourself and others too. good night. rosevalley ",

Then off for my MRI and I got the results, increased skull mets but no brain mets. Yay. So we still don't know what is causing the nausea and vomiting and motion sickness. Maybe inner ear? No clue. I have pulled off a liter every day since Sunday. The ascites has increased along with gas, bloating and distention. My tumor markers won't be back for another day. My albumin is low as is my total protein but the rest of my numbers looked good. I am tired and wonder just what is making me vomit? Will ILC show up on MRIs or is it just a sneaky cancer that infiltrates and wrecks havoc. Maybe all the N/V is from gut issues, pressure and intestinal influences. I don't know. I just don't like the symptoms. Maybe as Gemzar drops the counts then things will get better. Just have to wait it out. Thank you for the prayers and well wishes they lighten the load and make the journey easier. I hope each of you on this hard journey is spending time doing things you enjoy with people you love and care about. Lots of love to all. rosevalley",

I do admire the indigent care and free clinics they offer the community here. I think you are right that my DD is seeking some certainty and reassurance when in reality life offers none. Change is constant. Hard to live with that when you are 15 and use a language that the main culture does not. It will work out in the end.",

It was a very interesting read. I read a book review in NYTimes and thought can't stand it - must read it. I am glad I did. Everyone who cares about QOL not stuff, should read it since there is so much about history that we can learn from. I love that the settlers who left the colonies to live with the Indians routinely never sought out to come home. If they were forceably returned they left to go back to the tribe. Who would have thought? I will be interested to know what you think Stephanie. The Lion King was stunning. We were kind of high but center. SO the full effect of the stage and sets and costumes was just wonderful The music and sound quality was great. The puppet animals and the way they moved was just magical. My DDs all loved the birds and dancing. I had to sign the story in parts and make explanations during the laughter and music. Some parts are hard to make \"deaf\" meaning. The story is universal with an African theme. The young king returning to find himself and reclaim his rightful place. A myth for us all finding out who we really are. Great music and I loved the stars/ night sky. We enjoyed it. I had to take a couple of pain pills to sit that long and got myself in a position I couldn't get out of..causing pain. But we had a great night out. It was lovely. I still have a couple of weeks to get through before school starts after labor day. I went for chemo today and talked to the oncologist. She said she was surprised the markers jumped so much and I was so symptomatic so fast on one week off. My albumin and total protein dropped again causing the increased ascites. My liver enzymes are just a bit elevated and my white count must be ok because they gave me gemzar. So we will see what happens in the next 2 weeks. I feel like I should drain but I would like to wait just in case the chemo circulating is in that fluid. Let it sit for 8 hours and pull it off tomorrow. Of course tomorrow the steroids will sustain me and then I will crash and feel awful Friday. My DH is so the eternal optimist... he told the oncologist I ate an entire piece of terimisu (sp?) cake and didn't puke. (It was fiercely yummy and I decided that if I did puke- it was blooming worth it.) We went to a special desert restaurant with DD3 for a treat. It was practically the only thing I ate that day. He also said my last drain went down! All happy.. it was 12 hours not 24 hours. That's why the number was decreased. I drained early to have a good time at the show and not be bloated. He tries to see any little improvement as \"getting better\" sustaining. It's cute and kind of sad. Really things are not better at all; they are slowly and distinctly getting worse. I keep telling him that and he just can't accept it. But there is the next couple of weeks to endure. As fast as things are progressing, unless magic happens, he will need to accept my leaving. My oncologist wanted to add carboplatin to the gemzar but that would mean more N/V. I made a face. We are sticking to gemzar. Tumor mrkers should be back tomorrow. Wish me luck . Thank you for your pictures and kind words everyone. I love the puppy Ruth! Stella's super cute. Lucky you to play Grandma!",

Love the name and the story behind it.Does she play tug and growl and steal socks from the laundry? My dog Freddy was a sock thief. They have great personalities. My DH's sister died suddenly today. She was disabled with Down's and was sick, still it was sudden and a shock. No one expected it. No suffering which was very good.Life is uncertain. It's hard on my DH since they were close and he was protective of her. Now she is gone another part of family history slips away. My memories of her are positive and happy.

Under what circumstances do folks make a tribe- disasters coming together (earth quakes), war and conflict, economic collapse etc. What circumstances cause people to act collectively and not individually. Having adopted an older kid with clear PTSD from being abandoned multiple times before the age of 4, I appreciated the PTSD comments and how PTSD symptoms are hard wired to protect us. I thought the book was good as far as he went with it. I would like to learn more about Colonial men and women leaving society to stay with the Indians. We almost bought in to a co-housing situation here in Oregon in 2007. It is a big regret that I didn't go for it. I would have been much better off. I was so shocked by the advanced breast cancer diagnoses and it being the same side as my Grandmother that I figured why move- I would be dead. I ended up 10 years down the road. Who would have thought. I really wanted the community part of co-housing. We have no relatives here in Oregon, all family is East or in CA. The community was so popular that the wait list is years. I think we would have been better off as a family and certainly for DH as a single parent. What you give up in privacy and individuality you get back i n collective living, shared experiences, support and common purpose. We took the safest economic route which was to stay put in our ranch house in our neighbrhood. We have some friends here that are helpful but people by and large keep to themselves. Folks at DH's job have really helped us during times I have crashed. I think that is true of our society. There is this individual bent to modern society and not a collective mind set. I\"t's not my business what so and so does. I would be intrusive and need to butt out.\" This isolates folks. I see it with older folks, single parents and families under going crisis - illness, job loss, mental illness etc... People are afraid to intervene, check up on folks- just pop in to connect. This contributes to high rates of disconnect and depression. Poorer more rural, less \"advanced\" societies are far more connected. They have to be to survive. Maybe next life time I will get to experience community. I lived the entire house in the burbs, garden and stuff... it's nice but you can't take it with you and it's very labor intensive. Funny but community costs more to buy in to collectively owned lands and gardens and buildings but you get more.",

His fur is not well cared for, he's past grooming it and he is super old and hyperthyroid/ renal failure. I bought him tuna at the store. I give him whatever he will eat. I told DH not to bother with the thyroid med (squirt 2x daily) since he was scampering out the garage to avoid it. At this point he might feel better with his thyroid faster then slowed... clearly he's upset if we give it to him. Sometimes he throws it up. So I said to stop. QOL. I get it. I think he's avoiding us because he's going to get his squirt. I walked all over last night calling and no sight of him. Love this old man till it's time. I have not thrown up today so far... very cautious about what I eat. Taking reglan and eating bland mushy stuff. I went grocery shopping and barely made it there and back I was so beat.

Before we did that we drove through a nature area to look at the tree colors and there was a huge group of wild turkeys! Seven of them in fact, one male and 6 females. We stayed in the van and threw out cracked corn, scared them but then they came back and scarfed the feed. They are surprisingly pretty birds as far as feathers go, bands of blue, gold, cream and browns and black ticking. Really except for their heads being scaly and red they are handsome birds and big. My DH took some pictures and I will try and share. I had chemo again today. No vomiting and I am able to eat. I am tired and my RBCs are low and I am slightly anemic but my numbers are pretty good. The thing that is bothering me is severe fatigue and some bone pain in my hips and clicking ribs. This is a fast quick infusion and waiting for labs takes longer then anything.

I simply can't imagine not having this drain- my goodness I would blow up like a tick. I was 4 cycles down and I am having fatigue, joint and muscle pain. Happily no N/V and no GI issues (diarrhea or constipation) either. So next week I have a break and we will see how my cancer reacts. I can't wait for my voter card to come in... where is it?? I am soo anxious to vote in this election. I wasn't this anxious since 8 years ago. I love voting. We have a wonderful country and it is blessed despite the drama and fighting.

I need to try and stay alive until I roundup some care givers and school starts. You are right that those lucky souls who get hit by a bus and taken out in an instant are spared having to think about what is being left behind. This is hard for me. I feel horrible guilt. I promised to be here for her and I can't. She drives me crazy sometimes and yet I feel very sorry for her. She hurts and is scared.

I am so tired and wiped out it's 1pm and I just got dressed. They upped my chemo from 20 to 25 to 30mg per kg I think.. not sure of the dosing. But N/V and diarrhea are to be expected. So I just need to suck it up, rest and keep trucking. I have the baptism to prepare for. My DH is so sweet he took my list of the 3 things I needed to get and will pick them up when he swings by to get DD3. She is tired and excited. I am making meat and vegan tea sandwiches and vegan cupcakes, munchies. My DH is a very good cook so if I run out of steam bless his heart he can take over and I know things will be yummy. It's a wonderful thing to have a husband who likes to cook and who does things around the house. I am extremely blessed and I know it. My gratitude knows no end. Please keep Longtermsurvivor/ Stephanie on your prayer list. She is heading to the end of her journey and she is a compassionate loving person who gave so much to BCO and hoped to aide anyone on their journey with lovingkindness. I will miss her posts so much but her suffering needs to end. Blessings Stephanie.",

If you were a passive sit on your hands and wait for the office to help you type of patient--- you would croak. You would miss weeks of treatments and I wonder if they would even notice or care? Navelbine is a bitch too I puke part of dinner up every single night. sucks. I am getting to the point where maybe dinner needs to be taken out of the schedule. It's not worth the nausea, fullness, burping and vomiting. It's usually just one session of 3 or 4 vomits and then I feel better. Weird. It's definitely the chemo because the day before I am supposed to go in and it's worn off - I feel much better. Ah the joys of cancerland. Thanks for letting me vent..",

Sixteen years ago when we had to put our other border collie down because of lymphoma, we took our 2 other dogs Flower (terrier) and Banner (Golden retriever/ DD1's service dog) in to see her body after she was put down by the vet. The vet suggested it since we were at the house. Their reaction was quite amazing; they went and sniffed her body and looked startled and sad. It helped them not look for her. Cricket (the border collie) was the best dog I ever had and the 3 of them would all sleep together.",

I should have done this sooner. Just focus on Thanksgiving. DD2 took off the day of and day after off from work so we could all be together. I am not sure I even want to tell her.. no long face last time we see each other. I knew this was coming. Funny how we always think we have more time then we do. Count down.

I cried buckets and can't hardly look at his fur and paw print the vet made without crying. 16 wonderful years being loved by him and unless you've been well loved by a cat - head bumps, wiggling tail, purring so hard you can hear it across a room, face rubs, funny vocalizations when ever you talk to them, them running up the yard to greet you, fighting for lap space, bringing you dead trophies and kneading you with curly paws and toes... when a cat does all of this, plus love all your kids, tolerate being dressed up, pushed in dolly strollers and loved each family member in turn then you will understand why I am heartbroken. He's a family member by heart bond an exceptionally friendly cat. My little comforter and therapist too. DH dug a deep hole under the bench in the garden. Percy was sitting out there yesterday in the brief moment of sun we had. He spent many hours laying in the flowers sunning himself. We wrapped him in a lovely cloth and laid him in the soft soil, the kids wrote cards and we buried him with love. I am so glad I made it to be with him and send my love with him. He was down to 6+ pounds and his kidneys were going. So Kjones I am glad I got to be with him and the kids as we let him go DWD via our kind vet Dr. Johnson. It was closure pushing the soil over on his earthly remains. His wonderful spirit is flying free. Funny how we accept DWD for our pets and not so much for people. I wonder why that is.",

I love it when a great big dog is sweet and the opposite of \"breed\" perceptions. What a love. It's the way you raise them and some temperment too. Years ago we had a Setter/Dobie Sheppard mix, 75 pounds looked like a setter with black Dobie markings - who had a prey drive that wouldn't quit. He chased everything. One time at a park he was in full on chase to a rabbit and the rabbit stopped short and the dog ran right over top! The rabbit then high tailed it down and got away! It was just like a cartoon and we howled with laughter. Smart bunny. The dog was like \"where did he go??\" Hilarious. We have a 11 year old Border Collie who is a big baby. She grovels and inches up to people for a petting when we are on our daily walks, always mindful not to scare folks. She just loves people and stays very still and sits for a pet. Sweet. I trust her with kids and people. She's not real good with other dogs but kids and people she loves. She likes to bounce backwards, pulling on the leash ... we go for a pull sometimes instead of a walkie. She could care less about squirrels and birds in the yard and the towhees look for worms in the grass and kick up leaves and she ignores them. She will drive you nuts with a ball or frisbee... play! She is my happy girl and I never feel sad when I am around sweet Tess. A black and white antidepressant she is! I am so happy Taxol worked for you. May it continue. I wished it worked for me since my markers dropped like a rock.. 100 points in one dose. My onc does not bring up scans and I am fine with that since my symptoms are so dead on that I can map out where the cancer is active by where I ache, ascites fluid increases, puking and nausea and then add tumor markers. When the 50$ lab goes above 800 I puke and get more intestinal issues and misery. So I know pretty much where I stand and a scan won't tell me more then I already know. Save the $ for the drugs. I am lucky the tumor markers correspond. Cheap indicator and we are going for QOL and palliation so this works. Good to hear your onc says the same about the scheduling and side effects. Sharing this kind of information helps patients and lets them see what the doctors are thinking. BCO is so valuable for that. Hugs to all. May we enjoy this beautiful summer.",

We have another cat Zoey who is 13 and toothless and gimpy (limps) she and Percy adore each other. Zoey will look for Percy and wander around until she finds him and they will sleep together out on the chairs in the garden. It will be very hard on her to lose him. When he goes I want to make sure his body is presented to Zoey so she knows what happened to him. Percy would call to Zoey and they would chase each other playing..so cute. She will miss him. Our other cat Emmy is only 8 and is jealous of Percy. She frequently bullies Zoey and there is no love lost between them. Maybe Emmy will mellow when he is gone. She is a Siamese mix and very noisy and demonstrative. She can be super friendly and obnoxiously curious... just in your face! She is a character and my kids enjoy watching her. Her nick name is \"Wilma bird killer\" cause she is too good at catching birds. When the tohees are out we usher Emmy in. We also have a catio enclosure that I put Emmy in. It has a cat tower and perches to view the yard while being enclosed in wire. My DH built it and it's really nice. She must not mind being in it because when we go to get her out frequently she won't leave. We open the door and she refuses to come out. Percy used to kill mice, voles and birds but since he's old now he could care less. He just lays under the flowers in the sunshine and sleeps. Farmer Lucy I am so sorry about your Kitty Ellie. Kandy you just lost Ashley too. We all have had to part with our sweet fuzzy faces. I will just enjoy Percy cat for as long as I get to have him.",

I have a week off. to think about options. Stephanie our blueberries are all in pots. We move them around in the sun as the light changes. I have summer squash in pots and tomatoes in pots. None are ready. Hope I get to eat them. Well back to the drawing board. Caner humbles even the most optmistic person.",

Well our Catholic Health care stuck it to us yet again. I hope my oncologist can iron this out. She was supposed to get approval before sending for genetic testing and we sent in mostly for my daughters sake and to see how much risk I have that may have been passed on to her. Well our insurance denied the claim as \"experimental, Investigational, lacks clinical usefulness and is not covered.\" So the 3,000.00 test bill will be slammed to our pocket. I swear this Providence Catholic Health Insurance lives in the dark ages if they think genetic testing does not benefit the daughters of breast cancer patients. They are F--- ing crazy in the medieval ages. The cheap stupid bastards. I have a mind to take every drug under the sun to spend as much of their money as humanly possible and stick them with the bill. They have already cost me 3,000 in DWD meds and 3,000.00 in deductables (for just me and does not count other family members) and if we get another 3,000 bill for this testing. I will declare war. I will take every drug in the formulary and sign up in Jan for them again and keep spending $$$$$ as much as I possibly can. I have nothing to lose at this point and we have already had to hit retirement, credit cards and I HATE these people. They are unethical and shouldn't be in insurance. There is nothing Christian about them. By the way this chemo seems to be working. Yay... more bottles showed up today. May it keep working and costing them money. Tumor markers back tomorrow. My brother sent me $ for my birthday so we went out for crepes after chemo. It was delicious. No nausea yay just fatigue and my labs look great.",

It was surreal to vote then. Yesterday when I mailed my ballot I just couldn't believe I was voting for a smart well educated, experienced woman in the white house!! Woo Hoo! Times they are a changing. I remember back when I was an undergrad in the dorms telling my father I had a new room mate. Her name was Shel I told him. My Dad was very racist. (Note this was decades ago and no offense is intended.) I happened to mention she was black. He snapped,\" how in the hell did you get stuck with her?\" I said that we requested each other. I thought the food was going to fall right out of his mouth- his jaw just dropped. We were eating dinner. He then proceeded to tell me how I would be labeled a \"N\" lover, no dating, black listed and ruin my chances at life and success. I told him he was crazy and Shel was super nice. Her Mom's a teacher and she's smart. We got along great. We had no issues at all and had the same group of friends. He shook his head and said he thought I was smarter than that. Here it is all these years later and things really have changed!! We elected a black president twice! We are slowly moving past the old ways and ideas. I also remember another time, also at the dinner table, when I asked my Dad for a high school ring. He stopped and said, \"how much are they?\" I told him. He said, \"ok.\" My brother chimed in I want one too!! My Dad didn't look up from his plate but said, \"no son you will get a college ring.\" I remember how that stung. Like the expectation was I wouldn't finish college and women didn't get anything but a high school ring. SO much for that! I got my degrees and paid for them myself! Now we will have a woman president! I can't wait. :-) ",

I filled out the DWD paperwork 2 weeks ago. I was so afraid of dying in vomit and misery. I cried when hospice visited since they wouldn't guarantee a relief from suffering. I was hoping against hope faslodex might work. My seconal script (DWD is legal in Oregon) came in and I can pick it up today. I will pay 3,000.00 for the peace of mind to know I can leave this precious wonderful life with dignity in a painfree manner.. in hours instead of weeks of puking and suffering.

Higgins and Percy cat were the 2 most friendly comical, loving tolerant cats on the planet. Higgs lived to be 12 died of kidney failure and Percy 16 died of kidney failure. In between I have been comforted by many sweet characters Flower (terrier age 18), Daisy (cat 16 ), Banner (DD1's service dog an angel golden retriever 12 died kidney mass cancer), 2 rabbits. Bunsley Abby Rabby and Little Bit (chubs), Betsy the guniea pig and 2 canaries. It's the peaceable kingdom here. My BIL laughs and says if they ever dig up your yard they will wonder what is going on... steven king and all the bodies. We did not bury any of the dogs in the yard. They were all cremated.

The mass on my abdomen is huge and hard and eating is miserable. I am sticking to boost today. My oncologist suggested carboplatin in a small dose and DH was all over it. So down the hatch... I have been taking zofran round the clock and that has been helping. have to say. Thank you for all your kind comments and well wishes they sustain me. Have a wonderful day!",

The wetlands were lovely greys and browns, cat tails and lots of blue headed wood ducks and mallards. There were lots of coots too. They are such unusual birds and swim so quickly and pop up like corks. They are round grey- black colored birds with white beaks. They were fun to watch. The sunset was pretty and it was very nice to get out of the house and just watch the wild life. Nature is so soothing. Lovingkindness to you all.",

When we were first married we shared a wonderful afternoon hiking near there, in a place called Abbots Cove. I remember the wildflowers being thigh high and the grasses waving.. the sound of the ocean and the breezes. It's a magical place for the senses. We hiked and enjoyed the scenery and each others presence. It's days like that fill the heart. Images we can reflect on years later. Your cancer group sounds wonderful and probably how you have managed to live 25 years with breast cancer- a noble feat in and of itself. Thank you for sharing these photos. Feeling feline- The little squirrel at the feeder reminds me of ours! We have one little stinker who climbs the bird feeder and hangs onto the suet block munching away - mmm seeds and fat a delightful snack! I love watching them. I also love to watch our gold fish in our little pond laying in the sunshine, soaking up the suns rays and warming themselves. We have huge robins that take massive baths in our bird bath... splashing away knocking water off everywhere. They are amusing to watch. I enjoy them. It's the simple things in life that provide such pleasure. Today I am grateful for the sunshine and warmth; it isn't raining yay! My health continues to be stable and the flowers are blooming! Spring is a fantastic time to be alive. Be well and pain free. Lovingkindness to you all. rosevalley",

My observation at this point is that we are kinder and more loving to our animals. My Percycat (16) and Flower (18 yr old terrier) were both euthanized with a tender goodbye, all of us at bedside, IV and 1 minute of release then sweet death. No pain no suffering just clean sweet release from age and disease. We are much kinder to our animals then our people. That's too bad for the people.",

We have lived across the street 2 houses up and over for years and years. They know I have battled breast cancer for years. We talk.. or did. I am not sure how much I plan on saying anything anymore. He's really nice- it was his wife. In a hurry. Wonderful that your friends came out and helped walk for you and took her little ones too! That is so sweet. You have some wonderful friends. I hope you are having a super time with the new baby. Being a Grandmother is wonderful. Lucky you!! Enjoy. To all those who posted roses-LOVE THEM! Thanks for thinking of me and sharing your gardens. Jazzy- the doves are so cute all nested up together. I didn't know they mated for life. I knew Eagles and Canada geese do. We like to watch the chickadees and gold finches at our feeder. We buy sock feeders with nyger (sp?) seed for the goldfinches and they love it. It's fun to watch them. It's stopped raining! It's sunny Yahoo. Sun is good. My knees are healing but my joints and hips are still sore from that fall. Falling when you are 57 is a whole different ballgame then hitting the deck as a kid. It didn't effect the drain. I am doing that every 3 days and got off almost a liter. I wish it would slow down and stop but it doesn't look like that's in the cards. The longest living person with a pleurx drain is 18 months. I have had mine for 8. Be well sisters! Lovingkindness to you all. ((hugs))",

That's a funny note about the stolen lunch one bite and tossed. I laughed. Where do you find these things? I need to take our old 11 year old Border collie in and have the Vet check out her shoulder. She's limping. Maybe arthritis? Not sure. I hope it's nothing serious. She is such a sweet dog. I feel so silly about being addicted to this TV show called \"Alone.\" Normally I only watch a few things on TV -HTV tiny houses and fixer uppers. I like that show Naked and Afraid because it's so off the wall that I can't believe they do it. But Alone is a survival show in the wilds of Vancouver Island. I have been up there and it's isolated, cold and rainy. It's also gorgeous and wild. There are wolves, bears and cougars. It is a facinating show. They just started a new season and this one has women in it. They have to find all their own food and shelter, water and not go nuts being alone for months. Cancer is a mind game too. You have to learn to survive between the appointments. Keep up beat with uncertainty. Search for meaning and solace daily, while knowing your life is likely counted in months not years. Stay present and comfort yourself. Cancer can be lonely. People don't want to talk about dying they don't want to invest in someone who is unlikely to live. We in Cancerland live our own kind of survivalist show like Alone. These boards help make the journey less stressful and less lonely. I am grateful to have this place to come to. Palms together in gratitude for your friendship and community. Lovingkindness to all. love rosevalley",

I was disappointed they didn't drop more. Ascites is the same. So we stay the course. My goal is to live through the first week in September so my DD3 has someone here at the house over the summer.

I saw the picture of your DH in the hospital when you were having lung problems. I hope you are feeling better and breathing better. You are so strong and try so hard. Having a child makes us work that much harder to stay alive and be a mom. It's such a roller coaster ride this life in cancerland. I try so hard to live a good life and be there for my kids and DH and pets. I woke up this morning queasy and full. I pulled off more fluid then normal with my drain and got very nauseated and vomitd several times. I haven't vomited in weeks so that was depressing. I panic when it happens since I don't want a return to the bowel obstruction and relentless N/V of Dec-Feb. I worry the faslodex is slowing down and will stop working. Worrying does not help but I can't stop myself. The zoloft is working but not enough so my PCP increased it. We will see how that does. I am worried about my dog who is sick and my youngest DD who suffers from mental health issues. Life in cancerland does not mean life doesn't have it's challenges. Ugh... Patty I was so happy to see you post. You too have had a hard time with N/V and the big D... my heart goes out to you. Glad you are out of the hospital and home with your boys. I hope your depression funk lessens. Gentle (((Hugs))) life is hard and sweet. Being a Mom is big motivation. Stephanie and Feelingfeline thank you for the Mama and baby photos.

Then they expect the winds to pick up to perhaps 60 mph... worried about the trees. Our soil is so waterlogged. Anyway..can't go outside even to walk the dog.. you could drown! Staying in the house.. books..music and the internet. Sigh..next week it's supposed to dry out. All my daffodils and tulips look beat up! I am otherwise doing pretty well, regaining energy slowly- lost to 3 months of misery nausea and vomiting. It's a slow resurrection as Patty knows. Very thankful for this faslodex reprieve. Everyone stay dry!",

I would have thrown in the towel New Years where I spent the day in the ER intractable vomiting and pain, unbearable misery, kidneys shutting down. Here I survived and plan to walk though a garden on a Sunny day! Enjoy the spring flowers and DH's company! Not many things last 27 years. Thanks be to Faslodex and my unexpected reprieve.... oh and prayers and lovingkindness of strangers. Lets not forget that!!

That you all take the time out to offer support is wonderful and I am deeply appreciative! I have been struggling with depression and I noticed that the reglan I take to move food through my gut has a side effect of depression on long term use. I have been taking it past the recommended 12 weeks. I started in Dec. and it's got some side effects. So I bet that's the reason for this misery. Unfortunately I am miserable with food not moving through too. So I have cut back on the amount I take. I added Zoloft. Hoping better living through chemistry! Aromatase Inhibitors also made me depressed. I was positively suicidal on arimidex. I quit taking it after 6 months, between the depression and the unrelenting joint pain.. It was horrid. I think our bodies are supposed to have some estrogen and none plays havoc. We are chemical beings as anyone who went into instant menopause through chemo (I did at 48) would know that! Chemical menopause in a chemo cocktail... instant drop off a cliff. No fun. Pity the poor women in their thirties. The sad truth is that we have to take the drugs to live at all. So it's life under the veil of pill side effects or death. Some choice right? I am feeling a little better. Although I am draining every 3 days and took off 800. All day it has made me feel odd. Sometimes I have no effect, other times not. Still I am grateful to be able to take off the fluid. Beats carrying around a liter sloshing your gut and pressing on your intestines. The Faslodex shots have slowed things down. I walk several times a day. I am not at all hungry and continue to lose weight slowly. Food is just not very appealing. I can't eat vegetables and things with roughage and not pay (vomit) so it's always the same. Eating to live. Interesting because I used to LOVE to eat and am over weight so this is a new reality for me. The comfort of food is gone. Food can hurt, cause misery nausea and vomiting so I am very careful. Food to live is what i do now. It's really interesting how puking for months and being on 800 calories of liquid drinks only, shrinking your stomach and learning how to eat again has rearranged my entire outlook to food. I eat just enough to live and sustain my energy. I eat tiny portions and feel full fast. It's been an experience. Not an experience to repeat. At least I can eat which was not an option in Jan and Feb.. so things have hugely improved. I do wonder how long this will last. I get tumor markers drawn this week and meet with oncology next week. Fingers crossed. My sweet border collie is doing better on anti inflammatory meds. Her black mask around her eyes and ears is getting streaked with white and her joints are old. They did an xray at the vets and did not see any damage. I was told no ball and frisbee jumping until her shoulder heals. She doesn't understand. Poor thing. I was surprised she has lost 4 pounds. She always weighs the same year after year- 45 pounds and she was 41. So she has been getting two nice walkies and pats and rubs. Trying to let that shoulder heal. I have near constant pain in my back so I understand. Thank you for all the flower pictures they make life sweet. Life in cancerland is hard. Only those folks who have visited cancerland really get it. Lovingkindness to the sweet souls who understand!! Blessings to you all. Thanks for letting me vent and ramble.",

I had some blisters on the bottom of my feet after the 3rd dose of Taxol; after the 4th dose I couldn't feel my feet at all. I thought that was great since the pins and needles thing was awful. My onc at the time said that zero sensation wasn't good. Sometime during radiation the feeling started to return and so did the neuropathy. They tried gabepentin (Neurontin) which didn't do much except turn me into a water balloon. I had lots of dependent edema. To make a long story short I ditched the neurontin, used accupuncture, glutamine and coQ10 and toughed it out. Sleep was miserable. The nerves finally healed and it took months. What I find 7 years later is that if my feet get swollen (edema) then the nerves are irritated and the neuropathy returns. My onc increased the diuretics and down went the edema and the neuropathy with it. So if you have edema in your feet try asking for diuretics to reduce it and see if that lessens the neuropathy. It works for me. ",

Someone called in and 2 cops hauled all 4 sets of parents in. My kid mouthed off to the officer because he made her best friend cry. My husband was so angry! Needless to say she was grounded. We knew one of the other parents really well so we watch the kids. I'm the only parent who has the luxury of being a stay at home Mom.. teens need as much supervision as little kids! My daughter did say the cop taunted them that \"what kind of problems could these well off kids have? Lost homework no fancy jeans?\" He did have quite the attitude but we were glad he gave the kids warnings and not citations. Grateful for that!! My daughter said \"I have watched my Mom having cancer since I was in 5th grade.

Good thing you had it taken off and it's done! MOH's surgery usually leaves a nice cosmetic outcome. Good luck and it will heal soon! A year after my chemo and radiation 2008, I noticed some changes on a tiny mole on the side of my knee. It went from flat and uniformly brown,  to raised black and bumpy. I figured it was so little and didn't seem too much to get excited about. Still I watched it change because I saw it every time I would shave my legs. So I had a dermatologist look at it. He said we'll watch it. I said, \" no, I really want you to take it off and send it in.\" So they did. It came back melanoma grade zero.. just sitting on top of the skin. The pathologist said to take margins, and the dermatologist did. Ouch. So it pays to monitor your own skin changes! This was an easy fix. Melanoma is nasty stuff and will take you out faster then Breast cancer. I think all the radiation I had tipped the scales, plus being fair skinned.",

This is a long term relationship after being diagnosed with mets, not a once a year visit. Be blunt, write it down, maybe a log of symptoms. If she is defensive and blows you off or says \"oh you look refreshed and tolerating things well.\" Correct her. If she continues to blow you off get another provider. Once you are stage 4 managing symptoms should be part of the game plan. You wrote that you are ER+ PR+ Her2-, did you run out of hormonals (Tamoxifen, Arimidex, Aromasin, Femera etc.)? Or was your original tumor/ pathology ER/PR + but the bone mets currently are not receptor positive? Why did they start with Xeloda?",

I remember my Mother calling me years ago and saying...\"seriously who is the sicko who named this stuff Golytely???\" It made me think of her, she had that happen. Yes a one day prep is icky enough and a 2 day prep is just nasty.. awful. I have had 2 colonoscopies and one virtual colonoscopy since BC diagnosis and all have been clear. Pretty unusual to get mets to colon with IDC, more with lobulat I thought. I wouldn't worry too much(famous last words) because there are so many little reasons, small tear, diverticulae, engorged vein that got nicked that can cause bleeding etc... geez. Wait until you get the report back. It might never happen again. The UTI sounds miserable enough; glad you are on the mend. Good luck with the job hunt.

I felt the same when I got breast cancer at 48 and my kids were 6, 10 and 12. It just killed me. My Grandmother died of IBC in 3 years and it was traumatic. I was a teenager and remembered everything. The sadness and terror of leaving my kids and dying the painful death she did, just wiped me out. It's been nearly 9 1/2 years though and I have made my peace. I don't feel picked on since my Grandma died of cancer, my Grandfather, Greatgrand father too.. Great Aunt. I know cancer is how some people die. I just wish my last kid was out of high school and more independent. I can't help the way things are but it makes me feel badly. Unfinished business is hard to walk away from. But as a friend put it - \"give it up to God and trust it will be taken care of.\" I feel the inner strength of the kids will see them through. They are stronger then they think and more capable then they imagine. Plus we have sown tremendous amounts of love and those seeds will grow and nourish them in the future. Our legacy will thrive.

The people must brave the elements, find water, food and survive being wet, cold, animals and utterly Alone. Two of these amazing people left the race because of loneliness and missing loved ones. Their bodies were fed, their souls and need for companionship empty. These folks compete for a 500,000 prize. The beauty of the Island and the wildlife is stunning, they were making it but not mentally. This area is so beautiful but that isn't enough. I have been there on vacation and love it. My DH and I had a wonderful time up there - together. Cancer is a lot like the show Alone. We are alone on our journey navigating the cancerland waters- treatment, isolation, feelings about death, living, drugs and side effects. We go on a journey of real life survival. Fighting mentally through the sheer years of treatment and trials of different meds, symptom management, surgeries...on and on. Then the social aspects of cancer - the isolation, social effects and effects on our family. It's a mental mind game. Our families can sit on the outside and watch, support and cheer... but the cancerland journey we go alone. My DD1 is special needs developmentally disabled and autistic. She sent me the sweetest email tonight. In short it was \"we will do fund raiser and get new medicine to fix you. You can stay.\" Oh that it was that easy. Just pop that pill and make it all right. There is no fun raiser to fund cause there is no cure. The email made me smile. Life is simple for her, literal and good/bad.. I just have to align myself with the good side to win. Mom will stay; Mom is good. Life isn't so clear. She is comforted by seeing me upright and doing normal things. Now I will lose my hair and look like a cancer patient. I have lost so much weight that my wedding ring has fallen off several times. My clothes look like sacks. Now I will look like cancer (bald) instead of me being the only one who feels it. I feel the effects always but only I do. People around me say \"you look good- do you feel good?\" I hide it. Why talk about what you can't do anything about. Life is what it is. Cancer is eating me alive. Fluids i drink leak into my gut and fill it with fluid, instead of heading out my kidneys. I am always thirsty. I feel that daily slosh of fluid, aches when it comes off. Can't eat, N/V. I take naps.. fatigue. This is so strange this disease. Thoughts about cancer for the night time.. got to go ambien kicking in. Thanks for letting me ramble. Sweet dreams to all.",

I was looking at ideas and thinking how fun it would be to try them on my 15 year old. I am pretty good at copying face painting ideas. Then I stopped to wonder if my health would hold out by then.. would I be here? No telling. Just playing it week by week. I know that it's good to live in the present moment but to have virtually no future is mind bending. It is weird. Thank you all for your kind words, lovely postings of flowers, animal adventures and sharing your lives. No one gets this like we in cancerland. I am going to harvest my foxglove seeds and put them in a bag and spread them out up at the park... like Johnny Appleseed only with foxglove. My legacy.. to the local hummingbirds and butterflies. They are local plants so I am not hurting anything, just adding some! We have lavender, pink and white foxglove. When I am gone may they flourish and thrive. Lovingkindness to all especially those at the end of their journey in hospice may you be free from pain and at peace. rosevalley ",

My DD1 and DH and I played Johnny Appleseed and took a HUGE bucket of foxglove stalks to huge natural Park. We walked along the river and in the dappled areas forested near the banks spread stalks and cups of tiny black seed the size of poppy seed all harvested from our garden. In a couple of years the foxglove will turn into their elegant majestic spires loved by birds and bees. I spread lavender, pink and white seeds. I feel pretty good about my efforts. My legacy in flowers... no markers. Here is a picture of the river off DH's phone. It was a beautiful walk. Nature is something! Happy 4th. My cats are so peeved at me because I won't let them out. One more day of forced prison and then they can be free.. fireworks are scary. All the cats are too old. ",

You aren't boring me with a \"weary story.\" It is that way with us all. Your comments are what I have always felt. Our ancestors live in us through their spirit and love. Certain foods, plants and traditions during the year bring images of those we love long gone but still loved and enjoyed in our hearts. When I see purple and blue pansies I see my Grandmother Helen's love for them and her spirit and appreciation for beauty. I can not see pansies and not think of my Grandmother. I feel her love for me and life in pansies. This is how we live on in spirit after we pass from life. We are there in different form inside our loved ones. It's like the foxglove in the meadows and banks. No one needs to know a couple planted the seeds. It's plenty honor enough to have one plant flourish for the birds and bees. My DH will smile when the hummingbirds flit through the foxglove in the summer. He will remember my love for them. I will return to my family's heart if only for a moments passing a gentle reminder - \"oh foxglove Mommy loved those and she loved me too.\" It's all the legacy I will ever need. Buddhists and Christians should not lay treasures on earth but let it go and appreciate this sweet life full of beauty and wonder. When those who have known me and felt my love for them pass on, and there is no memory of my earthly time spent in anyone alive - then the flowers will live on. Perfect. They will bloom, whither and die, spread seed and grow again. The great cycle of life continues on. Dying very slowly of cancer has let me think about what really matters. Spread love like seeds and do as much good as you can, appreciate everything and everybody. Good night. ((gentle hugs)) rosevalley who can't sleep because of the steroids.. ambien is having zippo effect. But I am here and grateful.",

It was such an education we spent many an evening laughing and teasing each other. So maybe that's why your son prefers to talk with Mom!

Prayers your way and isn't it sweet to see your kids grow up? Brenda-Thank you for sharing the Mary Oliver poem I just love her. She has a way of speaking right through things in a very raw and immediate way. Her images paint a picture. It was interesting today in the infusion room. The nurses are opening up more as people. Some have suffered such painful prsonal losses and yet they work with cancer patients daily accepting more pain and loss. That takes strength and fortitude. To watch these life and death struggles.. roller coaster rides up and down. Slowly dying and reviving. Seriously I don't know how they do it. It's hard for me to live it. I can't imagine working in it too. I drove myself to the cancer center. The traffic wasn't bad coming or going. I didn't even get out of there until 5:30 and Made it home in a little over an hour! I was kevetching ?? spelling... over how bad it was going to be(before I left) and it wasn't! All that anxiety for nothing. Our fears are frequently way worse then reality. Abraxane seems tolerable. Labs were good have to wait for markers. No change on the ascites fluid portion. Still hoping to maybe stretch draining over 3 days instead of every other. still guess what I ate for breakfast?? Blueberries off our bushes, strawberries and granola. Wow was it good. In March I would have puked my guts up. In July I ate normal food and felt full not sick. It's the little things that really are lovely. A fresh organic blueberry picked right off the bush is one of life's unsung delights!!! Heavenly. Not to brag but Oregon grows the BEST Blueberries!!! Living around cancer is a triumph. But you knew that. Peace to all. ",

I puked up my coffee and cheese stick and took zofran. I feel awful. Still no word on the tumor markers. It's supposed to be 104 and is beastly hot already at 10am. Pity anyone with no AC. Looks like it will be a wipe out day of laying low. I was up off and on all night with terrible gas, flatus, burping that just lasted several times an hour all night. Felt like I would explode. Miserable. Gemzar comes at a price. I did have something rather comical happen yesterday morning. I was sitting in the living room when I hear this screeching, screaming howling and just about flew out of my chair. It was hysterical and I knew it was my Siamese mix Emmy and I thought my goodness she has torn her leg off.. something very awful. Well I go in to the Family room to the patio door and she is on the inside poofed out having a hissy fit in epic proportions because there is a HUGE male grey cat with a red collar on the other side of the screen drinking out of her water bowl! Emmy is fiercely territorial and this just rocked her world. The nerve!! My other cat Zoey (old toothless and gimpy) was sitting there wide eyed like tell him Sista!! It was so funny. Good thing they couldn't get at each other it might have been an ugly cat fight. Anyway I had to escort the interloper out the side gate, how he fit through the bars is beyond me. He had to be 16 pounds, obviously a fat beloved friendly pet. No fear all curiosity. Then I let our dog out to further discourage visits... So today Emmy has circled the lot several times and searched the bushes and perimeter.... looking for any signs of the grey one! We have cracked up at how she is behaving! She won't soon forget this episode. Her nick name is Wilma Bird Killer... we try to keep her in our catio (8 x 5 enclosed screened in porch built by DH off a shed, cat tower, multiple perches and landing areas to climb and play, box and water. Emmy loves it out there and will go hang out inside even with the door open. It's her safe haven, there are sleeping pillows and kitty cup. Most of the time she lounges like a leopard hanging off the cat tower Queen of her domain. I know lots of you have cats so thought you might like the story.",

You may be able to marry who you want as the law of the land but not in their house. This is a HUGE church multiple services, hundreds of worshipers, entire blocks donated to medical and job skills, indigent care etc and the price is your soul and allegiance. It's also the only deaf game in town. They are against everything I hold near and dear- I am trying to be open minded but what do I tell my kid? Your relatives and your sisters best friends are going to hell because they are gay/lesbian? Your church says you are not to judge- leave that to God, accept as people but do not encourage? Really? Big of you that kind of attitude will promote family unity. Last service I sat there just speechless. I will die by death with dignity meds unless I die first of something faster. They will tell my kid Mom went to hell? There is a part of me that is amused since I don't believe in hell. There is not much I can accept and endorse with their brand of Christianity. It is not the \"loving all no exceptions\" message I got from the New Testament I took in college. Anyway after years in a Quaker Meeting where woman had a voice in the 1600s and slaves were embraced, same sex couples married happily under Meetings and choice and mercy for the dying are sanctified, peace work- it's a real hard pill to swallow this brand of Christianity. Now that I am folded into Buddhism with my back ground I am left speechless. I tell my daughter her choice is her own, but be educated and thoughtful; think hard about what you are accepting. She is a smart kid and will figure it out. I have always believed it best to teach by example. Live what you believe and that will speak volumes more then a lecture. A sense of belonging and meaning and community is strong though, I hope it's worth it. Please no one take offense since I mean none and believe there are many paths up a mountain to the summit. Pick the path that speaks to you and follow it. Everyone has a right to choose. This is one of the hardest things I have had to do. Thanks for listening to me ramble.

It helped my DD1 take her limited cognitive skills and concentrate them on reading and writing, which she does at 3rd/ 4th grade level. Pretty good. I know other DD kids only without the autism, same IQ range, who can't write and read as well. Glad I am not the only Mom up thinking what happens after I am gone. About 3 or 4 years ago we also got the special citizen registry to give descriptions and photos of non verbal DD adults in our town of 150K. My DD1 was number 5 in their list! She used to wander and thankfully stopped. It gave me a little peace of mind. They started this registry after a really tall young black autistic teen got lost, didn't respond to commands by Portland police and they shot and killed him. I think the young man was only 15 but very tall, adult sized and had never spoken. There was outrage and they started the special citizens registry. My DD1 and DD3 are both deaf and neither talk, ASL only. My youngest is just deaf and can learn to drive but all kids can make mistakes! I will look to see how to get a Nonverbal /ASL only bumper sticker or window decal. Farmerlucy- thank you for your shared story. I am glad to hear your friend's son is 50 and drives and gets around. It's great to hear that. I worry about my youngest learning to drive. I will try to be her guardian angel and spirit watch. How very sad your Mom died when you were so little.

Stephanie- very interesting clip on deaf culture. We have a cool book about a congenital form of deafness in Nepal and the culture that revolves around it. Beautifully photographed. I guess there is another village in Bali. Both my kids have congenitally malformed cochleas and both have implants. Neither get enough information for speech. My oldest DD gets the best use of her cochlear implant and loves music and will listen with her Ipod. She will hum and we can figure out from the melody what song she is listening to! Like she loves Ariel songs from Disney and will hum the songs. Dead on too! It's so funny. My youngest doesn't get enough of the speech spectrum to use an implant except for sound awareness. She will listen to music and can tell if something is on or off etc. Still both kids are culturally deaf. They think in ASL and write in English with ASL influence. It is isolating speaking a language no one else does. It's hard. They can be in a play ground of kids and isolated... it's heart breaking sometimes. They also have a radar for seeing someone sign from a football field away! OOOOHHHH someone DEAF!!!! Yippeee!! They go barging over and no one is ever upset. It seems a cultural norm to bust in and connect, regardless of age. The school for the deaf is full of kids with cochlear implants who can't use them for speech or hearing. Just giving someone an implant doesn't make them hearing. If they don't get the audiology and speech support early and hard, plus support from school, the kids won't wear the implants and they won't develop normal speech. Even kids who were headed for being verbal and mainstreamed successfully I have seen give up because it is so hard to listen and learn in a noisy public school. They just wear out and quit. It's very hard and an enormous amount of work. My attitude is and will be - cochlear implants are tools period. You are always deaf and to use a tool is what humans do. If it helps you great. I wear hearing aides and glasses. Can't see a dang thing without my glasses. I wear them. Can't hear well either. We got quite some negative feedback from deaf folks over giving 2 adopted deaf kids implants but I have no regrets. The kids enjoy what use they do get. They will always be a part of the Deaf Tribe. They will always make fun of our signing and giggle at our mistakes... Like one time I signed chocolate instead of Church and my kid and DH busted up that they wanted to go to the chocolate church of See's.... as in See's candies. Holy Sees.... it took a long time to live that down. My DD2 recently signed she was going to kill the car instead of park it and my 15 year old nearly fell off her chair laughing.

Wish your oldest well - hug her, send letters or text. I annoy my DD2 and text her all the time at night... \"Good night I love you. xoxox\" Good night moon... she will always be my little girl. I will always love them. I guess gemzar effects the brain... I was making vegan black bean burgers and had my brown rice, peppers, corn, tomato paste... forgot the sweet potato. Dang. I thought they were easy to make into patties and they baked up perfectly. I dust with bread crumbs. DH and DD2 loved them with tomato and avacado, lettuce and mayo. Tater tots... yep Mom caved it was a kid dinner. Now they are yelling at the TV soccers on!! Had a lovely conversation with DD2 and she shared how she cried back in Jan when they thought I wouldn't make it and how nice it's been all summer to come visit. It has been wonderful to have so many meals and visits with her. She breaks my heart -they all do. My youngest pleads and my oldest sends me drawings and cards. I will never be able to walk off into the sunset and die peacefully. I will struggle. I have a great family. They will be ok alone they are loved and stronger then they realize. I do dream about dying peacefully in my sleep since I am very tired, achy and hurt a lot. I will miss them so much but this body I could ditch. ",

I am 58 and you are 60... the songs of an age. The burgers were fine. My daughter is a lazy cook and if she fails at an attempt she just stops. I keep trying another recipe.. until it comes out right.Sometimes even mistakes are ok! Why pay 4.00 a box for vegi burgers when theyare easy to make and you get 8 for the fresh ingredients. So We made them together. It helps I like to cook and don't mind washing dishes. :-) This has been a hard day. Bloated and painful even the skin/muscles on my legs ache. What is with this? I barely made it through breakfast,took DD3 to church and ran 2 errands and collapsed to napping. No energy. I can really tell when the chemo hits and when it wears off. Not terribly hungry and everything makes me feel so full. So thirsty. Chemo on Wed. wonder what oncologist will say. If I abruptly disappear it's because my computer has been acting up.. seizures and general turning itself on and off with out warning. We ordered a new one on sale, it's old and falling apart. They are so cheap now and you get more. I have an old flip phone and refuse to get a touch phone since my phone works great and I can text my deaf/hearing family like a fiend.. no sweat. It charges well, is cheap costs 25.00 a month pay as you go 1000 txt messages. They are discontinuing it come December. Maybe me and my phone will go out together! Ha ha.. I am all for technology but if something works I have a hard time justifying getting rid of it just because they came up with something new. My DD3 is driving us crazy... school can't open fast enough. Oy... She is bored and excited and how much can anyone talk about school?? Blessing to all those Mom's and Dad's suffering this weekend. Keep your sanity this too shall pass. Hugs Stephanie! You are in a much harder spot and watching your dying body fail and still being attached is weird eh? Are you comfortable? I feel so odd and un well that I know I am following you despite the treatments. It's like draining out your vital energy and life force with every pleurx bottle.. a little more of you gone.

Tomorrow we will go to the woods. Might be from a car. I simply do not have the energy to walk very far. I get short of breath, my right side hurts and I just wilt. Not that my general weakness stops me. Today, I decided to go to the mall to get DD2 a sweater for Christmas. She was wearing one Sat that was pretty worn and well loved. I thought the kid needed another nice one. It wasn't even on sale but exactly like the one she was wearing on Saturday in a different color. I bought it. The kind young clerk wrapped it up. I kind of described what I was looking for and she knew right away. She was just like my daughter.. skinny and blond. I held it up against her to see the size and can't thank her enough for finding a good one. I can't shop the sales.. no energy. I want one nice gift for each DD and DH. It took me 3 rest stops to get out of the mall and back to the car. Then I went home and napped. I found 2 things on line for DD1. So one more kid... and DH. Then I am done. This will be a record for me if I get it done in September! I have gotten addicted to BBC crime stories on Netfix... nice diversion to cancer. After dinner I hit the crime stories and murder mysteries. God night all. thanks for listening to me ramble. I made another milestone..58. Ten years down the cancer trail.",

I have been so close down that path it is so totally real and ever present, that sometimes I feel like I am on death row and am just waiting for my number to be called. It's so weird to know cancer will win and this is just a pause button in the great scheme of my life. It is hard to live this way. You don't make new friends, you don't plan past a week, no retirement dreams, no talk of seeing that graduation and hoping for spouses for your kids in time you can meet them. This is the FIRST year of my adult life that I didn't plant something to see in the spring. I will have DD3 help me replant tulip bulbs.. sigh. I carefully store them for the summer and replant. This is living moment to moment. I do try to keep a lighter tone and be grateful for my time. I had to laugh when I picked up my DD3 at school today she came home in a pretty good mood except she was scared. I asked her what she was scared of. She showed me her phone and all the images of scary \"killer\" clowns all across the US. Then here in our town two 14 year old boys dressed up as clowns and scared some girls.. it was on the news. They got arrested for disorderly conduct. See even here in Oregon my DD3 signed!! She was so serious! \"Really Dad you shouldn't walk the dog.. becareful. There are bad clowns out there.\" She actually warned Dad. Hahaha... it was good yucks. I do kind of agree that clowns are scary. We might have to break out the night lights at age 15 1/2!! Fear is so funny though. I remember being alone up at the cabin on off season. Not a light on anywhere in the other cabins. Pitch black in all directions!! I went to take the dog out for her last night pee. We walked to the edge of the porch she put her head down and all her fur stood up. She growled this menacing low growl. I froze and so did the dog. We went back in the cabin. Pee on the floor kiddo..news papers on the kitchen vinyl. too many bears, cougars and coyotes to go out tonight. I let my border collie sleep on the bed with me..and I never let dogs on the bed. Fear.. yep it consumed me that night. Something was out there.",

The drain pro guy just left and he was awesome - in and done in 45 minutes and the sink is empty and draining!! I am sooo happy. He unclogged it going through the roof vent. Good thing it's sunny and dry. Dishwasher is running; it is beautiful. It is a gorgeous fall day sunny and mild, golden leaves and blue skies. No nasty clown sightings.

It is making me down. Every time I try to get up and out to do anything it's raining. Wet grey cold mess. I got 20 bottles and I have motored through 7 of them. One full one a day. Every morning some relief and then I fill up all day - by night time I am bloated and round bellied. The endless cycle. I lay on my left side and listen to my ribs click and I am tired. So tired and kind of down. I finished my Halloween cards and put red flame maple leaves in brilliant red-orange inside. It's the most beautiful tree just glows in what sunlight we have. Yesterday I asked my DH if he missed his Mom and Dad and talking to them. He said yes, but it's been 15 years since his Mom died and 10 since his Dad passed. My Dad passed 10 years ago too. My Mom has dementia and simply can't keep a conversation going. It's great to hear her voice but there is no one behind it. I have spent time talking to the cat today... therapy in fur. Cats don't tell. I feel so bad to leave my DH alone and worry that the stress of watching me slowly die for years is aging him and him and isolating him. More then anything I want everyone to be well and happy - then to die and be free of cancer. This isn't living so much as existing in some cancer purgatory. I feel guilty that I am not happy but when you never feel good it's kind of difficult... causes an existential crisis of sorts. You suddenly realize there is nothing you really need or want (that you can have like health and well being) and you feel rather useless. Take care. hugs",

Ruthbru- I posted on Cats but I wanted you to know how badly I feel that your 17 year old cat Oreo died in his sleep last night. He had some health issues you had said and looked like he would do better and didn't. You tried and I know how much you loved him. I never have had a cat live past 16, so 17 seems ancient and wonderful to me. Hugs your way for the loss of your fur-baby. Last night during the rain we let the dog out as usual. We didn't realize there was a big possum walking across the back yard. Our border collie ran full on out to see it and the possum froze and just fell over stiff. It was hilarious! It just laid there and the dog was all confused like \"I didn't even touch it- swear honest!!\" She's a pretty sweet dog but she will chase squirrels and raccoons etc.. So DH and I went out to hold a flash light over the possum and it was curled up, mouth open (lots of teeth) breathing but still like it was dead. Ha ha so they really do play possum!! Anyway we got the dog in and turned off the porch light and possum got up and left the back yard. Poor thing bet we scared the heck out of it. ",

I have a bad headache this morning. Hopefully we can break from this tradition of \"chemo breaks.\" I mean all my labs are fine so I don't see why I need the breaks. They clearly are not benefitting me and there isn't a reason clinically since my counts are normal. Maybe we can skip them. It's not my call. I have an observation for those of you in long term relationships. My DH and I went to the same high school and knew each other for 10 years before we seriously dated. We have been living together for 30 years and known each other for 40. We can finish each other's sentences and regularly watch a news report and \"wonder\" about the same things exclaiming, \"I was just wondering about that!\" This morning my DH mentioned something and made a funny passing reference to a camp letter our oldest wrote years ago. We both got the reference and giggled about the recollection. Kids write hilarious letters from camp. We enjoyed them all. After he left for work I sat there thinking how much of our lives are richer and connected from these shared experiences with kids and decades of living together. When I die, all these funny references to things in our shared past will fade from view, unless the kids are present. It's such an odd thing to think about. ",

Well after very little food, being thirsty and vomiting for days off and on... Friday being the worst. I went to the oncologist yesterday and she fit me in -most grateful for that. She decided the chemo was too strong hence the symptoms (pain, N/V) and lowered the dose. I got a liter of fluid yesterday and that made me feel MUCH BETTER. The good side is it's working my tumor markers went down 102 points!! I can eat an egg and biscuit and coffee! No puking, lots of bloating though. I am thrilled. So in all the misery there was some good news and physical improvement.. Of course daily reality always sets in... the dog had diarrhea on the tile in the office..ugh stink. Had to clean that mess up. The PG&E gas crews are drilling through the street right outside our window making a hellatious amount of noise. Percy cat wants to go out and there are monster sized machines parked essentially surrounding the house..so no way. He's peeved and howling in protest. ugh more noise. So I ate my breakfast and drank my coffee to poo stench, cat howling and street grinding.... and I am still happy not to be puking and able to eat. Guess it all depends on your perspective. Right??? If this keeps up I will be able to be at Thanksgiving. Blessings to all. (((Hugs))) Thanks for your support and prayers it lifts my spirit and humbles me that so many reach out to comfort.

I think your Mitz is a champ for being able to share her bed. Our Tess does not share her huge round Costco bed.. it's her safe spot when she isn't chasing our Siamese cat Emmy away from her tower and food. She won't eat the cat food, but doesn't want the cat to either.. dang pet territorial wars. ugh.. I am a referee. Disgusting as it is she will eat cat poop. yeeeww. TMI. Farmerlucy- I love your colorful ducks! There is a place here that has colorful chickens and a few specialty ducks. We would feed the chickens and then feel badly for the ducks. So we bought meal worms freeze dried and fed the ducks those.. man did those ducks love meal worms. These ducks are also multicolored and handsome. I would love to have chickens but we are in the city limits and I can't. FF- well no trucking for me except figuratively... ask my city slicker kid how my parallel parking skills are in a mini van.. I could never do a truck! Haha.. Both she and my DH rib me about being able to walk to the curb and maybe cars can get by.. Well it snowed 2-3 inches. Schools were cancelled and the freeways were mostly empty except for long haul trucks spraying 2 lanes of mist. I vomited before we left and then again at the chemo suite. When this chemo wears off it's a puke fest. I took zofran when I left the house and they gave me 16mg more. Haven't thrown up since!! Yay. I got fluids, chemo carboplatin and all my labs looked pretty respectable considering! I have more lives then a cat. Ascites is the same, fatigue and reflux and fulness is a terrible issue. I slept 3 hours in the recliner last night because of reflux. It's brutal. Tumor markers back tomorrow. Looks like I will be here for Christmas. Amazing. It was so bitterly cold wet and rainy I am worried about the homeless people and animals. I hope they have the warming centers open all day and night. It's crazy wet and cold, snowy. Blessings to all those out in the cold. Blessings to my DH who drove up and back. Hugs to all of you who sustain me with your well wishes. Thank you.",

It was comical seeing the birds and squirrels sitting in the frying pan eating away... the snow falling. Funny images. Off to chemoland tomorrow.

I was just sick as a dog. I lost 6 pounds over the week. Threw up early in the morning, explosively threw up at the chemo suite and and choked it came so fast and miserably. I got 16mg zofran and steroids.. it didn't help. I puked in the car all over myself right over the cup. After chemo we went to wait at DD2, waiting for the murphy med to be installed. It was beautiful and we are happy to be able to give it to her. DH took her for pizza and left me at her place with my blue puke cup. Clearly couldn't eat anything or drink. Oy.. all night just miserable. Puked off and on and finally hit the recliner exhausted. I got 500 fluids and I probably should have gotten a liter. My own fault since I declined, the liter. My hands and feet are bothering me, neuropthathy and my stomach is sore. This reflux is hilacious. I am affraid the reglan and prilosec got puked up. Only get one a day sigh. I got some compazine to take tonight. Can't take it near the reglan. wish me luck. It's a sunny day and I am laying here soaking up the sun. feeling kind of tired. Geez this is some way to bring in the New Year. Ya'll have to be doing better then me. SO I am wishing you peace and fun with your family and friends. Happy New Year!!",

She has been quiet and sullen, not talking. Now a reminder of the ever presence of cancer boxes of pleurx and saline. Can't be helped, price of staying alive.

We had the cutest little Girl scout (I guess there are no more Brownies anymore cause she was little) anyway she was collecting donations for a refugee family. Apparently Catholic Charities, the girl scouts and area churches have sponsored a refugee family from N. Africa. It's a big family and they were asking for donations. I went out and got pillows, towels and a woundcare kit. I figured bandaides, wound wash and neosporin comes in handy for us all eh? I can't imagine being dumped in a strange climate, strange land and not speaking the language. It must be scary and require an enormous leap of faith and courage. But it beats dying and starving from where you came from or religious persecution. I actually know nothing about why this family was allowed to be sponsored and relocated except the refugee status is pretty tight for reasons. I am glad to help out. Life is hard enough. (Plus I come from Swedish, Irish, German, English refugees - economic freedom seekers in the 1850s) It will feel good to go later and drop off the goods. The little girl scout was adorable!! Nothing like helping learn community service and charity at home. I remember when my kids were required to do community service as part of their due at middle school. They happily took rakes and did yard work for elderly neighbors and cleaned up area parks. It was school wide effort and builds spirit. Good for them- good for everyone. Love the pictures. Life is like that cactus and roses - thorns and flowers all together. Good with the bad. ( ) palms together in gratitude for you. Peace to us all!",

So if that becomes and issue ask hospice for a sitter at night, so you can get some sleep. Or for a sleeper for your Mom. Also hospice should have volunteers to give you all a break. They will come and sit with your Mom. I have been a volunteer, sometimes folks were awake and I would take them around in a wheel chair to go outside or whatever. I asked them what they wanted. Sometimes they were sleeping and non verbal and I just sat and massaged lotion into their hands and read to them. )",

Co-pays do add up. If you need the help and it would lessen the burden on your family, then take it. What ever you don't need as Raro suggested, offer it to someone in your chemo home who does. Maybe some one has no insurance and anything would help. You can also save the extra for when you might need another more expensive drug down the line. But do tell your story regardless of what you decide to do, because too many folks don't realize MBC hits  young women especially hard. That needs to get out loud and clear. Wish you luck.",

She's back and forth between looking good and eh...makes me crazy since all I can do is watch her go down hill. Then there are my other 2 kids and all of their needs and drama. A poor husband who gets lost in the mix and tries to make everyone happy, while working his butt off. Makes feel guilty about complaining. Then I live where it rains, is cold, dark and depressing 8 months out of the year.. I definitely have SAD. Counseling can't make the sun shine either. Or make breast cancer disapear... shots go away, no more office visits. ugh. Bitch bitch.. even i don't want to listen to it... I would take an antidepressant if they all didn't have insomnia as a side effect. Thank goodness for you all being honest about how it is with stage 4. Otherwise i might just think I have wandered off the deep end. No just another person down this rocky path..trudging, tumbling  along trying to make sense of it all. Venting is good.",

Walked away in 08 from arimidex and it took until April 2012 for the cancer to invade nearly all my bones, break some ribs and smoosh a vertebrae in my back. Then I went on treatment to faslodex. Got disgusted with everything, life, marriage,  cancerland.. and walked away again March 2013. The cancer ate all my bone marrow by November and I was in pain; so I got 7 months. Then I was super anemic and need multiple blood transfusions just to function. That was right before Christmas. By Jan I was back in treatment with afinitor and aromasin. It took months for it to kick in. Months of transfusions, severe anemia, no energy. I am still anemic. Onc thinks scar tissue displaced the bone marrow and maybe I will be chronically anemic. Hmm. The drugs sap all your energy and physiologically the cancer saps your energy. It's kind of a no win. I guess you have to decide if being chronically tired and feeling crummy is worth it. Because the cancer will come back and it will be harder to stop it and more miserable. I hear you and feel your misery!  Walked miles and years in those shoes. It totally just sucks. It's the Misery Merry-go-round that you can't ever get off. You know I need to add that I am sensitive to these meds. There are plenty of folks on these boards who tolerate some treatments really well and they work really well for quite some time - years and years for some lucky ducks. So in an attempt not to be so negative, trying another treatment might provide you relief from the fatigue and feeling crummy. I will mention that if your oncologist doesn't treat pain, sleep issues and nausea issues you need to find someone else. Nothing will ruin life faster then never getting enough sleep, being in pain all the time or feeling queasy. I kind of feel like the side effects need to be addressed at the stage 4 level. QOL is everything. I hope you find a SE level that you can tolerate and gives you your life back.",

I bailed out of a treatment that was working because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. My onc thought they were doable. I decided they were not doable, so I ditched the Afinitor and continued taking the aromasin. Which stopped working and progression. Well I wanted a second opinion so I went to a MO who specializes in nothing but BC at Mayo's in Jacksonville. I did have insurance approval. I had a PET/CT etc.. labs and sure enough wide spread bone progression. Anyway I wanted to try the new Ibrance.. Mayo doc shot it down. He had a bunch of recommendations that had side effects I didn't want. so I fly home after spending over a week in Fl, room, meals, rental car. I got a bunch of information, not even what I wanted oh well. I did get to see the beach and get warm sunshine which was the greatest benefit of my visit. When I got back my current doc... shoots Ibrance down too. I am like why? just to agree with the Mayo Onc, I am a perfect candidate for it? No comment. Same senario.. I said I am not taking that other crap. So we are at an impass. He just ordered a bunch of tests and I cancelled them, since I have had 4 tests already since January and if you refuse to let me try things that have any QOL there is nothing to talk about. There was a bunch of high uptake and avid lesions on my femurs, so much so I had a bone scan at another hospital and it turned out ok. (no pending break and no mention of radiation) Other new \"hot spots' but nothing hysterical; it's all over and i know that. So all my scans and tests and other opinions didn't help- mostly it contradicted the others. Except they all agreed on progression and chemos would be possible. Except I refuse the chemos. I want to try the drugs that are not as miserable first. I don't think it's an unreasonable request. I am hostage to their \"opinion of sequence.. these drugs in this order\" or nothing. Honestly I never understood why they are ALL so pig headed and stubborn. It's our lives and if we want to try something that might work, why the hell NOT? My Onc won't answer anything. I have stopped asking. I just sit there. I hate going in. I think the whole oncology paradigm is crackers. But I do totally believe we should have the right to ask other facilites what they might do better for us and what might be less invasive, less side effects and yield a better results. SO if you have the $ and the desire to investigate this new procedure go for it. It might work well and i hope for you that it does. It doesn't sound like your current onc is for you.",

I will tell you why. My oldest has tested anywhere from 50 to 74 in the IQ range. She also self stimmed, hand flapped, poor eye contact perseverates on subjects, flips over changes in routine etc.. She is also profoundly deaf and has mild CP in her right lower leg. Still we thought ok she will have a safety net since she's clinically retarded. Well that was until she had an exceptionaly good day and they tested her at the Deaf school and she got 74 (at the time she was 12 years old). She tested right out of all state services for adults, except deaf support. The state cut off is 70! We flipped. I went to the pediatrician and we had her tested and added the autism which everyone notices about her faster then the MR. If you do not get that autism diagnosis before they are 18 you can not add it later.That diagnosis is your ticket to a variety of services. It will help enormously with getting help from vocational rehab for school and job support as well as access to job coaches and financial/ insurance support for your son once he turns 18. Vocational Rehab has been a fantastic resource for our daughter. Kandy I hear you. I will be seeing a radiation oncologist tomorrow for pain in my left arm and hoping for a zap. Hips might be next as they are ouchie. I hope not to get to your situation. My daughter got very upset when they placed the pleurx catheter in my abdomen to drain the ascites. She wants to see the dressing and how do I keep my insides from spilling outside? She gives me posters and drawings for support. She told her counselor \"I can't live without my Mom!\" My DH was there and said it was pitiful. Still we work with her to accept my death as part of life. She can read and write at a 3rd grade level and we email and talk about feelings, go to counseling and sign conversations here at home. One year ago we placed her with her respite provider and told her since she was 21 she needed her own apartment like her college sissy. She thought that was cool. Her Adult foster home parents are heaven sent. They are the nicest folks and we LOVE them. Their home is lovely, they love to cook, grow organic foods, live out in the country next to horses. They have 3 other residents 2 with Downs and they all go happily to ARC dances together. Our daughter comes over every Sunday and holidays and she flits back and forth between the 2 homes. Now when I die she is used to this arrangement, routine is set and she has support. I now see that placing her was in her best interests. She does not see me go to appointments, or home health visit and doesn't watch my decline like she would if she lived here. She goes to her job and home, bowling, ARC dances, Saturday DD swim and clay class on Sundays. Her life is full and safe and happy. We did have some guilt issues over my feeling like I sent her away (5 miles) before she needed to go, but they had an opening and it was the best placement I have ever seen. We didn't want to lose it. This has also helped my DH because she is supervised and we don't have to worry if oncology issues keep us from attending to her needs. That's what we did and no regrets so far. This is a huge step I know. My daughter is little Miss Sunshine and when she visits on Sunday she snuggles close and asks me the same things... :-) I miss her, but realistically this is better for us both. Finding a good placement is so hard. My DH's sister is severely disabled with Downs and is in an excellent placement called Elwyn Institute outside of Philadelphia. It is a fantastic place for low functioning people. I volunteered there as a high school kid years ago. Funny to marry someone with a sister there and end up with a special needs kid too. We are on a very special journey. Take care all of you.",

I watched the documentary and they only mentioned Melanoma and blood cancers like Leukemia as having had success with immunotherapy. I just did a little look see on the internet and it appears that Her2 and triple negatives have some clinical trials. Does anyone know if there are clinical trials with ER+ PR+ Her2neg BC patients? From everything that I can see immunotherapy promises to be the only real treatment that might provide no side effects and potentially longer lasting effective cancer control. Any ideas or have you heard anything? Where is Best Bird?",

Some issues just don't get sorted out by the time death comes. Many folks can't even tell you what's going on for them. I remember being an aide/nurse tech (student) and going in to take vitals on a patient who was expected to pass. This person was struggling and lingering much longer then anyone expected. This person was unresponsive. I said to them, \"it's ok, you can go. I will stay with you.\" I had my hand on a dialysis access and felt the last beat of the person's heart. It amazed me. I came out of the room rather stunned, so gentle, there and gone. The nurse said \"well you gave them permission and maybe no one had.\" I have also seen folks greatly under medicated and suffer. I have seen suffering get in the way of easing into death. So I guess I think Oregon's law is wonderful because it lets the person choose what fits their situation, beliefs and coping abilities. Choice is a good thing.",

      "Content": "Jan 3, 2013 03:28AM Rosevalley wrote: There doesn't seem to be a standard of care that oncologists follow. Back in 2007 I had a huge mass that everyone (GYN, PCP, 2 surgeons and an oncologist) could see and feel and measure as 4x5cm. Yet on ultrasound it measured 1.5cm. Everyone of these specialists were so sure that \"ultrasounds are always correct.\" No one would do an MRI to solve the huge descrepency between what they could see and feel and meassure, and what showed up on film. So I marched off at their recommendation had a lumpectomy and the the thing ended up at first pass to be 5.2cm. I freaked at how huge it was. My path report from the core biopsy said it was ductal cancer and the lumpectomy pathology report said it was lobular. I had a mastectomy which found cancer margins 1.6cm out from the lumpectomy. The radiation oncologist said, \"that tumor was at least 6cm.\" The whole affair reminded me of a circus and no one knew what they were doing. All of these people had great reputations and lots of experience. I thought they were all nuts. The surgeon asked me how I knew it was so huge and I remarked, \" I have 2 fingers and a ruler.\" Everyone measured 4x5cm no one got 1.5cm but they believed the films as gospel. The films were wrong. I  should have gotten chemo first to shrink the mass and then surgery. Nothing I had from anyone went by the books. Then after all the surgeries, treament, chemo and radiation in 2007, I tried aromatase inhibitors and found the side effects to be awful. I stopped taking them, against medical advice. The 3 oncologists I had after that refused to do any labs, no testing for tumor markers - zip for years and kept saying I had to take the aromatase inhibitors or else. Everyone pronounced me NED by just looking at me. I guess they have a crystal ball.  I was having all these GI issues and saw a gastroenterologist 2012 (6 years later) and she did a colonoscopy. She couldn't get through and did a virtual colonoscopy and Ct scan. That test showed up lytic areas in my back. I had had 2 severe episodes of back pain (2010 and 2012), but everything always got better. I have lived with back pain for so long I accept it. My PCP said it might be cancer but going to an oncologist never helped me any in the years after treatment. This GI doctor ordered a PET scan/CT and the thing came back loaded with mets all up and down my spine, collar bones, sternum, arms, legs, pelvis, multiple rib fractures and a mild compression fracture on one of the vertebrae. I was simply amazed. My ribs hurt on the right but like I said, I always have back pain, so I just added rib pain to the list. So there you have it. A GI doctor found my bone mets. I went to an oncologist that she recommended and since she found something to treat before I landed in his office, he couldn't blow me off and say I was fine. After taking faslodex and zometa for 6 months,  my scans went from loaded to clear. My ribs have healed and I still get back pain.. as usual. Yes I have stage 4 but I finally got offered a treatment that I could stand and it is working. I thank my GI doctor for that!! I wish there were universal standards of care for breast cancer, but there doesn't seem to be any. I asked one oncologist I saw in 2010 why she wasn't going to do any labs or tests and she defended her actions as endorsed by their professional organizations, \"everything is left to their (oncologists') discretion. Too many different types of cancer for there to be set standards of care.\" I find that crazy. If you never look for anything, you won't find anything either. Running a tumor marker blood test isn't too much to ask. My markers went from 768 in April to 76 in December. How can a patient decide what to do,  if you are never given any information? I think oncologists play a lot of deadly games and there isn't anything a patient can do about it. There isn't anyone to complain too either. It's all legal. Maybe some day there will be national standards of care, but right now there isn't. So good luck. I'll be praying for you.",

That discussion might be worth bringing up with your PCP, or oncologist if they seem open to that. I would never judge someone who went the assisted suicide route when facing a terminal illness, because I think it is a reasonable sane option. I have seen so many young folks lately use suicide (in the papers, at my kids high school) and that breaks my heart. Theirs is a different pain altogether. I do worry what kind of message any suicide sends to them.",

It's like they found each others missing piece to be as one. Of course you get orphaned at once too. May we all find someone to love or to be in happy solitude and at peace. Like Thomas Merton or Mother Teresa.. solidly alone, connected with everything and utterly grounded. Maybe next life I would like to be a monastic. Owning nothing and living in community sounds pretty neat. Isn't it interesting the paths we take or the rivers that sweep us up and off! My raft has no steering anymore and I drift.. on that note. Sleep well. Lovingkindness to all rosevalley",

We get the digital NY Times and in the health section is an article called-\"Putting Breast Cancer on A Diet\" by RC Rabin. It doesn't address the issues of stage 4 folks but we all know those diagnosed and waiting. It seems obesity increased the rate of death by breast cancer by 41% and those overweight and whose body index was under 30 only had a increased rate of 7%! That's from 80 studies and 200,000 women. That's huge. The article went on to say that obesity fuels cancer growth by metabolism, increased insulin, inflammation, increased proteins nd nutrition all provide optimal environment for cancer to get a foothold and grow. So good information to pass on to all our buddies in the wing who we don't want joining the club mets.",

It seems more natural to die alone quietly under a tree, peacefully focused on the task of leaving/ separating from this world and the next.

She was stage 4 from the start. I continue to lose my hair.. I had a yellow shirt on yesterday and my shoulders were covered in little hairs 1/8th from my buzz cut.. all over. The nurse said she could see what I meant about hair loss. She thinks it's the effects of the abraxane. I don't know. The gemzar makes he weak and tired but I can eat and keep fluids down. woohoo.

My Mom used to go to thrift and antiques stores and buy the ratty old stuff and transform it into gorgeous furniture. She bought me a desk for 10.00 as a kid and it was the ugliest thing.. brown warped top, long legs with a drawer and shelf. I remember thinking yuck old nasty thing. She took it home screwed the top down smoothed in wood putty, painted it white and antiqued it. The nobs were brass and we shined them up. By the time it was done it honestly could have been in sunset magazine. I was thrilled with my desk. I continued the tradition. My daughter wanted French provencial style furniture. I found a French style side table at goodwill, white, top marked by a curling iron. I sanded the hell out of it and painted it black. The fancy scrolled pull we left white. It was gorgeous. It matched the French headboard I found at habitat for Humanity .. painted it black. She has a lovely set in satin black with bright comforters. This is her place up at college. I paid 12.50 for the side table and 25 for the headboard. The wood is solid and the pieces heavy so they will last. To transform them just took elbow grease and time. I hope you enjoy your table and fancy it up to personal perfection! Just think you saved it from the landfill to be enjoyed.",

The book Tribe is about the sense of community that is missing in modern society. Ittalks about \"tribal\" sense in vets because the military fosters the same sense of tribal unity necessary for military survival. Also during times of war and severe calamity when people rally and become tribal in cohesive unity. Modern society with it's individual bent and focus on aquiring things doesn't give people meaning and tribal identity/ support. Frequently there is mental illness, depression and sadness even though we have aquired enormous weatlh and safety. It's a sociology book and very interesting. Makes me wonder if the current fad of community co-housing, tiny living and such aren't a response to disconnect and wanting to be grounded with community. Making a tribe if you will is what we all do finding our mates and families. My own DD2 and her vegan diet has given her a sense of community and purpose- finding others like herself.

He's just so mellow and sweet I can't bear to put him through anymore then is necessary. We just support him but he's sooo thin and still eats. play it by ear. I just love this gnarly, skinny old cat. I love the rainbow FF!! You send the most gorgeous pictures. Ireland must be so beautiful. I feel like I have gotten to tour it through your sharing. My Father's family was from Rosscommon, Ireland. I might be spelling that incorrectly. My Mother's family was from Smaland, Sweden.. mauling the spelling on that too. Ha ha.. I am a mutt!! Most Americans are! DH's Dad was from Scotland. DH has traveled all over the Islands and loved it. Stephanie hang on so you can vote and ask for an absentee ballot. All of ours come in the mail. I want to vote for a smart, well educated, experienced woman - go Hillary. So I am motivated to get my ballot in. I edited this since we really shouldn't get political. To each a vote and an opinion. I am so very sad to hear you are struggling with a swollen liver and nausea. I HATE feeling nauseated. Use CBD drops under the tongue and zofran. I have citrus and mint flavored CBD oil. What ever works to relieve your misery. Prayers your way. I am blessed right now to have no nausea. I can't figure it out since the last time my markers were this high I was barfing my guts out. So what's different now? Cancer is such a mind F--k. Never know where you are going except towards death. I figure I feel very tired, sore in my hips, alittle short of breath but am able to eat, no puking- so QOL is still there. Still drawing off liters of bottles... incredible how much fluid I pull off. So I will accept this turn of events. I have my polst papers, need to finish some paperwork. I ate honey dew melon, strawberries and bananas for breakfast. It's a gorgeous day. May we all have the strength to enjoy this day, no pain and misery and loved ones to enjoy. I will hold you in the light of lovingkindness and metta to ease your suffering Stephanie.

I remember when I first got ascites I really thought after looking at the stats that I was a gonner in 2-5 months. Everything I read painted a truly bleak picture and I felt so awful. Once I got the Pleurx drain and could get fluid off I was in heaven but there is very little written for patients about this journey. You can search and folks share little about malignant ascites and various treatments. Maybe they die too quickly, but if you live for a year as I have done, why not tell others what worked and what didn't. Maybe they can use the information to help themselves and their loved ones. I really wanted to post about malignant ascites and wide spread mets/ Lobular breast cancer. I truly have taken other peoples posts and asked my onc how about this? What about that? I get much of it from these postings -from others willing to share their journey. I also believe in painting a true clear picture. If I am miserable, say so. If it's doable, tell folks! The thing is we all metabolize drugs a little differently and one person might tolerate something easily. Like Ibrance, I wanted to take that drug so badly and it made me puke unrelentingly. I couldn't keep the capsules down. Most patients are fine with Ibrance. my Onc only has had one other patient respond the way I did, everyone else did great. So there is some caution in sharing. I want everyone to have everything work for years and years and be super responders! Blow the stats away live long!! Ruth there are perks to being very much loved old cats! Percy looks ancient. He also will pee on things left in the garage (dog bed and rug..) and we have had to throw out things. There is a liter box out there and 2 in the house, and a cat door... no excuse. He's just pissy or that's what he thinks of the dog!! Ha ha! Also if you go to a vacuum store you can buy a product that uses digestive enzymes to break down vomit, pee, diarrhea and food nasties in carpet and fabric called ALIVE. We have used in on carpet after the dog had diarrhea and used a carpet cleaner machine... no stain or smell. Amazing stuff. Gets out blood too- soak it in the washing machine or a bucket and water. Worth every penny. I thought I would pass that along to all old pet owners.. we need all the help we can get.",

I spent 20 minutes snuggling with a little 6 week old grey male with a blaze on his nose and white paws. He purred and purred. SOOO sweet. Nice medicine. I was tired from going out but loved to just love on a kitten. Therapeutic. The little grey tiger above is precious. Love his name Franklin. I wanted my DD to name her huge Siamese she rescued Frankie after Frank Sinatra... old blue eyes. She didn't get it being 20 years old. Her friend named him Pinkerton or Pinky for short. Mara your Miss Kitty is lovely. I love brown tabby cats and she looks so healthy and filled out. Percy used to be like that. It rained all day today and Percy stayed inside, much of it on my lap! Ruth- let me know what you think of ALIVE we have been very happy with how it works. It's been tested in this house!! Oh yes! I could do a commercial. We used to have an 18 year old Westie/corgi chihuahua mix with dementia... peed and pooped every where. Thank goodness most of our house is hardwood and tile but bedrooms and livingroom are carpet. Yay for ALIVE and steam carpet cleaners. We celebrated my Birthday today. DH and I made a vegan vanilla cake with strawberries that turned out great. Moist and yummy. Sang happy birthday and got a card from my daughter that made me cry.. so sweet. Then a worry doll and hand painted bowl and a hilarious book on \"F\" answers to tests. So funny to read. We made a tofu stirfry and Chinese noodles and watched our local soccer team win a home game! It was a lovely way to spend a rainy afternoon.",

Lounging in the dirt amid the flowers, swatting at bee half heartedly. Sleeping so soundly you twitch... purring until your sides vibrate because someone you love gave you undivided attention. Being present. My cat Percy is so 100% present and lives in the moment.. Buddhist in heart. Our dishwasher has been making this awful smell when ever we run it.. like a burning electrical smell. It worries me. The machine is 15 years old, used almost once a day, now mostly every other day. Works well- but it's an alarming smell.. I guess dishwashers have a life expectancy of 8-12 years, so 15 is good. My DH wanted to have a plumber look at it but at that age why? Anyway we replaced it with the same Kitchenaide... sticker shock 600 on sale (150 off so they said) and a heafty sum to dispose and install. I was horrified at the cost of the machines. Most were 800 and up. Nothing lasts forever. Our dryer will be next as it is 16. Trusty old machine. I feel that way about my body. I know my markers are falling but I never feel good anymore. It was a lovely fall day, sunny 80 and I spent it inside. I was cold, my belly full and uncomfortable. It feels like a betrayal not to fight to the end, but I am tired. I wonder when I will just give up like the dishwasher... and start to smell bad. I am comforted by the sound of crickets out my window. They are the sound of summer and that reassuring sound of childhood. The hum of life in insects and the world. When I was a child at my Great grandmother's we would catch fireflies and let them go in the bedroom watching them... loving their flickering light. My brother and I enchanted by having \"stars\" in the bedroom. Funny the things we remember from childhood. Life is sweet and trying to stay here enduring chemo, ascites and aching joints is hard. Much harder then I expected it to be. Blessings to you all and thank you for letting me vent.",

I think Thanksgiving is doable and I hope to be able to plan a yummy vegan/ turkey feast. But I worry about after that. Still pulling gallons of fluid off. You know I have to ask you Kandy and others. The school for the deaf here grades the kids at the level they are at. SO for instance my 15 year old reads and writes at a 4th grade level and for her IEP (special education plan) they grade her on improvement at her level. Her level for math is 6th grade. She is technically in 9th grade. So she is justifiably proud that she has all A's and one C in health. I gently remind her that the level is for 4th grade and not 9th grade so there is HUGE room for improvement. She gets angry with me. \"I have all A' s my teachers say so. I am in high school in 9th grade.\" She will get a modified diploma. It seems the school lies to the kids by painting a picture of success that simply does not exist except at the Deaf school. Any other kid in 9th grade would get straight F's for being years behind. What purpose is there lying to these kids and having them feel like they are honors material when they read and write like 4th graders on a good day? My kid thinks she will go to college. She has straight A's better then her sister. It's a horrible lie and paints an unrealistic picture of opportunities that don't exist and dreams and goals that are decades away... The kids will be humiliated and shocked once they hit the real world standards of community college. I also can't understand how the school gets away with it legally since you can't do this to a normal kid. My daughter is of normal intelligence and is only deaf. Over half the kids at the school can't read and write at a 3rd grade level. I see their texts and it's sad. The school excuses it's responsibility to teach the kids English by saying they are all English as Second Language learners since their first language is American Sign Language. They have to be culturally sensitive and provide all instruction in ASL. That's fine and one can be bilingual but you have to be able to read and write well enough in English to read an apartment contract, buy a car, pass a drivers license exam, read banking statements, recipes, instructions and directions or you are severely handicapped. The world will not provide you with an ASL interpreter for life - like it or not America thinks and works in English. I think it is horribly unfair the way the Deaf School doctors up these kid's expectations and sense of self when they eventually will have to produce a written piece of paper to communicate to a hearing clerk or Boss and humiliate themselves with poor grammar, wrong verb tenses and unintelligible sentences. That's my rant for the day.",

She wishes to follow Jesus and she should follow her heart. May this decision bring her comfort, peace and meaning to her life. My DH made the vegan cupcakes which were wonderful. We made the tea sandwiches together. He thought I made too many but they ate it all and vegan sandwiches went first- who would have thought. It was nice to see the Deaf kids signing among friends and happy and communicating. The minister joined and prayed for the lives and spiritual journey of the 2 deaf teens that were baptized. It was very moving. Nice for our family and friends to be able to share this with DD3. Blessing kiddo!!",

I am putzing along.. trying my best to live life around cancer. I still have more bulbs to plant. Spring is my favorite time of year. One of our RHodies has put out a handful of blooms in Nov. never did that before. It was extra specially nice to see. Our wayward possum came back again. I watched him as he walked away after falling over and he's gimpy. Maybe an injury. We don't feed our cats outside. There is no food. Weird that it's in our back yard. The apples have been harvested and I doubt that possum could get through the garage door- cat door. There is a medium sized doggy door in the back of the house but the dog sleeps right near that door. She would go nuts if a possum went through the door. Wake up the neighborhood. Poor thing. I feel badly that it's gimpy.I might call the wildlife center. Wasn't that Cubs vs Indians a nail biter? I am not a baseball fan but we watched the game and you have to root for a team that hasn't won in 108 years! They deserve it. I thought it was super cool that Nike did a commercial for the Cubs after the game celebrating their win. Someday became Today. Very neat. We are a soccer family. But I found myself praying for the Cubs to be \"one with the ball\" !! A little lovingkindness never hurts anyone.",

Ruth there is nothing wrong with adoring a puppy. If they are loved and trained and enjoyed, they turn into great companion dogs for life. Sometimes getting other animals in the family to accept the newcomer is hard. Four years ago we had the family of our DD2's friend show up at our door 10 days before Christmas. The parents were getting a divorce and the Mom was making the 2 kids ages 16 and 10 give up their dog. Tearful pleading for us to take it. We did. She was a wild little terrier (15 pounds) and she got along with our 16 pound terrier older dog Flower who died at age 18 a year ago, but she never hit it off with our border collie. Our border collie actively bullied the little terrier and wouldn't let her out the doggy door, share toys, be near the gate to watch the neighborhood. This poor little dog lived in fear. We frequently heard yips of pain when the collie would nip her to get away. The final straw came last Feb when I went in the kitchen and our collie Tess had her mouth over Ruby's head and the little dog had her eyes shut shivering in terror. I smacked Tess and put her outside. That's when we decided to find little Ruby a new home. She was rusty red wiry haired doxy, russel mix... fiendishly cute. We took her to a no kill dog shelter near Portland, paid a 75$ donation, told them all her good points-housebroken, rides great in a car, plays like crazy, good with kids, cats and dogs, loves snow, walks and cuddles on the couch, washes easily in the sink dries fast, sweet and friendly, microchipped and spayed and current on all shots. Bad points- terrified of thunder and fire crackers drools and cries, shreds paper and dog toys. My kids protested. I said the dog needs a life and she is only 5 years old. It's not right to live with a bully dog. She was in the no kill shelter for less then 24 hours when a retired woman who lost her husband, adopted her for a companion dog. The last picture we saw was of little Ruby licking her new owners face in joy! So I am sure she was spoiled and loved and free from fear being the only animal in the house. A fine ending for a happy sweet natured little dog. The folks who adopt there pay 300 for the dogs and that money goes to help the other animals. It also ensures folks are serious about adopting. So happy ending!! Our grumpy 11 year old collie is happily enjoying her only dog status and doesn't have to share anything. :-)",

We have a tiny pond and the fountain attracts lots of birds and animals. As far as my kids being there when I pass I think it's a bad idea. Two of these kids are adopted and have loss issues, abandonment issues. One kid is developmentally delayed. One kid has mental illness and is doing well with meds but it would be sending the wrong message to check out with meds as a way to leave the suffering of cancer( which I think it's legit ), because you could run with that and turn it into a way to leave problems and a mixed message that suicide is ok. I certainly don't want that as a legacy. I won't have them with me. It's not helpful. I will tell them I will die and we will have a chance to say our goodbyes.",

Too hard to walk on the sidewalk. I need to make some broccoli, potatoe and cheddar soup for dinner. With hot bread. That should fill up the troops. Lovingkindness and peace to you all.",

Well I went to the cancer center yesterday and got small amt of fluids, zofran and steroids and carboplatin. My tumor markers came back 144 points down from last week. I swear it works well right out of the week and then wears off. No puking yesterday 3 doses of zofran and ativan, but reflux and bloating is pretty bad. I am noticing peripheral neuropathy in my hands and feet, swallowing lots of mucous which makes me nauseous and hearing loss. I will try and get a hearing test and have them bump up my high end today. Wish me luck. I can hardly recognize some Christmas music because I am missing a range. So I am getting deafer but I am still here. Hope to enjoy small amounts of meals and my girls who will all be here for 4 days!! Wooohoo. Much to be thankful for.. blessings.

I sat with my family ate a small amount of everything and it didn't work out. I just can't digest anything with roughage and substance. Too much swelling in the intestines for it to go down. Plus I throw up so often it's easier then when you only do it a couple of times every few years. Once I get sick I feel better and then it's done. It appears to just be a mechanical obstruction. If I was a candidate a stent to open the obstructed areas would be a possible option. None of my chemos last long enough to think I will live long enough to invest in that. With that being said I have wildly out lived all my predicted deaths and demise... kind of ironic eh? It's like I am in a stalemate with cancer.. check..move..check..move.. More time with my family is worth it. Lovingkindness and Happy Holidays to all. Loverly your annual trip to Hawaii is gorgeous! Love the flowers and plants. Lucky you and the girls!",

You have your new house and you just have to work harder at staying in it! May taxoterre kick cancer to the curb. Hey I've got cancer in my liver, lung, bones, ommentum, mesentery and malignant ascites.. drain every other day. I was in hospice in Feb. and because of Faslodex flunked out of hospice and from deaths door to life again. Holy crap what a miserable ride. But to get through hell.... keep going!! I think it was Churchill who said that. Well who ever said it; it's true. I made it through and feel better, not normal but better. Keep going. I made it to my DD3 15th birthday. We walked through the rose garden in Portland and the Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden today to celebrate our 27th anniversary. We saw gorgeous colorful rhodies, lenten roses, poppies and little blue flowers. I do not have a camera on my old flip phone but the lakes, plants and flowers were wonderful. We saw a pair of bald eagles flying and hunting. There were flocks of Canada geese, goslings, a heron and a bunches of ducks. The weather was sunny 75 degrees. My poor DH has a cold but he managed a long rambling anniversary walk, bird watching and lunch. It was a wonderful day and we enjoyed it all. Living and enjoying something like this is the best revenge on cancer. Today we lived a life where cancer wasn't invited! Thank you for celebrating with me. It's not been perfect and in our imperfections and celebrating the tenacity of spirit and fortitude we raised 2 kids, one still to go and stayed married. We started out in Pennsylvania then to California and finally to Oregon. We have been through 4 dogs, 3 cats, 2 rabbits, mice and a guinea pig in 27 years. We lost 2 of the dogs to cancer, the guinea pig to cancer and 2 cats to renal failure. We have also suffered some chronic diseases in our kids. One DD is developmentally disabled but has done herself proud! (She works and can read and write and is doing well!) Our lives are the peaceable kingdom. We still have one dog, 3 cats and a canary! Everyone is old and spunky. Cancer has colored the journey for 9 years and we steal our lives back as we can. But you all know this because taking back our lives and living is why we are all here! (((hugs))) to all of us! Yay for all the folks on BCO who trudge the path and live and help others do the same. Thank you.",

The only concern I have is that you can get low blood counts and I have an indwelling Pleurx catheter to drain ascites. This puts me at risk for peritonitis. But the 2 things left on the table are xeloda and Ibrance. They should each work on 100% ER+ cancer. I hope so. I will pop Ibrance at dinner time. I am grateful that I have an option at all. Not everyone does. Thank you for stories like yours. Ebru shared that her tumor markers were 3000 and went to NED on one of her treatments. This is amazing. Hopefully there will be more life ahead for me. My DD3 is home for 7 weeks July-August and I want to be there for her. Thank you for your prayers and well wishes. Feelinfeline-what beautiful photos!

I want to fix things and leave things resolved and tidy for my kids and husband. Life isn't like that (neat and tidy) and while I know that; it is hard for me not to want to try. Letting go is so hard. Life is sweet and I want to stay. The Ibrance has not been bad; no more diarrhea and no reduction in the fluid I pull out of my belly. It reminds me of the cancer's presence as well as the aching in my bones. Otherwise I feel pretty good and try to carry on best I can. My counselor told me I look good today. I want to believe it and fool cancer. Leave me be to raise my children and live my life...cancer go away. Blessings to you all for your support. No one understands like you all do.

I painted the entire inside of our cabin a light green to match the color of fiddle heads in spring. The color made me happy. Reminded me of rebirth and renewal.

I came home we talked and I took the Ibrance pill and threw up everything. So much for that dose tossed- 21 pills at 10,000 a month. Expensive mistake. So my poor DH came in hearing me puke.. ruining his birthday. So he's all sad and concerned. Sigh..We had a good time all the girls were here and it was fun. It still was fun even if it ended up so so. Eating is difficult. It seems all celebrations are around eating. My DD2 came home from college early to celebrate her Dad's birthday. I was draining fluid off to feel more comfortable. She walked in just as I started draining. She has a key. I was a upset she saw me doing it. A long catheter hanging out my belly connected to a vacuum bottle. It's a harsh reminded all is not well in cancerland. People don't drain containers of frothy ice tea off their bodies. She sat down said it \"wasn't gross and no worries.\" Her eyes were wide though. What do you do with the container she asked... throw it out in the trash since they burn it. She was a little quiet and reflective after seeing that. I would have liked to spare her the image of her mother draining fluid off her gut but it's done. She watched it all. I am sad to leave her with such a memory and am upset I didn't drain sooner so she missed seeing it. I try hard to do my best at hiding the cancer's effects on me and living my life despite it all. This is not an easy task since my life revolves around pills, draining and treatments. On a lighter note a friends daughter's baby arrived safe and sound. She is lovely and blesses us all.

It's not enough that the stuff works if the rest of you feels lousy and is adversely effected. Makes me wonder if oncologists don't have drug stock in their retirement portfolios to justify forcing patients to take miserable drugs. Or if they feel that in order to keep all options open everyone has to try the cruddy drugs first, so that the companies still make afinitor and drugs like them. Don't know.

My PETscan from April was loaded. My tumor markers dropping now down to 57.. close to normal. Not quite, so they correlate. I don't want to glow in the dark either. I agreed with his wanting one year of zometa then once a year after. But it is kind of scary that some of you have had normal Tm and felt fine and there was a progression. So most of you do PET Scans every 3 -4 months? Is that with just bone mets or bone and liver/ lungs etc.? I guess I feel lucky that I have had 2 PET scans in 11 months since going to stage 4. So you all think it unwise to drop to yearly? Or wait until symptoms?",

It has been my experience that if you \"look good,\" you are good regardless of what you report, what scans say, labs etc. Which is weird, when you think at what length some oncologists will go to find new mets and get them before they even become an issue that the patient exhibits or feels. Some doctors won't bother looking until \"it becomes and issue to you.\" Frankly I think that's too late, and you spend too much time back pedaling to repair and maintain function and health. I find Doctors believe scans, ultrasounds and reports more then they believe what they can see and feel and listen to, especially the patients' subjective reports of difficulty. This will take a whole generation of training to change, I think. Oncologists are specialists \"fighting\" cancer. Their focus isn't usually \"Your idea of quality of life\" especially when it comes to metastatic disease. They are doing their \"job\" when they keep you alive period. Palliation is a whole new field that needs to come to it's own. What needs to happen is a merging of palliative care and oncologic care when it comes to metastatic patients. We know this intuitively and the frustrations are plastered all over this stage 4 forum. Everywhere on these boards is evidence of \"stop treating me like I am cancer/ body minus my emotional, psychological, sexual, working, spousal, mothering self.\" How things became so separated is a mystery to me. I think in a specialists mind, there is only so much they think they can focus on and be effective clinicians. When you can no longer function in a psych realm then it's off to a psychiatrist or counselor, sleep - sleep medicine, or dump on the PCP etc.. This leaves fractured care and unhappy frustrated metastatic patients.",

People are miserable when they are constipated, bloated and cramped. Life sucks. Pooping is wonderful, and worth spending big pharmas bucks for prime time spot. If you can't sleep for days on end, everything in life tanks. You can cope for a while, but then things unravel. Get sleep deprived long enough can make you nearly dysfunctional in all realms physical and mental. The sleep issue is critical and really gets swept under the rug. Poor sleep makes a person sicker then they already are! (They have linked insomnia with obesity which puts you at risk for osteoarthritis, heart disease, diabetes, depression and higher cancer rates...hmmm) We all know the pain issue can eat away at a person until they get depressed and despondent about life. (The neuropathy from Taxol nearly drove me over the edge and the joint pain from arimidex made me refuse to take it.) I find if I get enough sleep I can handle pain, irritation and everything else better. If no one listens to and intervenes with symptom management then you get non compliance, depression, frustration and anger. If you are already stage 4 and palliation is the focus then why aren't the symptoms managed better or even at all? It doesn't help me to read an article cataloguing all the common stage 4 miseries into neat percentages and spread sheets if you don't intervene! I really am curious and hopeful to see what palliative care doctors can do for metastatic patients; it sounds like a perfect marriage with oncology for stage 4 folks. I did read that their salaries are low; high 70s to 100k. Hard to pay off school on that. That may be why we don't see more of them. We should start a thread asking those with palliative care MDs what they think of their input. Has having one made a difference in their lives. I would like to know more. I have heard good things.",

There is such a cultural taboo against it. One can only wonder and wonder, what if.. It's so hard. I had to fight with my brothers to get them to agree with my Dad's wish for hospice. He was dying, in pain with multi system failure and lasted 17 days after hospice came in. It was time. My brothers were not ready. I wish more doctors took a proactive stance to intervene and \"snow\" folks who struggle and suffer with pain or breathlessness, especially if they ask for relief. The palliative coma sounds good for painful endstage disease. What I have seen is that intervention differs WILDLY between doctors, even oncologists. So I think the solution is to talk about what the doc is willing to do and what the patient wants. See if you see eye to eye. Pretty hard to request a very Catholic or religious medical doctor to break their faith for your needs. Might not happen. Then you switch or ask for hospice. It's interesting how we feel we \"play God\" euthanizing our pets. Another post above. I see it differently. We have a lovely brain and ability to use medical knowledge to assist in a process that is already in motion. I think we do a good job with our pets. I ran 900.00 worth of tests on my daughter's service dog (a 12 year old Golden) before I was satisfied that he had cancer, was in pain and was dying anyway. He was a 4 footed angel. Then we let him go, holding him and crying. I couldn't bear to put him down unless I was sure. I remember crying in the office with my 16 year old cat, who had end stage kidney failure.\"Do something!\" I begged the vet. She said, \"we don't do dialysis on 16 year old kitties.\" I asked \"Is it because you can't or because no one ever asked you to?\" The vet looked.. pained. We did subq fluids at home, until I looked into that cat's eyes and saw the misery. I had her put  down. The kid's and I wrapped her in her blanket and burried her under the rhodies in the front yard. Our medical care was keeping Daisy here longer then she should have lasted. Sometimes we need to accept death as natural.. it's hard.    ",

That is always an option too, unless it's a free standing clinic and they might not have them. Don't endure panic and misery by allowing someone who routinely misses you to keep at it - that's how folks end up with PTSD around various medical procedures. Also when you are fearful the veins vasoconstrict and it's harder to get the IV in too. Tell your NP or PA the name of the RN you would rather not have your IV started by and she'll pass it on so no one gets hurt feelings. You don't even have to do it! That goes for shots too.

The symptoms started in May and I got the first of 4 paracentesises which relieved the fluid in July. Of course with malignant ascites it just comes right back. I had a Pleurx catheter placed in my abdomen in August. This catheter has made my life SOOOO MUCH BETTER! They tap the fluid off every 3 to 4 days. I can breathe better, the nausea is better. I can eat instead of feeling full and miserable. They take off about 3 liters plus a week. I would recommend getting one. Your wife might be more comfortable. It won't of course \"fix\" the course of the disease but it will relieve the pressure and misery of the ascites. Then you can enjoy the time you have together. Ascites makes me very tired so I would imagine your wife might be tired too. After the taps I need to nap. Sometimes just being together in familiar surroundings is a great comfort and blessing, no need to fancy up or vacation unless it's a nice day trip. All folks react differently though and she will need to decide what is doable. I would tell the kids sooner rather than later and enjoy every moment with each other.

One MO recommended chemo (CT)and then AIs,  and the other MO recommended the aromatase inhibitors. The cancer was grade 2, highly ER+, no lymph node involvement and clear margins. She had a double mastectomy. There are some other health issues but otherwise she is healthy and very active and totally loves life, kids & grandkids. She is in her late 60s. Both oncologists think there is only a 10% chance of a recurrence which means there is a 90% it won't metastasize. (sadly we all know stats aren't everything) I still suffer side effects from Taxol in my feet and recently had a bladder infection that I didn't even feel because of lost sensation from the Cytoxan I got in 2007! I don't think chemo is worth the risk in her case. I think she could take the aromatase inhibitors (femara, arimidex and aromasin) and biophosphates and if she got 5 years out of each heck she would be in her 80's! I would take the path that gives me the best quality of life and no risk of neuropathy or other SE. What do you women think?

There really isn't a \"set\" criteria from their professional organizations, so you can't go check their recommendations against the \"gold standard\". One oncologist told me that (after I already had chemo) that he wouldn't have given me chemo because I had ER/PR percentages in the high 90s! He thought I would have done better on the hormonals. Wish I had heard that before I did the chemo! That ticked me off because of the SE from the ACT chemo back then were particularly miserable. Most of the oncologists I have seen are not interested in testing (labs, scans, tumor markers) at all, most of that I have gotten from other doctors. Can't really say about this new MO yet. I just think that sometimes patients react to what doctors have to say about their % of recurrence out of fear and don't really think about how great their risk is. (they focus on the 10% recurrence and not the 90% chance it won't come back) My relative has not had any PET scans for baseline. I think this chemo recommendation is based on her being in the grey zone, with a grade 2 tumor. I hope she picks a safe treatment. She's such a great person we would all hate to lose her. In particular I wish she could continue with the happy retirement she's enjoyed so far, and not have it tainted and diminished by side effects of chemo. She's very active and involved with lots of friends and activities. Thank you all for your input, I will pass it along. Good to get wide variety of perspectives lots to think about.",

My husband thinks that if a kid hears it from the get go then they rise to the expectations. There are some limits. Our one kid is DD and will need job skills and vocational rehab, that's the best she can do. We celebrate that. But the \"experts\" never thought she would learn to read and write - she does both really well, surprised all. That's what expectations will do. We thought she could and she does read and write. I knew a couple of college women who got accidentally pregnant and kept their babies. Neither did well, kid or Mom. The women didn't finish college, got stuck in low end jobs and their kids suffered through low income, multiple relationships until Mom found a stable one etc. It's sad. I have a friend whose daughter got pregnant and keeps trying to patch up the relationship with the child's Dad. The Dad is going no where, smokes pot, no job skills, no interest in getting job skills, has another kid he's paying child support on.. whew! Give it up and MOVE on! This guy only pulls her and the baby down. A moment of passion and lifetime of misery? I think birth control should be given out to women in highschool - pills or implants free of charge, until emotional maturity catches up with them. The stakes are too high for life time failure. But what's done is done. Celebrate the co-workers Grand baby cause it's not their fault. Maybe Mom will go back to finish what she started. As others have pointed out over 50 years ago it was common to have accidents. I was one too! I asked my Mom about how if I was 3 weeks early and she got married on... she quipped \"the invitations were out!\" I laughed!! My Grandparents wanted college for her and she never went, had  3 kids instead. Wedding plans were fast, she was just 18. Such is life.",

I remember my Mother, who has a warped sense of humor, laughing hysterically over an article in the newspaper (years ago) about someone who was killed on space mountain in Orlando. I was like Mom how can you laugh over someone being decapitated? That's not funny!? She sputtered\" well at the beginning of the ride they tell you to take off your glasses! She probably didn't!\" On that my Mom just roared... \"they're off now...\" Oh well what can I tell you. My Grandma used to laugh that she wanted to be put in a Parkay Margarine tub after she was cremated. Then like the commercial, when you open it, instead of \"butter\" the voice would say \"Mother!\" (I guess that explains my Mom's sense of humor...)",

I hope there are laws to assure that you can stay in the place you live with support from your husband. I hope you are getting support from the father of the other two children. See if there are any support groups available or assistance. As far as your 3 year old goes, see if there are any early intervention autism services or groups in your area. I also have an autistic child that was very hard to deal with when she was 3 years old - an escape artist, behavior issues and language delays etc. So I know what you are going through. (My child is also mildly retarded and deaf even more challenges.) If your child also has global delays using early intervention services to maintain language, modify behavior and keep on track for school can be a life saver! Early intervention WORKS with autistic kids, but it works slowly. My child can read and write and care for her basic needs because of early intervention. We also used respite here when my autistic child was young. Then you can get out for a little bit. Having an autistic child is stressful all by itself! If you don't take care of yourself, you can not take care of the kids. If the whole picture looks overwhelming then bite off bitty pieces and deal with things hour at a time like was suggested above. Keep everything simple and basic. I am sorry things are so hard right now. Life is frequently unfair. May things get better soon.",

Think of depression as a medical diagnosis... diabetic = insulin or oral, appendix burst = surgery, infection = antibiotics. So there is no stigma attached to trying medication to intervene on mood and misery. You don't have to stay on it if you don't like the side effects. They do take 4-6 weeks to kick in. If one doesn't work there are others and it might take a while to find the right \"fit.\" Chemistry differs in folks, be kind to yourself give it time to work.  what the hell try it. You can stop if it is not your thing. At this stage of our lives why do you care if it's long term? What ever makes life easier and \"lighter\" seems sane and reasonable to me. Ativan does nothing for me. It works wonders for others. I have never tried Xanax. I do definitely have a screaming case of S.A.D. and use a Phillips Blue Light (bought at best buy) and you sit by it for 1/2 hour. It helps. I live in Oregon and the wet dreary cold grey days get me down. Even when it's grey they recommend getting out in to direct light to reset the brain. Good luck with your journey..

My core biopsy said it was ductal cancer, later it was determined it was lobular (in 07 and again in 2012). I asked my oncologist at the time for films to solve the huge descrepency between film size 1.5cm and palpable mass size 4x5cm. She refused. No film for the other breast either. That's the difference between an almond and a plum! So I waltzed off to surgery where it ended up being 5.2cm unclear margines and a metastatic lymp node 1.5cm.. oh and ILC not ductal. More surgery. This oncologist changed the measured size in her notes, shaving off a cm in all directions. I found that out later. She blamed the surgeon and the surgeon blamed her.  I fired her. I fired him too. Then the 2nd oncologist I had  started out ok and then later seemed very wishy washy. I would ask him very specific questions and get no answer. I asked for my chart notes and there were things in there I didn't know. I asked \"where did you get this information?\" He refused to answer me. Once we sat silently for minutes in the office and would not answer me and he said I didn't need radiation, after his treatment plan specifically called for it. He arranged for me to meet the radiologist. He refused to say why he changed his mind. I got the radiation, had quite a lot of difficulty with it.I lost all confidence in him and left again. So that leaves me with oncologist 3 (male) 2008 I saw him for 8 months. In that time he didn't do any testing and no labwork of any kind. I was a stage 3A breast cancer patient. I asked him why and he said  next time. I left. Oncologist 4 (woman)2010, again said that there are no standards for follow up care, everything is left to the doctor. She did no testing or labwork. She gave me reglan for the GI issues I was having. I never went back. Fast forward to Feb 2012, oncologist (male) number 5, also did an exam said I was fine and he would see me in a month. No labwork no tests. I left. I figured the game playing was just too much. Everyone demanded I take AI's and I refused. I had a horrid time on arimidex and aromasin. I was only offered Ai's and nothing else. It was like being held hostage, take the Ai's or you get nothing. Not even information on whether the cancer is back or not. By this time April 2012, I was having lots of GI issues and went in for a 2nd colonoscopy. I have a redundant colon and they couldn't get through. So I had a virtual CT colonoscopy and they picked up lytic areas all through my spine. My GI doctor ordered a PET scan and it showed wide spread boney metatases through out my skeleton, spine, (one small compression fracture), multiple fractured ribs, my pelvis,sternum, femurs and humerus all lit up. My alk Phos. was up, calcium was also up - had anyone bothered to look. I had back pain and some rib pain but got around pretty well. Also for the second time in 6 years they checked my tumor markers; they were 768. The only other time anyone checked them was the breast surgeon back in 2007 and they were 25. I got referred to an oncologist the GI doctor recommended and so far He seems decent. I asked him why no one offered me faslodex before now. He said you need to be stage 4. How do you get to be stage 4 if no one checks labs or does scans? He said to focus on doing things now. Faslodex works really well and I tolerate this fine. I still don't trust oncologists. So my question to you folks. Would you have stayed with the oncologists who refused any labwork or testing?  If so why? Have any of you been told that you had to take a class of drugs you had difficulty with before they would offer any other treatments?

Who polices these folks?  But to be  a late stage BC patient and have an oncologist do no labs or anything in 8 months is insane, but I guess legal. I did take arimidex and aromasin for 8 months. Tamoxifin was out, TIA and a bood clot in the right leg without taking it so too big a risk. Once my chart hit the next doctor I was doomed, repeat performance. I finally gave up. You can't make doctors do something if they don't want to. I even tried going to 2 oncologists out of my state and it made no difference at all. They stick together and all did nothing. I wondered if this current oncologist would follow the others, but I guess the GI doctor's referral and the PET scan results meant he had to offer me something... other then AI's. I thought all doctors took an oath to \"do no harm?\"",

He also said the drug performed so well that he thought the powers that be will expand access since there is such a need and more stage 4 folks are ER+/ Her2neg then any other combo.

Death sneaks up from behind and bam no decision. I think the particularly hard part of Metastatic disease is that you know death is waiting, watching, ever present - working it's way through your being physically and mentally. If the drugs and SE don't get you the \"mental\" aspects will do as much damage. Most of what is discussed and shared here is how this f... disease \"eats away\" at a person from all sorts of angles. We make some sense of it all by sharing the path we have been forced to travel. My Mom is slowly being eaten away by dementia at age 74. she smokes like a stove and that doesn't help. She is some what aware of her mind slipping and will be at times nasty and uncharacteristically mean. She wasn't this way before. Since she is with it enough her sister and I can not intervene. So we watch from the side lines as she spends in to her nest egg, buys way over her budget, refuses meds, drives when no sane person would EVER let her...and we can do nothing. We have tried. She's on a destructive path as miserable as cancer with half a brain working. She's gotten type 2 diabetes and won't take her meds. Driven to the other side of Florida, run out of gas, cops intervene, get her on the road again.. she never thought that driving 12 hours in the wrong direction was odd. She will take a swing at you if you try and force her to do something. Frankly, I think as some one posted earlier... ending up like that staring blankly in a nursing facility...hmmm maybe dying earlier is better. I agree with that. Life is hard. I am sick of all the cancer crap, dispite having lots of things I do enjoy. On a day to day level, I just wish my youngest kid would pull it together instead of making everyones' life miserable. Cancer doesn't stop the the other hard aspects of child raising, economics, work, marriages and everything else from being any less taxing. Cancer just makes it that much harder and a person more tired. I would never do chemo again, ever. Dying doesn't scare me at all. There is a lot of freedom when you stop grasping at wanting more  life.",

      "Content": "May 4, 2016 02:00PM - edited May 5, 2016 01:54AM by Rosevalley This last Christmas I spent the second time as close to death as ever. I still have moments of wondering why am I here and how is it I didn't die? The first time was 2014 when my bone marrow got eaten and my hemoglobin was 5. I had no energy and a very high heart rate. Hard to do anything when you have no hemoglobin to attach oxygen to! It would have been a peaceful death though very tired and sleepy. I had a fair amount of bone pain and that was relieved by meds. Then the turn around with afinitor and 20 transfusions. Back to life. This last Christmas herceptin and doxil failed and the cancer caused a bowel obstruction that backed up all my fluids and caused abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The N/V was relentless and MISERABLE. Honestly it's a horrible way to die. I ended up in the ER twice with intractable nausea and dehydration just heaving. I cried. I was besides myself with misery my kidneys had started to shut down. Zofran and pain patches barely worked, constipation and explosive vomiting scared me. They finally allowed me to give myself fluids at home, then added faslodex and I started to turn around. It took weeks to turn the corner.. weeks of muscle weakness, shaky unable to eat much, feeling full and barely able to write a sentence my hands would shake. The faslodex is working and now I can eat more, drink, walk, write legibly and feel more alive then dying. I used to be a nurse so I have seen people die. I am not scared of death. The dying process can be scary. Dying of liver failure and kidney failure is mostly peaceful. You get more and more toxic from organ failure and your labs get wonky and you fall asleep. There is pain associated with some systems/ organ shut downs and that can be controlled with fentyl patches and other meds. Stopping eating and drinking is also an option. Dying of a bowel obstruction is miserable because everything backs up and vomiting bile and secretions daily sucks. Brain mets is no picnic either. I have seen a few brain mets patients with no pain. I opted for death with dignity meds and paid 3, 068.00 for the script. My Catholic health insurance wouldn't cover it. I can not revisit another 2 months of puking and 24/7 nausea. My PCP has graciously offered to come to the house when it is time to take the med and be there to help me and my DH. I won't have the kids there. When faslodex and Ibrance fail I will take the DWD meds and die a peaceful death. My DH is fine with me taking the meds and he know the cancer will return and the puking and nausea. He doesn't want me to go through that again. Our will is done and papers are in order. Now we wait for the last of the options to fail. Trying to live in the mean time is the hardest part. Thank you for bringing up this topic. My family won't talk about it. We live with a dinosaur in the room! Here with others facing the same we can explore and hash out what living with cancer and preparing for death is really like.",

I had wide spread bone mets, that are responding great to faslodex and zometa. Iget zometa every month. My MO said one year of zometa is enough. He would give me zometa once a year after that. He would scan if there were symptoms which was a change from his initial recommendation of a PET every 6 months. My tumor markers have dropped every month and are correlating well with the scans. So he said he would check the tumor markers periodically once they hit normal. So it's great to hear some of you are getting the same annual infusions and periodic scans, and that it is working for you. I haven't had a bone density done since 2009; it was great then. I'll ask him about that.",

You won''t see social security probably..(I don't know your age) but that's what the program is there for! I also think folks are clueless about what cancer does to a person, the fatigue, pain, loss of sleep, weird aches and side effects. That woman was an insensitive clod who said \"they can print more money.\" How rude.   I mean 4 weeks ago I walked into a new oncologists office with a hemoglobin of 5.5. I was tired, short of breath and wiped out but I walked in from the car to the office. That's critical, 5.5. If it gets much lower you can just keel over and check out. But I look better then I am. Isn't that true of many of us? We wear our cancer on the inside where you can't see it. We are quiet about it and to the outside world we look good enough. I won't apply for SSI/ disability retirement, despite paying into it for decades. Why, because I have a disabled kid who will need a transplant eventually and I want the system to have as much money as they can. I want my daughter to have my portion and we are lucky to able to live on my husband's income. I have already been told that I should watch her and not place her because she's my responsibility and not the states. Even though she's 20 and the state has to care for her, legally. She lives with us and we love her. So I guess I will never get a break, except respite. I have even had family members say things like \"why should the state watch her and pay all those thousands out of our tax money, she's your responsibility and you don't work.\" My husband and I didn't go out alone or for an over night stay somewhere for 14 years.. no one would watch her. It's like being under house arrest. People make you feel guilty for asking for what is rightfully yours or for asking for what you need even. I'm off topic sorry. Fitztwins is right. It is jealousy and cluelessness. Like being off work to undergo treatment is a picnic. A year with cancer would shut those folks right up but quick!",

If I knew what I know today, I wouldn't have done what I did because it's made the last 8 years a trial. If your tumor is small and you can be treated with antihormones (tamoxifen, aromasin, arimidex, fermara), shoot I would so go that route. You will always be stage 4 so relax and focus making your QOL the very best it can be. I started out lllA and did all this crap to keep from being stage 4 and none of it helped. There was a teacher at my daughter's school who also had lllA BC. She was given chemo first, shrunk the tumor. They did mamosite radiation to just that area. She kept her breasts and has taken AI/ hormonals for 8 years. She is a happy camper. Her body is whole and she has normal sensation, no lymphadema, no scars, tightness, pain zip. Her QOL is outstanding. Wish that I had had her team instead of mine. Best to you whatever decision you make.",

I can not help but think that thousands of years of genetic tweaking have made our particular genetic make-up agreeable to milk, wheat, meat or soy... name your \"problem.\" So it stands to reason that Eskimos who wouldn't be able to get wheat or sugar in the snowy North would be \"devastated\" by it's effects. Same goes for any isolated tribe of folks. Tibet populations can survive on lentils, onions, meat and yak milk butter etc. and we would be wildly sick by such a diet. But these peoples have learned to survive on what they can grow in the area where they live. I wonder when you mix genetic traits like most Americans (mutt mixes from all over) if you do not invite vunerability to diet, stress and poisons out there in our environment. Scientists have a fair amount of evidence that histamine reactions like you get with allergies and a body with too much cortisol gets sick. That's why aspirin seems to work in lessening inflammation in colon cancer and heart disease. They need to know more about the effects of inflammation. I agree it seems too complex for a simple - \"scratch dairy and you are cured.\" Just out of curiosity I will share a personal story. We have 2 adopted kids. One is from South Vietnam. She can not digest cow milk and it gave her skin rashes, diarrhea and no weight gain. We had to switch her milk based formula to soy before the kid could gain weight. To this day she prefers soy milk. Yogurt and small amounts of cheese seem ok. My Chinese daughter can drink milk, eat cheese, yogurt and pretty much anything with no ill effects. She hates corn and tomatoes and refuses to eat them. Here are 2 Asian kids who can tolerate different foods. So our philosophy is give the kid what they prefer to eat since they know how it makes them feel. (With in reason.. no diet of popcorn and chocolate..) Our biological daughter (Swedish, Irish, Scottish, German Mutt) loves dairy, vegetables, fruit  and soy. She's a vegetarian. There is lots more than just diet to explain BC.",

It would either ease your fears that you have not flip flopped (+ to -) or give you new info. I would think the info would be good to have in your back pocket. Liver biopsy is easy, no pain just a bit of pressure and a bandaid! Good luck with your treatment decisions. Hope it works. ",

Repeat -\"future never comes, past is finished and  life exists only in the present moment.\" When you repeat it over and over, train yourself to stay present. Do not dwell on fears - accept them, do not push them away.  Just an acknowledgement \"oh fear there you are, have a seat. I see you and feel your pain.\" Don't try to make it go away just acknowledge and let it go. Amazing what just noticing and not judging will do. You do not have to \"do anything.\" Just notice \"fear is here.\" Let it be. You can take the wind right out of the sails of fear and panic and calm down. This takes practice and more practice. You need to be willing to sit with something that makes you very edgy and uncomfortable, but the rewards are profound. I wish you luck. Find a therapist who has some knowledge of mindfulness training. Sounds like you have some background in this already. Find your way again; you are just lost in the woods. Find the trail markers and continue on!! I wish you peace on a path you have no choice to travel! Yep we all got re-routed on this cancerland path. Therefore we must teach ourselves how to cope.  Vent! Be gentle with yourself! Be well. ",

Look at all the botox and \"life style lift\" ads you see every night on TV...makes me want to barf. In some cultures age is a sign of respect, wisdom and status. Not in the West and that is too bad for us. Our ideals are tapped out at 30! What poverty of experience is that! Celebrate those Birthdays and the wrinkles, leave your greys out front and center! Wear it all with pride and take back growing older as a gift - for us and society. I just wish the folks in congress could act their age.. temper fits by adults are never in fashion. oops OT...",
