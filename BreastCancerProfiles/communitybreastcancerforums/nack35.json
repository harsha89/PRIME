Not sure why. so he took that node out and I have one drain. I put a bra on,but it felt tight and I was afraid it would squeeze the drain tube and it would not drain right.  So I am only wearing a camosole. is that ok? I don't need the support of a bra? I have a incision under my arm that hurts worse then  the 1st surgery did. So is the cami ok? I have drain pinned to the bottom of it....... Thanks, Nancy",
