    "Content": "ConcernedMom wrote: my 14 year old daughter has extreme constant pain that radiates up into her shoulder, the other breast has no pain.  Pain does not come and go due to menstration, has been constant for a few months.  Dr.'s have now found a lump and we are awaiting her appointment for an ultrasound (still another 11 days away)  The pain now goes into her left arm and arm pit area, they have been giving her shots at the hospital due to the degree of pain.  Her ultasound can't come soon enought.
