I was diagnosed in 2002 with a small ER+ tumor and had a lumpectomy, a lymph node dissection and radiation. This time the tumor was 6cm grade 3 and HER2+ with extensive lymphovascular invasion. I had a dmx--completed my 6 rounds of TCHP and will now continue with 12 more rounds of Herceptin only. The radiation is being done again due to the large size of the tumor and the high grade. We are also including all of the lymph nodes....Mammory and superclavical?--whatever. The reason for all the nodes is because I previously had a lymph node dissection so no one really knows where the lymph fluid goes after that. Yes it is higher risk but so wasn't my cancer.......need to do everything possible.",

My first was actually 12 years ago and ER+ This time I was diagnosed in December 2016 with ER-Pr-HER2+++ in the same breast. They originally thought the mass was small but after the masectomy found it to be at least 6cm which is why they are considering re radiation. I am currently getting ready for TCHP #5 and will see the MO the first of May. I also had quite an easy time the first round of radiation but the residual pain lasted many years and in fact is partially why I did not catch this second diagnosis. I want to do everything possible to prevent this from happening again, which is why I chose a double mx. I am concerned about the risks involved with re radiation. What about your lungs and bones?",

I was a survivor for thirteen years then I was diagnosed in November--spent two hellish weeks trying to get a doctor to respond. We live in a tourist area and all of our medical think they are on vacation. Finally decided to go to Moffitt in Tampa. Original biopsy thought the tumor was smallish but HER2+++ ER- PR- Had BMX on 12/07 and the mass was actually 6 cm and extensively throughout the breast and nipple. Port placement was on 12/30 and will begin six rounds of TCHP next week followed by a year of just Herceptin.",
