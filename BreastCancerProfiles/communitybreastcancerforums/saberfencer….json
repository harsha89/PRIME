One was actually very large so they only biopsied a small piece of it and it resolved completely on its own within a few years. It becomes a very difficult question whether to remove or leave any lesion in the breast no matter how benign it appears. It is a question, I believe, of better safe than sorry. In truth the only person who can determine what anything that is not \"normal\" is -- it's a pathologist, even if this is completely normal for you. The deal is this rapidly becomes a legal rather than a medical issue: many breast surgeons and mammographer/radiologists feel it is essential to investigate even when they are sure something is benign and I have to say I agree with that. Would I do it again? Yes, all for and not for the legal reasons but because it is much easier to be done with it and not even have a slight nagging concern than to be. That is simply my two cents. All the best: Amanda",
