Tried just rotating Tylenol and Advil every 4 hours but didn't seem to make much of a difference. Sleeping was like having really bad restless leg syndrome. Pain finally eased up Sunday but also ended up with a little swelling and like a rash on hands. I kinda breezed thru A/C so when they said Taxol was easier then A/C I have been a little taken back by these side effects. On a good note, I don't feel as tired on Taxol and have taken no anti-nausea meds. 3 more to go.",

Will have my 3rd this Wednesday. Already went through the hair thing, but last week started getting really watery eyes. Anyone else having the watery eyes? I stopped at Walgreens this morning and asked Pharmacist if any eye drops to use to help. She recommended a lubricant eye drop but its not giving me too much relief. Other than that, I really have not had too much trouble. Day 6 after chemo is usually my worse, just run down and a little light headed.",

Then will start everyother week on Taxol for 4 cycles. Followed by surgery and radiation. Quite a bit of heartburn last night from the Red Devil but a Hoagie an hour before bedtime probably didn't help (couldn't help it, I was hungry). My LGFB class that was suppose to be on Wednesday go cancelled until next week, I was a little disappointed since I have had to wait so long in the first place. Had yesterdays chemo in the new Frauenshuh Cancer Center at Park Nicollet Methodist. What an absolutely wonderful facility!",

Had my 3rd A/C a week ago and was a lot more tired over the weekend. Developed a fever that kept going over 100.5 (of course is never gets that high or becomes a concern until after doctors hours). Worked from home on Monday and then Tuesday called nurse line and was advised to lay low for the day. Kept the temp at 99. something but sure enough it went up late afternoon evening. Was also developing some lower back pain. On call doctor called in an antibiotic - Levaquin, took one last night and finally woke up this morning at 98.6 feeling normal again. Must have been developing some sort of infection.  One of my staff in Texas sent me a book today that I am looking forward to reading this weekend.She said her best friend who is a survivor recommended it.It is the book by Deanna Farve - Don't Bet Against Me!  OK - being a Vikings fan and of course not real fond of Brett Farve and Packers it is ironic that I am reading this book, but on the other hand, come this Friday, Brett Farve may be a Viking.",

I found that day 6 after A/C was my\"yucky\" day so I worked from home on the day 6's. Taxol I do not have those \"yucky\" days. My employer has been very accomodating and I have been lucky enough to work around appointments. There were some days I felt like I was 105 years old walking down the hallways but it would only last a day or two. I worry a little bit right now coming into the flu season with H1N1 but everyone know to pretty much stay away from me even if they think they are coming down with a cold. My surgery will be coming up 3rd week of October and I am hoping to only take a couple days of PTO and then work a few from home before I come back into the office. Radiation will be the challenge going every day and of course with the winter months of snow and metro driving coming during that time.",

So many things going on with everyone. I had my last chemo on 9/23, so it has been almost 3 weeks since last chemo. Seemed odd to me not going last week ( I went bi-weekly).  Had an MRI on 10/5 and got the news the following day that the cancer was gone! So 4 tx of A/C and 4 tx of Taxol did the trick for me. I did meet with the surgeon on 10/7 and we are still going forward with the lumpectomy and the axill node disection. Since it was pretty extensive in the lymph nodes they will still remove them and the area in the breast where they placed the marker at the time of my biopsy in May. Surgery scheduled for 10/22 - outpatient. Then approx 4 weeks after that will be radiation to the left breast and the arm pit area where lymph nodes removed. I worry about the lymphedema issue a little. Will just have to manage. Getting some fuzz back on the head again. Eyelashes are pretty scarce so will be glad to get them back full as well. Even though there is a couple months to go after surgery with rads, there is still that \"life after cancer\" feeling. I want life to be the same as it was before but I know it never will be. Yes, I will still have breasts and for the most part, once the hair comes back normal, physically I will not see much in visible changes. But emotionally and spiritually.........thats a differents story. Some good feelings, some not so good. Do any of you have those thoughts and feelings?",

Some days I choose to wear scarves and hats combo.  Doctors office has called me back today regarding the watery eyes - common for A/C. They advised to try Benedryl or Claritan also.

I have stayed working full-time thru all of this. I even bring lap top to chemo and work while getting chemo - what else are you gonna do?  Had my 3 Taxol last wednesday - the usual leg pain hits late Friday thru Monday. Not real heavy pain this time but my legs feel so restless. unklezwifeonety - I think you had asked this previously - I have Taxol bi-weekly and I do get Neulasta shot the day following. I did 4 cycles of biweekly A/C, and now 4 cycles of biweekly Taxol. One more Taxol left next Wednesday and when I think about it I could start to cry knowing it is my last chemo!!! I'm so happy to be almost done with that part of it! Have an MRI scheduled for 10/5 and then meeting with surgeon 10/7. Surgery will be sometime the 3rd week of October. I still plan on going with the lumpectomy and the lymph nodes removal. I just couldn't see myself going thru 6 more months of recovery and reconstruction. From what I understand the survival rate is not much different between lumpectomy and mastectomy, but there is a difference in recurrance rate. Not a large percentage, but there is a difference. I will take that chance and try to change lifestyle to reduce that risk. I'm 45 and not ready to give up on \"the girls\". If in the future it is not meant to be, then so be it. I have not had any nail issues on Taxol but have noticed that my fuzzies that were left after A/C have had some take a leap off the melon, and thank goodness for brow pencils. I did run into some friends this weekend that I had not seen for awhile and they said they could not even tell. One did not even think I had lost my hair. My wig matches my hair color perfect and it just looks as though I got a summer haircut. Susie - Wonderful to be so near the end of this - I'm so happy for you - It shines the light for the rest of us with a ways to go. Polly - Enjoy the time with your son! You must be very proud! Sorry your job gave you such a hassle. Thanks everyone for sharing!!! PAM ",

Had 2nd Taxol on the 27th, just like clockwork the 2nd day the pain in the hips and legs kicked in. Was a little better prepared this time and I did get an RX for a low dose of Vicodin. Have made sure to only take a couple of times especially before bed to help sleep without the restless legs. I really don't like taking prescriptions if I can help it. At least the pain only lasts a few days. But just knowing that on the 9th (scheduled for 3rd Taxol) it starts all over again. It wouldn't hurt my feelings one bit if oncologist decided to not do my final chemo on 9/23 and just get ready for surgery finally. Decided to stick to original plan and have Lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed rather than mastectomy. I just know that I will have a lot of changes ahead of me to help reduce my chances of it showing its ugly head again. Diet, regular exercise, cutting out the work stress, etc.  On the lighter side, I seriously think my hair fuzzies have grown a little bit again.",
