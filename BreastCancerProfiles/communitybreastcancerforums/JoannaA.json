    "Content": "JoannaA wrote: hello! I recently had my first (6 years late) mammogram and ended up also having a diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound and core needle biopsy. Results indicated CSL and some benign things including apocrine metaplasia, focal usual ductal hyperplasia and mild duct dilation. The irony is I wasn't even supposed to get a 3D mammogram, but this wouldn't have been found and considered architectural distortion if it hadn't been done. So just had consult with surgeon about removing the lesion. No size estimate but also no atypical cells found in biopsy. I'm leaning towards observing and no surgery.Anyone have similar experience?
