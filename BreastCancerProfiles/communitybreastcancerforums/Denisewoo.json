I recently was in the er for excruciating pain, 12/10, in my right breast. I was given blood and urine tests, as well as a chest X-ray to check for kidney stones, blood clots or lung infection. I was also given a ct and 2 shots of hydromorphine for pain. After about 5 hrs I was sent for another ct with an iv dye. The dr finally came in said I had no stones, blood clots it lung infection. But the radiologist notice a lump on my breast, so dr gave me a physical exam of both breasts, then said he needed to confere with radiologist again. Dr came back after about 15 min and said he was referring me to the breast clinic. I'm still in pain and now I'm a little worried as to what this all means. Log in to post a reply",
