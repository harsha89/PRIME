She has criticized me for my \"negative attitude\" for simply saying the truth.  We have fought constantly since my diagnosis because she doesn't want to hear anything she can't attest to herself.  You see, this is about her.  And she gets to decide what is and isn't happening in the world.  She disagrees with every word I say.  I know what my prognosis is, and I am going to stare it in the face every day.  If I could pretend it's not there, maybe I would, but I am not that kind of person.  I'm not depressed, and in fact am a much happier person minute by minute, than she ever has been.    ",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2015 01:21PM - edited Jul 30, 2015 01:21PM by Beasly Hi Tshire, I wonder if you aren't a little too hard on yourself for being scared. There's a Zen (or maybe Buddhist) saying that goes something like this \"the soft grass that bows to the storm is stronger than the branch that strains against it and snaps\". I don't think you can push your fear away. I think you have to sit with it, and tolerate it. Your fear will subside when it's ready, and not a minute sooner. If you are scared be scared, if you are sad be sad, happy be happy. It's reasonable to be scared, and probably means you are perfectly mentally healthy. If you try to stop feeling fear, it's like trying to make yourself crazy. It's sane to be scared about this. Don't make yourself crazy being afraid of being afraid. If that makes sense. :-) I think there is every reason to think you will go through this dramatic year and then the Dr. will send you on your way for a full life of good health. You now know to pay attention to your body, your health, and will have this experience for the rest of your life, and experience is always enlightening. Everyone is different, so I can only hope that my thoughts are helpful to you. I'm thinking of you and wishing you and all my sisters the best.",

I will probably just wear hats and scarves.  My sister had a wig that looked nice, but she literally wore it wrong (the part was meant to be on the side, but she forgot, and used to wear the part in the middle - true story).",
