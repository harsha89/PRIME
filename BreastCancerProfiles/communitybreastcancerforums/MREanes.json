I had titanium rods in my left femur and bone cement in my bottom vertebre, L5, early this year. A follow-up bone scan in early June found more spots, I am currently taking Abraxane, Avastin and Zometa. I have pain in my ribs, back and legs from the bone mets. I developed fairly severe pain about mid-thigh in my left femur about a month ago during a trip to the beach. After reviewing an x-ray and a CT scan from mid-June, my surgeon thinks that the pain is muscular and is from over exertion. The pain may have improved a little over the last four weeks, but not significantly. I do think that it is muscular. Now to my questions. Is it possible that the chemo is causing the slow recovery? Has anyone else had a similar problem? Thank you for your help, Mike Log in to post a reply",

I hope that is the case with your new spot. Best wishes, Mike",

My bone mets were found Dec 06 and I had a titanium rod put in my leg, bone cement in my spine and then went on Xeloda, Zometa and Femera.  More spots were found during a bone scan in early June and I started Abraxane, Avastin and Zometa in mid-June.  My side effects have been very similar to Jeanne46's.  I have had some numbness in my feet and hands and my leg has been very slow to heal. A scan in November showed no spread to other organs, no new spots on my ribs, spine or pelvis and some evidence of healing of existing spots.  My next scan is scheduled for late March. This combination is working for me and I hope that it works for you as well.  Based on my experience, I would definitely recommend this chemo combination. Best wishes, Mike",

Bone mets were discovered in December of 2006, which required a titanium rod in my leg and bone cement in my spine.  I took Xeloda daily for several months with minor side effects.  We found more spots in June and I switched to Abraxane and Avastin in mid-June.  I have treatments 3 weeks, then have a week off.  Side effects have not been bad.  I lost most of my hair and I have some numbness in my feet and hands.  The biggest problem has been that my leg is very slow in healing, possibly due to the chemo.  I have had a runny nose since last February.  My treatment may continue for quite a while and I am willing to continue as long as it is working. Hopefully, your side effects will be minor.  I am not familiar with your chemo so I can't offer any personal experience with those chemos.  Different people react to chemo in different ways.  You hear some horror stories about chemo, but my experience hasn't been too bad.  If you do feel sick, talk with your onc.  There are lots of options to ease the side effects. I'm sorry to hear that you have to go through chemo, but you will make it through.  Best of luck with your treatments, Mike",
