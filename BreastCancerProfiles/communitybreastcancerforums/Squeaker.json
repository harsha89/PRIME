I saw some of your earlier posts this past week and couldn't believe what I was reading. You've given so much support and cheer to others, allow us to help do the same for you now in return ... perhaps more book titles, pictures of wildlife from the lower 48??? ... you just name it. I'm with your daughter, burn the tickets and focus on moving forward, surrounded by your family, friends and bc sisters near and far. Thinking positive thoughts for you & all you hold dear.",

You, Lisa and so many others have shown us what it takes to be here to fight for every last speck of sparkle in each day.  We thank you for that and wish you nothing but the very best.  ~Squeaker",

May there be 16+++ yrs more with many happy victories and memories ahead as well. I laughed when I saw your posting since we're on the exact same protocol and almost twins! My recurrence was just confirmed this past month and I started my first chemo yesterday. Carbo-taxotere-zometa,only I'm doing it once a week for 3 wks straight then a week off. 6 cycles of that, then radiation again. So, 1 down and 17 more to go! UGH!!  Only SE today has been the headache and suddenly I'm feeling that sterroid blush as I type!!  My onc told me my hair would come out slower than it did the last time. I shaved my head by wk 2 before, then it still took another 3 wks for all the stubble to fall out. So I'm living dangerously now, for me. Told my hair gal (also a survivor) that we could wait to shave at the end of the month. New wig shopping tomorrow. I have no clue where the old one is. Whomever finds it in the future may just think it's something the dog brought in from outside!!  Who knows ... we just keep on, right??  I was trip neg first go around. My path this time says I'm suddenly ER+ but still PR/HER2 - . So I guess these cells do morph. Go figure - it's the same breast cancer as before - IBC. Anyway, I just voted to keep killing these suckers for as long as I can!  Being on an AI is not the goal for now ... just search and destroy is my mission.  Good luck w/everything and enjoy your celebration tomorrow. ~Squeaker",

It has exciting prospects as it launchs into trials. Take it from a 6 yr veteran of this battle, it's a big step forward but there's a long way to go!  Good luck to you & your sister.  ~Squeaker",

What I did find was a press release yesterday from Genentech talking about making Herceptin part of an adjuvent tx plan and their Ph III stats on how that's improving survival so much. It all came out at the ANSCO mtg yesterday. I just googled \"chemotherapy news June 4 2007\" and the press release is right near the top - forgot to copy the link, sorry. Anyway, I think Marsha is dead on. Take a deep breath everyone, they now have the statistics to support the science and I think that's what the report was all about??!! If this wasn't it - you bet I'm interested in knowing more. Anyone else have ideas or actually listened to the report last night??",

Here's the simple layman's view - There are different marker tests done on bloodwork. Mine are CA 27-29 and CEA. The mere fact that your Mom's numbers are going down is GOOD news. It shows evidence that the disease is less active. Yes, they can go up again and that's one of the tools her onc will use to evaluate her status as she progresses through treatment and hopefully achieves a stable status.. That said, there are those like me, who don't really show elevated TM numbers with active disease.  I was confirmed w/a recurrence in August and the only hint was my numbers on both tests were at the high mark of normal over a 4 mo period. We confirmed suspicions w/a PET. These tests will probably continue throughout her treatment, so view them as just one piece of a complex picture.  GOOD LUCK!!",

No symptoms at all, honestly a fluke that we even found it. I chose the least invasive way to go, as I know many others here have as well. Gamma knife for me was all it was advertised to be ... in at 6AM as an outpt, out by 2 that afternoon. Had lunch & dinner out the next day w/friends! Worst part of the tx was the decadron - (here's hoping I never have to take that quantity again!!) but the head frame wasn't even that bad w/the valium they gave me. I'm almost 6 mos out of that tx and I'm doing really well ... working, driving and enjoying life. The lesion has not disappeared, but it's shrinking. Anything that may give us the tx flexibility and time to hopefully not have to undergo WBR - ever, is what I treasure. My hats are off to those ladies who don't have this option. Best of luck!!",
