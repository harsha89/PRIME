Before my hair fell out it was very coarse and thick and I thought by now it would have at least thicken up a bit but it hasn't. Any good products that you could recommend? Has anyone else had an issue with their hair growing back?",

On Saturday I found a small hard lump on my left breast. I was able to get into the drs on Monday and had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound done that day. The radiologist came in and said It was not a cyst and that I needed to have biopsy done. My doctor called and told me that the report said I had one solid mass (1.1-1.6 cm) with bumpy extensions which makes it 3.2cm in size and a 7.7mm nodule that is close to the skin (that is the one I feel). I have been trying to read everything I can so that I can prepare myself in case it does turn out to be cancer. It's good to see that there is this type of forum to give support from people who know exactly how I am feeling right now. My friends and family are all saying don't worry but how can you not worry when you don't know what it can be or what to expect and you are fearing the worst..very nervous for tomorrow..and then they said they can't give me any results for 2-3 days and since it's a Friday the weekend adds additional days of waiting...What really has me worried is the fact that the mass has bumpy extensions. I have been trying to look for some kind of info on what bumpy extensions mean...does anyone have a clue?
