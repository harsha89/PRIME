I am so happy to have some hair!  But it has way more salt than pepper in it.  I was hoping to hold off coloring it for awhile but I just don't like the \"white\" look. It looks good on some people but I'm not one of them.  Prior to chemo, I was getting my hair colored at a salon and I think they were using Redken.  I was just wondering if there are some products that are less harsh. I don't want to do anything that might stunt my hair growth. Thanks!   ",

At one time, back in another galaxy, mine was light brown. I've colored it so long, I almost forget. lol.  I can handle the white fuzz, but dark would be a shocker for me. Oh well, not the worst thing, compared to all the other side effects, though.   ",

They warned me when I bought it about some things such as be careful about opening the door to the dishwasher right after it stops running, lets lots of steam out. Also, be careful taking things out of the hot oven. Just not used to having to think about things like that. I didn't wear it much in the house, though. Mostly just to work.   ",

I had the same thing happen about 2 weeks ago due to a broken machine. They called me just as I was leaving the house to go to treatment. I guess the good news is that neither of us was in the machine when it broke!  I don't have anything as important as a wedding on my calendar but I was frustrated with the treatments being dragged out yet another day. I can only imagine how you must feel when you have a big family event coming up. Sometimes you just want to say 'waaaaahhhh'.  I had #24 today. So I'll be finishing right around the same time as you. Let's hope the next couple weeks go fast and no more machine problems.  ",

I know someone else that gets so tired she goes straight home and takes a nap. She doesn't work, though. I think most people fall somewhere in between. I do get a little tired in the afternoon, around 3PM, but I found that going for a brief walk seems to help. The RO had advised me to walk to help with fatigue. I also usually walk back and forth to my treatment each day, about 3/4 mile each way, so that helps, too.  However, the past week or so, I am really walking at a snail's pace coming back from treatment as I am so tired. I've taken the bus a few times lately because I am too tired to walk.  If I had a physically demanding job,  it would be tougher, but I sit at a desk most of the day.   Some suggestions: try to go to bed earlier and drink lots of water. You'll do fine and it will be over before you know it. ",
