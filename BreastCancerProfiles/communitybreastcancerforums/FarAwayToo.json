My story (and worry) is somewhat similar to yours - I've set up myself with a surgeon who I would trust with taking what was thought to be benign fibroadenoma. When results came back as cancer, after thinking for a few days (also over the weekend), I decided to go with a multidisciplinary team at a university hospital an hour away. I'm seeing them on Tuesday as well. My original surgeon does lots of different surgeries, and specialized both in vascular and breast surgery. Surgeons at university do breast surgery only. Since you are seeing an oncologist before the surgery, you will have time to think. You can ask your oncologist for recommendations. No, you don't have to jump and do your surgery with the first available surgeon. Evaluate your options. For me - I have to be 100% comfortable with my choice, otherwise I will eat myself alive if something goes wrong. But that's me. Good luck with your appointment on Tuesday.",

I'm in the same boat - I had my bone scan today, will have an MRI tomorrow and CT next Tuesday. My plan also includes neoadjuvant chemo, but I know it won't start until we have all these results back. I want to start planning for something, even if it's getting the port in and starting infusions (I would rather plan a nice vacation), but I can't even start thinking about that, because \"who knows\"? Hang in there and let us know what your onco says today.  P.S, I take ativan pretty much every day for the past week and a half. It's the only way I can function. I already asked one of my doctors if I should be careful about getting addicted and she said \"don't worry about it right now\"",

My insurance, I'm sure, is freaking out :). We are a very healthy family on a high deductible plan.

My oncologist, when delivering the news about results of the biopsy on my left side, said that it would take 5-10 years to turn into cancer. But said they would do SNLB on the left now as well, when doing mastectomy. I was a little surprised about that. The DCIS is grade 1, but she said they do it on all DCIS surgeries, to make sure there is no invasive cancer hiding somewhere.Â  Basically, I'm and was high risk all these years, t have both invasive and in situ BC in both breasts by age 40. I just didn't know. I'm trying to figure out my next step with genetic counseling. What mutations I should be tested for. I have family history of melanoma and zero BC history.

I was prepared to hear that it would be something else, because it was hypervascular (phyllodes, or maybe fibroadenoma with ADH) but no, it is \"IDC with lobular features\". ER and PR positive, which I read is good, Grade 2 - not so good, but better than 3, I guess. The lump is about 2 cm, and my surgeon feels confident he can get it out with a margin of healthy tissue. He didn't see any enlarged lymph nodes, so he says CLINICALLY I'm stage 1. Of course, we will know more after the surgery and lymph node biopsy. My surgery is scheduled for September 6th, so really soon (read below) I've seen the surgeon before I had the results and even before I had the Core Biopsy. My thinking was \"ok, I'm 40, not exactly the normal age for fibroadenoma, so I want this lump out in any case\". Therefore, I had my surgery date ahead of time. Little did I know I would really-really need it :(. I honestly was in shock yesterday when I got my results. I've spoken to my family practice PA (who is herself a BC survivor - so glad I have her!) and she assured me doing a lumpectomy is the right step in my case. The surgeon mentioned genetic testing (I'm 40, so technically too young for BC), but I don't think I want to wait another 2-3 weeks for the results to come back before doing anything. I want to know what I'm facing. My understanding is that if genetic testing comes back BRCA1 or 2 positive, my treatment would be mastectomy, potential ovary removal, whole works. Am I correct in thinking I can do the lumpectomy, then genetic testing, and if it does turn out positive, do the mastectomy? if you had lumpectomy followed by more aggressive surgery, could you please respond and tell me about your situation? I'm hearing with tumor my size I don't need to do neoadjuvant chemotherapy, because the tumor is relatively small and it can be excised as is. BTW, my tumor didn't show up on mammogram.

We quickly realize how much cancer is changing our life already. I was total emotional wreck over the weekend, agonizing whether or not to go ahead with the lumpectomy, and ultimately told my husband we need to make this decision together. That's not how we usually operate - we have our areas of influence, and \"medical stuff\" is usually mine, whether it comes to our kids' health, mine or even his own. I make appointments for him and read his results. But here, it's too big of a decision, I need him on board and can't be shielding him - I just don't have enough of emotional strength right now. He has a crazy intense job (engineering start up), but he will have to take time off to go with me to the appointments and take me to surgery. He told his boss about the situation, and I think they will be fine with him taking time off (he really has no set hours, he usually works ~10-12 hour days. So, it may be 6 hours some days, and 10 hours some others). I also had a great conversation with my boss about my availability over the next few weeks. I have the best boss in the world! This may seem unrelated, but for me, emotionally, having the right expectations set at our work is very important. So much weight off my shoulders! I feel almost happy now, despite still being in the same place - cancer, who knows how advanced, being angry about \"why me\", \"I'm too young for this\" etc. As a result of our conversation with the surgeon, I will be doing genetic testing and, hopefully, an MRI. All the while waiting for my HER2 status to come back (although the surgeon said it won't really change my treatment plan, because my tumor is not large enough to do neoadjuvant chemo) and for an appointment with an oncologist at the university clinic. He completely understands I may even go with the university clinic surgeon. I will probably \"feel bad\" after all this time he spent with me, but ultimately, I need to have a team I'm comfortable with. I haven't decided if I'm going to wait until genetic testing comes back to go ahead with surgery. It may take up to 21 days. I'm not sure I want to wait that long. I realize a week or two won't matter, but I want the lump out by the end of September. But here is where I will have a second opinion (or first) from the oncologist. I feel like doing surgery without talking to an oncologist first, is like rushing into battle without a general.",

Can you, wonderful ladies, help me with an approximate timeline of treatment? Core biopsy was 8/28, DX on 8/31, if I see oncologist on the 9/13 and who knows when I do get the surgery - is it not too long of a wait? I see in the histories here there is often about a month's time between diagnosis and start of treatment. I know my current surgeon can probably get me in a little sooner, but I honestly may have more trust in the doctors at the university hospital. I'm thinking about starting genetic testing process here, through my surgeon, but waiting until 13th for the rest. Does this sound like a good plan?",

I talked to a friend of mine who recently went through a horrific experience of her husband being diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at the age of 36. (He is actually doing really good, had neoadjuvant chemo and complete pathologic response, and currently considered in remission). She gave me this: you are 40 years old, you want to think about treatment that will not only be good for you short term, but long term as well. That made me think: if I do lumpectomy, I will need radiation, I was told that was for sure. If do mx, I may not need rads. I decided to not do anything invasive until I see the oncologist on the 13th. If that appt was 2-3 weeks out, I may be doing something different. But with it being pretty much a week away, I think I should wait and get all my info. I'm seeing my current (1st?) surgeon today, with my husband. Mainly to talk about options, not for an exam. I will tell him I've got this appt on the 13th, and try to push for MRI. I pretty much decided I want MRI before surgery, even if it's not within my standard of care based on the fact that I'm stage 1 clinically. My friend told me it was also a good \"test\" for your doctor's office. If they don't fight for the tests your insurance thinks are optional, drop them. She says for us, we will need follow up imaging our entire life. Some results will come back equivocal. We will need our doctor's help to get approval for more follow up imaging. If they are not willing to help at this early stage, we need another office/doctor.",

Also, what are the ways (beside SNL biopsy) they figure out lymph node involvement? Is it seen on MRI? Mammogram (again, my mammogram was clear and here I am with a 2 cm cancerous tumor in my breast)? Ultrasound? The surgeon did clinical exam and confirmed my lymph nodes on both sides were normal size. He also did US under my arm, although it was super quick. I'm assuming he didn't see anything alarming. I completely understand this doesn't rule out lymph node involvement, but I'm puzzled as to how they stage cancer in those who don't do surgery first.",

My mammogram report reads \"no masses, suspicious calcifications or secondary signs of malignancy are seen.. Specifically, no discrete mammographic abnormality is seen in the anterior right breast corresponding to the palpable abnormality\". It was followed up by ultrasound which made the lump easily visible. Still, it very much resembled a fibroadenoma, so my dx was a shock. My BIRADS was 4, no letters, The only concerning thing radiologist called out was hypervascularity seen on ultrasound.  FWIW, my breasts aren't even dense: my density is a \"B - scattered fibrograndular densities\". The tumor is under the areola, though, where tissue is usually more dense. I admit to feeling something firm there in some weeks leading to the actual discovery of the lump, but this is how my areola usually is - a little more hard/firm/dense than the rest of the breast. I just never actually pressed on it hard enough, until I was in the shower with warm water and all the skin completely flat - then I felt it and immediately knew something was not right. I had a clinical exam in March, and my doctor didn't feel anything. I'm pretty sure it wasn't as big then, or she would've felt it.",

Hoping for clean PET results for you! Sounds like you have a good team of doctors, and that's great. You haven't been rushed into a quick surgery, instead, they ordered all the proper imaging and follow up. Take heart in that - you are being treated well. My story is somewhat similar to yours, in that I found my lump myself, and the diagnosis came totally out of the blue (I'm 40, no family history). The first surgeon I found wanted to do a lumpectomy without MRI or any other follow up imaging, and that didn't sound right to me at all. I had a second opinion at a large NCI comprehensive cancer center (large academic hospital). There, I had an MRI and had DCIS found in my other, \"good\" breast. So that solidified the decision about BMX, however, my invasive tumor is almost 3cm, so I was offered neoadjuvant chemo (sounds like this will be your plan as well). I was a candidate for chemo due to aggressiveness of my tumor (high Ki67 %), and when my onc offered neoadjuvant, it made perfect sense to me. 1) We can see if it's working 2) If there are any stray cells already, it's best to kill them fast. With surgery first, you have to wait at least a month (if not more in case of mastectomy) to start chemo, so my logic was \"I'd rather have chemo get to them sooner!\" Do you know for sure what your receptors are? Sounds like ER/PR+ and HER2-, right?",

Even bone scan showed something in my shoulders, but it was symmetrical and they called it \"degenerative\" (which is, apparently, a good thing when alternative is bone mets!) Do you like baths or hot showers? I can only relax while under hot water, so I take showers twice a day, and may even sneak one extra here or there. As for meals, I decided to give up red meat and sugar. It's not easy for me (especially with sugar), but it's coming along. I eat a lot of steamed vegetables (zucchini, carrots, tomatoes) over healthy grain. I'm originally from eastern Europe, and pretty much grew up on buckwheat. Look it up, and see if you can buy it in your area, ideally at an eastern European ethnic store (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian), because what Whole Foods sells as buckwheat is not roasted correctly and results in a mushy kasha, while what is sold at ethnic stores will give you nice firm flavorful grains that separate easily like rice or couscous. Good luck with your first chemo!",

Just today (almost two months after exchange) I started feeling zaps of pain in one of the \"breasts\". It's a pretty intense pain that lasts a second, then goes away completely, but repeats 10-15 times an hour. It's nowhere around the incision, it's right over where the implant is. It's in the left breast, at about 10 o'clock position, midway between the center of the breast and sternum, so upper inner quadrant. It's started this morning, and has been going on most of the day,. It's in one very specific spot, almost as if I pushed very deep with a finger and now it is bruised. The skin on top looks fine. I did breast exam the way I've been taught, and I can't feel any knots or hardness in that area, just a smooth muscle/implant (I have under the muscle implants). Should I be worried or can this also be a nerve pain? I had some \"zaps\" of pain after mastectomy, but honestly can't remember how they felt like. This pain caught me by surprise, because I didn't experience any pain or even significant discomfort in the breast area itself after exchange.",

My Ki67 is 40% (40-50 according to another pathologist review), and grade is 2. She said that Ki67 is more objective than grade. I read here that a lot of oncologists think otherwise. She explained, that 1/3 of the grade is determined by mitosis, and it is very subjective measurement. For Ki67 they stain the tissue, so it is more accurate somehow. Anyway, she said regardless of my node status (mine are not showing as affected on imaging, which doesn't mean they are clear, of course), based on the tumor size (2.8cm based on MRI), age (40) and Ki67, she would recommend chemo. My Mammaprint should be back tomorrow. I'd love her to be wrong, but sadly, I don't think she will be.",

      "Content": "FarAwayToo wrote: I'm waiting for results on my Core Needle Biopsy. It was done Monday and my hospital states \"2-4 days\" until receiving the results. Supposedly, the results will be sent to my referring physician, which, in my case, was a Nurse Practitioner at my OBGYN practice. While I don't have any reason to doubt that she will deliver the news as soon as she has it, I don't have any connection with her. I usually see another doctor in the office, and being otherwise healthy and not planning any more children (I'm 40 and have two teenagers), I only go once a year for my PAP and exam. Of course, when I found my lump, the doctor was booked weeks out, so I had to go for the first available provider, and that was this NP. I liked her a lot, but still - I don't know her. My OBGYN office is a bit disorganized. I called this morning and asked if they received results of my breast biopsy. \"I'm sorry, you are looking for results of your breast exam?\" \"NO! I had a biopsy for a suspicious mass. My results should be sent to NP. Can you tell me if they were received?\" \"Oh, I will have to leave this message with the nurse\" Ugh. While I was waiting for my biopsy (which was scheduled more than 2 weeks after my diagnostic mamo and US), I found a surgeon who I want to remove my lump, even if it is completely benign (radiologist told me it is likely a fibroadenoma). Surgeon said it did look benign based on shape, but it is hypervascular, which worries him a bit. Anyway, we are waiting for biopsy results regardless. At the breast imaging center where my biopsy was done, I added surgeon's name to the list of physicians receiving my results, but I'm not sure they did it. So, I called the imaging department and left a message asking them to confirm they did add his name and he will receive my results. I'd rather talk to his office than my OBGYN. Which brings me to my original question: would you rather get a call from whomever as soon as your results are in, or have a follow up appointment scheduled where results are shared with you? I'm very much in the second camp. At least I won't jump to the ceiling when one of my charity calls me about contributions (this happened yesterday). They are in luck, because I immediately agreed to up my contributions. Yay for clean water! I'm a very anxious person, and with this lump I, for the first time, broke down and asked my doctor for something to help with anxiety. Yesterday, I was waiting/hoping to get a call with results, and every phone call sent me into a horrible adrenaline rush (see above). Of course, no results for me yesterday. Today I decided to take my small dose lorazepam in the morning, to help with shakes a bit. I still don't know if I will get my results today, but at least I called and asked them to check for them. The pill is helping quite a bit so far.

Or is my case co complex they are getting multiple pathologists on it?\" On a side note, I went through a scare with my older son once. He had an MRI for what his ophthalmologist thought might have been a brain tumor. He had enlarged optic nerve and was 16. I don't know how I survived from Monday when doctor suggested the MRI and Thursday, which was the first available time. The MRI was at 9 am and at 1:00 pm ophthalmologist was calling me. I about fainted, because I was convinced that there couldn't be any good news that fast. Surely, the doctor has other things to do than deliver \"all clear\" during the day. Turned out, the MRI was normal and my boy is just special :) So, going by how soon you get results is also not very reliable way to tell if they will be good or bad.",

Nausea: I had a lot of nausea the day of the infusion, but I never vomited. Just awful feeling but not enough to throw up. It didn't matter if my stomach was empty or full. What helped was staying perfectly still, preferably in bed. I would have an early night the day of treatment and usually by next morning I wasn't nauseous anymore. I couldn't take Zofran (had bad headache with it), so my oncologist prescribed Kytril. I suggest anyone who is having a lot of nausea give it a try. I feel like it really helped. Another thing that was really bad for me was mental crush around day 6 of the cycle, I think it had to do with steroid withdrawal. Once I caught that pattern, I went easy on steroids, only took them the day after infusion (and not 3 days as initially told), and the crush just didn't happen that cycle. I had neulasta during cycles 1,2 and 3, I didn't have any side effects from it (except high blood counts, as expected). Other than that I was just extremely tired. I lost most of my hair with Taxol, but had some fuzz growing in at the same time. I went completely bold on AC, lost my eyebrows and lashes (I still had brows and lashes at the end of Taxol). I really really hated AC. I remember telling myself that no matter what, I will never ever have to do it again, because we receive the lifetime dose of Adriamyacin, and it can't be repeated again.
