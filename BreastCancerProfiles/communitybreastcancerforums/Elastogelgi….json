The reason I decided to tell you about my Mepitel use is that I feel good that my skin is covered. I do scratch thru the film but it is keeping my skin safe from infection from my scratch impulses. The film is very comforting. You can buy 4x4 squares at cvs. I have worn it since day 1 of rads and only have to change it once a week or less. some pieces just stay and stay. It's a patchwork on my areas I'm getting rads on my breast armpit and superclavical. It stays on wonderfully. No creams needed. It doesn't stop the itch but it's supposed to protect from moist desquamation? Spelling? Anyhow you could try it if you are going crazy I wear it through radiation treatments basically a week at a time. It is being done in NZ and in trials",

I finished rads and armpit is burnt peeling and moist, I'm using mepitel film on my rad burns both with and without the absorption pad. The absorption pad has the film between the pad and your skin so the pad won't stick. This stuff with the pad is comfy. You can wear it for a week or more and it is designed to be put on burns. It breathes. I wore the plain clear Mepitel film all during radiation treatment with around 7 day wear times.Prevented friction and kept me from scratching it raw. You can see pieces of the clear film next to the one with the pad in the armpit photo. I only needed the product with the absorption pad after rads were finished ....I got a pretty bad hot hurting peel going in my armpit. This is not something you will be putting on daily as changing it disturbs the wounds. Long wear time is the design. Read the instructions for removal, it does come off okay but there are tips on pulling it one way then the other...  anand reduced reactions they do this Mepitel in New Zealand google Mepitel Film for breast cancer radiation. Buy at CVS in USA...eliminates need for creams. The one with the white pad is for after radiation if needed. I'm wearing a bra over the pad it is a nice cushion. no problems. The last photo shows a patch of the clear film barely visible on my shoulder protects me from itching it. It is a lot like tagederm but way stronger and less sticky. You can shower with it.",
