So much so that I have dedicated myself to learning more and educating myself as well as other survivors about what treatments are or should be available to patients. There is a whole world out there of studies going on that I feel doctors are not supporting or telling us about. We have to stand up and do the work, for us and those that cannot or are to sick to. I am now working for a tech company that is helping patients find and connect with trials - I feel I have to do this - I have to get active and do it for me, for my children and for you. After all we have to be our own best advocates who else will watch out for us if not ourselves. ",
