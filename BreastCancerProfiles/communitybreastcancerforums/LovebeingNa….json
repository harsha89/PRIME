I think what was actually happening was there were other \"monthly\" changes happening that made it seem more pronounced. Also after the biopsy there was a lot of swelling so that also made it seem bigger to me so that worried me. I talked to my MO about the wait for surgery I had and he said it was ok and wouldn't affect the outcome. As it turned out, even though I thought it was getting bigger, it was smaller than the MRI or ultrasound said by about 1cm. Try to take it one day at a time. I know the waiting is so scary\u2026.it almost drove me crazy. But you are on the right path to finding out all you need to know about your cancer so they can treat it the best way possible. ",

I read all of that from Beesie too before I made my decision. I know the statistics and I also know many women that lumpectomy did not work out so well for. For me, I could not handle the testing and waiting. My lump showed up just months after a perfect mammogram and if I hadn't been hyper-vigilant about self-exams I would not have found it. I realize it doesn't mitigate all risk of it coming back in the breast area but for me it gave me great peace of mind to have them removed and my oncologist was extremely supportive - I think almost relieved. I really think the bottom line is that only I have to live with my decision. You are the only one who has to live with yours. And it is the same for every women. I personally believe there is still much to be known - I was not BRACA 1 or 2 positive yet BC is present all over my family. I appreciate the info, but what may seem like \"unnecessary\" for one, maybe just exactly the right choice for another. I have absolutely no regrets about my decision - I personally embrace overkill when it comes to breast cancer. :)",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2014 07:27PM - edited Apr 17, 2014 07:34PM by LovebeingNana Hi April start friends. I had my first TC treatment today. The infusion itself went well\u2026.I felt a little off toward the end of it, not bad - but off - my head seemed like it had pressure not really pain. I actually then went to a staff meeting but an hour after I had left the infusion center I started with a terrible headache. I took advil and it helped slightly so that I could get a walk in (per my MO's instructions - exercise every day.)  The headache has really not stopped. No nausea at all - I ate a small dinner and no problem at all! The happy thing is 1 down and 3 to go. I think it is easier to have started than to be still waiting to start.   I hope I don't get a headache like this every time. The only other issue is metals taste but that is not bothering me.  I hope you all are doing well. ",

It kind of started yesterday but was just severe this morning. it is in my low back and honestly feels like a throbbing toothache in my back. My Neulasta shot was Friday and the real varied bone pain didn't start 'til Monday with the worst of it last night and today. So I am wondering if it is the Neulasta shot or if it is the chemo\u2026.I never have back pain so this really hit me. I guess I thought if it was Neulasta it would have hit earlier than Monday. I am taking claritin. Sunshine I so agree with the \"wave\" of side effect. Seems like some leave and then new ones arrive. Never a dull moment that's for sure.  Shellbell, I have heard of them doing inpatient chemo. I know that would be discouraging but I think I would feel safer if I had that kind of reaction. I hope it all get sorted out for you quickly. ",

I was on the phone with my first cousin who is also recovering from BMX for breast cancer. We were talking about the needed moments when you just let out the tears. She said \"Aunt Elaine told me a saying our Nana used to use all the time do you know what it is?\" I said no (I was 2 when she died.) She was single Mom to 12 kids, one of which was my Dad, and she used to say \"Go ahead and cry for 15 minutes and then go get yourself a new hat.\"  Hats back in her day were a must - she always had one on so it was like a treat to go get a new hat. While we were on the phone, a hat I ordered from Etsy arrived.  Great moment. :)",

Try to baby yourself and let the tears out when they need to come out. You will start feeling better soon. And can I say a word from one Mom to another? Your kids are going to learn so much from this time. No guilt! It is not good for you or for them. Sometimes we forget that all aspects of life are teaching moments for them and this can be teaching them compassion, patience, strength,  a little independence, and that things in life can get hard for a while, but they are learning that they can come through it just like their Mom is. What amazing tools to have as they grow up into adulthood. My sons are now 28 & 23 and not to long ago we sat and had a talk about all of my Mom moments I had been feeling guilty about. Well, first of all they did not remember MOST of them, and the ones they did remember they remembered quite differently. I know it's hard right now. But your kids are going to be ok\u2026I hope you can get some rest knowing better days are coming. Hang in there. ",

Biotene mouth wash (and toothpaste) has really helped my mouth so no sores yet. Headaches have been my biggest issue.  I will say after the last 3 days (my worst days) I was really wondering how I am going to add more to this. I decided this morning I have to stop thinking ahead and just stay in today and work through what is on my plate today. It is so overwhelming to think about doing this 3 more times!!

My MO had given me his pager number in case fever went over 100.5 so I called him and he told me to start taking my Levaquin that he had me fill before I ever started chemo.

I grieve the changes brought about by surgery and by chemo and I grieve the old \"ignorance is bliss\" before I was confronted with my own mortality. But I am grateful for so many things too.

My MO didn't think it was from the chemo because they came so long after I had chemo. SO he checked my thyroid which came back perfect. Now yesterday, after my chemo Friday, the hives are here with a vengeance. Last night I was covered from head to toe in massive hives and swelling. I ended up going to the ER and they gave me a shot of solumedrol and beaneryl - It took a long time to help but it finally calmed down. He also gave me a prescription for a prednisone taper down and for pepsin. I guess I should call my MO and make sure it is ok to be on more steroids??? I woke up this morning itching like CRAZY. I am really at my wits end. I have a bad feeling these hives could last a while. ANy suggestions?????",

I have felt really good this past week which is really encouraging. It makes me feel like I can go through the next one, knowing there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Cold, My MO told me he wants me to exercise everyday on chemo. He was kind of adamant! He said \"Not 5 days, not 6 days, you need to exercise 7 days a week.\" He said it will make all the difference in how my body handles the chemo. So I have done something everyday.....a couple days it was so hard.....but I do think it helped my fatigue.  I have to say I am dreading Thursday..... I am hoping they can do something about the headaches this time. It seems like #2 has been rough on many of us.......Not looking forward to it.  A friend gave me a groupon for acupuncture so I am trying that to see if it helps with SE's.  I hope everyone starts feeling better. ",

Can I say though great job Mom, sounds like you have a wonderful daughter. :) Timbuktu - I don't have any of the pins & needs but I have taken L-glutamine & B6 from the start.  Jhodro - I hope your feet get better with the break - that is miserable. :( I leave on vacation in 3 days.

Well I wanted to share a cool thing that happened today. I am on vacation - (we had this planned long before Cancer came knocking.) My last chemo was last week so we went ahead with our plans. Well today we went to the Statue of Liberty and there was a LONG line ln the sun. The security guard came up to me and said \"Ma'am you should not have to stand in this line. Come with me.\" We followed him straight through to get on the ferry. He said goodbye by saying \"You keep up the fight OK?\"  That really cheered me up. I hope the rest of you start feeling better from your SE's. 10 days PFC and I am exhausted but it is good to get away and be Nana. :) ",
