I assume due to this I will start Rad in Sept or late Aug. I too am worried about heart and lung zapping as mine is on the left as well. My PCP has me seeing a Pulmonologist to be on the safe side because of my Asthma and the fact that I have had Chronic Bronchitis now for the past 3 months and am having trouble getting over it. ",

They finally had to go in my thumb to get it. My nurse said I may want to get a port since I am so hard to get blood on. I told her that I didnt have to have chemo and she said ya but with your radiation  you will still need it because they will check blood levels a lot. Has anyone else heard of that?",
