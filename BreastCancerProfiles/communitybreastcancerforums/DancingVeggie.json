Wondering if there are any north side Chicago mothers of school-aged children out there who might be interested in setting up some kind of help swap, especially as the school year starts to roll around. I know that I could benefit from having someone picking my kids up after school on treatment and scan days and I would be so glad to return the favor. What do you think about this? I live in Irving Park and my children go to school in Lakeview. Is this crazy?
