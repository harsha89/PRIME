      "Content": "alvaree510 wrote: Hello out there.... I'm 28 years old, mother of 2. I just had a lumpectomy last Friday. They used wire localization to go through my areola for the procedure. My first 3 days after the procedure were not so fun. I started feeling better though on Tuesday so I started doing some of my normal daily tasks. But now I'm starting to feel not so hot again. I'm starting to feel increased soreness, my nipple has been at full salute, and my whole breast is getting noticeably more swollen than the other side. Its making me a little nervous. I had a lumpectomy a few years back, but that was different. It was more of a simplar procedure as they only made an incision directly above the mass. By this time it was business as usual. I felt fine. But now I've been glued to the couch though all day. I feel drained and just really uncomfortable. Does anyone know if this is normal? To start feeling better and then back to poop? Its too late in the night to call the surgeon's office. But I may just be going nuts because I am still waiting for my results. I don't know :-/ Surgery 11/9/2012 Lumpectomy: Left Log in to post a reply",
