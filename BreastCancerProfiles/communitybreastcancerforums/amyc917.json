One day this woman was thre, and she was not new, but I had never met her before. She also had stage IV breast cancer, with mets in her lungs and bones and she had just recently had a bad scan. She said her Dr said that she had about a year left. She went on to spout off and say some pretty negative things. She was angry, I totally get that. Then she said \"well, at least I don't have liver mets, once you have liver mets its all over.\" Well I just so happen to have liver mets, and I was relatively new to cancer at the time, and her words totally wrecked me for about a week. I considered never going back to the group for fear of seeing her or hearing her say something like that again. Then I realized a few things: 1) Her cancer and prognosis is totally different from mine, and what's true for her is not true for me. 2) She didn't know what she was talking about, she was angry, and she was grasping onto whatever she felt she had left. Since then I have adopted a pretty simple policy regarding cancer talk: Never play the cancer competition game--because really, that's messed up. no one wants to win that competition. Never devalue anyone else's cancer experience--they are all different, and they are scary. And always, ALWAYS keep in mind that what you say about cancer prognoses can have a very profound effect on some one else, so don't ever make flip comments about prognoses. Those are my rules. As for how to respond when I think some one has crossed the line? I don't know. I guess I just try to get out of the conversation as quickly as possible and try not to talk to that person again. Or, I just try to remember the two realizations I made after that awful cancer group meeting. ",

It sort of validates all of my fears as a young, single person with cancer... that these lame-ass renegade cells creepin' up in my bod render me more or less undateable. Its a sad thought. I try not to think it. sigh. It not the first time this friend hurt my feelings. My personal favorite from her was when my hair fell out from chemo. she asked if ALL of my hair had fallen out, and I told her that it had. and you know what she said? she said, \"Oh my god! You have little girl p***y!\" I'm not even kidding you. I didn't talk to her for quite a while after that, because not only was that comment hurtful and insensitive, its also really really disturbing that her mind went there. Its also tragic that the distance between her brain and mouth is so short that she didn't have time to catch it before it came spilling out. Its a shortcoming of hers. we all have shortcomings. and so I forgave her...  ",

      "Content": "Aug 22, 2012 11:40PM - edited Aug 22, 2012 11:50PM by amyc917 oh yeah. this is great. \"foot in mouth disease.\" This story that i'm about to tell isn't specifically about things said about cancer, its more about sentiments regarding long term and chronic illness. I think it still relates to the topic. Last night, I was having dinner at a friend's house. I hadn't seen her or talked to her in months, which is fine, I was on the mend from surgery and grumpy, and I was actually kind of thankful to be left alone for a little while. Anyway, we're sitting there, talking about people getting married and she brings up that her cousin recently got engaged to his long term girlfriend, and then she said that she wished that her cousin would just get out of the relationship now while he still can. Some one else at the table asked why, what was wrong with the girlfriend/relationship. The answer:   \"Well, first of all she has Crohn's Disease...\"   I gave her a nasty look, and cut her off saying something like: \"as a person living with a long term and chronic illness, it really hurts to hear that.\" Then she tried to provide the other reasons for why the relationship should end... but there was really no other reason. Mostly just the illness.",
