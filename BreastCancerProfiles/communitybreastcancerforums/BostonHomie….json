Invasive carcinoma, ER/PR +/HER2- stage 1. Lumpectomy completed. Post menopausal. Hormone therapy planned. Chemo not needed based on oncotype Question is whether or not to have radiation which had been the plan until meeting with RO who raised concerns re: possible significant side effects due to the ATM defect. Alternative is mastectomy. Second opinion with another RO scheduled. Would love to hear from others who have been down this path. I need to decide soon.",
