The breast surgeron said no need to worry at this time...she wants to do an ultrasound in 3 months, but first wants me to reduce caffene and start taking vitamin E to soften the tissue. I hope she is right. I don't know if I should believe her or get a second opinion. I have heard the horror stories of things being overlooked. But, I saw the mamo, she showed me and explained it very well, and seems to be very understanding and down to earth. I'm glad my obgyn referred me to her.",
