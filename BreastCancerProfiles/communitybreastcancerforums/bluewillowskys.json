Today the news is that they found \"something\".....I had dcis in Spring 2011, did lump. and rads and one yr tamoxifen, no family history of BC , but many other types yes. MY gut instinct was telling me since last December that there was something lurking in there.....that gut feeling was stronger after my Feb 2014 mammo. But I kept skipping cycles so they kept postponing the MRI. My original surgeon didnt think i needed one so I went over her to my onco who agreed to do one. Lo and behold I was right....a crappy thing to be right about. Now Im waiting until June 9th for my MRI guided biopsy....oh joy ! Has anyone here had cancer in one breast and then several yrs later find something in the \"healthy\" breast? anyone know what my chances are that it is dcis again OR something invasive ?

This week the area right under where and underwire would go all the way across and up the right side of my chest is swollen and painful. All through last night i felt a raised \"line\" also going up the middle of the breast about 1/2 the diameter of a pencil...that has slowly went away today but the other swelling and pain is still there.... Could this be lymphadema? its been almost 15 months since my surgery and 113 months since my radiation. I am on Tamoxifen. Should I go see my doctor??  Yippy Skippy !
