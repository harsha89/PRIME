About 95% certain it was the weirdest bruise I've ever had. The areas that aren't actually veins or capillaries (which are still super visible, and pink/purple) have begun to fade into an orange/yellow color. Basically, old blood. It's weird because it never looked like a traditional bruise (blue/purple) but as it heals, it definitely looks more bruiselike. So from afar it still looks like pink streaks, but upon closer examination, it's just a network of pink capillaries and an orange/yellow healing bruise. Obviously, no other symptoms arose. No discharge, itching, swelling, burning, etc. I do still have a few weird lumps in that breast but two of them feel identical, like a short lumpy rope. So most likely fibrocystic tissue. I have the mammogram and ultrasound this upcoming week, it will definitely put my mind at ease to know for sure what those are about. Still a little pain up under my arm but I've heard that's common with fibrocystic breasts. ",

I'm having a less severe HA day, so I'm a lot more logical and am thinking it might just be a natural but previously unnoticed breast color pattern. Or perhaps I pushed too hard while doing an exam? It's surrounding the nipple area which is obviously the squishiest area and most susceptible to bruising. I will update if anything changes, I'm just starting to feel like in the absence of every single other possible symptom, it may not be anything. Watching my mom go through her cancer for the last 15 months has really shown it to me with new eyes, and it scares me more than it ever did before. We have no history of breast, ovarian, uterine or cervical cancer in our family, but cancer as a whole does run in the family (Pancreatic, colon, throat, etc.) so I'm just trying to be pro-active.",

I just have such a bad feeling, and I can't be sure if it's HA or a legitimate fear. I woke up this morning and off to the side of the nipple was this line. It sort of looked like an allergen test line, raised and puffy, except that it was white instead of pink. (EDIT: This has since disappeared) The pink rash is maybe a hair darker today but no bigger I don't think. There are three teensy tiny pink dots around the nipple but I do have one of those on the other breast, it's just weird that all three showed up at one time. They almost look like hard little pimples. Very tiny. As far as the rash itself, it isn't one solid piece of pink. It looks like it in the mirror, but if you look closer it's more of a collection of pink splotches. Although it looks more solid today. I still have the underarm pain, but I've had that on the other side just recently and I'm hoping it's just a stress response (Sweating from fear, etc) but it does hurt down my arm. I still haven't found any palpable nodes. The breast tissue itself still feels the same as on the left, and I don't SEE any skin variations between the two breasts. Still no itching or discharge, and any itching feels like dry skin and is on both breasts, and is infrequent. I don't feel any additional warmth outside the normal body warmth. No palpable lumps under the skin outside the normal breast tissue. I'm almost a week past ovulation now, so both breasts are starting to go through their hormonal changes. I'm just hitting major freak out. I'm glad they can see me tomorrow, but I'd have rather it been today. ",

The left breast also shows sign of bruising. I'm still a little uncomfortable because there are still areas that look a little pink between the bruises, but it hasn't gotten darker, bigger, or caused additional symptoms. I do still have the lymph node, and have been putting a heat pack on it at night. The pain it's causing is making me wonder if it's truly a node, or maybe a hard cyst? My gut says lymph node because it's just that shape, but it also seems longer than a typical lymph node would be. I don't want to touch it too much because I know that nodes can get more and more swelling if you keep touching them.",

I've had a little pain, more in this breast than the other, but again, it could be cyclical. Every now and again I get what I think is an itch deep in the tissue that I can't reach, but it's sporadic, and other than that, there hasn't been any progression in symptoms.

I woke up this morning and the pink patch was slightly darker, and I still had the pain/swollen node under my arm. Doctor checked the left breast first as a control, then felt the right. She saw the pink patch right away. She said she felt some fibrocystic changes (which isn't necessarily surprising, I was having regular ultrasounds for cyst monitoring) and made a comment about \"well maybe some of that tissue is grouped together.\" This sort of set off red flags for me because 1. I hadn't felt anything in that breast different from the left and 2. What exactly did she feel? I wish I'd have asked further but it's something that sort of occurred to me in retrospect. She told me BEFORE she even looked at me that any time a breast patient comes in, that they will order imaging. So I knew she was scheduling a mammo and u/s before she even looked, so I wasn't really all that panicked about that. Overall my assumption is that she likely isn't familiar with IBC but she also didn't try to prescribe antibiotics or creams. She told me to take ibuprofen for the lymph node pain and to use hot compresses on that area, but she never actually felt my nodes, neither under my arms or in my neck. I just don't know. Considering right now the only things going on are the pink spot and lymph node (which could have even been caused by something unrelated) I guess I'll just focus on not touching either the breast or the armpit for a few days and see if that helps.",

She lived with my brother and his wife for the first year of her disease and then she moved up here to live in an apartment building for elderly and disabled folks. She likes it because she has privacy and independence, but I am only 1.6 miles away (I know this because I walked there and back yesterday for exercise) She is on a new chemo that may or may not help. The last chemo stopped working. If the new chemo works, it could definitely buy us more time. My doctors appointment tomorrow is actually between two of her appointments. My husband switched some things around at work so that he can take care of the first one and I take care of the second. (I should note that all of her appointments are with a toddler in tow, because I can't just leave her at home LOL) I should try valerian root, my grandmother swears by it. (Incidentally, no one in my fathers side has ever died of any kind of cancer, and in my mom's side it was 95% her paternal side that had it, her maternal side was pretty unscathed.) My mom gave me a few of her Klonopin and that helps for about 20 hours, with 4 horribly anxious hours before bed. But I'm totally out (she only gave me a few) and so is she. I don't do any caffeine because I get tachycardia if I have too much. Little bits of chocolate though...well ;) I do hope that this is just anxiety and that I'll feel better about it soon. I JUST had an ultrasound back in December but it only did 9-12:00 position, the pink area is in the 12-1:00 position. Plus an ultrasound likely won't find anything. (I did have a full breast ultrasound on both breasts in 2014, with repeats done on the right for cysts) One thing I will say is that with all the information out there on google, and google images, that I have not seen ANY photo that looks ANYTHING like what I'm dealing with.

When I'm texting/playing on my cell phone, my lower arm rests on that breast. Right about the area where it's red. I'm pretty much always in a reclined position because I either lay on my bed or on our chaise lounge, and I hold my phone a little closer to my face cause my vision isn't what it used to be. Which might explain why the pink spot seems lighter certain times of the day. So I think I'm going to try to put up my phone for a few days and text through my laptop/desktop computer and try to see if the spot lightens at all. I'd be thrilled if that was the cause. It's flat, no swelling, there is no pitting or thickening (although if I'm being honest, I don't know what skin thickening feels like, but I lightly pinched the skin near the red area and it was thin) and it's just like a blush hue almost under the skin. It's more obvious in blue/purple light and almost invisible in white light (I'm a photographer, I see light in colors LOL)",

It makes me nervous that I may not have him much longer. Actually he had some serious dental issues (stomatitis) and had all but his canines pulled back in 2014. This is after surviving the first 6 months of his kittenhood which involved a broken leg, severe URI, worms, ear mites, an eye infection, abscesses on both back legs, and just general living in a barn.

I had actually seen that link before, but again, it never really talked about how dark the pinkness is before it's a concern. I do hope it's just some sort of weird allergy or perhaps just the way the blood vessels are arranged under my skin. My best friend says I have \"porcelain\" skin, so I can see a lot underneath.",

I remember when I had a breast exam last year the very nice nurse (who'd worked in a breast cancer hospital previously) said \"If you can find a twin in the other breast, you can relax.\" There is no twin. And obviously it's causing pain, all the way down my arm. I can't stop thinking \"what are the odds?\" because from what I understand, IBC is relatively rare. It seems like there are no official numbers on yearly diagnosis but I've read between 2000-4000. That's extremely rare. My mom's cancer is considered rare and only about 38K people get it a year. And yet, I'm terrified.",

Usually I post on a HA board when I have things like this happen, but IBC is scary, and no one is going to be as knowledgable about it as people who actually have it. Heck, some doctors don't even know about it. And the kitty in your profile is adorable :)",
