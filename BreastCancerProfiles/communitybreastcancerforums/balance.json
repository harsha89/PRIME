My neuropathy did seem to get a bit worse, but I'm unsure if that was related to the chemo. I do not want to emphasize that you may not experience the same side effects.  I have a history of UTI's, so you might not have the same bladder issues.  Despite these side effects, I was able to continue to work full-time during chemo.   I would leave work early on a Wednesday, receive chemo and return to work for Thurs/Fri.  I felt OK until Friday afternoon, when the fatigue would start to set in.  I would feel pretty lousy all weekend and then return to work Monday morning.  I was lucky that my employer let me take a brief afternoon nap in my office which really helped me to get through some days.  I had chemo every 2 weeks in the beginning decreasing to every 3 weeks toward the end secondary to my bladder issues.  Although I was fatigued in between treatments, I did pretty much carry on with life.   I hope that helps.  Please fell free to check back with me if you like.  Wishing you well.  ",
