Well she noticed straight away and she also 'felt something' like a ridging? I've been referred to the breast clinic in a week time but the wait is killing me. She said 9/10 referrals are normal but im guessing that includes every lump and bump referral too? Has anyone else had a dimple and 'something felt'? What did it turn out to be? I'm kinda freaking out here! Thanks Log in to post a reply",
