There is also swelling and pain below my left breast.  I had a mammogram done and just received a call on yesterday where the scheduling nurse told me that my doctor wants to schedule surgery for me on December 22nd to see exactly what's going on with the breast.   I have had pain in my left breast for about 2 months, its now progressed to my left arm as well as the left side of my stomach, where some areas of numb to the touch.  Please tell me somebody has had something like this before and can explain to me, why my doctor would want to wait until December 22nd.  Could this mean that he's not really all that concerned, or what?
