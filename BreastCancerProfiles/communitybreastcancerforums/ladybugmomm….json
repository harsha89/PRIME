The surgeon didn't say anything about my breast being fibrocystic but my aunt told me that on my dad's side of the family our breasts are fibrocystic. I have the pain that you mention, like right now it is hurting and has been hurting since I came home all one side. She did give me a physical exam, she also said based on my family history I should have been given a MRI and scheduled for the BRCA test. Thank you so much for sharing what happen to you, I feel a lot better. I started crying in the doctor's office because I felt like no one takes me serious.",
