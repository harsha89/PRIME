I live 1 1/2 hours from the Huntsman Cancer Institue in SLC and am scheduled to go see a surgeon there in a couple of weeks.  She has a video link that I think will interest and hopefully help you too.  http://www.huntsmancancer.org/index.php?tmpl=component&option=com_jedirectory&view=lightbox_dis&itemid=304&f_type=4&vimeolink=1&Itemid=99&f_name=aHR0cDovL3ZpbWVvLmNvbS8yMzA0NjUyMQ%3D%3D&video_w=600&video_h=450 Okay, that looks really long after I pasted it, but I am pretty sure it will work.  The video is titled Options for Surgery but there is a lot of other good info in there too. Just knowing we are not alone, and having these forums helps me a ton.  I will send hope and good thoughts your way! Rachel ",
