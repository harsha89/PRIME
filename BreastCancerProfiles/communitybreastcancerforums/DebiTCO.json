I am going to post this again her so other/more folks will see it. I hope that in doing so, I am not breaking any rules. Sorry, this is probably not the right board to put this on, but I don't know where it should go. I am wondering if anyone has had a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following diagnosis and/or surgery? I have looked this up on the Internet and have seen that there seems to be some connection between the 2. I have been having a lot of issues since surgery and thought I was simply depressed. I went to see an Internal Medicine doctor last week and she mentioned to me [after me going through a list of complaints] that I might have PTSD. I have many of the symptoms of PTSD and have made an appointment to see a therapist. Has anyone else heard of this or know of anyone having had PTSD after breast cancer?
