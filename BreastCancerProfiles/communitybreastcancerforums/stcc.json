I have one questions to the ladies who have gone through BMX with TE, what is the typical procedure of the entire operation? Did your breast surgeon stay in the operation room through the entire operation (even include the reconstruction part), or he/she finished his part of operation and left the operation room, so plastic surgeon came in and took over? I am asking this question because I am thinking if I can allocate all of the scheduled time just for the bilateral mastectomy (giving up the TE part so that my BS surgeon has enough time to do a BMX for me --- if he stays there through the entire operation). Thank you for your input!",

(My left breast has cancer, it is grade II/III, Her2+++). So thursday I went in for an ultrasound to double check, however, the ultrasound cannot find these things (that found on the MRI), instead, ultrasound found something in another postion that they believe it is cyst...... So, all these findings drive me nuts. So many findings in the right breast, and both MRI and ultrasound pick different things and cannot confirm each other... I am so worried what exactly are going on in the right breast... I hope to do the bilateral mastectomy, however, my BS told me that the sugery they scheduled for next Monday is only for unilateral mastectomy (NOBODY ever asked my opinion when they book this surgery for me, they just booked it as unilateral without my own opinion and wihtout asking me at all.) So if I want bilateral mastectomy, they have to reschedule the surgery which possibly in September...That means I have to wait longer for my surgery. With such aggressive cancer, how scary it is for me to wait longer... I have to make the decision by tomorrow (Friday). what should I do? Should I wait longer and get the bilateral mastectomy? or just do the unilateral mastectomy on Monday and deal with this Cancer thing again if it is ( BS thought these findings in my right breast are all benign. but I am really worried and no much confidence --- it is my body, I take consequences if I make wrong decisions.) If you are in my situation, what will you decide? Any suggestions? Thank you.",

Hope there will be no more bad news from this pre-op so that my surgery will go as scheduled. Otherwise the whole plan has to be changed. Nobody asked me if I want to do bilataral or unilataral mastectomy before they schedule the suregery date. Only when I went in yesterday to talk with my BS and told him that I am struggling with the two options, he told me that \"well, if you are thinking of doing bilateral, then we maybe have to change the surgery date, because there will be no enough time on August 15 to finish a bilateral.\" I am so surprised to hear that: why nobody asked my opinion at all and just went ahead to schedule the surgery as unilateral. ... Thus, I asked him to order the MRI for me at the pre-op tests, I want to make sure that there is nothing going on in my right breast. If unfortunately they indeed find something in the right breast, then I will have to reschedule the surgery date and ask for a bilateral mastectomy.... I hope the X-ray and MRI will come clean.... Too much unknowns in this breast cancer. So stressful with every decision to make... ",
