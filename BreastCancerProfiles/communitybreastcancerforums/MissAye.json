I use a mild soap and thats it..because my skin doesnt like aloe vera (which most soaps have) This just started happening..I dont take anything with asprin...I dont even hardly drink soda and never drink coffee!!! It goes away for a day...and then it happens again but  BIGGER and more. And in more areas! My gums have been bleeding...all day....every day for about 7 months now...and I have  been bleeding easy for a while..but now its under my skin, I was not just asking if it was related to breast cancer, but I have been talking to you ladies in this forum. So I was wondering if any of you had ever had it. Period. Breast cancer related or not.",

It would be great to know that lump in my breast is just fatty tissue and  that all my other symptoms can be attributed to an autoimmune disease. It will be interseting if yet another test comes back normal. When I clearly am bleeding under the skin.....",

Like the top part pulls in upwards so that my nipple is actually facing upwards!! But its not goning \"in\" its just laying sideways.Nothing was seen on my ultrasound and two different doctors could feel a lump and suggested it was a cyst, but nothing on the ultrasound...My nipple didnt use to do this. So I am a bit leary. In a pickle lol. I live in Idaho. To be on medicaid you have to make less than $307 a month for coverage. I have a pretty good job for the area but No benefits. I've  been seriously thinking about going to the ER to get a breast MRI...but I dont know how I could accomplish that without acting completely crazy... Not knowing sucks. Its easier for me though because even though I am a bit worried nothing was on my Ultrasound.",

I guess that would be under the category trauma but is that still the same if its never happened before??? You know? I use to scratch my legs constantly because they always itch. Now all of a sudden I am getting petechiae....? Hmmm what other tests should I ask my doctor?",

I developed petechiae and my doctor said I needed to do a blood test because I also have bleeding gums and such. She said she would probably have to send me to a specialist. I guess I just didnt think to ask these questions at the doctor office..(happens often right) What kind of specialist? When will I get the results back. They drew blood yesterday..Also if they dont call you, then your chances are that your test results are fine right? Anyone with experience please let me know.  Log in to post a reply",

Okay.....So  my breast is almost a cup size bigger now. My nipple is almost purple...So  dark..and My other one is pink..I just feels so much more firm than my other breast. Which is Probably why it hurts! I'm curious if anyone else had this issue with there nipple...Guess I'll post it as a question..I know you're scared.

Maybe some people don't know what to say...they can't handle it, you are fighting and being strong...some people cant.
