Something is still there, but it appears to be decreasing in size. The surgeon said that the mammogram was normal except for this area that appears to be an abscess. I started antibiotics on Thursday, so maybe it is a blocked and infected duct that is beginning to resolve. There is also a lot less pain than there was last week. She did say that if there was still something there she would biopsy it, so that is still on the table. I just want to let you all know what blessed angels you have been for me in the last 24 hours. I realize that this situation isn't over yet, but your love and light has held me up when things looked so very dark. Thank you. I wish each of you grace and goodness and wellness. With respect and warmth, JocelynÂ  Log in to post a reply",
