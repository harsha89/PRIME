A little about me: 35 years old, Wife, and Mom of two-ages 9 and 10. I found out I had BC 10/24/16; I finished my chemo 2/21/17; I am triple positive; I will receive Herceptin every 3 weeks until November; I elected bilateral mastectomy with implants.  ",

Is this for a specific surgery, or do all mastectomy surgeries get it? I feel like I should know everything that they are doing to me on surgery day. Also the pre-op nurse said I should be just fine sleeping in bed with pillows and not needing a recliner. What are your opinions on sleeping? Also they told me If I have dogs to have minimal contact with them and no sleeping with me or being in my lap. This to me will be hard. My senior dog sleeps with me and is with me like a 3rd leg. I have plans on my young dog to spend a few weeks with a neighbor, she is just to hyper.",

At the time of mastectomy I had 300cc put in my TE's. When I went for my 1 month post op we did a fill of 65cc. They said this is likely all I will need. I go back in 3 weeks to follow up. If we still like the way things are going then we will schedule my exchange surgery. So hoping I get my implants in a few months. Sleeping with the TE's has gotten much easier. I'm still not completely flat but pretty close. I will be so glad to have them out though, they are not the most comfortable things that's for sure.",

My surgery went great, I was in the hospital only 1 day. Coming home was rough, but now I have my pain under control. I am emptying my drains every 8 hours and I feel like I am not getting much. I have 4 tubes. Tubes 1 and 3 rarely have more than 5 cc per dump. Tubes 2 and 4 I can dump any amount from 7.5 cc to 14 cc this evening. Do I add the total cc dumped for the day, Is that how they gage the amount coming out? I think I worked up the surgery and recovery in my mind way more than I should have. Yes I am uncomfortable and yes I hurt but not what I was think it would be like. I go for my follow up on my reconstruction doctor on Thursday. She told me she was able to fill 300 cc in both TE. I look so awkward, I know the end result will be nice but for now it just looks so weird. She said she won't do another fill until about 4 weeks out from surgery. I've been able to shower every day since surgery which is nice. But my limitations are driving me crazy. I can't bend over, lean over, and I can't reach for things. Relying on ;someone 24-7 is tough. I am so glad this phase is over!!",

I will go every 3 weeks with the first 6 treatments being the \"worse\" and then the remainder of the year after that will be still every 3 weeks but just the one chemo drug (not 4 like my first 6 will be). You ladies seem like you know exactly what y'all are talking about. I am still in a cloud. I know I'm stage 2, high grade, and 2.3cm. I tried reading through my Path report but didn't see the actual grade listed. XOXOXOXO Shannon",

Tomorrow is infusion number 2 and I am so anxious and nervous. I guess mainly due to how my body responded last time. Those of you that have had a couple rounds already, did your side effects get worse? My hair has fallen out around the front part of my crown, so I just decided to shave it. I have been fine but I have some family members that are not handling it well (me with no hair). Any advice on how to make future infusions easier?  Thanks, Shannon",
