Personally, I didn't want anything in my breasts that made them feel different. So I had no problem saying yea let's take it out. Mine turned out to be IDC, that had been missed on a Mammo because of the proximity to the chest wall. Glad I had the MRI to get a better look.  Bean, I am in your shoes, I had to have a bone scan because of the findings on my MRI. I never want to have to do another again! I am waiting on those results, hopefully Monday. In the mean time, at first I was a nervous wreck, but now, I am accepting the possiblities that my treatment will include something to help it.

Well the lump did not show up, but 3 areas of concern did. I was set up to have those sites biospied, 2 were b9 and one was DCIS. But they still did not know what the larger lump was. Since it was movable, they figured it was just a fibroadenoma. The BS I was sent to see, also thought this,  but the senior partner was not so sure. I was sent for an MRI and they preformed a second biospy on the lump itself, which turned out to be IDC. I will pray you don't have the same results I did, but the thing I am trying to say, is if the Mammo doesn't show it, don't stop there. you need to know for your peace of mind. Good Luck!",

They did two spots on my right and one on my left breast. The biospy itself when good, so the doctor tells me. They got the material they needed. However, when they did the after shot Mammograms, I had a black out spell. I felt it coming enough that I asked to sit a moment. The next thing I know I was in a bed laying down. They said said I was ash grey, and looking at them but not responding. I just remember saying not I didn't feel right when asked, before blacking out. It concerned me enough to ask about it. They told me it can be a normal reaction to the stress. As if that complication was not enough, one site on my right side, near where I felt the original lump would not stop bleeding. They had to finally use surgical glue to close it up. Now today, I am swollen and bruised, which they told me is to be expected since I had some after issues going on. If it still looks and feels as bad tomorrow i have to go back to make sure there is no hemotoma.  I should get my results on Feb. 11th. If the right side comes back bad, the doctor told me without a doubt, he will do a complete mastectomy on that side, since there was more than one issue on that side. The left, if bad, will just be a lumpectomy. But he did say it was very rare for someone my age to have three sperate areas with cancer, at least in both breasts.
