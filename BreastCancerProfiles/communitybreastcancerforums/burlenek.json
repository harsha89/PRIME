Physical therapy didn't help much. Does anyone have these symptoms?  My rad onc denies that it is from the radiation therapy, but I never had these symptoms before.",

However, we are now required to do telemetry, and I just cannot seem to learn to read EKG's. I am at the point where I am going to get documentation from my oncologist for a reasonable accommodation to be placed in another position because of the lingering chemo brain. It is embarrassing to admit that I just can't get a new concept, and my boss looks at me as if I am crazy. Just remember, if chemo brain continues to be a real problem, as cancer survivors, we are covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I have asked my boss point blank if he will fire me if I can't learn this new very complicated concept, and he just smiled. I am prepared to do what it takes to keep my job and perform as well as I can. We put ourselves through hell with cancer treatment, survived, and then have to deal with the consequences. Thankfully, this problem is recognized as a true diagnosis now.",
