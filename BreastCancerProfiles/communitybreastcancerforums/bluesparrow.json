    "Content": "bluesparrow wrote: Hey everyone! I'm a 25 year old woman from Denmark who started getting a whole mess of symptoms, starting Thursday 4th and I'm super concerned about especially Inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's Disease (which I know are rare, especially in young people, but I still can't help but worry). So on the 4th, I noticed a little hard lump on the outside of my left breast. I had my mother feel at it, and after she did, it became extremely painful. Thursday and Friday, it was so sore I thought I had severely pulled a muscle in my arm (cause I had been doing a lot of heavy lifting the day before) and ended up not being able to raise my arm, had to put ice on it etc. On Saturday, I realized the pain was not in my muscles, but came from the lump I'd first discovered. Furthermore, I now had another hard area on top of my breast, and the skin on those two spots were turning red. A bit of yellow pus came from my nipple. So I went to the emergency room, worried what might be wrong with me. They told me I had an elevated infection count but my blood tests were otherwise normal. The doctor had a feel and thought it might be an abscess/mastitis (despite me never having had children), so he sent me home and told me to see my own doctor. On Monday the 8th, I went. She prescribed me antibiotics (Dicloxacillin Actavis 500 mg) for infection and told me to try that first. The pills have been super hard on me, making me pretty sick, but I've been taking them as prescribed from Monday and until today, a week later. Tomorrow, the pill bottle will be empty. The redness is all gone and the pain is all gone. There's only a faint hint of tenderness when I feel at my breast. Which is good, but the problem is now that I've gotten more lumps. 4 of them in total, in a zigzag-like pattern from my armpit towards my nipple, as well as a hardened area near the nipple. My armpit lymph node is swollen and tender. And two days ago, my nipple started getting flaky and dry and itched like CRAZY. I didn't scratch it, but put some lotion on it but it continues to be very sensitive and became itchy and flaky again after my shower. Even wearing a shirt is uncomfortable. I have naturally inverted nipples, so I've seen no changes there, and there are no discolorations or bleeding. I'm going back to my doctor on Wednesday for her opinion and possibly for a referral to a specialist, but these recent symptoms are really concerning me. It's so confusing! Everything happened extremely fast. Redness and new lumps would appear literally overnight. (Can cancer happen that fast?) The pain and redness is all gone, but the lumps haven't shrunk in the slightest and now my nipple is being weird too, which is what makes me so concerned it could be Paget's. Can Paget's present as infection/lumps FIRST before nipple changes? I know one of the symptoms is an eczema-like rash that comes and goes and back in November, my left nipple was extremely itchy and flaky as well, but it came alongside a rash on the inside of my elbow, so I figured I was simply allergic to my washing powder. How serious is Paget's disease and inflammatory breast cancer? I've been such a nervous wreck since last week and it would be so nice to hear from someone with similar experiences.
