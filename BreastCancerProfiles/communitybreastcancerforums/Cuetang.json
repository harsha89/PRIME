You're probably going through one of the worse parts of it now. I was diagnosed this January at age 33 and read a lot of things about cancers being more aggressive in younger women, yadda yadda. Bottom line is that there are so many factors that play into whether you will have chemo or not (i.e. type of tumor such as the triple negative that is more receptive to chemo, aggressiveness of the tumor, size, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, etc.) and that would be the oncologist's call. How big was your tumor? Do you know the hormone receptors of your tumor (ER PR Her-2)? I'm one example of someone that got two medical oncologist opinions and a radiological oncologist opinion and did not end up with chemo or radiation. Don't hesitate to see a second opinion with another surgeon. While cancer is urgent, it can wait for another opinion as well. I actually was happier with my second opinion doctor, who made me do things like get an MRI, talk to plastic surgeons about reconstruction options, and an oncologist. I wasn't part of an NCI cancer center, but essentially my breast surgeon built that similar team around me. Mentally, I'm not going to lie, this won't be easy. However, you'll find out that you are so much stronger than you ever thought you were in this process. Don't hesitate to lean on family and friends during this time and if they offer help, take it. There also a group, Young Survival Coalition (YSC) that has their boards and meet ups for those under 40 diagnosed with BC (I just went to a happy hour yesterday). Additionally, feel free to join in the IDC forum, \"2013 Sister Warriors\", which includes us diagnosed this year with IDC. You'll see all different favors of treatments that we've gone through with our respective cancers.",

This is a real \"hurry up and wait\" thing, and I agree it's nerve wracking and frustrating. You are truly in one of the worse parts of BC, right after diagnosis, and before a treatment plan is set. For me, all I had was the ultrasound and MRI and the typical blood tests before any operation. Unless an oncologist or the breast surgeon recommends actions such as neo adjuvant chemotherapy, you probably won't know your final treatment plan until the surgery pathology results come back. That's where I am now. My oncologist was waiting for my surgery pathology and Oncotype results first. If you are going for a mastectomy, meeting with the plastic surgeon is a great thing because you will find out all the reconstruction options. After you have decided that, then the two surgeon offices can coordinate their times for a surgery date. Also don't be afraid to ask for second opinions during this process as well. Kayezzy66-- your husband did a great thing there. :). Tell him to keep finding distractions for you! Remember, it isn't cancer unless the report tells you it is.

In my case, I am a worrywart and I knew that the bilateral mastectomy was the way I wanted to go.  I wasn't strongly for or against breastfeeding and figured if I lost sensation in one side, the other side wouldn't matter as much.  Also, I chose the DIEP reconstruction (which could only be done once), so I might as well have strived for symmetry at the same time.

Others just want the darn breasts gone. I fell into the latter category because I knew I would have major anxiety issues going through the what-ifs scenario in the future. I had a nipple and skin sparing bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction in March. Because my reconstruction used my own tummy tissue, I woke up to breasts that looked like my own, just shaped slightly differently. Good luck with your final decision and keep that chin up! :)",

Nicolegug --  good luck on your visits, and good for you for going for that second opinion!  The bilateral MRI will be alright, be prepared to hold that \"superman\" position for a bit of time!  Hang in there.  (hugs).",

Pattysmiles -- it might be good to check and see if your health insurance will cover the oncotype.  I was fortunate enough to deal with my health insurance's nurse navigator assigned to me and she clearly outlined the conditions that an oncotype would be covered in my case.  For me, I have an Aetna HMO and they won't pay for it if I have any positive nodes since that to them would mean chemo for me.  The oncotype company called and said that I will have results 7-10 days after they receive the \"specimen\".  I'm so with you ....this \"hurry up and wait\" mode royally sucks!  2girls-2spaniels -- great news! ",

Hang in there, you will feel so much better after surgery (I know, so weird right considering they are big surgeries and all). 9 days post op, I'm in a better place than the days before surgery (despite all the surgery incisions and the pesky last drain). Mamasixtaz-- I had the DIEP flap surgery and ended up being at least 12 hours. Hilarious part of things was that they stuck a big butt cushion on my rear end to account for the long surgery time. I was also told 4-5 days in the hospital but ended up staying 3. Sounds like you have a great support system and you'll totally rock the surgery! :) Shari-- You're definitely not being silly, BC really messes with all of our minds. We just have to know that we did all the research that we could do and gave the cancer all we had. After surgery, you'll feel so much better, for sure!",

I find that I wake up now in the mornings more than a little sweaty (my heater is set at my normal temperature) and I don't ever remember this happening before my surgery. I've been combing the boards and see some women report some night sweats after their mastectomy. I'm not having hot flashes and nowhere near being menopausal yet. Just curious....just find it kinda meh to feel sticky every morning I wake up....",

      "Content": "Mar 26, 2013 12:43PM - edited Mar 26, 2013 12:45PM by Cuetang Thanks ladies for the input on the night sweats!  I haven't started any treatment plans or chemo, and I'm 33, so having night sweats all of a sudden was really making me wonder about things.  It really must be the trauma of having such a huge surgery that my body doesn't like even though I *so far* have been feeling pretty decent.  Isn't it amazing how we don't think about things like a nice shower or a hair wash the way we do until after our surgeries?  Maureen -- you mom is definitely your angel and with you every step of the way.  I'm glad you have such great memories that you can smile upon with her. Thankful2day -- you'll feel awesome after your drains get pulled today!  I had a weird day about 4 days after my surgery where one drain was consistently doing about 12 a day, then that one day it did 50!  I was so worried, but thank goodness I didn't see my PS until 2 days later, where it went back down to about 8-10 each day for 2 days.  He thought something may have been stuck and just \"unstuck\" that day, resulting in the high number. LKSHER-- I agree with about the fear of mets.  It is like a \"cancer radio\" where you can tone it down but never really turn it off.  In time, we will all learn our own ways on how to tune things out for a while, some of us better than others.  I'm one of those that is still trying to figure out ways on trying not to overanalyze my body (so hard!), but hopefully as others have said, as time goes on that radio will be quieter and blend in with the rest of the noises in the background.  Foreverchanged72612-- good news that you only had to do the SNB and no surprises!  *happy dance*  Best wishes to the rest of the March surgery sisters!! ",

Jrose14 and kap -- I was lucky to not experience it this time around (probably because I can't feel anything lol), but when I had my thyroidectomy in the fall, I couldn't stand ANYTHING touching the incision line or the skin around it.  It's the nerves going wacky, and it's super duper annoying.  At some point, hopefully it goes away!  I don't have full range of motion either kap, but am trying to do my exercises that the doctor and the PT (which I saw before surgery only) recommended.  Hopefully it gets better soon.  If not, I'm thinking about booking some PT sessions. ",
