I had to stop reading here in order to sleep because I was not only worrying about myself, but everyone else as well! You're all such great ladies and I truly appreciate what you all have to say. On to today. I had an ultrasound today for a pea sized nodule next to my nipple, about 5 o'clock. The doc who looked at the ultrasound said it 'looked' like a blocked duct, but was going to have another breast doctor look at it because it didn't appear to be clean fluid. What does that mean? She also sent me for a mammo, my first and what an intro, and then I was cut loose. I should be getting results back in about a week - they said because this was a diagnostic exam the results would come back a bit faster. So, while I don't feel totally at ease, I do feel somewhat better. I am assuming that if something obviously bad showed up on the ultrasound the doctor would have said something. However, I'm wondering why a mammogram would have been ordered when an ultrasound is supposed to show more. Any thoughts? Ann Log in to post a reply",

I had my annual on Weds., which I needed because a. I needed to have my annual anyway and b. I could not get any tests ordered without going to see my practitioner. She found the lump, no problem and didn't say much about it except to order an ultrasound and tell me not to wait. My ultrasound is scheduled for this coming Weds. and I am at once optimistic, worried, terrified. How did you all keep from getting ahead of yourselves? I don't have good feelings about this at all. Perhaps I am over reacting, but I can't sleep, I'm stressed out, and for once, I'm ready to skip the weekend and get to Weds. already. I'm trying to do one day at a time, and really, I do fine until bedtime. Then all bets are off. Seriously, I have to work, I have homework (I'm in school), and if I could, I would take a sleeping pill - 3 hours of sleep per day is not enough to function on and there isn't enough coffee in Starbuck's to sustain this sort of sleep deprivation. Any thoughts? Any advice? Thank so much, Ann Log in to post a reply",
