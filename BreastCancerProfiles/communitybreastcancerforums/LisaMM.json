      "Content": "Feb 4, 2013 10:49PM - edited Feb 4, 2013 10:51PM by LisaMM My onco told me that with this regimen I will lose my hair. I bought a wig on Friday in anticipation & I'm so glad I did. It is making me feel a little less stressed about my hair. The process of finding one went much better than I anticipated also, I thought it would make me cry (again), but the place I went to was very supportive & knowledgable. I am a full time RN & have been anxious about my impending hair loss. Having my wig already makes me feel a little more confident about it all, as I don't think I'm much of a scarf/hat person. So much anxiety is involved with all if this! I have found a lot of comfort in these forums though!",

The pirt will be sore for just a little while, but you will come to appreciate it as time goes! I've been told by many thst hair will start to thin around days 15-20, then really come out faster after 2nd dose. I plan to cut my hair next week closer to the length of my wig, then when it really starts coming out I'm planning on buzzing it down to about an inch. I've seen other posts saying that the 1 inch cut is more comfortable than the shaving if all of the hair hasn't fallen out.",

I think we're all a ball of nerves on fire when we're starting out, that's how I felt! ",

I was wondering if anyone has used pure lanolin with any success in keeping your skin from falling off.  I've been reading your posts & racking my brain (what's left of it) & have been contemplating using this.  I used it when I was breastfeeding my kids & it literally kept my nipples from falling off then, so it made me wonder.",
