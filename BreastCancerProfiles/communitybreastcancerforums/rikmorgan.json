I am not diagnosed yet but I found a lump went to the doctor she found one i did not feel and sent for mammo and ultrasound. I have fibro and dense breadt which does not make easy. They found it and it is a tumor the paper work said but only possibly begnin not definite. So they planned to watch every 6 months. And theny appt. Earlier this week she found a new lump next to the old one and there is one in armpit I felt so back I go again. Just got the appt for that yesterday won't be til November 14 and I have to sit and worry til then. I also noticed that same breast has grown another cup size. It can barely fit in my bra now. I started crying when I found that. I am only 37. My aunt nreast cancer. My great grandmother breast cancet and tumor in brian and she died. My grandmother 5 tumors spread out and she died 6 months after finding them. Now just this year my sister, 44, was diagnosed with breast cancer. So you can see my fears mounting up in me. And I have this weakness, downright exhausted and domt like playing the waiting game.. I hope all goes well for you and praying for that . ",

Have been going for mammogram and ultrasound since original post. Now the bummer. New area, complex and have to have biopsy! Scared, worried and had a really worried feeling about it before the appointment, like this was the year. Like something was not right. Any words of advice or concerns or I don't know anything, lol. Funny thing, they have always been concerned with the other breast rather than the one they say has a new complex area!",

Have heavy family history of breast cancer and just cancer. They had their cincerns as well so they sent me for mammo and ultrasound, i was 36 at the time. Tjey ciuld not say if it definitely was or wasnt cancer so for the last year i have been going to mammos and ultrasound every 6 months. Well while i was going through this my sister, 44, went as well with concerns and was diagnosed with breast cancer. Well made another appt that I had Â yesterday and they found a new lump right next to the other so again for the third time in a year I am back to mammo and ultrasound and scared with.Also have one in my armpit.

      "Content": "rikmorgan wrote: So I am having a biopsy today, have not gotten support yet as i was hoping that i would, but anyway really scared. Have very dense and cystic breast. Have cancer in the family: great grandmother- died breast cancer, grandmother-died 5 tumors multiply places, aunt-breast cancer survivor, sister-breast cancer survivor. And they are the ones that i know of, dont know my father or his family and their history. Anyway, have been having mammograms and ultrasounds for the last 4 years now. First two was twice a year and then went to once a year. My sister was only 45 when it was discovered, i am 40 now. This time the doctor came in and said, her words exactly, \"You have a complicated area, we need to biopsy, this is a new area\", argh, I mention it this way, because after someone else commenting and the research i have seen myself, the doctor did NOT say cyst, she did NOT say complex, so i just watned to make that clear, lol, i already went in this year thinking this is the year. Just felt different and was very concerned going in. What is strange, this is the opposite breast they have been watching for years. So i was not even prepared for that! I have had some things going on with breast through out the year as well, so again, argh!! Just am wanting some comfort right now, because i am scared at this point. Really scared. Thank you for anyone who might decide to respond, i really appreciate it and would like advice. Is this my year??????????????? Log in to post a reply",

My biopsy is in less than two hours, and then the waiting game, argh!!! i wanted to have someone to go with me, cause yes, this is the first time for a biopsy, another reason i worry, they have never felt the need to do so, but i do not have anyone to go with me. but if this is the start of a journey i need to get use to that anyway. I will post this evening on my experience!  Thank you again!",
