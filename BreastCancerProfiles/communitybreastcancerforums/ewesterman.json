Roxi and Kristy and others considering Halloween: I think we should get together and have one of us dress as a breast. Then two of us who are still baldies (okay, that means nearly all of us) could put a leash on the person dressed as a breast and go as two men walking abreast. Oh my, this reminds me, Kerry, that the sense of humor does return. We have all had times when we feel funnier than others, but once the sting and sorrow and pain of the idea of just taking care of yourself 24/7 for the next chemo zap goes away, I am finding my sense of humor returning. It all goes back to figuring out the new normal, Kerry, and I DO think we ought to weigh out drugs vs. not drugs vs surgeries etc., etc., but know that as human beings, we are so fecking (isn't that the way you spell it?) resilliant that we find ourselves again and go on. Cris, WOO HOO again. We are waiting or diving in to help. We want to hear how it went and see that pole dance if you're doing one. RanD, your son is adorable. As far as surgery and pain go, I have a very different read on it. I had a different experience at my mastectomy. They gave me some kind of pain medication in my IV bag and I was there over night, but went home early the next morning. I only had one breast removed (wish it was both at this point) but I never had to take anything more than tylenol or ibuprofen. I used ice a lot, a lot those first several days. Also, this is counterintuitive but the best advice my surgeon gave me was to get those arms (in my case, one arm) up above my head ASAP after surgery. Your body will want to \"protect\" your new \"injury\" but it is imperative to get that range of motion going as soon as you can -- even if it means hurting a bit. My surgeon sent her nurse the day after and had me stand up against the wall and creep my arm up above my head as far as I could go -- even though it hurt. My surgeon said it was better to hurt a little than to continue to \"protect\" as those first few days are key in terms of range of motion. In your case, it will be different as you are losing more nodes, but please, please ask your surgeon or the nurse about how to get yourself into movement as soon as possible. As far as pain meds, you know your tolerance and don't be a hero. Take what you need, but know that not everyone needs that and that the ice really helped me more than the meds. Roc, I sent you a song on your Facebook for good times and for bad. I am so sorry you've been feeling down, but I am behind so I am hoping you are feeling better now. As far as the sleeping meds go, do what you need to do. We are all in a place of what I think they call \"periodic depression.\" Though some of us are finishing chemo (only three more for some and YES, steroid suck, suck suck!) or going through rads or dealing with herceptin infusions, or even just dealing with waiting for those NOSEHAIRS and eyebrows and stuff, we are dancing in limbo...we had a battle plan...we got through and now we are on to next steps. It is NORMAL to feel down as Karin did or Roc or any of us, but we will bove through this stage as well then come out the other end stronger, wiser and maybe ready to appreciate the world even more than we did before. Kristy and Otter -- love, love,love finally seeing what you both look like. You are lovely women. Karin, hope your fever is long gone. Okay, on to manky. In our family, our younger son called his thumb (which he loved to suck), his manky. If he lost a dessert privilege, he inevitably would come back with a line like this -- \"I don't care if I don't get dessert, Mommy, because I've got my manky and it tastes like vanilla so I don't NEED dessert.\" So, I hear a different meaning for manky and I'm not sure I can buy in on that one yet. That's it for now. Managing my mom, my boys, my still-angry husband and the high holidays are doing me in...thank goodness for work. Ciao lovely women.",

Okay, so I have been not feeling like blogging or facebooking or even writing here. Why? Like most of you, I go back and forth of trying to find my \"new normal\" to being overwhelmed with next steps (looks like an oof for me...hoping for this year...could we all get together and do it at once? Maybe put our ovaries in an egg carton and sell them?) I am feeling really, really good physically. Back to working out regularly. Hair and brows and lashes continue to make new inroads as well as unwanted facial and leg hair. Still searching for nasal and pubic hair but that's too much information I am sure. Denver sounds good to me, but I'd go anywhere to catch up with you--even Tasmania. I am pulling for the girls still working through chemo...you are almost there. For those on herceptin (like me too, Jen) though we have a long, long way to go, the side effects are not like they are for rads and this is supposed to save our lives so we have to reframe how we look at this....all in our own time, though. As Adrienne will tell you, our autumn here has lately been fabtabulastic! The colors are amazing. Just went up to BC (not Breast Cancer but British Columbia) to spend a bit of time in Victoria...a late anniversary trip. We are doing better . . . seeing a therapist and trying to work through stuff. I am thinking of all of you. I will also try to get my holiday shopping done with you, Noelle. It's simple for me to do that. Remind me where your web site is....I love seeing many of you on Facebook and will continue checking in here, but I am trying to keep up with my so-called normal life and that is taking up lots of time. I hope we all have a fun Halloween. Adam is going to wear his regular clothes and post a sign that says, \"Nudist on strike.\" talk to you soon.",

First off, congrats to those who are finishing radiation, chemo (Gracie, you are almost there) and dealing with MUGA stuff. I have been spending more time on Facebook than here, but I miss seeing those of you who are NOT on Facebook. Jen, thanks for doing the holiday card list. Hanukka falls the same time as Christmas this year which is good and bad -- good because it gives me more time to prepare and bad because I like to have them separate so we invite friends to our house then we go to them at Christmas. Peach fuzz. Yes. Heart palpatations. Never had them. Have them now. I did an echocardiogram instead of a MUGA. I also did an EKG to check out tha palpatations. All seems normal. Shingles? Maybe coming back but I am PRAYING they don't. Work? Working too much; too hard; too long and missing connecting with you more often. I have been the interim director of the WEA -- the Washington Education Association -- more than 80,000 members and a wild election season where we worked very hard to get our current governor r-elected. Needless to say . . . I am very ready to be done with this interim period which has lasted for nine months now. Ovary surgery? December 17th. I am popping them out and serving them up to the cancer gods as a delicacy. Hope they like them. This buys me half the time on tamoxafin -- two and a half years instead of five then I'll be able to switch to femara (probably spelling that wrong). Chemotherapy pushed me into menopause but borderline. My theory is pop OUT the ovaries to avoid ovarian cancer as breast cancer is related. Bad news? I have to get my first colonoscopy (most people don't have to do that until 50) since a first cousin died of colon cancer at 54. Blech. Anyone done that? My husband did recently and as I told someone who asked, \"The actual procedure was no big deal -- it was all the crap he had to go through to get there.\" Then I realized what I said. I love unintentional puns. BTW, hubby and I are doing much better. He was diagnosed with ADD and that explains a lot. We are dealing with coping strategies. I also seem to be having a wandering thyroid. More on that when I get more details. I don't really know what that means. Las Vegas in the spring? Yes. Farmhouse with bringing own chair? Yes. Denver for a conference? Yes. Skype? I am a technodweeb but I supposed I could try. Noelle, please, once more -- so sorry, send me your shop's website. I will be curious to hear what's up with your heart at the next test. I hope the first one was a fluke. Otter, you are an amazing source of information and a calming voice. I am hoping your father is better. Jean, congrats on finishing radiation. Jen, I have to get a hair photo out so we can compare and contrast, my dear hercepto-twin. Thanks again for organizing the card deal. Mary, I love seeing your stuff on Facebook. Love the photos. Kerry, I will swap our winter for your summer anytime. When winter sets in, come to Seattle and we'll tour you around. Kristy, I am so sorry you had to endure the fecking pokes! Ridiculous Rock, your book signing looked really fun. Is your book available on amazon? Gracie, hope your bones feel better. You're almost there. Karin, I like hearing your voice too...hope your school year is going well and that your students are keeping you going. Cristine, I also just read and try to catch up. It's hard to keep up with these fabulous women. Anyone here from Angelsabove us lately?",

They are being SUPER careful with us and we want that even though it sucks. Secondly, it is RIGHT and GOOD and CORRECT to get all of those checkups because they will help us live for a long, long time although I am intrigued and jazzed about the woman you mentioned who blew off checkups and went 10 years from cancer to cancer. Third, just returned from a Susan G. Komen event. Our son, Adam, raised the most $$ of kids last year for the Race for the Cure by competing with me on my blog. He was asked to make a presentation tonight. While I sooooo appreciate what they do and support the cause and raise money, I have to say that it creeped me out a tiny bit. Glad to be home. Fourth, I had a breast MRI last week-- the one where they poked the hell out of my arm even though I have a port and I haven't heard a thing so I am thinking no news is good news.

We laugh easily but sometimes not often enough. Does that sound like you? Okay, I made it up but happy birthday anyway. Packing for skiing. My intention is to be on top of a hill on the one-year anniversary of my 800-foot fall. It's going to happen. It's going to happen in Colorado -- my home -- and it's going to be great. I am sending hugs to those going through particularly rough times right now. I am glad you went to the funeral of your nephew -- it is good to witness. And I am thinking of you, Randie, and not sending a card this week cause I'll be gone. Will try to check in. Love you all.",

Glad your dad was in there with you. Love you. Jen, I, too, get echos but not because I am a needle wimp (I am) but because they both do the same thing and the echo is less intrusive. I am assuming your heart is still ticking and we can continue our herceptin together. Like Noelle, I have lost count. I think of you all the time, Noelle, when I use your lotion which is all the time. What a good way to stay present in my mind.

My lumperversary was last weekend...when I first found it. All my other cancerverseries coming up. Like many of you, I am of many minds on whether to spit, scream, celebrate, reflect, cry, etc.  Karin, you look GOOOOOOOOOOD. You are inspiring me to think about cutting my unruly hair, but not yet. Gracie, Karli is on my mind. I am so sorry she is having to endure this. Thank goodness you are in her life. Karin, loved what you did with our avatars. Makes me realize time to put a different one up.  Rock, I love your posts whether you think they are appropriate or not. Mary, hope you are vacationing well. Julie, Robin, Kristy, Linda, good to see your posts....I am so tired becase I just worked too many hours so I have to stop but I love hearing you all chatter... BTW, am training my replacement because I get to return to my REAL job...the one I gave up a year ago to be interim director. Now, I get to go back to my real job, real work. It's about time.  Love you all so much. Am finally thinking it's time to lose weight seriously. Moving those workups up a bit. Now, I have to eat less. :) Ciao.",

I am sad, too, about crappy X-rays and bittersweet retirements and the fact that you still have ONE more herceptin to go even though you have one down...I am sad about Callum and sad that a lot of what we talked about this week is yuk. I am sad, Julie, that you are going through all of the family stuff and I am sad this fine group of women has to put up with ANY of this crap. I love each of you and though I am checking in less often, it is because I am working longer hours but I like that as I feel stronger. I have a friend who is going through diagnosis/treatment ideas. They got her whole lump during her needle biopsy (how cool is that?) so she may need very little in terms of treatment. Anyway, I love you all and I am thinking of you and I am so honored you allowed me to be a part of this group. When I think a year has gone by, I am starting to know that there is life after diagnosis and after treatment...so, let's get all of us through treatment and MOVE ON.

Jen, please let us know immediately if you hear anything. SHIT. This is so unfair and I know the world is not fair, but this is outlandish. Have got up on many days posting. I miss you all and it's not that I am posting less to \"get away.\" It's simply that life is back so full time. I Facebook less; I definitely blog less and I am missing all of it, but between work and feeling so much more able to deal with the world, I don't take enough time here at the computer. It is 7:55 on a Saturday morning and I am just about ready to wake up my sister-in-law to go with Dottie (remember Dottie, my fantastic cancer bully friend?) to a fancy shop across the water (not your direction Adrienne or I would hook up) but across Lake Washington to be outfitted for the Gilda's Club Fashion Show April 28. My friend who coerced me into appearing in this Surviving with Style fundraiser just died a couple of weeks ago in Morocco. She was the two time bc survivor and had a throat cancer as well. She was in her mid-70's and a fantastic woman who helped found the Gilda's Club here in Seattle. Well, she died, they believe, in kind of a fluke situation. Her body is back in this country now. All the more reason to raise more money for Gilda's Club. Rock, hope the Crush goes well. I think of each of you every day and I am going to spend all day thinking of Jackie. A friend was diagnosed a couple of weeks back and she has surgery on Monday. Things look good for her as they think they got the entire lump at the biopsy (ever heard about that happening?)...They will take a bit more and check a node. Randie, you amaze me. The rest of you...happy retirement; yea on negative results; I love the shaving cream song...I sang it as I read it; loved the haircut story -- I believe that is a rite of passage among most little girls but since I have boys, we never had to deal with it. My littler boy is going on TV next week to encourage people to joing the Susan G. Komen walk (sorry); Spring is here. My allergies are back and pounding and I am happy about that as last year, I had no allergies (no real immune system? hmmmm). I could blah, blah forever but it'll bore you. Many of you commented on the celebrate vs. mark cancerversary....for me, it is a celebration of being bc-free for a year as well as a marking of when my life changed. Reading from the Torah was pretty powerful last Saturday. Our rabbi had other survivors flank me and two were very close friends (one who has chronic stage four mestatized bc in her lung) and we got to say a pretty cool blessing about getting through a very difficult journey. We all know the journey is continuous, but it's nice once in a while to stop at a milepost and reflect. Love you all. I am not trying to blow you off in any way...just trying to figure out how to check in more often without taking away from other stuff too. Happy Easter to each of you. May the day be full of springtime, color, fun bunnies, miracles and family.",

My port isn't all the way healed from the actual surgery so I'll go check it out today to make sure we are good to go. What blows me away, robink, is that I was diagnosed just two months ago today. We have learned so much in such a short time.

My friend, Susan, was behind them while they were trying to fix it and she was making so not very appropriate sign which made me laugh which made her laugh which made me laugh harder which made her snort . . .

One thing that puzzles me greatly -- seems like some of you are doing lots of bloodcount checks along the way.

Everything is scary. Hope the eye thing was a one time only issue. Also, I am right behind you. I do A/C #4 on 3rd of July then on to Heceptin/Taxol so I want to hear more from you ...RobinK..your last chemo is my halfway. I will be celebrating for you and expecting you to jump in when I finish and celebrate with me. Congrats. The rest of you who are talking about the feelings of freaking out about chemo...I am so there as well. Here is one thing that I think I told you about...maybe not, maybe it was on my blog, but this has really, really, really made a difference for me even thought I laughed it off. My friend, Janet, is a first grade teacher. She told me I need \"a visual\" because we talked about how 8 rounds seemed like a zillion and how it could get \"drawn out\" due to all the blood stuff so I couldn't count on an \"end date.\" She kept saying, \"YOU NEED A VISUAL.\" She brought me 24 colored blocks...they are called math manipulatives for those of you who are around elementary kids. They hook together. They are plastic and different colors. We decided to use 24. 24 is divisible  (divisable?? can I spell? do I have a degree or two in journalism? do we care?) by so many numbers -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12. We said each of my 8 treatments were three blocks because we knew if these chemo treatments kicked my ass they would have to spread them over a longer time and we could make them one block or two blocks or whatever. We built a tower (this was already into the first round so we took three off)...We had one tower with 21 and one with three. The second treatment, we had 18 and 6. I sooo dreaded number three because at least at number two I was twenty-five percent done. But this is where the visual really kicked in. After chemo number three, not only did I add three more to make my little tower nine, but my big tower got shorter from 18 to 15. That third chemo seemed so insignificant, but adding to one tower while lowering the other did some kind of major psychological boost...now, my tower has 9 and 15 which still means I have five, but this week when I finish that fricking A/C, my towers will each have 12 and I will truly feel and be half way. But when the next one comes....the first taxol one...hopefully just two weeks after, my done tower will grown higher and my what I have left tower will grow smaller. Ladies (and Wayne -- did you ever come back on?), for some reason, that is making a difference. We have an L-shaped house and I have those towers in our bedroom window. Sometimes when I am sitting on my deck I can see the towers and I get this subtle message that I am moving forward. I will stop raving about this now, but it has seriously helped me. That third one really was hard for me, but the tower thing helped me see it was another foot forward (or another three blocks anyway). Linda, biotene has helped me and salt water helped me with a few minor mouth sores. Okay, on to vacation. We were in a houseboat with two other families on Lake Roosevelt in north eastern Washington. No malls. No restaurants. No stores. Just pristine beauty and two other families who allowed me to just be. When I felt like it, I would do a load of dishes. All the rest of the time, I just relaxed. It was the nicest gift anyone has ever given me -- the gift of being.  My toughest days begin the Tuesday AFTER chemo and has lasted all the way to the following Sunday at worst but are really bad on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and beyond... When on a houseboat in pristine fresh air and perfect weather, one can handle headaches much nicer. We were with seven kids ages 11-15 and for two days with 10 kids up to 17, but I could get away from noise and listen far enough away to their late-night card games and muffled giggling and enjoy because I was not in the thick of it. The stars....women, we have to take a trip to the stars one time just to remember our skies before our cities blotted those stars...wow....the stars were so calming. Sanitary? I think not. It was gourmet camping, but for being at days after chemo, I was slightly worried I would die but I \"showered\" by swimming in the 60-degree lake water. I innertubed (worried the whole time about bouncing on my port). I hiked an hour with the adults one day up a hill that knocked me dead, but they waited and were so kind. My 11-year-old caught his first-ever fish -- a wally which our friend prepared as a fabulous delicacy. We went with foodies so the food was organic, healthy, delicious and wolfed down by the teens as well as the rest of us. One day, my dh, Marty, and our friend, Todd, took the little speedboat into the marina and brought back 10 chocolate soft serve ice creams. I cried once (getting that I hate that I am so out of it feeling while feeling so blessed to be with such kind people)...now when I cry, I have few eyelashes so I can either own up to crying or blame the eyelashes....very cool excuse. Bottom line? I was lucky. I have the next two weeks off from work as our building is closed. I have one management meeting one day, but other than that, I am a free woman which makes me hope to get through the last A/C before the next four rounds. Remember, women, they said it would suck and it does. The survivors say this is how it is and it is. It's just that until we experience, we don't believe it.  One more observation then I will let you all go....for those who are still reading ... Remember when you were preganant (for those who were...and for those who were not, stay with me for a minute) when because your condition was so public, perfect strangers would come up to you and tell you their birth stories (while patting your belly? Oy!) ... but remember how so many shared their horror stories? You thought, hey....keep it to yourself. But they didn't. Now, those of us who  are parading around bald or hatted with our baldness showing....we, too, are very, very public cancer patients. (I never know to say cancer survivor, cancer victim....I hate that one) but cancer somethings....right? Okay, so, I am in the airport line with our 15-year-old today...he left for LA for six weeks -- bye bye, I will miss him, but that's another conversation . . . so we are in the line and a woman looks at me and says, \"It'll grow back honey. I had cancer in 1989 and look at my hair now (and she had lovely hair). And a woman RIGHT behind her said, \"Me too.\" I am here nineteen years later -- don't sweat the hair...it's nice to see you bald. We laughed at my LOPSIDED self as that is the LAST thing on my mind right now and I was wearing a tank top and it suddenly dawned on me that this is OPPOSITE the pregnant deal ---- the survivors are surviving and living and traveling through slow airport lines and telling me how long they've been around after. The sadder stories . . . the ones who died . . . they are, sadly, gone. They are not standing in an airport line to say, \"I didn't make it.\" or... \"That chemo wasn't worth it.\" They are gone, but we do not have to deal with their stories as the success stories are STANDING their sharing. Women....buck up. We are going to get through this and we are going to do it with flying colors as some of us already have. We will whine and cry and be sick and we will feel so sorry for ourselves and we are alllowed to do that and we will share that crappy stuff like every time I go to the bathroom now for a BM, I bleed and I HATE that, but we will get through and we will survive because in our long lives, this is a short time. And that will be us in 19 and 29 years telling someone, \"Don't sweat the hair, honey. You'll get through.\" WE WILL GET THROUGH. I have FIVE more of these rounds, but after Thursday I will be HALFWAY. Each of us will encourage one another as we have done so far and we will all get through ---stupid ports intact, cotton mouth, feeling like we have been run over, but we will get through.  MsKarin, I like your avitar as it really shows your face. I am going to try change mine as I've gotten a little more bald. I like your glasses. They are cool. I have to stop as most of you have already dropped into a deep sleep. Hey, I could post long posts and it would help us all with our sleep. ",

Other than those who go at 86 and three days instead of 86 and four days, I think we need to just trust our oncs...I asked mine today the difference between taxotere and taxol and he said they were very, very, very similar. His experience is HIS patients seem to respond better to taxol, but I am sure some of your oncs experience is that her or his patients respond better to taxotere. It is all made from Pacific yew trees so in the end we are going to the same source. love the vestal (taxol) virgin analogy from Otter. Jeano....are you back yet? The waterfalls were good and nice and cool, but not cold. Played cribbage with a friend and opened lots of little presents from friends along the way and ate truffles between the A and the C. Bloodcounts were still very strong though slightly down from last time (no prob...this is cummulative). I told the bloody nose cancer story to the nurses and my friend -- they loved it. Okay peeps...I am loopy and a tad tired from all those drugs they poured into me. For those of you who already started taxol, my onc told me to get gluto something at the health stor and to start taking it now in prep for taxol. I'll fill you in later. I am curious to know if any of you got the same advice. I am off to zzzz land for a while. Catch you later. ",

I wonder if swimming would help? Here is a good story for you all...though none will be as good as bloody kayaking. I went to yoga on Monday and demanded that we do a whole series of downward dog to plank to child pose....nice stretches. This is yoga for cancer (which is sort of like yoga for dummies, but I mean that in the nicest way and there is no way I'd be good in a regular yoga right now) Anyway, I demanded these stretches, of course, because usually  I am in there on the Monday after chemo where I am a total drip, but because I was on vacation this week, I was amazon cancer woman. So, the instructor says, \"We don't usually do full downward dog because of the weight baring...meaning half of your weight is on your hands....but I push forward and we all agree we want to go for it. We all love it, blah, blah, blah. That was Monday. This morning, my wrists were aching sore and I couldn't figure out why until, (ominous music here) the yoga...aaaargh. Perhaps everyone in the class is suffering because I insisted on doing weight baring yoga stretches. My wrists cannot, it turns out, support me at this time.  Robin, YIPEE. So does that mean you have four more or three more of taxol or of taxotere? Ciao. ",

I am feeling like my full body pain peaked yesterday and I am back to where it is ankle and wrist and manageable in some ways. I took lots of advil yesterday as well but refused the heavy stuff as I was worried that would be worse. The pain racked my entire body. What helped was watching Lars and the Real Girl then hot tubbing for a few minutes. The knock off crocs (called dawgs) feel good on my feet. Also started taeking fish oil and B complex vitamin. I am thinking today I will beg the mammogram people to just do ultrasound and leave my aching body without mor pinches. I skipped walking yesterday except for walking around an art fair because I hurt so much. I am going to see Sex in the City after the mammogram then will even try to head for yoga, but ouch. All I can say is...three more taxols, three more taxols. I forgot that the mountain gets steeper the higher we climb. Damn. I will be out of town this week starting tomorrow but will try to take my laptop and check in with you chickies.  Cristine, thanks for your thoughts. The pain is painful (really, I am not trying to be funny here). Okay, I'll check in later. Sable, I am glad you are feeling a bit better. I am as well. Let's keep checking in.

Chronic pain can really take it out of you. I feel like things are under control. I have learned a ton. I won't bore you with it as it will seem like a rehash of whining, but let it be known that I will not allow pain to get the best of me. Went to the regular doc today. Not CPS...just plain old tendinitis. Will get wrist braces tomorrow and will take ibu and other NSAIDs or maybe even not NSAIDs to keep them under control. Simple, eh? While I was there, we discovered I have edema so will get that under control. I also stopped in at the forbidden dentists because I thought I lost a crown but it was chemo brain and all was well plus the doc told me my mouth doesnt look like chemo mouth. So...bottom line?Although I am scared to think about taxol number two, next time I go armed with a lifetime of new lessons.  I am so sorry I have been so whiny and not at all responsive to what all was going on with many of you. Sometimes I feel like we're doing parallel play or parallel whine but it is also parallel support and parallel laughter and then I realize we really are interacting...just sometimes different ones of us are more present and I feel I was not present these last few days (okay, since last infusion)....so, please accept my apologies. Meanwhile, I appreciate your information, your diagnoses of my issues (really....they helped), your laughter and food thoughts and the fact that you are all there. Last thing . . . one day I will write an entire diatribe on \"cancer\" books, but the short of it is the one best book I recently read was Cancer Vixen. It's a graphic novel....it's really a good read. Love you. Thank you. I think I am back for real. Linda, hope all is well. The rest of you, it is the WEEKEND!!!!! Laila tov (good night in Hebrew). ",

Gracie, sorry about the long day. Mine ran from 9-4:30 so I just got home. On the kidney (Landon?)  My son, Adam, who is 11.5, has one kidney. He had a blockage either in the womb or at birth which is probably Landon's deal. We took out his non-functioning kidney at 5. Listen, Grace, tell you daughter the surgery is very, very, very easy. Tell her the docs do it all the time. Tell he the scare is during the surgery but Landon will be fine...very fine. We all have 200% of what we need. Landon's other kidney will go strong and well and right into an adult kidney as Adam's did. What he'll have to do is: no motorcycle riding; no jumping while horse back riding though regualr is oaky and nos wrestiling (as an organzied sprort in school). If he snowboards, suggest skiing instead. He will have to not drink lots of dark liquids as those are harder on kidneys so no coca cola now and less, less, less, coffee and red wine as he grows old ...no ibuprofen or other NSAIDS (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) Tylenol instead. What this means to your daughter is that he'll have to play lots of sports ...no select. The key for him is not to damage his joints as it won't be good for him to pop ibuprofens a lot in his 40's. This is easy stuff. Please remind your daughter this is NOT kidney disease...just a blockage...a fluke no BIG deal. Have her contact me on my blog if she wants to talk more. Adam lead a wildly normal life. He fell off a banister while in the play Oliver a couple of years ago and he fell on his arm and I sat in the audience relieve he didn't fall flat on his back. That's it. He plays baseball like a wildman, skiis, plays tennis, is into dance and drama and does climbing walls and everything else boys do. The secret is I am thrilled he'll never be able to wrestle. I have also outlawed football which suits him fine. Sable do NOT NOT NOT pull that lip hair or I will have to Roseanne Rosana Danna you.  Congrats on the hair wherever it comes in. This can only mean god things. ONE MORE TO GO!  WOO HOOOOOOOOOO.

I fear she already invited her hubby and when I told her I didn't want others coming, she said, \"You know, this isn't just about you.\" At which point I just fell into a puddle of tears and replied that, in fact, the 8th chemo was about me and to please respect my wishes....but I was blubbering so hard I had to hand the phone away. Give me a flipping break. ",

Weepy and rough day for me...of course, the third day after that fabulous steroid high from the last taxol. I feel emotionally numb. I am relieved and I am extremely teary. I went out on my bike alone today and only rode about 6 miles which is more than I've ridden in ages, but I felt so weak. DUH. I just came off my 8th DD chemo. 1-800-stupid. The best part is I ran into the one person I could just be in tears with and I knew she'd be okay with it. What a rough day. On the kid front...Linda, my 15-year-old son is like your daughter though not as affectionate, but very, very matter-of-fact. My little guy is the one I worry most about in terms of how this is impacting him. He takes it all on and comforts me sometimes more than my dh who is under \"a lot of pressure\" dealing with all of this. Blah, blah, blah. I loved hearing about all of your days today. Love you guys. Best part of my day, btw, was when I was sitting on the bench in front of Puget Sound today with my son's teacher -- the one who was okay with me tearing up and weeping, several very naked people rode by on their bicycles. It was lovely as they were painted up beautifully. The teacher had never seen this group but they do tend to be out and about in Seattle from time to time. It lifted my spirits....you all would have enjoyed how pretty they were all painted. Some women were covered in paint while others just had paint on their breasts and other more private areas. Men had \"bracelets\" and \"footlets...\" It was all very festive. Anyway, in a pretty emotionally confusing day, it was a very bright spot. I know part of this is lack of decent sleep for three nights running. Tonight will be better. Sleep well dear women. BTW, thanks for sharing about the nodes and the rads and all of that information. I find it fascinating that we are all learning so much. In the end, we know we've all been \"overtreated\" and if that means keeping this away until we are all grandparents and/or lovely women full of wisdom, I am there. Keep hugging those little ones and I will too and let's keep watching the teens and for those of you who do not have kids, know that you are very connected to the kidworld as YOU wish to be connected. My older one is downstairs coughing and I am less worried as all I have now is herceptin in two weeks then once every three....got my chemo nurse some scotch the other day. That went over even better than sweets. Night. ",

Woo hoo! This thing with lashes and brows if amazing, is it not? I seem to be way more obsessed about that than the hair. Though my last taxol was September 4, I have mature lashes and brows still falling out. I echo Jen's (I think) pondering of how can hair be growing in on one part of my head while falling out just one forehead away? I also remember what Rock said about eyelashes falling out even after they grew in. Karin, how are you doing? Cris, how cool that you got to meet Jonathan Horton. Sometimes I am glad to have a kid around because they get the autograph but I am just as excited. Hope the week goes well even without Grandma. Kerry, ICU with two hours to live and that was before bc? Mine started with an 800-foot fall down a mountain (which is how I ended up discovering the lump in my breast)...would love to hear your story. Yes, quite a year. I am so pleased about my foob...can't WAIT to go out in it. Maybe I'll wear it to curriculum night on Vashon Island tonight. I have herceptin today after a bunch of other rehab appointments. Did anyone get dark speckles (kind of tiny polka dots) at the tips of their fingers after taxol or taxotere? Just curious and wanting to know what that is all about. Otter, oh great woman of wisdom, got ideas? Adrienne, aren't crickets supposed to be really good luck? I think, in many cultures, they are considered very, very good luck. May your daughter have very, very, very good luck in her future. That's it for now. I suggest Norstrom for all of your FOOB needs. Ciao. ",

Please know that if you didn't get cards/cash to me, you must still feel free to write or purchase a gift card or whatever you like. I will let them know we also made a donation to BC.org...looking for feedback from you all around how much and looking for feedback from Robin about how she wants to handle her extra cash.

For those who are estrogen pos and NOT considering having children, I got my ovaries out on a Wednesday and was swimming the following Saturday. It is EASY surgery. I am not a surgery person, but if you are thinking about dumping them, do....your body will create less estrogen (though it will still create some). Jen, Your son is fine and you know that. This is a bump in the road. Cris, Everyone in your family is going through huge adjustments. I am so glad you have a strong relationship with your daughters. In the end, it is up to your EX and your daughters to figure out their relationship and they will. It is VERY important that you continue to be solid and to walk a line of staying out of it while being supportive to your daughters encouraging them to feel their feelings. You are an awesome mom and a very strong and beautiful woman. I admire you. Stay strong and remember that you, too, are dealing with post traumatic stress. Speaking of post-traumatic stress,  call it what you will. Call it crying at a wedding for different reasons; call it having clutter of the house, the mind, etc., depression and so on -- listen, women, we are two to two and a half years out from being diagnosed with what we all know to be what used to be a death sentence and what still IS a death sentence for those we know and love (RanD). One of the things my oncologist said at the very beginning when I used to tell him about each of you was this -- he saw women and continues to see women who have been in stage four breast cancer for 15 years. He has also seen young, strong, otherwise healthy women such as RanD who, for absolutely no explanable reason, go way too quickly. Here is what I know about this group. We are fighters. We are survivors. We are people who take life by the balls (sorry...so crude) and hang on. We laugh hard and fight hard and work hard and cry hard and that is what we are supposed to be doing -- that IS life. We get to feel whatever feelings we want when we want because we were diagnosed with a disease that we are all learning to live with. Though we'd like to get RID of it, we can't. What we can and DO do is move on. We are moving on but we are doing it at our own pace and in our own way. That means we get to be depressed when the time is right; we get to take more risks (I have definitely been doing that since I've decided I can't fully control when my life ends anyway) and there is not a day in my life that I don't wonder or worry about how long I will live. I, too, desperately want to be here for my kids' graduations and to see them have children (if they choose to do that). I currently bargain with a God I do not fully believe in that I get 30 years since diagnosis...that gives me to 77. That is all I ask. What I also know is that each day we live, new treatments are continuing to be developed. For those of you waiting to hear about BRCA, my hope is that your children (whether you have BRCA or not -- I do not, but every first cousin on my dad's side had breast cancer or colon cancer and one died at 54) will NOT have to worry because there will be some treatment which will slightly change their cellular make up to trick the body into not allowing cancer to take up any kind of residence.  SO.....let's agree to continue to be who we are. Let's continue to support one another as we go through all life throws at us. Let's continue to agree that it's okay to cry at a wedding for ourselves or for the joy for the new couple. Let's live as we are living. Let's party and pray and run and garden and work and laugh and search for continued meaning in our lives. I love you all.",

Her mother had four kids before her and had my mom at 44 thinking, of course, she was going through the change of life. She never really recovered from that in terms of self esteem.

We spent so much time just dealing with the overwhelm of chemo that now that it is gone (for most of us) and now that rads are gone (for some of us) and now that we have herceptin (only a few of us), that survival mode got easier, but everything else gets harder. My fifteen-year-old was joking around about BC the other day and I almost shot him. He was just being fifteen, but he is convinced that now that I am done with chemo, all is well. I haven't the heart to tell him how worried I am about my fluttering heart but I get an echocardiogram on Wednesday so maybe I'll know more then. But there are days when I am flying high and days when it feels like a real drag. It's all about finding that new normal. You all know the one I am talking about...the one where I am waiting for a toenail to fall off or that (tmi alert) I get excited when I blow my nose and a booger comes out and I know it's because I have nostril hair again.

Dana, that post was beautiful. Noelle, how are you feeling? Inquiring minds are wondering. Randie, extra big smoochies to you as you go on your \"vacation.\" Hope all goes well. We are thinking of you. Glad the rest who were down with little illnesses are up and moving again. The photo of Otter and Jean is scrumpdili-icious. I believe that there is a common thread other than the \"same haircut\" common thread and that is that each of us, sadly but still with dignity, has wisdom in her eyes that very likely was not there before we were diagnosed with cancer. There is a resilience in those eyes that really resonates with me. I am in awe of all of you. Crush, crush, crush. WHAT HAPPENED? Robin, you need to talk to you onc as there are other drugs that can do the same thing femara is supposed to do that is not femara and that does not have the femara side effects. I am currently on my fourth month of femara and just about ready to kick it out as well, but I will do that by switching to another drug. I am not a drug girl. I hate them and I know that when I dump femara, it is likely the next drug will have a different SE but you need to discuss this with your onc. You may be able to take something else and have very little problems. Here is what I believe....we did chemo to kill any free wheeling radical cancer cells running around. We put poison in our bodies to dump the free radicals. We removed lumps and breasts to dump the actual cancer that was visible. Now, we are in the next stage...we want to keep cancer at bay for five years...the further we get from our original diagnoses, the less likely the cancer will return. Not to say it won't...as we know that sometimes it returns sooner (and we fight those fucking alligators) and sometimes it returns seven or eight years out and sometimes it takes 20 and sometimes it doesn't come back until we are 86 or we die of something else. I care about you deeply and I want you to consider having a chat with the onc. There are two or three other options to femara. Femara is the one that supposedly blocks or inhibits cells from feeding cells that could start the cancer again. I encourage and implore you to talk to your doc. OR, find a new doc. When I told my onc that femara was blechy, he said, okay, let's do something different. I chose to stay on it because I believe I am a masochist and I wanted to try everything before dumping out. For me, femara kills my joints -- one that was injured years ago in particular. So I can be moving along but the pain in those couple of joints (shoulders) takes 45 seconds to subside. Please reconsider dear Robin. You should feel well and you should not have to \"hide this\" from your onc. You are supposed to be on the same team. Blah, blah, blah. I love you. Angels, you are just across the water in Victoria. We wish you a wonderful time and wish I could fly like a heron over to see you. This afternoon, my cancer-bully friend, Dottie, and I head to the Napolitan Salon for Jeremy to do a full makeover on both of us. I expect hair color and maybe a cut. Dottie will get both for sure. I will get waxing (woo hoo...it'll be free) and I am hoping they throw in a left breast for me and a right one for her. Oh...wait....is that NOT part of the makeover? Anyway, we get to go back to our fancy store, Via Lago, on Sunday and pick out second outfits because we do not want to wear on TV on Monday what we are set to wear on Tuesday at the Gida's Club Surviving in Style Fashion show. Yes, there will be photos. At this point, I am so NOT married to my hair they can do anything except SHAVE IT OFF. Noelle, so sorry business is bad. I hope you can hang on as your products are high quality and unique and much loved in my household and with anyone else with whom I have shared them. Karin, big teacher and para layoffs coming in Washington state. Our Washington Education Association ESP of the year just won the national award and I shot a video of her. She is something....para with special ed but, at this point, started some amazing training programs for other paras who work with special ed kids. You'd love her. Anyway, we are hoping most of the layoffs (I hate when people call them RIFS...that is so bullshitty when, in fact, they are LAYOFFS) come through attrition. My DH is waking up. I hear him stirring. Spring is being glorious in Seattle.We go from wonderful days to rainy and cold ones to lucious breezes to everything in between. Mary, am thinking of your daughter and of you. I chatted with my team about my port which is still scheduled to be in my body through to August. I told them it scared me...oh oh gotta' run. Going to work ... my ride is here.",

Hi Ladies, I am sitting for the third day in a row on the floor of a convention center in Spokane, Washington with some 1,000 teachers and other public school employees. It is our annual rep assembly -- delegate assembly...it is where people set the policy for us for the next year. We have spent three packed days debating, learning, listening and so on....it is almost over, It will be over early. I was catching up on the thread. It was nice to hear from Kerry. It was great to catch up on stories about snakes and rockets and kind deeds parents do for children. It was great to read Noelle's post on her blog and to listen to the to boob or not to boob discussion. I like it when I read that we are \"done\" with chemo even though herceptin is still considered chemo. It sure doesn't feel like it, but is is called simple chemo. I am readying for the final countdown on herceptin. I am hoping I have only five left then OUT WITH THAT PORT. My femarra still bugs me ... a lot, as it stops me from doing some very fun stuff...still -- two ibuprofen each morning with all of those fun vitamins seriously does take \"the edge\" off and, hey, as you know, none of this holds a candle to chemo. I could do femarra forever and it wouldn't come close to chemoworld. Okay, on with it. I like checking on on you here. I like hearing about your lives on Facebook. I like post cards and love CDs. I am, as always, worrying about Randie even though I know she is home. I think we ought to change are name from Starting Chemo May 2008 to, \"May 2008 sisters.\" It's not that I want to forget we went through chemo together...it's that it's a chapter we can close. Can you tell I am tired of sitting on a convention floor and have been doing it for hours and hours and hours? My babbling is worse than usual. Karin, You would have loved this as we have the National Education Associaton Education Support Professional (ESP) of the year this year....she is awesome and we have the first recipient of the C.L.E.A.N award which is a custodian who believes in cleaning for the HEALTH of the children and staff at the school...he had to get off the shining of the floors and concentrate on teaching people how to clean not for looks but for health. He's amazing. Inspiring words for you? It is a pleasure to be \"cooped up\" with a thousand educators on a sunny Saturday in Spokane. Teachers (and paraeducators and bus drivers and custodians and librarians and counselors and so on) are the best. Love you all.",

I am wearing a chartreuse scarf twisted in a lovely way on my still scraggly head. It is complemented with chartreuse (gosh, I hope I am spelling that color correctly) earrings, lipstick, undereye make up and very expensive shoes I bought once in Norway because I didn't really realize how much they cost. They were a good buy as it is years later and I still wear them. They are the coolest shoes I have ever owned. Lipstick is so NOT Eddie. I don't know if I look good, but I do look different. Hope everyone at the bar today has a smooth infusion. Got my first mouthsore last night. Salt water swishing. Cheers.",

The walking is so good when I feel good. It makes me feel better when I'm off as well, but it is glorious when I feel good. Women, our Susan Komen team, the Fast Eddies, are walking on Saturday here in Seattle. We are in fourth place in the city and have raised close to $8,000. We have more than 30 people on our team. I feel so blessed. I hope I feel good enough to walk. Methinks I will. So...two more great days until I step up to the bar for #3 on Thursday...Jamiaica...yes. ",

Still, I like the idea of riding around in one of those cool pole and box deals where you have very buff people carry you. Each of us, I am sure, could decide which four people we would like to have around carrying us from place to place. I would choose Bruce Springsteen in case I also needed some good music (plus I have this secret fantasy about him), Ichiro because I love his butt and he is good looking, I would have chosen Heath Ledger but he rudely overdosed and I might choose George Cloony because he is good eye candy. .. or maybe Denzel Washington....yah, he would be good too.  Kristy-- we know you have the picture. POST BALD.....everyone is doing it. Love the charm bracelet idea...when our cousin, Zach, was little (3), he had cancer. He really connected with Buzz Lightyear and we still think, to this day, it was because Buzz looked bald. Zach was chemo bald. So . . .maybe a Buzz Lightyear instead of an 8 ball for baldies? Welcome to Starr. We are a party even when we're not. You are invited any time any day. Went to work today. Only worked half a day because I am trying to TAKE CARE. Although, I was doing fine until I took three weeks off which is when I got all this stuff. Hmmmmm.I am jealous that you all are moving forward on chemo. I feel like I am on one of those gameboards where I got stuck on....\"You caught shingles --LOSE one turn.\" I should be happy that it is not chutes and ladders where I landed on one of those where I have to start over, right? Good luck tomorrow to Roc and Adrienne and the rest of you going in this week. I will let you know what happens when I see my doc. I think he'll say, why are you still in pain? These are scabbing over so well. I am starting to ramble. Starr...that is an issue for me. Ciao to all of you. ",

Sue, no way is that lump anything as you are being BLASTED with cancer poison right now. Glad you are checking and, obviously, we are all sending warm thoughts your way. I sailed into my onc's office today convinced he would clear me for chemo one day late on my original schedule and he very kindly laughed me right out of his office. Plus, he gave me perspective. He said, \"Let's see. You have a light case of shingles. Your body is healing and you are doing really well and you want me to blast you with steroids so you can do taxol/herceptin tomorrow when you're not ready?\" He said I could go as early as Monday but that throws off the work schedule so bottom line? One week delay. Deal with it, girl. It just means I get to step up to the bar with other friends. Although I really, really love Montana. Have I told you all how fun it is to NOT have to tear my eyes open at night just to pee? My eye gunk is disappearing rapidly. Life is good. I may as well take a week of and admit that just a few of those shingles are itchy/burning so this will give them a few extra days. Your posts are wonderful. Otter, here is the deal...my dad keeps asking me why I am putting myself through all this. \"I thought the cancer was gone. Why do you have to do this to yourself? And why can't we all just go to Yellowstone this year?\" He will often call and say, \"Do you feel better yet?\" He is 87 and I love him, but it gets slightly annoying. I am glad to have him in my life....but it can be a bit of a downer having the parents ask you why you are going through chemo. Listen women....we are alive and hurting and laughing and loving (or trying to) and we are cranky and strong and vulnerable and itchy (just me) and bitchy (just me again). Your bald avatars thrill me. I wish we could photoshop a bunch of us together. I laugh so hard about charm bracelets and dinners with Lulu and our food conversations. My dh is turning 58 tomorrow (I am 47 so I love these six months when he seems 11 years older than I). He is currently NOT eating refined sugar. I am going to try to track down a yummy dessert with no refined sugar in it for his \"cake\" Meanwhile, I sit here at 6:31 eating a banana and really good dark chocolate. Yum. The dryer is calling, but you are way more fun. Hope the chemo treatments went well for those who went today. Talk to you soon. ",

I am currently flying high and will share two experiences because I can. It's up to you if you read. Number 1: My ears are burning in the best way. The back of my head ... kind of between my ears is partying. Which leads me to number 2. When I was 19 (there is really a much better and deeper story here but I will NOT go into it now but suffice it to say that I was a virgin but thought I had herpes and, yes, when I am not steroided I will share the story either on this thread or on a private one if you wish cause it is funny but back tot he main story). I was 19 and had gotten myself into poison ivy. I was allergic to it and the inside of my body was suffering as well as the out. I was placed on a major regiment or is that regimen of 12 steroids a day for 10 days (and don't stop even if it goes away). I spaced out my six in the morning one day (hey, I was 19. I forgot) so at night I took 12. (Did I mention I was 19 and stupid?). Immediately, I felt odd. I begged out of the program (I was at a college camp) and went to my cottage where I rested. Jerry Garcia came in t my cottage and sat at the foot of my bed. I must be hallucinating, I thought. I had never done any drugs heavier than once in a while pot. I liked what I saw. He was playing Terrapan Station (sp? don't blame me...I just took five steroids) on the electric guitar and he sounded goooooooood. Then I thought, I must be hallucinating, but he seems so real. Then, I came up with a plan. If his amp is plugged in, I thought, this is real. Why? Because who would hallucinate in such detail that an amp would be plugged in, right? So I checked. And, guess what? It was plugged in. I KNEW I was no hallucinating. The next three nights, I took 12 steroids, but guess what? It never happened again. Go figure. So, tonight, when my ears started tingling, I thought, just go with it. Maybe Jerry will come back from the dead. Do you think? Herceptin tomorrow for me too...you too Sable? Then on to herceptin only? Rock does have pretty eyes. I hope, ROck, that your bams, dots and cracks bring you luck at the mah jong table. Good night dear women. May all of your rock stars visit you in your dreams tonight. ",

I am an eastern European Jew with lumpy breasts (we're famous for them) and am trying not to worry, but of course, they call me on a Friday so I have to wait to Monday to go in. I swear, women, if I have breast cancer in my right breast WHILE in chemo, something is very wrong.   SUe your comments about my mountain analogy were kind. Thanks.  Mast bras? I am a C or D depending on the bra and I have not worn anything but a jogging bra since my mast. I will deal with all of that later. I don't care if I am lopsided. I did get a few shirts that make me look less that way. People always look at my bald head first then take that quick sneal of a glance at my chest. Oy. Karin, I work for the Washington Education Association. I work for 81,000 teachers and paraeducators or parapros and I happen to know that teachers would fall apart without the paras as they are the ones who can add nurturing and love to the students who need a little extra tlc. Parapros are the glue that keep it all going. You are an angel. I know many parapros by the way with many degrees and they CHOOSE to do your work so just know you got there with fewer loans. You rock. Sable, my only post taxol se so far are hiccups...many times and in just a few bouts then they go away. Had the neulasta shot today, though, and will see if IT is causing thos pounding headaches/ear ringing or it was the cytoxin (now long gone). I will check into bcomplex too. Other than that, not much to report. Am scared about the other breast, but I have to remind myself I used to get called in everytime to recheck....so this should be no different, right? And, yes, I want to remove my other breast as well as my ovaries and take off tweny pounds on each thigh while they are at it.   I did not wake up either night. Same routine as yours. My only se so far has been lots of post chemo hiccups (pepcid?). Fisho oil is also supposed to be good to stave off taxol side effects I understand. Chocolate chip banana bread goes over very well in this house of boys. ",

Bought: B1 vitamins with B6 in them Fish oil capsules (also supposed to be good) Crocs although I got croc knock-offs called dogs and a tee-shirt for a friend who lives in Germany. Now, I am going to chomp some comfort food (tomato soup). Sable, don't forget to keep swishing with salt water to avoid more mouth sores, okay? I'll check in with you all later. I am so glad I have one more day off from work tomorrow as that will be day 5 (if you count chemooooo as day one and you seem to be telling me day 6 gets better). Ciao ",

Are you gonna' send me for a biopsy if it looks suspicious?\" They agreed they would do that. I said, \"Really? In the middle of chemo?\" I blew them off and told them I wanted to see the doc. I almost made a scene. Being emotional can work to one's advantage I guess. I was told, \"You'll have to give up the mammogram room.\" I was, like, \"OKAY!\" I was shuffled off to Dolly in ultrasound who told me to lay there until the doc arrived. He did. He said, \"We don't need to do more pix.\" He very gently ultra-sounded my poor remaining breast and, guess what? It was a cist. That was a fun exercise, but I am relieved. Celebrated by seeing Sex in the City. I never watched the show so I am sure some of it was lost on me, but good clothes, shoes and handbags....I must say. Meanwhile, the pain was pretty bad again today and, I realized at the movie, part of it was because, like an idiot, I didn't take anything. Went to cancer yoga and they all yelled at me and told me to take 800 mg of ibuprofen if I wasn't going to take vic or oxy. Came home and did that and, I don't want to jinx anything, but it does seem to have alleviated the pain. My onc called home tonight and told me he will work on why my wrists are hurting so bad as well as ankles. He is so nice. He also said we could cut back some on the steroids before the next chemo. And, he made me promise to take pain meds if I must as he explained that being in pain makes one use a lot of energy which makes one tired, blah, blah, blah. Okay, off for work tomorrow but will try to check in with you. Good luck to the Lake Cuomo crowd. I've been there. It is beautiful. May all your side effects be non-existent. One of the women in my yoga class sprouted hair this last week. It's so cute. Can't believe the boob rubber, Noelle. You could have sported your \"brazilian wax\" without having had the pain to go with it, but.... maybe not. Crocs are working, Sable. Go out right now and get a pair. Okay, get someone else to do that. They feel really good on. Good night and thanks for your support. It's been a very rough few days. Shlaff gut (sleep well in poorly written German). ",

It is telling your body to rest. My friend told me I had a certain number of units of energy to use each day. Say you start with 100. Chemo (first round) just knocked you down to 60. It takes 30 to feed, shower, blah, blah all the regular daily stuff. You are left with 30 units. You need to decide how you want to expend those units. For me, it was walking. Even though they took up units, I feel I also got to deposit an extra few. For you, it might be taking the extra trouble to have a bubble bath instead of a shower or to force yourself to just be...that takes energy too. I must tell you I had two very rough days after chemo...not right after, but after I stopped the drugs and before I felt better. I was in panic mode, but then it went away. Let the waves wash over you once in a while if you have to . . . mostly, we'll surf and ride the waves out together, but every once in a while, I think, we are going to go under.

I am floored and amazed how different it is today. I have been reading all of your posts and I will look forward to gettig to know each of you. Congrats on graduating seniors, by the way. Hope the graduation goes well. I am quite new to this as I have only done one chemo so far. A/C for now then on to taxol. Your experience and wisdom will be very useful and my plan is to support you as you go through as well. Hey, Bremerton, I looked for that toothpaste, but couldn't find it in PCC. Got ideas? My next chemo is a week away. It is possible that one can feel pretty yukky for the first week after then feel okay for the second then start the cycle over? Or, do you think each time it'll be different? I guess I'll find out soon. Meanwhile, ladies, I wish each of you a night full of good dreams, calm sleep, hope and I thank you ahead for welcoming me. I think, today, I am figuring out how to actually navigate the website. Thanks for supporting me in my maniacal stage yesterday.",

Meanwhile ladies, I was laughing because of the inappropriate signs and faces my friend was making behind the nurse's back. I will NOT be requesting nurse Emily next time. Plus, she shoved the cytoxin in in a half an hour which gave me a head ache. I am going for the slow track next time. I brough my husband's incredible homemade brownies today -- two for the doc; two for the schedule guy and my knight in shining EMLA armor, Michael and the needle weenie nurse, Karen; and two for my oncology nurses. Sadly, they did not earn the brownies. We ate them instead. Sucked on ice chips while A went in. Pee was a lovely orange...kind of an organic orange. Okay, I may be grossing some of you out. By the way, the EMLA worked well....barely barely felt the needle numbing the port. I am tired but happy that round two is done. Like some of you, I am breaking it up to two cycles of four rounds. AC first four the taxol herceptin the hercepting for an extra 40 weeks...yiiiii. I saw a cool look today. Baseball cap, but a cool cotton beanie under it with big hoop earring. It looked good. Okay, so maybe it looked good cause the wearer is in her early 30's but still....did I tell you how fun it is that my little under the chin hairs (come on...admit it...some of you have those too) are flying right out? My feeling is if I can spurt blood about, I can have an all out gross out session tonight. Congrats on chemo graduation, by the way. We all aspire to be you and we all will make it. Meanwhile, I will play one (okay, four) games of internet scrabble, take an ativan and a dex whatever the hell they are called and check in tomorrow. Goodnight. ",

I woke up in the middle of the night the other night and felt like I was in a panic...but no, I felt okay in my mind, but something was burning. I had to think really hard about the pain then it dawned on me that this must be heartburn. I never had heartburn with the pregnancies, but it was burning in the middle of my chest, but no...not really my chest. Maybe it was gas? Oh my God, is this what babies who have collic feel like? No wonder they squall. I had gained a whole new understanding. Did we have TUms? It's three in the morning. What should I do? I'll try go to the bathroom....ho hum. No luck. It still hurts. I go through our fridge and find Alka Seltzer. Hmmm...I think, this if for heartburn, right? I figure it's safe enough to try. I open the pack, throw the tablets in the water and, strangely, immediately, start singing, Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is. Somehow, this makes me laugh out loud. I drink that horrid stuff down and go back to bed promising myself to give it 20 minutes. GUess what? It worked almost immediately!!!!  Here's the best part. I could hear it working. It was a pleasure. Then, last night, I ate matzah ball soup and a pickle and even the pickle did me in, but it was BEFORE bed. I used that bluchy Alka-Seltzer again, and PRESTO, I slept with only three pee wake ups. How cool is that?  So, for those of you who are experiencing some kind of heartburn, try this.  Plus, it will make those of you old enough to remember the alka seltzer commercials (I am 47) the chance to realize how strong their branding was. I will check in with you all soon. Seems like a few of us are on the exact same dense dose of A/C for every two weeks for four then a move to taxol. I am heading for round two on June 5. Any insight on difference between round 1 and round 2? I am hoping my neulasta makes the white blood cells strong enough... on the running/ walking/exercise, my friend tells me we have so many units of energy and we MUST choose to use them the way we want. Any exercise we can do (if and when we feel like it) takes a few of those units, but it also repleneshes them AND it allows us sun, fresh air and the chance to be in the world. I'll check in later. I'm going walking. ",

We are a very literary (okay, prolific if not literary) gang. I love you women. I have lots to say, but will wait as I am usually one who rambles and rambles. Quick health report: Meds are good. Wrists are braced (what a relief) and am into ibuprof tradng off with tylenol. I am wearing edima socks for my swollen ankles. They feel good. Plus, of course, my crocs. We are downing the steroid dose for next taxol on Thursday then herceptin (first one) on Friday. They do it separate the first time to be able to detect allergies. I am scared for taxol 2, but I WILL get through these next three no matter what it takes. Like Sue (I think) I finish first week of September if all goes well....except for the year of heceptin. Yes, I have been gaining weight...I am 47 and a half yesterday. Otter and Roc, Hope both of your moms are better. Loved the \"Hair\" image. Wish I could have been there dancing with you. All of you, Please go see Mama Mia. I know I told you before, but this is an escape that will make you laugh and cry and sing. It's a winner and it is going to be a cult classic. How do I know? People sing along in the theatre AND Abba is making a great come back. How do I know? Because at last night's Mariners game, the song the fans requested was Dancing Queen.  Sable, LOVE your new avatar. Roxi, you and I are the same sage...woo hoo....let's celebrate 87 together, okay? Our fifteen-year-old comes home from camp today. Haven't seen Max since June 28. It is time. Our younger one, Adam, departs for camp on Tuesday. I will miss him. My dh, Marty, will fly down with him so he will be gone during taxol 2 day and back by the end of herceptin day. We have suite (sweet, too) tix for a Mariners game on Friday night. Shall I try to go for it? Everything is different when not in chronic pain. Kristy Ann, hope you are feeling better and home by now...but not until they take full and good care of you.   May Sunday be kind for you....",

Tylenol seems to be keeping most se under control. Emotionally, though, I am soooooo ready for this stage...this chemoooooo stage, to be over. Anyone else feeling that way? Can we all just agree to be done with this right now? Older people came and visited me today and that depressed me. it depresses me that people twice my age (okay, nearly twice my age) are coming by to see me. Ay carramba. I am going to my book group tonight wearing my brand new Joan Armatrading t-shirt. For those who are aching...I send you hugs and drugs and mugs of good things to soothe your jaws and your bones. I am suffering some bone aches as well, but I keep thinking of that chemo tower which now looks pretty do-able. Two more chemoooos. Noelle, hope the swimming went well. Took a walk today and that was about all I felt like doing. We have 709 loads of laundry to fold down stairs. Olympics, here I come. I am thinking about all of you. By the way, me edema stockings....the ones I had to purchase recently are very good for cutting out any kind of leg cramps at night. I just wear them at night, but the support feels really good. I am really more tired this time than any other chemo. Maybe it is because it is cumulative, eh? What happened to our Aussies? Kristy, hope you are feeling better. Being at our friends yesterday was fine, but a bit depressing as someone told me she has been in pain for seven years and somehow that scared me. Speaking of scare, I read, in our paper a couple of days ago, about the number 8 in the Chinese culture and how it is very lucky. Four is death in that culture and I was diagnosed on 4/4 and I woke up that day at 4:44 just knowing I had cancer, but the scary part now is that the article said 47 was \"certain death.\" Okay, I am 47. We live on 47th Street. Our phone number ends in 47. Is that enough? My dh is reminding me we are not Chinese, but still...that scared the living pot stickers out of me. Have I rambled enough yet? If you got through this, you are a hero as I didn't even put in paragraph breaks. Did I mention the older people brought me chocolate and nice lotion? See you later. ",

For me, it seems the Tuesday and Wednesday after chemo (I have done it twice so I am VERY experienced) are the hangoverish, weirdest, fuzziest, least together days. However, I am NOT in a panic today for many reasons --the biggest is that I have found you all. So thanks for that. Good luck to those who are stepping up to the bar. We tried packing tape and the duct tape does work for hair and it's not torturous --it's just funny. Tomorrow, we are moving on to the lint brush. I wore just a hat today . . . no blue hooligan stocking cap. It felt fine. Lovely ladies, feel better those who are aching (I took Tylenol today to mask a headache), feel calm to those who are nervous and for those losing hair...join the club...my nose, she is running without those nostril hairs to keep it all together.

We will be swimming next to otter and hugging those who are done on the other side. We will be in training for waiting for each and every one of the rest of you and we will not leave until we are all on the other side and maybe never. Gracie, go commando. Have fun. We saw Shrek, the musical last night as it is Broadway bound. It was fun and well done; I predict it will do well but I think it needs some work. The same fellow who wrote a lot of Spamalot did Shrek and though the sets, costumes and songs are great, there are so many messages in the show that are good but it doesn't all quite connect. I am not making any comments on Alaskan governors at this time. What else? Activities...Karin...activities...Noelle and Otter and Sable and all of us...I am readying myself to lose the ten pounds I have gained. I will be seeing a naturopath and a post-cancer recovery trainer type person. I will continue my \"normal\" 3-mile walking regiment, but I plan on pumping it up. I have been careful as I was told save energy to get though, but once I get the go ahead and a little help designing a program, I will be on my way. One more development....I am in search of a foob. I will be discussing with oncologist on Thursday, but it will be step one in looking a bit more normal. Happy Sunday. ",

My tummy hurts probably from the anti-viral anti-shingles drugs. My doctor called it siding -- not shingles. My eleven-year-old, who was with me in the doc's office- was mad the doc did that because he was so bummed for me that he started hugging the doc when he said it was siding rather than shingles. I have vicadon and oxy whatever the hell it's called. I could sell all these pills on the streets of Seattle and donate the money to Susan Komen Foundation. I don't want to take the narcotics either and am also a lightweight in the world of drugs. I did take some kind of NSAID today which made my joints feel less achy. I am, officially, a mess. However, it's nice to check in with you all and know you are there. For those stepping up to the bar (chemo bar) this week, I wish you well. For those who were doing it next week (and I was one of them, but now I am not) know that I saw many of you had setbacks from time to time and, though I was sad about them and I wanted them to be gone, I do take some comfort knowing this is my bump on the road for now and you overcame yours and I will overcome my blasted shingles as well.",

People say it takes a long time to grieve the loss of a parent and I am here to say that you have a long time to do that. Take your time as your mom left the world knowing her daughter was healthy and strong. I have been saying prayers for her at temple as well as on my own and I send them, too, to you and the rest of your family. For those on chemooooooooo this week, we are waiting and ready toward week's end. I walked four and a half miles yesterday plus spent about half an hour wailing in my car (but it got too hot in there). It really makes me realize that there are no safe places to cry by yourself. If you are by yourself and you are outside (in a town or city) walkers ask if you are okay. If you are at home, it scares your family. Showers are okay for quiet cries, but not loud ones. My dh and I will work it out....we really will. Things come to a head sometimes. I am just asking him to take some intiative instead of me. If he wants us to go see a counselor, choose one and I am happy to go. It will help. We worked out some stuff yesterday and will continue to do that. I just hate ultimatums when I am trying to deal with other stuff right now too. It'll be okay. Noelle, I am sorry about the facebook stuff. One thing we all have to get used to with the web is that nothing is really private. It's weird, but our children get it and know it. It's harder for those of us who had a sense of privacy before the internet. Thanks for your thoughts, Linda. It's going to be okay. BTW, Linda, we have a unit on strike right now and I am proud of their resilliance even though it is so difficult. I hope the strike ends by late this week or early next week, but I hope they hang strong for what they want. Jen, I am off to the pm in a minute but not before I let you all know that I have made an appointment next Monday to go through a cancer rehab program. It is through our cancer health care hospital and it is supposed to be good...I meet a therapist twice (physical I think) and a guy named Dr. ZOOKER twice to set up a complete rehab plan so I can start losing the 10 pounds (or maybe more, now, who knows?) I gained as well as keep an eye on me while I am on herceptin so I push hard enough but not so hard that I keel over. I am nervous and exicted PLUS Dottie and I are going on a FOOB date to Nordstrom soon so I can have a less lopsided look by the Jewish high holidays starting at month's end. My feet are killing me but ice is my friend....I feel better today even though yesterday was rough. I think this is par for the course after chemo, eh? Karin, I hope things are smoothing out for you and that one or two of your students' have captured your heart and reminded you why you are such an amazing parapro. In case you don't know it, you are the reason children are successful in school. Your impact so many. Both my boys are on top of homework so far...Noelle, loved the puke story and I have good ones too but I think it would be too much to get us going on those.",

Next time someone says, \"Is there anyting I can do?\" Say, \"Yes, would you be willing to come with me to my next chemo session? I find I am so much more relaxed when I have someone along.\" Your family members are doing a great job, AND you can ask for other help. You'll feel better. I promise.

I just want relief but this is NOTHING compared to the pain of taxol. It scares the life out of me to have to do taxol #2 with herceptin the day after but anyone can do anything three more times, right? And, besides, I'd rather be in pain than have to drag these out. Gracie, I won't be done with herceptin until sometime next August so you know I'll be here for you, honey. My wrists hurt too much to write.

Not only is it an honor and a pleasure to have you both with us, we learn from you as well as from the different protocols in each  of our countries. We welcome your wisdom as well as your whining. I just caught up with all of you and it looks as though we are having a healthy pity party. I, too, have had major meltdowns as well as minor ones. I am 47 and was not at all even pre-menopausal bc (before cancer). I have not had a period since the first day of chemo when I got my period JUST AS I STARTED A/C -- but my guess is that my period will come back as I've had no hot flashes or other related menopausal se except for the serious moodiness. The moodiness, though, is also chemo/cancer/lifechange related. Hard to really sort them I think.  From what my cancer bully friends (I call them cancer bullies because I have a blog and all of my non-cancer pals kept telling me to listen to the cancer bullies for they have been through this and know what they are talking about) say that it does get worse the deeper in we go. I think many of us feel like once we are half way, we are at the top of the mountain and now it's smooth saling and downhill, but the truth is we start at the bottom and have to keep climbing all the way to the top of a very steep mountain. Sometimes we fall a ways and have to grab on to a shrub to keep from falling all the way down. Sometimes we have to deal with blisters or shoes that are falling apart. Sometimes we have to rest under what little shade there is, but we can't really give up and go back down as it is too steep and we could fall to our deaths. So, we have no choice (we made the choice to have chemo already) but to keep climbing all the way to the top. For some of us, it is 8 rounds of chemo but then it changes -- for others more or less. Once we arrive at the top, those of us who are her2positive have to hang out there on top for another year or so. But...once we get to the top, we can stay there for a long while. The other side is not nearly as steep as the side we are climbing. The other side is a much more gradual down and, if we want, we can stay at the top for as long as we wish. We can just be once we are there. I, too, want to remove my right breast (which had a mammogram yesterday...I kept saying, \"this is my port side,\" and \"do I get half off since I have only one breast?\") and my ovaries as well as I, too, am estrogen pos and all that, but these are decisions each of us will make later. They are personal and individual and we will discuss them together (at least those of us who keep checking in). I have a friend who has been cancer free for more than a year since her last chemo and she and a core of women on the thread do check in. For some of us, we'll stop because this will be too painful a time to remember, but for others, we'll check in because of the bonds we are making. But, the point is that we will get through and make decisions about ovaries and breasts and whatever else we do (I'd like to have all the fat on my thighs removed please) after we survive this as this is enough right now. The lesson we must learn (although I am having a very, very difficult time with it as I know many of you are as well) is to be present for what we are dealing with right now. I, too, can't wait for chemo to be over and to regain taste buds, my brain, etc., but we must concentrate on swish our salt water (Sable, I do that every few days just to avoid mouth sores) and that  has worked well...think I've only had one or two little ones. We must concentrate on just gettng better  with or without or moms' there for us. As a parent, I can't begin to imagine how I would feel as an older person if I knew my child had cancer. Some of them simply do NOT have the capacity to deal (my father is one of those people). What I wish is that each of us could have a mom who would support us by nurturing and holding and wiping away tears, but it is up to each of us to try to find a friend/spouse/partner/ who can server that role from time to time. Women, we are going to get through these times as it is a very short time in our LONG lives. We are going to survive and we are going to have a hell of a lot of wisdom when we get through. None of us asked for this but we are here. So, we are going to cry a lot. We are going to yell (I go in my car to do that anger work ...but not while I am driving). We are going to hurt and leave sandwiches on kitchen tables that no longer exist. We are going to dread going to the bathroom and be glad we are in the bathroom as the other option is not for us at this time. We are going to enjoy the breeze and the beauty of nature. Some of us are going to find relationships changing and it will sharpen our focus on the people we decide to share our time with and some of us are going to have dramatic change in our relationships with our selves. I am rambling again. How do you put up with this? If you read this far, I love you. If you didn't, I love you anyway. Have a good Saturday. My dh asked for a pound of organic almond butter. I got him two. I am so cool.",

I am taking steroids up the yin yang the night before and the morning of . . . which is coming soon (Thursday).  Noelle, Hebrew lit, eh? Did I tell you my mom is Israeli and my dad spend quite a long time in Palestine? BTW, do you happen to know Rachel Grynberg or Terry Epstein...both Middlebury grads but they finished in 1983...couldn't tell if you started in 85 or finished. If you finished, you might have crossed paths ...who all did you read along the way before you blew off that major? Question for all of you....my joints (wrists and ankles mostly) are still doing a number on me. Also, my left ankle is swelling like one of the old ladies....adema maybe? I have never been a water retainer .... is this the beginning and if so, why just the left ankle? Anyone else have swelling ankles or aching joints? Should I be concerned? I am NOT stopping chemo again so I am not calling in the docs on this one. My eye is no longer gunky (thanks for diagnosing that one for me, Roc); my shingles are a thing of the past; chemo number four, here I come. I love hearing about horses and partners and paths and how we all ended up where we are.  One thing I learned long ago, but this makes me learn it over again, is that whether we got degrees and post graduate degrees or we chose to start our own businesses or raise families or try to do a lot of those things; whether we chose to marry or partner or divorce of stay single; whether we chose to change careers or manage others or try to manage ourselves; by the time you get to this diagnosis, our wisdom (both individual and collective) carries us a long way. Formal education is just that -- it doesn't make anyone smarter -- it is just a path. Going out on one's own at 17 takes more courage than going to our cushy universities. Changing careers or being forced to change (Adrienne) when Seattle crashed opens new doors. We are quite a group. I have posted four photos on my blog today of our Susan Komen race. One is with my main cancer bully, Dottie, who turned me on to this website as she had bc a year and a half ago. One is with another survivor, Joanie, who is now in stage four with bc on her lungs, but totally hanging in there. One is a team photo of the 32 who walked and raised $9800 and one if of just me, but if you want to see an overweight, but happy camper, google eddie westerman. No pressure, but it's bigger than the avitars.  Enough rambling for now? Any other taxol advice for Sable and me? I am most worried that since I mostly sailed through A/C that taxol is going to whip by (*&. See, I don't cuss unless it is highly necessary as it was with shingles. love to all of you. Ciao. ",

I have two friends in stage 4 who have been doing very well, thank you very much, for many years. Don't sweat the numbers unless they tell you to sweat the numbers then we'll all sweat together. Did I tell you my dear mom told me, last week, that she lost all of her friends because of me? Yup. She said they tell her she should have come to take care of me and since I didn't \"let\" her come, her friends dropped her. Remember, this is the same mom who said she'd commit suicide if I died of cancer so no great surprises. She's a trip. I am lucky to have her healthy and thinking I know, especially as many of you and many of our other friends have lost parents, but I'm telling you she is a trip and coming here to Seattle on Sunday afternoon for two weeks. Hope you all have a crisp and lovely weekend.",

I am learning that we will all go through this as we journey. Just know, I am sorry. To be stupid, the other day, I was driving down the freeway thinking about all of you and the bloodwork stuff and I saw this cuticle hanging off my fingernail...okay, go into the Gilda Radner Rosanne Rosanna Danna voice now if you're old enough to remember...and I thought, HEY if I pull that off and let it bleed, I'll know if my platelets are good for chemo tomorrow. My dh was out of town with all of hte clippers in his dub kit so that's why the cuticle was there to begin with...so I went for it. I pulled it and watched it bleed and it stopped and I decided I could go to chemo that my bloodcounts would be okay which they were for that chemo. But what if it hadn't have been okay? What if I pulled it off then blood gushed out of my cuticle vein and I caused an accident on the freeway and the headline said, \"Breast Cancer Patient (victim? suvivor? journeywoman? I never know what the hell to call myself) Tries Experiment in Car then kills 4 others and dies herself because of Low Platelets\" That would have given all of us a bad name. Hang in there, Dear Drcrisc....your platelets will come back and they'll be fine. Meanwhile, sorry for the irritation. Mominaz,  Next time the steroids kick in at 4 AM, please come over and clean my house. My dining room table is okay, but we have LOTS of hardwood floors. you could have a field day. EyesoTexas, It wasn't my port. Mine is fine. But what ever happened with that upside down port anyway? I asked my nurses after I read about it here and they said it was not that uncommon. Maybe that's why you area asking me. Meanwhile, mine if fine and dandy, but I have a year of herceptin as part of this roller coaster ride so I'll be living with it for a long time. Okay wild women, Here is the deal. Had chemo on Thursday (third A/C -- only one more to go before next four of Taxol and hercep). Came home and helped my fifteen year old (okay I am lying) I basically did all of this for my fifteen year old...packed him for six weeks in LA....two with friends then on to camp for four weeks in Malibu (poor kid). His bags had to be ready early cause a friend is taking them down so no airplane surcharges. THEN, got sleeping bags, pillow, and packed for eleven-year-old and fifteen-year-old and mostly me, but I still have a bit more...why? Cause dh is away but now back. He is in charge of food and packing the car as I have no spatial abilities.  Then our team of 32 walked the Susan Komen Race for the Cure today...some of us ran...I was NOT one of those but those of you who are running through this impress me. We raised more than $9,400 putting us in the top five of family and friends in Seattle. My eleven=year-old raised more than $2,000 on his own. He is amazing. And the walk was very cool. We had people there from work, temple, book club, general good friends and it was very wonderful. PLUS my two cancer bully friends, Dottie and Joanie (it is a term of endearment) were also walking. They are my heroines along with you (and my hero, Wayne, if you every post again). So, we are off to Lake Roosevelt -- a five and a half hour drive from here tomorrow night after we see Avenue Q. Am I nuts? Yes, but my direct post-chemo has not yet been bad. I think the lower time tends to be Tuesday-Saturday next week and I'll be hanging out on a houseboat with two families we love and hoping to just mellow out. I will be out of touch with you, but thinking of you (and Robin's daughter and Randie's son and daughter-in-law and all of our mothers alive or dead and God bless them all-- even the ones who drive us nuts...it can't be easy watching your kid go through this...did I mention my dad wants me to drive him to Yellowstone Park this summer? Why are you putting yourself through this, he says. I thought you were cured. I thought it wasn't in the nodes....aaargh! Oh, oh, I rambled. Okay the uncharacteristic thing about me that I will not pull off is that I had no patience before this all began and I have even less patience now and I am scared, sometimes, that my dh will bail out and my kids will hate me because I get so irritable at the end of the day and/or if I am having weird headaches. I am supposed to be learning to have patience and to let things go and to be mellow and I am not there yet and I am so sad about that because I want to learn how to let go of the easy stuff. How's that? Love you all. ",

I would give anything even two ovaries and another breast for all of us to NEVER have to do chemo again (but we'll wait until we all finish up here) but you're right about the talk being different. I do feel we are all starting to regain our original selves and we didn't really know one another when we were our original selves. My sense of humor is just starting to come back. It's not that we didn't laugh (and I mean laugh hard) during our ordeal-- it's not that we weren't hilarious (charm bracelet, sharts, hair where, etc.) but we are going, now, to get to know one another as cancer is not our 24/7 job. I love that. That is why Kerry is slowly moving us off the breast cancer site and onto a Facebook page....Randie, I am sending my prayers that you are sleeping well right now and that all went well. Love you all. Here is another thought for Halloween before I sign off -- what about putting a nipple on the top of our heads and going as a boob full of brains? Those like Noelle with more hair would be a hairy boob with brains. Okay, this is getting bad. Goodnight all. ",

I am hoping, Rock, that you promise yourself to get some people over to help set you up so you are MOST comfortable. While I recognize and salute you for living independently, I know, too, that you have friends who are really wanting to help. True independence, my dear friend, is asking for support when you need it. Get it, girl. I am so thankful for those of you who are researching and sharing with the rest of us. I am a neulasta girl and we think I am getting my headaches from them...any research on that? I understand the white blood cells are created in the largest of bones (spine, thigh area and, perhaps, the back of the head where all of these headaches begin?). They are, so far, easy to handle with tylenol though many of you said do NSAIDS as well or switch them out so not to bother my liver too much. I have only take six extra strength in one day a couple of times so I am not too worried. The taxol thing is scaring the living daylights out of me as I hear you speak of the se's but my onc said most of his patients do better on taxol than taxotere. Perhaps some of your oncs would consider switching you taxotere women over? They drug is very similar. Worth an asking I think. I love you all and send you healing thoughts. Last night, my dh and I (did I mention both our kids are at camp or visiting friends? No socks, no  sweatshirt....ahhh) walked to see two fabulous fireworks extravanganzas...one over Ellioot Bay on Puget Sound and one just past the Space Needle on Lake Union. At times, they were both running and it was hard to decide which to train my eyes on. The walk out and back was about three miles and the evening was mild and the best, best part is that we heard soooooo many languages being spoken. It made my evening to hear Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Danish, Hmong, some kind of Somali or Sudanese language that was hard to recognize, Filipino and more. It was truly an American experience. Loved it. Will check in with you soon Otter, I am glad you remembered lunch. Retain our weight...I may be retaining a bit too well. Super13, nice to meet you. RanD, I am so sorry for your bottom issues. I had them when I was on our Lake Roosevelt trip....there is a song from Avenue Q called, \"I'm not wearing any underwear.\" You might want to check into it. I hope you feel better soon. Ciao",

My joints are killing me which means I skipped my daily 3.5 walk which bums me out My shingles themselves are burning though they are not spreading. Where are they? Curious minds want to know. They are under my right arm. They are violent. Still, I am sleeping at night. That is good. I don't want to take vicadon or any of those fricking narcotics because they have their own se. One drug for shingles gives you diahrrea (I know I spelled that wrong. apologies). The other constipates you. Have you heard of shitting or getting off the pot? Is that the true meaning? I am distressed. Roxi, in my distress, I am still sending your sisters my prayers and thoughts. I tested negative on BRCA1 BRCA2 and all the other 3,000 genes, but, like Sharon, I was 47 years old when my two cousins told me they had breast cancer (oops...we never mentioned it before ) plus my third cousin died at 54 from colon cancer yet ALL of us tested negative. Go figure. So, Roxi, know that your journey is yours and your sisters will do what is right for them. I called the onc to say maybe all this glutamine is causing aching joints and he said what is probably causing the aching joints is the shingles as it is a viral infection. DAMN. Have I cussed enough? I will stop for now. Shit. ",

First off, I am very excited to see more people cursing (cussing). We were all socialized NOT to do that, of course, but my feeling is that it allows us to vent some of our anger, rage, sadness, etc. It's kind of like kick boxing. We are not supposed to fight, but so many women I know LOVE kickboxing. Why? Ventilation dudettes, ventilation. On to pole dancing. My husband, in particular, loved the New York subway pole dancers. I can't imagine why but he was right here over my shoulder. Karin, thanks for sending that along. Adrienne, I knew you would \"chicken out\" on pole dancing but it really isn't chickening out as you warned us in advance AND, may I say, I will NEVER forget the Pacific Yew photos so we will consider that your pole dance. Congrats on being finished. Roc, my husband liked your pole dance shots nearly as much as the subway ones. What can I say? You are one hot chickie and I congratulate you as well. I wear my Joan Armatrading t-shirt in your honor tonight and I hope to God you NEVER have to have a mastectomy or any other treatment relating to breast cancer other than what you have to finish up now. Still, I know where you are coming from. Sadly, I find myself worrying about recurrence too much of the time. Noelle, you are going to help me with skin stuff too but right now I am trying to keep my last two lower lashes in. Ontario is too dang far for now, but someday....btw, I love, love, love Vermont as well. Jean, hope your mom is better all the time. I know I am going to miss people but two and a half days of catch up is way too much. As I was thinking about all of you today, I decided that we need to post photos as our hair starts to grow back in. Herceptin also made me fluish for a while. I think it is just the first time. I am interested in the herceptin for three weeks straight then once every three weeks concept...I wonder if I'll have the same routine. I am jealous and excited as each of you complete treatment and make it to the top of the mountain and into Camp Recovery. I want to be there with you and it seems so far away, but I know we are all going to get there.....right Sable/Jenn? We, too, will jump into the New River Gorge hand in hand (it's in West Virginia...check it out...I once bungee jumped off it and swore to never to that again....but still, a free fall jump into cool water together might be nice). What else? Who else? Roxi, Gracie, Angels, Sue, KristyAnn, Cris, I am sending my good thoughts your way. Hot flashes? me too...taxol...sweaty head ... at night and some, now in the day time...what a concept....I am tired....but managed my second taxol so much better than number one. Third one is next Thursday....can't wait....really...just want to move it on. I am going to knock your socks off on my pole dance (if I can get my nerve up). Maybe I'll knock my socks down. I am sometimes wearing those old lady edema support socks...I am trying to figure out a way to work them into my act. Hmmmm. Okay. Love you. Thanks for letting me ramble.",

Had a total of 10 of those 4 mg steroids (five last night and five this morning). Last night was very pleasant and did not need ativan to send me to sleep. This morning I woke up with only 80 percent of all those joint pains I have been whining about. It was awesome. Plus, last night, I really liked the tingling ears. Reported that to Dr. toda and he said the extra 80 grams of steroids today (or maybe it was just 40 more infused) might knock those joints back to normal. If not, I will check in with him and we will fix. Taxol took a long day. I did NOT get first herceptin with it as they do taxol first to check on allergies. Then, they do a second taxol alone in two weeks then a separate herceptin the next day then they merge them if all goes well the third of my four taxol treatments. I wasn't aware of that. Adrienne, what about you or are you taking herceptin? I forget. From what I understand, the protocols are different for us around the country and world simply based on the research going on in our region. We are tied to Fred Hutchinson Cancer and UW. Many of you on the east coast are tied to Sloan Kittering (bad spelling I know) and the midwest is tied to the Mayo Clinic....others are tied to cancer centers nearby. Gracie, BRCA results take a long, long time to come back. Mine took several week so hang on...it'll be okay. Sable, I am on dense dose too. Where do you live? I think it is a regional decision on how they deliver all of these chemo infusions. So, I got very, very tired in the middle of the infusion. Had benadryl, adavan and so on. Here's a suggestion for those of you who get sick of the meds. I keep mine around during the heavy days and put them away on the days when we don't need them. My tower now has 15 on the done side and nine on the to go side. Whoo hoo. Sable, glad we made it through okay.  Linda, my Jewish mom who lives in Florida never played mah jong. BTW, my doc loved that we brought a card table and mah jong in chemo. We got the corner room with big windows and one of my bc survivor friends was our fourth. It was a blast. Here's the deal, when we are all finished, we will find a place to meet and those of us who want will learn to play from those of us who can teach. And those of us who make great pastries will do that. And those of us who love ice cream will eat it. And those of us who kayak and walk and bicycle and run will do that. It'll be somewhere lovely like Nelso Canada although that might be too expensive a journey. We'll figure it out.  I talked way too much yesterday so I will quit for now.  ",

We'll still feel punk after it, but then no more except herceptin -- a piece of cake. Those of you whose children started school, my guys start after Labor Day as well. My favorite kindergarten story? When my second one began, I was watching a little girl in tears talking to her mommy. She said, \"It's not that I don't want to go to school; it's just that I will miss playing outside and the fresh air.\" I remember tearing up at all of her wisdom and I wanted so much to say, \"Run! Run while you can, honey. You're right. It's better to be in the air and out playing.\" We are pushing our children too fast too hard these days. What happened to childhood? I have one starting middle school. He is short and scared. He'll be fine. He's the same one who just received a WII from the Susan G. Komen Foundation for being the youth who raised the most money for the breast cancer walk earlier this summer. We had no idea there was a contest. He didn't have a WII. The only game console we had was a Game Cube we bought him when he got his kidney out when he was five. He is trying out for Oliver this week. Hope he doesn't get a big part as he just had a lead last year and it takes up a lot of time. Oh oh...I am rambling about sons instead of cancer. When do we get to say we are cancer survivors? After chemo? After diagnosis? After herceptin or radiation? After cancer-free for five years? What is that protocol? We had the BEST thunder storm yesterday. It cheered me. I know I have been a bit of a downer lately which is good because I am usually an eternal optimist. It means I am \"feeling my feelings.\" I get that I am depressed right now and I will check in with myself in three months to see if things have shifted. If not, I will get some help to shift things. If yes, it'll mean I went through a \"normal\" depression period. Speaking of periods, I do not miss mine. At all. What should I do with all of those Costco size boxes of Tampax? Save them just in case it all comes back, right? Is anyone laughing yet?  I am working on exfolliating. Shea is too big of a leap....Noelle, is Ahava okay? My hair is coming in more corse than I thought...it's a little softer than before but I was hoping to become a blonde beauty...it's gray and dark brown just like before...hmmmm. Can we talk about Michelle Obama? Did she do a great job or what? And, by the way, Adam asked if she had a mastectomy because he thought she looked a little lopsided. Is it time to stop rambling? Not yet! I am looking for that next pole dance picture and still planning my September 4 one. Sable, I am expecting a good pole dance from you as well. Talk to you all soon. ",

Last time I cut a drop more. Coming off steroids is TOTAL hell. It is the worst. However, pain can be tough. I much preferred pain to weepy/bitchy although I was weepy/bitchy anyway (think about how much worse it would have been if I'd stayed on 60 mg). Kerry, you have ONE more then you're done. Do what feels right to you and know that no matter what, the last time is different because it is the last time. Just let yourself get through. I was extremly bummed out and numb after even though I was relieved and happy. Bottom line is that some expect everything to be ok the next day and it isn't. This is your last cummulative treatment and your body will react to it even though your emotional self has some adren. going to get you through. The good news is that you are nearly DONE DONE DONE. Follow you heart. Follow your body. I tried to get out of the last neulasta and was told no, no, no. Maybe, though, it is because I get herceptin on Friday. Jen, I am headed for the farmer's market but not before I go check the mirror for eyelash stubble...I think you are beating my (*& on that now but I'll let you know.   I get to start my cancer rehab program tomorrow afternoon and will fill you all in on it.

I am going to swim in Lake Washington this afternoon. Woo hoo! Happy Sunday.",

All, Can I throw in a little scare here? I am scared about being her2 positive. We are 25% of the IDC population and I know we are supposed to be very receptive to herceptin (Hell, we get to take it for a whole year at least) but I have been scared about the her2positive stuff lateley. Otter, what is your take on this Ms. Scientist Research Wizard Godess? Obama was awesome last night and I called it on McCain choosing a female although someone mentioned the gov of Alaska a few days ago and I dismissed her as too unknown...but I have been saying he's pick a female for a long time. In my next next life I will be a political analyst. I say next next because in my next life I am going to be an athelete on performance enhancing drugs because I like steroids....I just hate the crash after.

It is slightly bumpy but not really hive-ish.....I am taking no chances and put myself on benedril for now. Plus, my conjunctivicrapis is back in my eye but I have drops. I am worried about taxol #2 as it is paired, the following day, with herceptin. My feeling is I get through this one with no allergies and I am home free in terms of finishing the next two. Geez, what a trek these last two weeks have been.  Kristy Ann, welcome home and take it easy. Bummer about chemosetback but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Roc, ovaries? What's the scoop?

Noelle, I just assume you'll fly there from anywhere in Canada as I forgot where you live. Also, the milk letdown thing and the hot flash business resonates for me. I hadn't thought about it, but it has a similar sensation just before coming on....as far as herceptin/taxol, they were administered separately so I could tell which effects were new since I had had taxol before AND, the fluish (Jewish) part came from herceptin cause it matched what others told me what might occur....HOWEVER it only occurs for some and I don't imagine it'll occur for macho mohawk chicks who swim. Seriously, it's a possible side effect and, for me, it was overnight. I had chills and the runs. Am still having the runs a bit, but may be cause of other meds. NEWSFLASH!!! I have hair sprouting on my lower legs (it never left my thighs and upper area but let's not get me ranting on that one again). I shaved in June but there is definite hair sprouting...and, there is a possible new hair sighting on my head. It is only five weeks after A/C PLUS I am on heavy taxol and my eyelashes are falling out like crazy and my eyebrows are thinning, but could it be? Seems early but last A/C was July 3 so it has been 40 days which is just short of six weeks, eh? Weigh in women. What do you think? ",

I wish I really did mellow on Shabbat. Years ago, a young man named Steve used to run through both sides of our summer camp yelling, \"Shabbat is coming! Shabbat is coming!\" He was so funny. He'd wear his bathrobe right before jumping into the shower to prepare...he died very, very, very young of a rare disease and many of our friends took up his \"Shabbat is coming!\" in his memory. To this day, my dh and I RACE to see who will say it first. It is fair anytime after midnight on Thursday since Shabbat comes in at sunset on Friday. Marty usually wins which is funny since I am way more conscious of time and days. It would do ALL of us good to remember to relax and stop doing the same stuff day after day. It makes sense to make at least ONE day very different....it's a good concept. I wish I did it more. ",

I am trying to exercise EVERY day stretching one day/aerobic the next. Am hoping to get on that map soon. It is soooo cool. I love it. My dad had adult respiratory distress syndrome...was in a coma for five and a half weeks...they were sure he was going to die. He was 82 at the time. Now, he is 87 and still globe trotting. His nurse tipped him over so he was face down for several days and that is what finally got things moving. Rock, can you pm me your facebook sometime? I know you don't want to share it here in case there are lurkers. Loving the queef/fart talk. You are so funny and, sadly, I have been there too. I am finding my sense of humor is starting to come back. And I'm really enjoying singing out loud to music and though I am stuck with my port until sometime in July, I am loving the end of chemo. I am thinking of those of you in radiation and sending you hugs. Public/pubic....yes...I worked in Seattle public schools before moving to my current job and I work in communications and I made the same mistake. Fell 800 feet down a mountain last February, Rock. That is when I discovered my lump. Like Kerry, I figured if I got up and skiied away (which I did) I can beat back cancer for thirty years or so. My onc says I will also get to do the oof....I am looking forward to that as it seems they are a source of too much estrogen, eh? Talk to you all soon. Glad your bro is better Cris. Goodnight. ",

But it is so much easier without the SE that went with chemo. Karin, I am afraid I am living through you vicariously....even the teeth sucking part. First off, it is nerve racking to be LIVE. I used to be a TV reporter and it was easy because there were no live shots then and you could always re-shoot a stand-up. But ask anyone --- it is HARD to be live on TV so if you're every sappy enough to watch American Idol, you can just imagine what they feel like when they are in tears and being asked to sing. I mean, really. You looked great and I can't wait, wait, wait to see the clip. The part that makes me happiest is that you got to thank Dr. Weiss for all of us as I keep saying someone ought to do a thesis on on-line cancer support groups. I believe they are healthier than live for many reasons which I will NOT attempt to share right now because I am trying to be a bit more brief. Sue --- LOVE your hair. Mine aspires to be yours. Jen, where in Ohio do you live and do they have good chocolate croissants (is that a lunch food?) Mary, The tearing up in the church/synagogue thing is fine. They are your community and want to support you in your journey. I just delivered a speech at our synagogue thanking my community for all they have done (see my blog if you want....just google Eddie Westerman...it is there under thank you) and I have teared up, wept, choked up, etc...it is human and beautiful and a safe place to do that. Kerry, Get that photo up there. The rest of you, Happy October. It is our 18th anniversary tomorrow and we are working on our post-chemo stuff and seeing a therapist and doing well. I love October because: it is a crisp month; great leaves; we got married in October; the gem/rock is opal and I love opals; it is the month of Kristy's b-day and my brother's too; and, of course, it means winter and fires are coming. One more question....anyone who was on taxol or taxotere still having that hicuupy kind of burping thing? That and some tingling are my only lingering SEs. ",

March 15 I was feeling around because I still had minor injuries and was checking to see what bruises were gone and what were not. I found the lump. I figured I had checked it out because I always had a lump of some sort. I asked my friend, an onc, if I should go in...she said, yah, but don't sweat it. I went in at the end of March. I moved all of my stuff from Federal Way, WA to Seattle (because they said it would take 10 days for a biopsy appt and Seattle could give me one a couple of days later). I woke up at 4:44 AM on 4/4 and knew it was cancer as 4 means death in China. I called my brother to tell him and he said that we were not Chinese, but more Native American where 4 is a lucky number. The call came in that morning at work from a nurse who knew NOT how to tell me. She, too, had a script and she was doing the best she could. Even though I already knew I had cancer in my heart of hearts (even the doc doing the biopsy was giving me a phone number for a surgeon) it was still a shocker. My cancer bully friend, Dottie, was nearby and I just remember walking into an office (not Dottie's) and shutting the door and crying. It was awful. That whole first night I kept weeping and saying I wanted to live and I wanted to see my grandkids someday. Each day got a little easier but the first days were darkest as well as the first days of chemo. Now I am convinced we are all going to live a long, long, long time.",

The hardest part of \"dropping out\" for a while is that I imagine everything from the best to the worst. We have all been praying and/or hoping and/or imagining your return and here you are. My dear friend...no one ought to be going through the EXTRA shit you are dealing with in addition to the health issues. It is a crying shame that you are dealing with it at all. I implore you to let us know how you are doing when you can and I beg you to PM someone just to say you're around if you don't have the time/energy/inclination to write. I missed you so. We all did. We are anxious to hear the results and we are all carrying shovels to smack the heads of those who (*&$ed you over. How DARE they say anything with a child in the room. How FUCKING CLUELESS. Sorry. I love you and will be thinking, praying and willing things to be better for you. Obama stuff -- sigh. I hope for better health care. I hope for better schools for all children. I hope for peace and an international reputation that is restored. My highlight was the music and the poetry. I dream of better days but I know it will take a long time. Just as we have to be patient with our healing bodies, we have to be patient with a healing world. Movies -- I have seen most of them. Still missing a few but check in with me if you're going to see one and I'll share my commentary.  Hair -- like some of you ahead of Jen and me in the hair department, my hair is beginning to be \"unruly\" and like some of you, it cracks me up. I don't want to cut it, but it looks so funny. Jen, it looks some like yours... Femara, so far okay. Also taking 2000 mg of D; 1000 mg of Calcium; Glutawhatever the hell it's called that we took during taxol to help with joints and fish oil just because I want to be smarter. I have gone from never taking anything in my life to one pill and six vitamins a day. Whatever it takes. Oprah, keep writin; keep dreaming; I doubt it's going to happen, but it was fun to write about us and I suggest an all-out campaign to get us on. :) I love you all and think of you often. Since Oprah probably won't come through, it might be time to consider a reunion of some sort in the late summer? Let's think on that. ranD....glad you are back.",

Listen, we are living with cancer and when we die, we will be dying with cancer. Some of us will die from cancer and anyone dying now is dying way, way, way before their time. Ideally, we want to live to our 80's and beyond but let's face it...some of us won't make it. We can't predict how this disease is going to impact each of us except for how much it has impacted us so far. Here's the deal. I wish I didn't have ANY of the wisdom any of us had from cancer but this experience has aged us all and caused us to have more wisdom. I wish I'd met you in very different circumstances, but this is what our life is handing us. We don't have a choice. All we can do is take care of ourselves and pace ourselves and live each day and try not to sweat the small stuff (I really, really, really, really have to learn that) and to just \"be\" whenever we can. Our perspective is different. It is vastly changed. Adrienne, you are right...it's screwed up that we don't have a cure for this damn disease, but what we have is years and years and years longer to live because of how far we have come. We must not give up hope. Alaska Deb and Annie/Heather and all of the other women who died in the last week and the last day and the last minute and the last second lived their lives the best way they could given their circumstances. We are going to do that each day. We are getting through crap and sometimes it is deeper and sometimes it's as if it doesn't exist, but we have to accept that we are LIVING WITH and LIVING IN SPITE of cancer. Can't deal with this for a while, go to Facebook. Sometimes it's good to take a break. But don't take a break from one another....just take a break from this disease. I am celebrating my 48th birthday, my 49th year and my first day after that stupid 48th year after my 47th birthday. I am thrilled to start anew and I start anew knowing that herceptin is part of me for every three weeks until August. If, like Noelle, I have to go off, I will and then I will get back on. I am on femara for five years. I am going to do everything I can to connect with others and remind people to get mams and do all I can to help women get diagnosed early so we can have a fighting chance. Got it? Love you.

      "Content": "Feb 27, 2009 01:05AM ewesterman wrote: Hi women. It is very early AM in Seattle and we're under a small blanket of snow. Schools are two hours late. I have no idea if work is two hours late or not, but I'm not going anywhere in the dark. This will give me time to write. First off, to RanD...Dear Rand, I am not pleased with the medical care you are getting from your doctors. I would feel very comfortable if you talked to more than one and if you changed to an oncologist you liked better if that is possible. If it is not possible, forget I wrote this as your convenience matters a lot as well, but if there are other oncs around, more than just a second and third opinion, you also should check them out when you are talking to them and see if you click better with one. As far as taking a chemo break, only you know what your body can handle. I support you contiuing the regiment as soon as possible, but I understand that taking a short break might help your body become stronger after pneumonia. In the end, a couple of good doctors ought to be able to help you make the decision with a sane mind. I can't imagine the pain you are going through and you have been an amazing trooper. I so want you to stabilize so you can get back to fighting this crap, but I DO understand your wanting to take a break. Like the others, I have friends who went the 100 percent organic, non-chemo route. For both of them, cancer came back with vengence AND it also came back with friends who did the full chemo route. Each of us is different. I have not heard of anyone who BEAT cancer for many, many years by going the non-chemo route, but having said that, I have never known anyone who was fighting pneumonia, the insurance world and cancer at the same time. I am constantly bombarded with well-meaning friends here who tell me cancer is all about diet and if I just cut out (you name it....meat --which I hardly eat anyway -- dairy, become a vegan) or if I just weighed 128 pounds, everything would e fine. My friend, Judith, died in her early 70's from breast cancer last year. I swear to you that the woman ate the most healthy diet EVER and did yoga every day for 30 years before she got BC but when it came, she was gone quickly. This is a tricky disease. You have to try to step out of your currently battered body and weigh everything out. If you feel like you CANNOT go on right now, talk to a couple of docs and take a week or two off unless they tell you you are making a HORRIBLE decision. They will help guide you. If they tell you you can't afford to skip 7-14 days, look at it again. If they tell you they get it, by all means, do it. If you are at full peace with skipping chemo for a week and your team of docs understand, go for it. But if they say no, no, no, no -- this is a matter of extreme importance -- you MUST keep going....look at it again. We want you to be around until you are in your 80's at least. We want you to get better, but none of us has had to endure your pain -- physical and emotional. I support you in stepping out on a limb to get another opinion -- even if insurance won't pay (I would help pay for a doc visit). That will help you make a decision AND give you a chance to see a different doc. In the end, dear friend, I support your decision. I want to make sure you have as much information as possible from more than just one doc. Okay? Meanwhile, life was very good here until, in the middle of the night when I woke up with a pain under my arm. It feels swollen and in the nodes. I am scared. I will make an appointment today but my heart is beating pretty hard. It hurts as well in a throbby way. I remember someone else had to deal with it....got feedback anyone? Caught up with the rest of you (took a long time to read and I love how chatty we all are). I am sad dear Oprah didn't \"get it\" but maybe we ought to try for a reunion on some other talk show as others have suggested. It's nice to see newer faces online too. Julie, it's really nice you're checking in regularly and thanks again for the VD card.  I see many of you on Facebook. Work has been extremely busy and I have 14,000 things to do before March 12 when our new director arrives. As some of you know, I was hired to be the interim director of Communications for a 90-day stint. I am coming up on  my year anniversary of that 90-day stint and can't wait to get back to my old job. It has been a long trek. Meanwhile, the whole time I was in chemo, I said no, no, no to a ton of stuff. Once I started feeling better, my guilt got to me and I agreed to too much stuff. And, so, here we are. I am interested in the Susan G. Komen discussions. My cancer bully pal, Dottie, is involved and I walked in the race two years ago then 32 of us walked this year. At the time, I researched and saw that much of the money went to research. Though I, too, was concerned about the commercialism part, I saw that it was a way for people to help. We have more local groups in Seattle and I have been involved with them as well, but I guess i should tell you that our son, Adam, was asked to be the honorary chair and the grand marshall at the kids race in Seattle this year for a variety of wild reasons. He gets to work with Edgar Martinez and he is very jazzed about that so no way can I pull him at this point. I guess I am sucked in and it's too late to pull out now. While many of you brought up very strong and valid points, I am hoping a chunk of our money does help breast cancer research -- if not going directly to patients. We are also supporting Gilda's Club here by appearing at the Surviving in Fashion show in April. I know that money goes directly to help patients. Adrienne, March is upon us. Let's make a plan to meet in Seattle or Bremerton. Pick a Saturday? Or is it easier to come in for an evening or have me come out and meet you? Can't wait. I am so scared about the pain under my arm. Geez...just when things were going so well. Skiing was great. I missed you all but it was nice to be away from cancer for a bit. It's great to be back. Congrats to angels who is portless and those finishing up their rads and herceptin....I am on with that until August. I go in next Friday. I have found herceptin to be a non-issue ...just annoying to go in every three weeks. Femara has been okay so far...just joint pains. I was told to up my vitamin D intake after my last labs. I was on 2000 -- now moving to 3000 but I hear some people are taking a zillion mg. Okay, enough rambling. I send you all hugs, thoughts and positive energy and prayers. RanD, I haven't sent you a card in a while. Did you laugh at the dog one? Hope so. I keep you in my thoughts as you make extremely important decisions. ",

That means I am going to be crabby, but it is time. I have never weighed so much and I allowed myself a lot of slack and it is time to get healthy now that I am feeling healthy if you know what I mean. This is going to be a long post so stop now if you're not into long Eddie posts. I told my onc, Hank, about Randie today when I went in for my check before herceptin. He shared that he has \"seen it all,\" and that when someone is going through what our dear Randie went through it is a sign that she would have had to suffer more, more, more. He believes her kids would have had to watch her fight with all her might just to be in pain and that, as terrible as her dying is, that it is better for her younger kids to remember their mom the way she was and not to have had to watch four or five years of hell and pain. He says they were already, likely, so distressed that she was in and out of the hospital draining her lungs and being in pain that, he believes, it is almost (not quite, but almost) better that she could pass in peace. He says he has stage four people who were destined to death who have lived twenty years and he has \"Randies\" who were supposed to breeze through with flying colors who just die. He told me to tell you all that, as an oncologist, it is so difficult to watch people such as Randie go. He was very kind. I miss Randie. Our vacation -- we had a very good one save the Randie news and, again, I am so grateful and thankful that you got a hold of me right away. I would have been even more distressed had I not known. New York was great; Montreal was elegant; Middlebury was fun for the 4th; and we discovered Portsmith which was lovely. Boston was terrific and all three of us enjoyed. We've heard from Max that all is well as well. The diet. What can I say? I am a piggy and I must cut back. I am going for the extreme weight watchers concept -- I will write everything down and do something active for an hour a day. I am setting my goal to lose one pound a week to lose 20 pounds and giving myself 26 weeks to do it.  Herceptin -- two more. That's it. Two more. All vital signs good at this point. Have a mam in two weeks for the other pesky breast and will schedule a colonoscopy to be done before port out. Enough on that. Jeff -- our friend, Jeff, is suffering mightly from pancreatic cancer. He is going downhill as he goes into round two of, taxotere.  You all -- Noelle, I hope your kitty is better. I hope business is good this summer or at least picking up and I think it would be cool if we put all of our Randie cash toward a relaxation basket. We'll see what the women want. Linda, GM out of bankruptcy so fast? Big union issues here in Seattle...Boeing trying to pressure unions into no-strike clauses in contracts. Bummer.  Kerry, They say swine flu is partying in Australia. I know you are good about walking and staying healthy, but this is your reminder....no swine flu, okay?  Cristine, Now, don't be mad, but the throw up thing on your bed (bummer that it is) still makes me smile because we have whopper vomit stories around here that make people cry with laughter. Max is not a throw up boy, but Adam did it with such personality and he started day one and still manages a good deal of it even now (though at 12, he finally seems to get it that the best place to throw up is in the toilet). Anyway, someday we will share barf stories. What can I say? Bodily fluids...a fact of life and sometimes runny and funny. Hope everyone is feeling better. Julie, Your grandpa has a lot of gall hanging around with that gall bladder. He's a tough guy and he will get through...we Westermans send him our thoughts for good healing. Kristy Softball, baseball, sports, sports, sports. It keeps them off the street and it catapults parents into a whole different subculture.  Jen, How many herceptins do you have left? Are you on countdown? How is your son spending his summer? I hope he's enjoying.  Mary, No more infections mehopes. I, too, like Colorado Springs as I grew up in Denver so you and Robin and I should have brunch at the Broadmoor (sp?) Hotel sometime soon. Robin, Make reservations.  Otter, Hope those fish are biting and you're enjoying. Gracie, If they put you on steroids, quit your day job and go be a jock. I think the country is ready for a breast cancer survivor sports celebrity. Jeano, I sent you a big old smooch when we flew over St. Paul yesterday on our way back. Hope you got it. Rock, Your words are a comfort to me very often so thanks for that. You are still rocking the bald and I love your spirit in everything you do whether it is ranting, raving, poet slamming or just checking in. Karin, Do you miss the kids or is it nice to be parafree for a while? Heather, How's it going in Nelson? Isn't this summer better than last?  Adrienne, Has your daughter settled in back here now? What is she up to? How is she doing? Any photography? I could check FB, but I want to get a mom's perspective. Sue, You checking in once in a while? Randie, I miss you, dear Randie I am missing someone and I can't put my finger on who...I will catch you next time. Love you all.",

I wrote thank you notes to my two favorite chemo nurses, Marybeth and Marilyn, plus one for the whole chemoland floor as they were amazing in all ways. I also wrote a note to the office staff at the oncologist's. The pharmacy (I always called them the witches as they always had to brew up my herceptin) sent over sparkling apple cider and a note and there were hugs all around at completion time. I am feeling like I want to tie up other loose ends....I leave the port in until August 31 so they can access me for my colonoscopy coming soon. I got the blood people to do extra tests today so when I have my physical on Monday, I won't have to do a blood draw. I have dental work and then the portdump on August 31. We had an amazing road trip down to LA and back with our kids. I have lost six pounds in six weeks as I am on the pound a week diet. I am planning on losing a total of twenty. I have been working out an hour a day minimum and that seems to be helping. Thanks for the post card, Otter. Montana is in my top five states in the nation for sheer beauty.

Linda...you were in Oregon? That state is another top fiver for me. Dana, am thinking of you and sending you hugs. Jen...you are next on the herceptin completion department. I am set free for three months. Love you all. Will catch up this weekend when I can get my kids (who are checking their computer stuff after four and six weeks) to share a bit more. Meanwhile, a peaceful weekend to each of you. Did I mention my mom (yes, the one who said she lost all of her friends due to my breast cancer) moved here? So far, so good. Gut nacht.",

It is good to see that we are all alive and KICKING except for RanD who is no longer alive but am sure she is kicking really hard in another space. I am worried about Dana. Anyone in touch? I will check Facebook later. It is a pleasure and a joy and sometimes heartbreaking to read about our trials and tribulations. I am trying to find a new balance in the BC world. I want to think about it less and less each day and am pushing myself to go that direction, but something or someone or missing you all brings me back to it. I understand that it is important to \"live with\" bc rather than pretend I never had it. Plus, my aching AI joints remind me every day I am on a journey of trying to keep it away or keep it at bay or whatever you want to say, but I just love living and I want to make bc a smaller percentage of each day. Finding a balance. Finding a balance. Finding a balance. Hmmmm. I love reading about what we are all up to. I send Cris thoughts and hugs as she deals with \"stuff\" and I send Otter hugs hoping things are better health wise as well as \"crisis in the family\"-wise. Just got back from a week in LA looking at colleges with our older son, Max. It was a joy to travel with him. He is a lovely, delightful and easygoing guy and we travel well. We looked at four schools in the LA area and it helped him get going down that path. Our other son is in a show in Seattle called \"The River Why.\" It is playing at this theatre called Book-It which delivers theater in a \"novel\" way. They stick with the book. He's doing five to six shows a week for several weeks and he's basiclally hardly at school but managing really well. People are starting to say he's gay. It's very interesting to hear people hint that your son is gay. I look forward to watching him grow and watching whether or not people's predictions come true. He loves what he is doing and it's fascinating watching him navigate this journey in professional theater at such a young age. They are asking him to try out for the lead in a show next fall. If he takes that part, we will have to get him out of school for a while. It's all a lot of driving and dashing about and it's fun. I have been loving our spring-like weather and am getting out to exercise each day as it is the best way to get vitamin D. Everything seems to be going along swimingly which, kind of, scares me which saddens me as I realize we lived in crisis for such a while that I question what's up when we are not in crisis. I want to get past that. I have an oncology appointment tomorrow morning and last time I went in, I had a big liver scare which only lasted 24 hours but it was scary and I am hoping liver comes back happier this time. I am on this thyroid medication so maybe that will make a difference. These days, I pop my cancer pill, my new take for the rest of your life thyroid pill, a bunch of vitamins and a piece of chocolate every day perscription (I perscribed that to myself) hoping that everything will stabilize. I am starting to think about removing my other breast and think the answer will make itself apparent so not really pushing myself on that one. I would like to lose some weight. I did lose a bunch (12 pounds) but think I've gained back about five...ho hum I like to call it the 30-year diet as I've been on it since college. I think of you often and do read and I do like to check in with you. Trying to find the balance. Olympics have been great. Inspiring. You are inspiring as well. Love to each of you.",

My suggestion is that you keep feeling ALL of your feelings and that you panic when you have to panic until it's gone. No way stuffing this...it's probably more than a year's worth of panic and it is probably screaming to get out so your body can heal again. Panic sucks and it is overwhelming. I pray that each attack is easier and that they go away and that you do whatever you need to do to help calm yourself....whatever it takes. You have people around you who love you. They will continue to love you no matter what. The only thing you owe to anyone is that you are true to yourself and your feelings. You have come back from hell and they are trying to pull you back in...that is terrifying. We are holding your hand so just know that you will not be pulled back in...we are all here holding you and your hand will not be able to slip away because even if it slips, one of us has your other hand; one of us has you around the waist; one of us is holding you under your arms; one of us has your other foot. You can panic all you want but we will not allow them to pull you back in. We are here and we are strong and you can do whatever you need to do...we've got you. We love you.  Our Race for the Cure is this week. Go to the West Seattle Blog and scroll down for a story on Adam and me westseattleblog.com....it's under Komen and just a couple of stories down. Adam is third in the state in fundraising and we both have a TV interview tomorrow. We've raised more than 5,000 together and the race is Sunday.  Our team is third in the whole race in terms of fund raising. We are pleased. Noelle, we are in Burlington for the 4th of July and in Montreal on the 2nd and 3rd...need some recs as to what to do...want to come party on the 4th? Want to do Montreal on the 2nd or 3rd? Boundaries, women, boundaries. Get out the *&^%ing shovels and USE them. If not, send them to me and I'll smack them on the heads...each and every one. To all the new boobies, the very breast to each of you.  Love you all and that's it for now.",

You make me laugh and cry. My cousin, Amber, just created a \"boobie around the world\" bra for a fund raiser but I can't, for the life of me insert it. Here is the paper she wrote with it. The Journey Dedicated to women I love: Eddie, Donna and Audrey Written by Amber Ziring This bra is inspired by the journey we take through breast cancer and beyond. I say \"we,\" not because I have personally had breast cancer, but because three of the most important women in my life have. And while their experiences are indescribable to someone who has not lived it, everyone connected to breast cancer walks on this path in their own way. Our journey begins without time to pack, prepare or decide. There is no way to predict that your journey will begin that day: all you know is that everything you understood has vanished, you are in a dark and lonely place where there is no path. With no preparation, direction or plan the journey of a life time begins. Like arriving at the airport only to find your NEEDED luggage has been lost, those on the breast cancer journey begin to learn about what is and is not truly necessary: control, hair, a breast. We learn to rely on Cancer Bullies despite childhood lessons teaching us to play nice. We rely on our support network, even on the days we push them farther than we know we should. We rely on ourselves, knowing we will make it, even when we think we can't. On the hot, dusty days in the desert we are sometimes given crackers and Coke when what we really needed was water. But we keep going. Some of us write home of our adventures and some of us keep our journey to ourselves. We learn that journeys demand us to be strong, even when we have no desire to be. We do things we aren't proud of and hope it won't be noticed while we are in this faraway land. But as we move from the dark abyss of unplanned travel, we begin to see colors and perspectives previously lost on us. Some of us arrive at the end of the journey, wrap up that time in our life and never look back. Some of us change in ways we never imagined: pushing ourselves into new adventures so we can live once we have survived. Some of us are lost at sea, but never forgotten. But we have all taken an amazing journey. I am TRYING to get the picture in...it's in my documents and it's a jpg...anyone help?",

Last time we saw them, our sixteen-year-old, Max, was 16 months old. He is Jewish. She is a Sikh. Their three children are an incredibly gorgeous mix of curls and eyelashes and smiles. Last night, when most of us definitely should have been in bed (as our kids are on their last week of school meaning we get up at 5:45), my friend, Dan ,and I were hot tubbing our weary bones. Marty and Dan's wife were hanging out with us but outside of the tub then Max came out to practice his presentation on the Manhattan Project which was due today. It was after 10 and the final, final light of dusk was fading in the western sky. The honeysuckle was pungent and it was cool to think that Max was willing to listen to our tips for him for his presentation for the next day. Everything felt so \"normal.\" So sorry about the drain infection, Mary. It will go away soon. Jean, cool that you are jogging again so soon after surgery. Hope all sick children heal before travels. My friend needed a tampon the other day and for the first time in my adult life, I could not help out on that count and I was really okay with that even though I scoured through my home looking in all of  my old hiding places. So funny. I think I mentioned this before, but I didn't get much response so I will try again (or maybe I just think I might havementioned). Do any of the rest of you have this somewhat desperate desire to \"make up\" for lost time due to chemo? I am feeling like I \"owe\" myself and my family twice as much summer this year since chemo kind of wrecked last summer. It's odd, but I feel like I want to have two times the fun. I allow myself too many treats (because I can taste them this year) and too many good indulgences. Anyone else going through this sensation? Just curious. I have a herceptin at the end of the week and then it's down two three or two depending on who wins out (my onc or me) on the last one. Okay, here is my question for the day....do I go ahead and do that stupid colonoscopy while my port is still in so I can be accessed that way (no IV) and be done with it? Or, do I remove the port (the sooner the better, right?) and blow off the colonoscopy until sometime next winter. Weigh in on this subject women. :) Ciao. Randie, Just sent you a little card to say hi but I am saying hi here first.",

I told onc I would consider going on after colonoscopy (this Wednesday) and \"deportation\" surgery on August 31. My question is will the meds: *   slow down my weight loss program (seven pounds in six weeks) * make my energy go whacky? I like exercising an hour a day and feeling good * make me moody? I am generally even and in a good mood a lot. Got answers? Still haven't heard if the Cipperly family received our package. I haven't checked to see if the check I sent was cashed. Will do that this week. Love to all of you. Wish me luck on my cleansing colonoscopy (I am a colonoscopy virgin and a bit nervous).

Today was kind of stormy here -- the beginning of autumn kicks in and I was walking with four people and two were a bit in front and two were a bit in back and it was on a very flat safe road and I just closed my eyes bc I could hear from their voices behind and in front if I was getting off track....and I felt the wind and the mist and the cold and I felt so alive and I hope I never lose that feeling. There is definitely something after cancer that settles in as we learn to live with cancer. Okay, so I finally chatted with Bob (RanDie's husband? -- thought his name was different) but he says they never got any kind of package. I sent it with their proper address and my proper return address in the beginning of August. No one has cashed the $650 check and I will cancel it on Tuesday and write a new one and send it off, but at least it explains why we never heard back. I sent it in a US post office bubble pack envelope and had them weigh it there at our post office so I know the postage was correct. I suppose it is floating somewhere and will arrive sometime back here, but meanwhile, I will cancel the check and resend. The tragic part, of course, is that all of the cards and letters and Ran-D-isms were in that package. I am crushed, but I feel it will appear at some point. Sigh. I am so sorry for I know how we all put time into our cards, letters, memories. I will let you know what happens, but meanwhile .... The pound a week is working...and a bit more...lost 10 in eight weeks ... celebrated with a Reese's peanut butter cup...guilty pleasures, what can I say? Otter, welcome home and I suspect your \"Floating lump\" is a little cyst or something that is very, very NORMAL. My washer and dryer are both on...my husband is in DC for a wedding of dear friends of ours. Our older son ceded me the computer only now and only after watching a bunch of teenage movies (but funny) plus Sunshine Cleaners (I think that is what it was called....Emily Blount and Amy Adams...very good( and our little one is at a slumber party. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law and niece are here for Bumbershoot and, like Otter, I am up but not because of meds or worry....just because. Love you all ... Jenn deportation is GOOD. Noelle, hope all is well. Rock, love those FB photos. Must sleep so I will go for now. ",

I want this board to be kind of boring and comforting and delightful in a way I can't really explain...not that I don't want us to lead exciting and adventure-filled lives but I want them to be exciting and adventure-filled sans any health issues except constant checkmarks for bill of clean health. Lots going on in this family, but I haven't posted so much in any spots...too busy but good busy. Our older son got his driver's license and that is very fun for him. We are paying new insurance fees as all of you who have had kids this age do. He was also just accepted into the Amigos program which means he will spend 6-8 weeks in a Latin American country this summer living with a family and in total immersion Spanish and volunteer mode. He will go with one other American student (one he won't know from a different part of the U.S.) and, together, they will work on a project for the summer. He is excited but a bit nervous and what he really, really wants to do is go back to his summer camp to be a Counselor in Training, but he knows this is stepping outside of the comfort mode and he knows it'll, likely, broaden his horizons. Our other son, Adam, is just completing his creepy play, the Ray Bradbury one -- The Veldt. Today is the last performance. It has been a good run. We had five Oregon family members up for the weekend which is one reason I am here...just stalling before flipping four sets of sheets and picking up matresses around the house. We are also preparing, now, for Adam's bar mitzvah which is in January. We sent out our first round of invitations (the ones to out of towners) and we'll send out in town one in a few weeks. We give the out of towners a chance to reserve rooms at IslandWood, a lovely place on Bainbridge Island where we are having the bar mitzvah, before letting our in-town friends and family reserve. We have much to do and I am happy happy happy to not be going to doctors every week. This is the longest I have gone without an oncologist visit since April of 2008 and I love that. My weight-loss program continues but slowly....I have 12 down and 8 to go. I am thinking of you one and all....so all is well. I will head over to the pink page though it is my custom to stay on this page only. :)  Love to all of you.",

So...let's take a little time to reflect. For most of us, two years ago, Thanksgiving was as routine as they are -- we had our gripes and our joys and our loves and our challenges. Then...many of us were diagnosed with breast cancer the following winter and early spring. We went through the hell of chemotherapy together and we bonded over bodily fluids and tears and steadfast stubborness. We learned about one another through recipes and fantasies and life stories and the hell of chemo. We stepped up to the bar (the pole) and we kicked cancer in it's ass. We cussed at it and we cried about it and we grieved and we fought and some of us fought really, really hard and then died despite the fight. We have seen others on these boards die and we lost one of our dear ones. We lost RanD but I am getting ahead of myself. Think back to last Turkey Day. Most of us were mostly through it all. Most of us were just getting through the cool lesbian commando hair look and dealing with baby fine curls. We were mostly thankful to just not be going through chemo and the Thanksgiving meal never tasted better because we were surrounded with family and our tastebuds were back. And, still, we soldiered on and THEN we lost one of our own. And we miss her. And we think of her all the time. Time, once more, is flying. It was so, so slow during chemodays. We have each had our scares and our adventures and our learning -- we have each gained wisdom. I am thankful for your wisdom. Happy Thanksgiving. May Thanksgiving 2008 be a reminder that we must always be thankful for our lives --especially the chance to celebrate Thanksgiving 2009 and, I pray for each of us, Thanksgiving 2010-2050 and beyond.

We have scaled mountains (high on this mountain, the clouds down below...) We swam across tumutuous currents. We have loved; we have learned; we have leaned; we have lamented. we have one another. I cannot put into words the feelings I have for you as words take away the value of the emotion. Therefore, please know, you are forever in my heart.",

I am steeling myself) will live in his neighborhood. Maybe they'll hit it off. This has been an incredible summer (and winter, Kerry). Like you, Kerry, I am mostly elated all the time. I am trying to stuff two summers into one to make up for last year and it has been very successful so far. Randie would be pleased at those of us\"catching up\" on vacations and walks and relationships and life. I long for her to be able to do the same thing and I hope she is more comfortable in another place but we think of her everyday and her spirit and memory is among us all. My \"slow start\" diet has worked well so far. I have lost five pounds in two weeks and my plan is a pound a week for the next 15-17 for a total of twenty to twenty-two pounds which will get me to where I want to be. I was looking at a chart at the onc's office once and it was one of those, \"If you are five feet five inches, you should weigh 128\" charts and I snorted because that is meant for 18-year-olds as far as I am concerned. I gained nine pounds during and after chemo and I was 13 above where I feel MY chart says I should be so it's going to happen. Here it the best part of this news....I have been swimming a slow mile once a week and it is making a humongus difference in the aromatose inhibitor department. Like Kerry, I started on femara. It last four months because though I have a huge tolerance for pain, the femara seemed to settle in my shoulder blades and especailly in my left one which sustained some football injury a zillion years back. The pain made me wince for a long time. The onc told me I was a dope (He was nicer than that) and I switched to aromasin and it made life much, much more manageable but the big pain was still in my shoulders although much less. Two weeks ago, it took 18 laps just to loosen up my left arm while doing the crawl. This week...it took about three laps and the pain was so much easier. Needless to say, I am recommending swimming to all women with sore joints. My dh and I are just about ready to leap and finally purchase a piece of art for over our bed. We went to the Bellevue Art Fair yesterday and I have to say it was an amazing sensation for the eyes. It was three fairs in one -- a fine arts, a beautiful crafts one and one we never even made it to...we spent four hours at the first two. Women, your mouths would have dropped open as you marvelled at the amazingly beautiful art. Think about your favorite galleries but all together under one roof outside where it was hot but shaded and beautiful. Each artist had to be juried in and they are from all over and they are sitting at their booth so you could talk with them. The crafts one also had magnificent stuff. We bought a friend a house warming gift of beautiful coasters. Most of the art was way out of most of our price ranges, but the woven art and the ceramics and everything else were not to be believed. And we had no kids to say, \"Come on...let's go.\" It was great. Spaeaking of kids, my little one is sick at camp, but they seem to have it under control. Our older one almost got kicked out of his Israel program not because he was making out with a girl; not because he missed curfew; but because he lied about it...he tried to sneak back into his room an hour later and it was \"staked out\" by staff. Really....camp -- a good place to sneak out. Israel? NO. You always want to be accounted for in Israel. They spared him and we were glad because we didn't want him to have a bad taste in his mouth related to this program as he has had the time of his life. The poetic justice, though, was that the next week, he chose (on his own) army and we got a call telling us he hated it because he had bug bites and was eating meat out of a can and was forced to do dishes for five hours and on and on. That suited him well after all that making out. Things have a way of working out, don't you think? Okay, I had kid digression. This is a very good summer. As I mentioned before, I am even enjoying my mosquito bites as no mosquitos dared approach me last year because they could send my usual lardy self was pumped up with poisonous chemo. Now, they are back to biting and that makes me feel normal again. Who'd have thought? Ramble, ramble, ramble. Ciao.",

I was thinking about you yesterday -- thinking about all of us and feeling that you were the one who had to endure more than the rest of the gang and that we'd all look back in a few months and say, man that sucked for Randie but all is well now. What I see, now, is that all is NOT well and though I'd love to wish it away, I can't and I am so sad about that. I, too, would be in major panic and be taking valium, etc., to try to calm my nerves but it is a very overwhelming time for you and your family. I know that we human beings are like cockroaches -- we adjust to all kind of wild circumstances and find a way to go on. You, my dear, are not a cockroach, but you will soon have to use that spirit to adjust to your new circumstances. Know that I have friends who have lived with mets for a very long time. I have a friend in stage 4 cancer who has lived more than 10 years after the mets arrived. Know that my friend, Joanie, has mets on her lungs and is currently in Nicaragua with her daughter and she has been doing very well. I am thinking of you all the time. Please continue to connect when you feel like it.  Women, we are heading out the door Monday...seeing shows, heading to Canada, etc. I am running around like a chicken with my head cut off as I prepare my 16-year-old to leave for Israel for several weeks and prepare us to head out. Below is today's blog post...sorry to double it. Read if you wish and know I will try to check in...won't be back until July 10. Love you all. We are busily packing for trips abroad and trips to the East Coast. Our house is being taken care of by Michel Jean and the weather here is perfect while it is raining in the East. We do not care about any stupid rain. We understand rain and we know how to deal with it. We are not going there for the rain. We are going there for the INSIDE activities... Max may be flying to Israel with a friend from Bainbridge who is going with a different group. That would be nice. But we get him for the first several hours. As usual, Adam is going through his pre-travel stuff. I think some people's bodies react differently to the idea of leaving home. He currently has two stitches in his head which we will have to remove somewhere in New York or Canada. Some may ask, well, hey, how did your son get two stitches in his head? That is a very good question. He has this little bald spot on his head and the dermatologist who agree that it was not serious and not anything to worry about decided to biopsy it anyway. Even though there is hair growing back in, she thought a shot in the head and a scrape of the scalp would be fun. And you know, those heads really bleeds so that explains the stitches. I am hoping no brains fall out when we cut out the stitches. Plus, he ate two bagles and 30 cherries and drank no water before going out to play a couple of hours of tennis in the son and, you are not going to believe this, but he threw up. Fluish? No. Fever? No. Cherry and chocolate chip bagel fever? Yes. Max has been great about laying low these last several days. He is catching up on sleep and watching baseball and relaxing before his journey. I appreciate that very, very much as lots of people are catching major flu so we are happy he is hanging around here. We watch Billy Elliott in anticipation of the show. Can't wait. I have a ton to do today so off I go. It's a gorgeous sunny and terrific day. The best part of this journeying, I think, is that I feel it's the first REAL trip after chemo even though herceptin counts as simple chemo. I am jazzed to go. Ciao for now.",

I would feel so sad to catch up on this later. The entire train car knows about Randie as I told them all about her after I burst into tears after reading the text message (thanks so much, Karin, for texting me. We are not back until the 10th. Whatever you decide to do, count me in financially and count me in for writing whatever you want...but also know that each of us ought to write what we want. For tonight, here are some words for you. We just saw Billy Elliot which is, of course, about a boy who is 11 who loses his mom a year earlier. I believe Sam is younger, but I also believe, these words apply to him. His mother writes a letter to him that he is not supposed to open until he is 18. Of course, he opens it immediately...these are the words (and if you really want a cleansing weep, you can Youtube \"Billy Elliot\" and \"The Letter\": I must seem a distant memory which is probably a good thing and it will have been a long time -- And I will have missed you growing, And I'll have missed you crying And I'll have missed you laugh. Missed your stomping and your shouting, I'll have missed telling you off, But please Billy (Sam), Know that I was always there. I was with you through everything. And please, Sam, know that I will always be Proud to have known you Proud that you were mine Proud in everything And you must promise me this, Sam In everything you do Always be yourself, Sam And you always will be true And I'll have missed you growing,  I'll have missed you crying  And I'll have missed you laugh. Missed your stomping and your shouting, I have missed telling you off, But please, Sam, know that I was always there. I was with you through everything. And please, Sam, Know that I will always be. Proud to have known you Love you forever. Love you forever. Mom This song -- these words are so relevant to me tonight and resonate in a profound way. Meanwhile, women, these are the grim statistics, right? We are twenty (or so). Now we are down one. The hardest piece for me is that Randie never got the chance we have gotten which is the chance to be be out the other end -- to take a breath, to process and to regroup. We are all finding our new normal. Randie never got to even begin to look for her new normal. She never got to have her head above water. I am sad for the pain she endured, and like all of you, feel a sense of relief that she is no longer in pain. But we all know any amount of pain would have been worth it had she gotten more time with her kids and with her husband. There ARE NO COMFORTING words I can offer...all I can say is that if you think about our group, this was bound to happen to us....a very few of us will never have to deal with breast cancer ever again and a very few of us (Randie for now) is gone way too soon. Most of us will be rid of this fecker for quite a while but will, likely have to deal with it again sometime in the future -- and may it be years and years and years -- but it is reality. And it sucks. Our job is to continue to love, hope, research, advocate, stand by and stand up for one another through everything as we did with Randie. Our job is to hold one another as we did Randie and to send all the energy, thoughts, hugs, prayers, etc., we could possibly send -- and we did. And we loved her so. We are allowed to all feel survivor's guilt which most of us will feel. We all know if could have been any of us just as it was Randie and we are scared about that (and we ought to be scared) but we all need to know that this is a stage we must go through just as every piece of this journey has stages and chapters. My dear sisters, It was too much for Randie. It was too much for any human being to have to handle. It was too much for Sam and for her daughter and husband to have to watch any more. It was too much pain and darkness and now she is at peace (as many of you have said). So, know, dear sisters, that this is who we are now...we are one short of being complete. We will always be one short and we will always cherish Randie and hold a place for her in our hearts. One day we will be two short (and may it be in twenty or thirty years)...may some of us die of old age (not cancer). May all of us weep and grieve together and individually. May all of us experience for the first time what it means to lose one of our own and may all of us come out with more perseverance than before. I am in Montreal and have internet access available tonight and tomorrow night. Whomever is organizing -- let me know what kind of message/letter/ idea you want me to pursue and I will get it written and put on here tomorrow night...then you all can add, subtract, edit and so on. I love each of you with all my heart. ",

Seems we should put all money toward flowers already purchased and I could still collect letters and Randi-isms (and who volunteered to help with that and will you help?) then I could get them all off to Noelle and she could include it all with a BIG relaxation basket? Hate to open this up again if it has been opened....let me know. Meanwhile, go ahead and make checks out to me and I'll keep them until, say, July 25th or so then cash them all and send cash to either Noelle to add to relaxation basket if you want me to do that OR I will use some for donation to breastcancer.org and some for giftcards and send all letters. I await your directions. More later.",

It's when people start talking about 20 years from now or 30 years from now....they take it for granted. It throws me into an immediate, \"God, I just hope I am alive then.\" Then I get mad at myself for having that attitude even though it isn't a bad attitude -- more of a realistic one.

I felt very, very whole. I encourage people to try Nordstrom if they have one near by. Having said that, we are all different, but the foob is working for me. I wear lots of lightweight clothing and the bras are very pretty and I feel very good with my foob. Meanwhile, I am thinking about what it'll be like to have a second mast and the numb question as I really like \"feeling\" a hug. I am confused. We all are to some extent but I am pleased we are discussing this instead of nausea and getting shoes to help with nerves in our feet and ports and so on. We are progressing. This is our next stage and while we miss Randie terribly, we must celebrate that we are at this stage at all. How many women with breast cancer ever got to this spot a generation before us?

While I know that your soon-to-be-ex loves your children, the idea that his needs are more important than them pisses me off to no end. I have a lot of anger around men who put their needs ahead of their children. I am comforted knowing your sister and other friends and family are there for you. I am calmed by the fact that some of our sisters here have gone through what you are going through. I know from my own experience that there are times in marriages when things are better and worse as those who are married or partnered know there are always bumps. BUT STILL, what is it with people who think it' okay to create havoc and think they are okay in the eyes of everyone else? Okay, I will stop ranting. I am sorry to put it here as you are seven pegs ahead of me...I am just hearing this and I look at you and your girls and I know about your strenght and so on but I am still so PISSED off at the man you have been living with? I will stop for now because this is NOT productive. I send you hugs. I am glad you tucked your anger somewhere else instead of saying it is not there. I encourage you to work through that anger when you are with people who are safe and who can keep you safe. There will be lots of grieving and readjusting and anger and you owe it to yourself and your children and your family and your HEALTH to make sure you do some anger work...with or without a therapist but with someone who can help you. Hitting a tennis racket on pillows really, really, really hard and screaming and yelling is one way....just do it with someone to support you and somewhere far away from where others can hear.

Rock, I am so sorry you have been having to deal with all that is happening all at once. DO you think someone is pulling strings sometimes or sending \"adventures\" or \"challenges\"? Do you think there is a master schedule somewhere for how much crap someone has to have all at once ..... like maybe some can deal with more than their share? I send you hugs and strength (as if you need that, but I guess we all do sometimes.) Christine, of course it was a clerical error, but still!!! I wish each of you had the opportunity to get the care we each deserve. The one thing about this whole liver thing this week is that my oncologist called on Tuesday evening at 8:30 to tell me he was concerned (he always calls in the evening so that didn't freak me out. What freaked me out was that I was sure he was calling to yell that I wasn't taking enough Vitamin D). I had the CT scan on Wednesday and the people were amazing. I had my results delivered by the doc himself (no clerical errors there) that evening by 9 PM. He called my home and our son gave him my cell and he called to give the all clear. Everyone should not have to deal with this crap, but when we do, one lost night sleep is enough. I am thankful I got good news within some 25 hours. I wish all of our cancers had been \"clerical errors\" and \"misreads\" and that none of us would have to adjust to being under a microscope forever and \"living with cancer.\" I notice no one is weighing in on the new mamogram recs. I am interested in what many of you are feeling. I, myself, having been diagnosed at 47 after finding the lump myself am at a bit of a loss. I have read what everyone is saying and I am normally someone who believes that less intrusiveness is better and that less stress for women is better, but I know so many who were diagnosed way before 50. I would not have known I was \"high risk\" until after I was diagnosed as none of my cousins came forward until after I told them I had breast cancer. I think the weridest part of all this is the way they decided that one in 1900 wasn't worth the trouble but one in 1300 was... so odd. Anyway, every once in a while, I do start thinking about what if this is all a hoax and what if we are all just playing in to big business and a weird medical web. I get a little \"Twilight Zone\" about it then pull myself back and tell myself I am alive because of early detection, etc. Weigh in women. Speaking of weighing in, I plateaued a long while after losing 12 pounds and now gained two back. The doc tells me now that I have started this very exciting purple pill thyroid stuff, I will lose weight quicker when I work out (which I have been doing religiously) and when eating right (the chocolate seems to be the problem here). We have invited my friend, Jeff, to Thanksgiving in our home. He is our 12th. He has pancreatic cancer and has been given a few months. He can come if none of the rest of us are sick. I have alerted everyone to to a self check on turkey day morning and see if there are any scratch throats, running noes, etc. I am thrilled he is coming. We also have a dear family coming (kids are similar ages to ours, etc plus, bonus, they are bringing their 80-something mom to hang with my mom) and my boss who is delightful, pithy, interesting (he worked for the Kennedy family and for the Edwards campaign) and Australian (which adds a good accent, Kerry). What about the rest of you? Take care andI hope to write more between now and Thanksgiving....love you all.",

It is done laperoscopically. It is no biggy. It might be an emotional biggy but it is an easy surgery. PLUS, you will lower your chances of cancer returning. Ovaries be gone. I am struggling with the ideal of taking off the other breast just as you will be struggling but I am pleased you know and that you can make your decision based on knowledge. Love you.

Like many of you, I hope she is at peace and in a place that is comfortable. We have cancer. It is not going away. We are living with cancer. We have to face that. We were so fucking busy just surviving chemo and rads that we didn't have the time or the inclination to process that. Some of us have had to deal with this long before we/they were diagnosed as it was a family affliction. That doesn't make it any easier, I don't think, to process. Some of us will die before our time. It will suck. It will be unfair. It will be awful and we will learn to handle it with sorrow, grief, anger, grace, sadness, overwhelm and whatever the hell else we have to do. We will all end up with more wisdom. We already have way, way, way, way more wisdom than most women because we have seen the other side and we are choosing NOT to go there at this time. Sometimes it is not a choice and we are going to have to face that and it is going to suck because, like Deb, we will leave behind loved ones. But let it be known, Ms. RanD, that your stage four does not make you a candidate for that path any time sooner than the rest of us. People live with chronic cancer for a zillion years and one of us might walk out the door and be hit by a falling brick tomorrow morning (although that will mean walking somewhere in an urban area...maybe we ought to stay away from there.). The bummer, bummer, bummer, RanD, is that you ought NOT to be going through such fucking pain. As far as the rest of you go, it is impossible to begin to try to catch up with you because you are abuzz with all kinds of news. I love my foob but still think about recon, but since I am behind you all a bit (except for my herceptin sister, Jen) I just think about it a bit. Jean, I respect that you were keeping things quiet, but know that we are here for you through anything. Keep healing dear one and keep getting through. It humbles me when people from other threads visit us. I feel so honored to be a part of this group. You are rock solid. Now, I am heading over to Facebook to friend request a few of you who I have yet to friend request. I love that we are here and took Karin's pledge and I love that we are there as we are weaving one another into the fabric of our \"regular\" lives. Good night. I love you all.",

We didn't hear and decided they chose some young things but guess what? We just got an email that we were selected as a package deal. We both get full makeovers to be televised the day before the fashion show. We are floored. Okay, you know, Oprah had her chance and blew it so we're going local.

Dottie and I had a great time picking our fashion clothing for the fashion show at the end of April. We also bought thong underwear but don't tell anyone. That' it for now. Will check back soon.",

May we all live to at least 100. 102 seems pushing it, don't you think? Loved hearing about Jen and Robin and the photo was magnificent. Ciao all.",

He's in the top 11 in the state. We've had a good time. His letter he wrote about me made me cry. Thinking of all of you. Lots to do this weekend. More soon. Hope you're all well.",
