I have been disabled since 2003, I grad. in 1990.  At this point I am a 18 month breast cancer survivor and 6 yr. colorectal cancer survivor and I expect to continue as a survivor!! My breast cancer was estrogen positve and I am on arimidex and have managed to succesfully have multiple frustrating and painful side effects. Doc says I have best chances to take it anyway .  I have often wondered if some of the medications we have handled could have lead to our cancer. In 1995 the pharmacist at the nursing home I worked at told us to use gloves with tamoxifen as it put us at risk for cancer, after many yrs. of handling it!! I have wondered if there is a tie to the  tamoxifen, many nursing home residents are on tamoxifen throughout their lives in our area. I wonder what other drugs risks we have been exposed to for many years before they were known, and how many are still unknown. my cancer was invasive but was still caught early as they were doing mammograms and ultra sounds every 6 months...or should I say were supposed to do both breasts every 6 months...later a story about the screw up with that, any way lets just say I am blessed. I had radical bilateral  mastectomy  and no chemo, no treatments. All lymphnodes were taken from right side, and only 3 from left, all were neg. I worked mostly midnights, homecare for Childrens hospital and other local agencies the last few years,  homecare gave me much more flexibility with scheduling. I raised 6 children and the flexibility helped me to maintain a active involvement in their activities. I by no means understand all about breast cancer , I have been afraid to read about it since diagnosed. I hate statistics and fear them. I already have a problem with anxiety attacks and the few times I have read anything...I have had 1. At this time 18 months out, I feel good about getting a better understanding about breast cancer. I   purchased my prosthesis  4 months after surgery, hated them and have gone without since, and I feel much better about myself without them...everyone is different. To me they were a every day reminder I had breast cancer. Anyway I am so glad to meet all of you. My name is Jeannie and I am the proud nana of 4...soon to be 5 grandkids..the first one being 4 yr. old Tyson...hence my name tysnana",
