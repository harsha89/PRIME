Doc said lump is palpable but bot see on on an ultra sound. My breasts are dense and with the HCG they want to move quick. I have stopped estrogen therapy to be on safe side. Gad I am getting referred and this is not being taken to lightly. I had no idea some breast cancer can be HCG positive.Im just staying calm and patient. That is about all you can do until the dx. I keep thinking if that ER doc hadn't did that pregnancy test we wouldn't have known. I praying everybody has a fabulous day. Its sunny and warm here in Virginia and I think I'm gonna take advantage of It. Thank y'all for listening.",
