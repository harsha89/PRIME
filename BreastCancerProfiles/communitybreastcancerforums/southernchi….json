I found my breast cancer early.  It didn't show up on mammo, but did on ultrasound.  I just passed my one year anniversary and am doing great.  I Thank God all the time that I found it before it spread.  Give yourself the same chance.",

It is not an easy decision.  I had a terrible time making a decision for myself.  But once I made the decision, I felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders.  I have never looked back and never once regretted the decision I made.  Becase I made it not listening to anyone but myself and I know it was right for me.   Good luck to you.",
