I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy and was deemed \u201cclear of cancer\u201d I underwent six weeks of radiation therapy and now am on a course of Tamoxifen for 10 years. Since starting the Tamoxifen in late April I have developed extremely heavy periods, which thankfully I have never had up to this chapter of my life! Sometimes twice monthly. I met with my medical oncologist and asked for a pelvic ultrasound because I suspected something was wrong due to the heavy bleeding. I had a transvaginal ultrasound that showed abnormal endometrial lining thickness. It was then decided to have a endometrial biopsy to check things out. I had that done last Friday found out Tuesday that all is well no cancer or hyperplastic cellular changes. Amen to that! My next course of action could be an ablation or perhaps a prophylactic hysterectomy. Since my cancer was driven by both estrogen and progesterone and the Tamoxifen is squelching these hormones (the uterus) needs estrogen to be healthy my body is fighting itself.... help has anyone undergone a hysterectomy in this situation? Thanking you in advance for any advice~ Log in to post a reply",
