I can't get my physicians to address the long term effects of radiation which include leukemia and sarcoma.  I have been researching the newest data on using oncotype to predict logoregional recurrence which is what radiation addresses.  According to that, I only have a 4-5% risk of local recurrence but my radiation oncologist insists the rate is 20% or greater. ARG!  I am T3N0M0 Estrogen/prog + HR -  7 cm tumor size.    One day I am ready to go for the radiation and the next I am terrified of the side effects.  Heavy decision.   There is a trial going on using curcumin to reduce the skin side effects of radiation.  It's an antiinflamatory that may reduce the effects.",
