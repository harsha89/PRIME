I was wondering for those of you who have more than 20 treatments (Joytxs, you have 33?), what are the total dose and why so many? Thanks.",

However, I just read an article (https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation/t...) and it says: \"...In 2018, the American Society for Radiation Oncology updated its guideline on whole-breast radiation therapy. The current guideline says that most women diagnosed with breast cancer who will have radiation therapy after lumpectomy should be treated with accelerated whole-breast radiation therapy as the standard of care. The preferred hypofractionated dose schedule is 40 Gray in 15 doses or 42.5 Gray in 16 doses....\" I was wondering if the \"current\" guideline would be the \"standard\" guideline. ",

Today during a part of the pre-op, she had the ultrasound to locate the clip which was placed during the biopsy 5 months ago, but the clip could not be found. They decided not to do the mammogram and thought it would not be helpful to locate, either. How would this impact the surgery? I e-mailed the BS about this, but am still waiting for his reply. Since both the MRI and US (after the chemo) indicated the tumor had been resolved and the clip could not be found now, how are they going to locate the original tumor site during the surgery?

The breast surgeon today did reply that \"Clip not seen on ultrasound. We will have to be creative\" (during the surgery). Tomorrow will be the surgery, we are kind of nervous about what \"be creative\" really means. My wife told me that even during the ultrasound right after the biopsy almost 6 months ago, the doctor could not locate the clip. I was wondering if the clip was even not in place from the very beginning. However, I was told from the MRIs before and after neo-adjuvant chemo, the clip does show up. The possible reason they did not use mammo is the original tumor site was at one o'clock and close to the chest wall, they even could not image the tumor during the initial diagnosis, that is exactly what you explained Thanks again",
