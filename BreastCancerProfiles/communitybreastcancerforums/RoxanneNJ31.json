They were denying radiologist doctor charges because they said it was out of my network when I was going to the hospital (innetwork). I explained to them that I have no control over which doctor reads my scans and after three phone calls they said you are right and reversed the charges.  Its a shame that we have to fight for every bit of our treatment My advice be persistent and make sure you let them know that the answer no is not going to fly with you, that you will contact them as much as you have to and even threaten them with the Department of Insurance and Banking Department in your home state.  If we don't take charge or our own lives then the insurnace and legislators will take control of it for us and that will give us inadequate and limited care that we need to survive. We are a strong community and need to fight for us and ours since no one else seems to care. If you need help in your fight please contact me direct and I will do what I can to help you because we deserve the best treatment options available. Good luck and many hugs. ",

      "Content": "RoxanneNJ31 wrote: Please read and talk to your onc if you are on this drug like me:  FDA panel recommends against approving Genentech's Avastin for breast cancer Published: Wednesday, December 5, 2007 | 6:53 PM ET Canadian Press: Matthew Perrone, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON - A panel of U.S. government experts said Wednesday that Genentech's cancer drug should not be approved for expanded use in breast-cancer patients. The Food and Drug Administration's advisers voted five to four against the new use, on grounds that the benefits of the treatment did not outweigh potential risks. The agency does not have to follow the advice of its panel, though it usually does. Initially approved in 2004 to treat colon cancer, Avastin was the first drug to fight cancer by stopping nutrients from reaching tumours. Such \"targeted therapies\" were thought to hold promise for eliminating chemotherapy, but that promise remains unmet. South San Francisco-based Genentech Inc. asked the FDA to approve the drug for use alongside chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer who have not already taken other drugs. While some doctors already use the drug to treat breast cancer, FDA approval would have increased the practice significantly. Avastin, which is also approved to treat types of lung cancer, was the company's second best-selling product last year with sales of US$1.7 billion. \"We are disappointed by the split vote of the advisory committee,\" Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Genentech's head of product development, said in a statement. \"We believe that Avastin can help meet a significant unmet medical need for women with metastatic breast cancer.\"Continue Article Prior to the meeting, FDA scientists said that while Avastin slowed the progression of cancer, it did not improve patients' life span overall. Patients on Avastin and chemotherapy survived on average 26.5 months, compared with 24.8 months for patients taking just chemotherapy. FDA said the difference was not significant. Scientists also questioned the drug's safety. Patients on Avastin had 20 per cent higher toxicity levels than those on chemotherapy. Common side effects included hypertension and blood clots. The panel's decision has implications for all drug makers working on cancer therapies. Increasingly, the FDA wants to see overall survival rates improve - not just the delay of cancer's progression - before it grants U.S. approval. Avastin, long a recipient of superstar treatment and heavy touting in the Genentech portfolio, has also got the attention of increasingly competitive rivals. Earlier in the year, Britain's GlaxoSmithKline received approval for Tykerb to treat patients with advanced breast cancer. The FDA is scheduled to make its final decision on Avastin in February. While most analysts leaned against an approval decision for the drug Wednesday, Morgan Stanley's Steven Harr suggested the FDA could show some leeway given the narrow panel vote. Harr also pointed out that of the five cancer specialists on the panel, four favoured approval. Dx 6/5/2007, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 2/30 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I was on zoloft for only 2 months when I decided to take myself off.  i like your husband had allot of issues with the drug. I am now in counseling and only take xanax when i am having a sever panic attack.  I felt like it was changing me, that i was looking at myself from the outside. My mom has been on anti depressents for as long as I remember. Paxil then zoloft. Finally after 5 years I convinced her that the zoloft and paxil were making her worse.  i made her change her doctor adn she is now on lexapro.  This is truely her wonder drug.  The transformation was amazing.  Maybe you should have your husband talk to his doctor to change the meds to lexapro. Maybe it would be right for him as well. Please remember especially because us women take on way more then what men do because we are raised as the caregivers and a lot of the time we give away too much are really the one who needs the support as cancer is a very tricky and hard diease to overcome. You need all your strength and energy to fight the green eyed monster (cancer) and need all the outside outlets you can. i hope it all works out with your husband but just know if you ever need strength in numbers the breast cancer sisters are here for you.",

I am a year into treatment, he dropped my abraxene and so far Im holding stable with no progression. You have to make the choice for you and their is no right or wrong answer, its whatever your most positive about because the mind something plays heavy in your overrall well being and response to treatment (at least thats what I think and sticking to it lol).

Please lets all stick together and get what we need, proper medical insurance and monies to survive this terrible diease.  We did not ask for Cancer but we need to survive and the government is not giving us the proper outlets. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope we all fight this together because one voice is overlooked but many are heard. All my love and hugs go out to my cancer sisters and brothers....

It is not the 1920's and the Government needs to reconize that we need medical care.  If we all stick together, then we can make our voice heard.  Enough is enough.  We are sick and tired literally and the reality is,  we need the medical care now, not in 30 years now.  Why not give us the care we need now...... Its just not right and I hope that change goin to come soon.... Thanks for listening. Roxanne ",

My pain stopped and I am on Abraxene, Zometa, Zoladex and Advastin.  Maybe the abraxene and advastin will work for what you need it for. if you need anything, please feel free to PM me.

Abraxane, advastin, zometa and zoladex. His recomendation was the 2. (Abraxene) because of the fast progession.  I was on Abraxene for 8 months and now have some decrease in the mets but the blessing is that it is stable.  Now I am just on what he calls maintenence and its all the drugs listed in 2. but the abraxene.  I am doing very well haven't had too many side effects and the pain has ceased (had bad pain in my shoulder and back).  I am very grateful for this onc since he was my second onc and did what he said he was going to do stabilize my mets.
