It took 5 days for me to get my results and I called the doctor's office and radiologist multiple times. It turned out ok for me and I hope that your results will be benign too. Remember 80% of biopsies come back benign.",

Maybe it is just a cyst, but you won't know for sure until you take a closer look at it. I hope you'll be ok, let us know.",
