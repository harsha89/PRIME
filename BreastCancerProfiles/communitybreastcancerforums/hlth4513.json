Actually, my arm had been swollen for a couple of years before my BC DX - but I never knew until my MX that 6 of my nodes on that side were \"scarred\" and not working.  I have a custom compression sleeve that I wear when exercising, but other than that, I have just been really careful. Yesterday I pulled a muscle in my arm (the one where 9 nodes were removed). It a long story - but involves a 75lb Golden Retriever puppy. It is very sore and I am freaking that this will make my LE much worse. I have been wearing my compression sleeve and I have been icing it - but can I wear the sleeve 24/7? ANy suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks! Beth Dx 7/2/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/9 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
