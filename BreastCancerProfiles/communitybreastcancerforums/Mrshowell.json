There is an amazing support group on Facebook just for phyllodes sisters. It is a very confusing disease because not a lot of drs know about it. The support group has atlas 1000 ladies and you'll get a lot of your questions, concerns, and fears helped there. Good luck facebook.com/groups/PhyllodesSupportGroup/  Kimber",
