Did the mammogram then radiologist wanted an ultrasound. During this time I'm hoping for your good no problems. Well Instead I got biopsy two days later that was on July 7th they said I would get the results 2-3 days. I finally called them on July 13 and the nurse calls at 5:00pm to tell me the dr is out of the office until July 18th and she can't go over the results and he can see me at 9:00 on 18th. I'm terrified. The feeling I got from the radiologist and his nurses were not good and they did not give me any info. I feel like in going crazy if not for my husband I think I would have gone mad by now. I received a letter from radiologist stating your mammogram shows potential breast problems and we have sent results to your dr please get in touch with him asap! Has anyone else had to wait this long for a negative or positive result? I have a very bad feeling!! Log in to post a reply",
