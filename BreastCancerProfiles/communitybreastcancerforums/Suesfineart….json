Tomorrow, I go to my second chemo (TC). I am certain that accessing this port will be the most painful thing and I'm not looking forward to it. Last treatment (my first), i had the port put in and also the first chemo... they allowed it to be accessed so that was no problem, but I had to have an infusion of saline two days later. The nurse accessed the VERY NEW port and I lit up... thought I was going through the roof. Now, the pain continues off and on.. today it's pretty bad.. applied lidocaine and taking ibuprofen. I am VERY concerned about accessing this bad boy tomorrow.. wondering if the length of time the IV is in affects the veins or the number of times it's accessed. The nurse said that some chemo drugs play havoc with the veins, not sure if my taxotere and cytosine do that. Any information, ideas are very welcome and thanks in advance.

The pain I experienced was indescribable. It hurt to move at all. Getting up from a seated position, getting into and out of bed. I couldn't dress myself without my husband's help. The minute it was out, I felt relief. Now, only one more chemo. I should be able to do that through IV> ",

Combing it was very painful and taking a top off over my head was also quite painful. I had cut my hair very short anticipating hair loss. I read somewhere that the pain would subside if I had my head shaved so I did... and the pain has stopped. The only problem is that it appears that my hair isn't falling out , I also seem to have hair on other parts of my body also.... am I going to keep my hair? Was I silly for shaving it? Any comments are very welcome..
