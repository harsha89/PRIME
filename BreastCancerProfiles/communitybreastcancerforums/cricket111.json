Expanders were put in at same time as mastectomy. I had months of Chemotherapy , then Radiation therapy to the right side. All went well until 3 plus months after Radiation, I had reconstruction surgery. Implants were put in. Left side healed well. Right side, radiation side did not heal. It's been almost 4 months, Dr did surgery In office. Cut out bad skin and restitched. Within a few weeks I was back at the office and he, once again, did surgery and cut bad skin and restitched. ugh... It been another few weeks and it's opening again. Mostly a hole in the nipple area. Dr. wants to take the implant out this week and not put anything in. No expander... Nothing.... Sucky thing is, actually all of it but I'm dealing with this on my own. Not easy for anyone but its really tough by oneself. I'm scared, I think worse than the mastectomy! What if taking the implant out, I still don't heal??? I suggested hyperbaric chamber and dr. wasn't ok with it. Idk I'm confused as to what to do. For some reason the hole right side is painful. Dr thinks removing the implant is the only solution but is it????? Surgery is tentative for next week.",
