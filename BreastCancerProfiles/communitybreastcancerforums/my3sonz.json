I have some questions, please tell me how any of you have tolerated this chemo combo?  I am soooo dreading going through it again but know there's no escaping it.  I work as a reading tutor in an elementary school and want to try to keep working, I love my job (well, most days), my onc said if I feel like it I can still work but to really be cautious due to all of the little germ carriers. I'm just not ready to give up and take this.  I'm p.o.ed that cancer has to show its ugly face once again.  I feel guilty that I am robbing my boys of a childhood that doesn't involve a sick mother and I may not be there for them soon.  So, please give me any info anyone has, I would really appreciate it!  I've been pouring over this forum and need to hear from others that \"get it\".

I so hope I can keep working, I love my job so much and am afraid if I have to stay home that I will spend so much time thinking about my illness that it will really bring me down. Carol",
