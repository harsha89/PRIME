The clinique that I'm going to is in afiliation with John Hopkins and I think it's kind of american too. Even Oncotype is used mostly in US those days. This is a plus for them, in my opinion. AS  I know soy is not that inoffensive to the hormons. Better not. Doctor said 4 times chemo, every 3 weeks will be enough for me. God help me to choose well. My son is to young for that. (Sorry if my English give you headache :) )",
