    "Content": "mollyboc wrote: I have to go from a MRI on monday to \"rule out\" brain mets. I am preparing myself that it may \"rule it in!\" I have been bothered with headaches, nausea, dizziness and a get sick feeling for about a month now.. finally I called the doctor and they immediately schedule me for a MRI. Everything that I have been reading gives a pretty depressing report on brain mets. I am trying to stay positive for my family which is getting harder each day when I feel like crap. I am 38 years old and have had two breasts cancers in 12/05 and 11/07 six surgeries, a course of chemo, radiation, tomax etc. and here I am facing the possibility of brain mets. Will this even end.. I feel my girls have already spent the majority of their tiny lives they are 5 and 8 dealing with a sick mom now I worried they may lose their mom. Please sendÂ  a dose of positive thoughts because I sure could use they right now! Log in to post a reply",
