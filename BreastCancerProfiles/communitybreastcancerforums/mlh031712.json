      "Content": "mlh031712 wrote: So I've had a negative mam and ultrasound and have seen a general surgeon who feels that it is probably not BC. But my concern is that I've in menopause for almost 6 years and I'm on estrogen and progesterone shots. My left breast is dull and achy and the pain is radiating to my armpit and up near my collar bone. I've read a lot about BC not being painful but have also read that people had the same problem and it was painful. My surgeon recommended going in to just remove the entire area if it affected me that much but stated that he didn't want to just jump to surgery. Any thoughts or suggestions????

Never had an issue before but this was really odd to me. I'm hoping my Dr calls me back Monday so that I can move forward with things. I'm learning a lot on here! thank you so much!!Â ",

She said it maybe a cyst but wanted me to get it checked. I had a mammogram and ultrasound yesterday and they found NOTHING! I could feel the lump yesterday morning and I'm very frustrated with this. I left a message for my obgyn to review the tests and call me back because I'm not happy with this and want to know what my next steps are. I've never experienced anything like this. Any suggestions?? Log in to post a reply",
