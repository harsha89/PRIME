I'm sorry i'm not in better shape before starting, it seems daunting to increase physical exercise during this time but on the other hand If I do try to up the exercise i can blame whatever aches and pains i have from being horribly out of shape on chemo :) EZRunner - I do water exercise and swimming and I have to say its so good for everything - mental, physical, water retention (i am hoping it will help with steroid bloat. I recommend it highly, its like getting a massage while you exercise.    ",

Sat in a recliner. got my IV - then my pre-meds ( dexamethasone, Kytril, Pepcid and Benadryl), then the Taxol. Attempted to ice my hands and feet and just couldn't tolerate it, it was too painful for me. My nurse told me to bring bags of frozen veggies next time and they may be more indirect. -- I was surprisingly high from the Benadryl. 50 mg of it is a lot. I'm still pretty hopped up on steroids so I don't feel particularly bad tonight. I had a couple of \"episodes\" of feeling kind of dizzy and weak but they passed. I've been eating ok, but i have periodic stomach cramps. Also periodic leg cramps. I went to the pool and did 1/2 hour of water exercise and felt great for the next few hours, so I'm definitely going to try that again. Not much nausea yet. But I take nothing for granted - all bets are off when the steroids are gone. Still - Day 1 is over and the 20 weeks of active chemo I was looking ahead at, is now 19. So thats pretty cool",

Warning - the entirety of the rest of this post is complaining. Sorry in advance, its just where I am today. I was so good about exercise the first two infusions but the same day port + infusion 3 just sapped any will i had this week. People talk about Taxol being \"easier\" and maybe it is, I don't have what to compare it to, but nothing this week has been easy. My lungs are super sore, which as an asthmatic makes me nervous but I called the doc and she's not worried because i'm not short of breath. Still Its making me super anxious. My biggest problem is my neck. either something is swollen back there (either from the port placement or the taxol) or I injured it, but no matter how I position my head I feel shooting pains and numbness somewhere. Its like a crash course in how the nerves move through the body. Between my lungs and my neck, laying on either side makes me feel like i can't breathe all that well, so sleeping is an adventure. Then I finally fell asleep and random nausea woke me up at 5am this morning (my infusion was tuesday, and i had no nausea then. why now?) Oh and i started shedding. I'm kind of ok with that.. it was the first piece i made peace with but with everything else its a nuisance I'm hoping the port just made everything a little harder this week and that next week won't suck. I could use a few good days before the next one.  ",

Spend entire week coughing 10/16 infusion. done with antibiotics. spent entire treatment coughing. like a full hour of hard core bronchitis choking asthma cough. Every muscle in my body hurts. I feel like I ran a marathon. I don't look like I ran a marathon however since I gained 10 pounds since chemo started on 9/4. And I seem to have a cervical bulging disc that my doc said is probably \"benefitting\" from the additional systemic inflammation and is pinching a nerve . leading to numbness up and down my left arm. Three cheers for Taxol .. the :::cough::: \"easy\" chemo-- my behind. On the bright side I my super sexy crew cut (i seriouesly love it)still covers my head, thinly but completely. My doc was shocked that i still have this much hair. so there is that. And by some stroke of weird lucky my eyebrows are thinning in the pattern in which i naturally shape them so they actually look good. I take wins where i can get them Much love to you all, gonna go through and catch up and try to check in more. You guys help sosososos much Hope everyone is having a tolerable or better week",

Also, if you are prone to reflux, that could be compounding things, maybe sit reclining rather than laying down entirely if that is a problem. Good luck - I hope it passes soon ",

I met with the genetecist and was negative for mutations on 20 different genes besides the brcas (also negative on those), which is great. I will follow with her evey few years because she's sure i'm positive for a colon cancer gene that has not yet been identified. (My father, aunt, grandfather and great grandfather had it, and my sister had pre cancerous polyps removed at 32). Also - when I had my surgery, me and my family/friends met this amazing couple in the waiting room who had been through SO MUCH but were riotiously funny and had the best attitude I've ever seen. They really got me thru surgery day. When i looked across the infusion room today, they they were in the next (i don't know what to call these, \"areas\" booths? Best surprise ever! This time we exchanged numbers. The less good news. My veins, annoyed upon learning that we'd be doing this every week and not just once, decided to stop cooperating. Sticks were hard, blood draws were hard, infusion was painful on the arm, and they had to stop and move the iv a few times. so.. I will be having port surgery sometime in the next week or two. Not the end of the world, and probably better in a host of ways, but I had hoped to avoid it. The mixed news - she lessened the steroid by half today so i'm much less wired, but i feel much more conked out. I came home and took a massive nap with the cat. Onward through week 2!",

I can easily see becoming addicted to wig buying. 1. My real hair:   2. Wig 1 (needs adjusting this was just me trying it on)  Wig 2  All my friends love the first one and don't really like the second, but I love them both.",

They had me send over my pathology report from the place it had been done and arrange to send my slides from the path lab so that they could retest them. Both were simple paperwork procedures. Once she saw my initial path report they scheduled an appt. I met with her and her nurse for a while. She discussed her impressions of my tumor, explained hormone receptor status, described the choice between lumpectomy (for which she felt I was candidate) and mastectomy, explained recurrence and survival rates. She discussed removing lymph nodes, how they decide on how many to remove in the moment. She explained potential complications from both surgery and lymph node removal and gave me odds on those occuring.Explained what would happen aftter surgery and who i would likely meet with next. What recovery I could expect from either surgery. She told me that mastectomy is always an option with breast cancer but she felt that a lumpectomy was a decent choice with me. I asked her if I let her choose what would she choose and she said lumpectomy. I decided to trust her. The approach after that was to rule out things that could suggest mastectomy instead of lumpectomy I had an MRI, genetic testing, and a biopsy on a second suspicious area on something else that turned out to be cyst. All of these appts were scheduled by and arranged for by my surgeon's office. While everyone's experience is different. I found that the practice I went to (which is part of a major cancer center at a major hospital), prioritized making things easy for the patient, both emotionally and administratively. This is something that is very important to me and I'm glad I went somewhere like this. good luck at your first visit!",

I've stopped reading stats. predictions, r prognostications and the like. I was driving myself crazy with something I couldn't possibly know. Just my favorite little piece of encouraging thought. Every statistic you read is based on some period of time, often 10 years, that preceded it. Which means its out of date the second its published. They improve treatment all the time. We will have, on average, better outcomes than the people those numbers are based on.     ",

      "Content": "Mar 11, 2019 09:22PM - edited Mar 12, 2019 10:59AM by pcranky Hello All. I needed some mental health time while transitioning out of chemo (Last day was 1/15) and into radiation (started 2/20) but wanted to weigh in with my experience in case its helpful to anyone. I did 12 weeks of weekly Taxol followed by 4 DD AC every other week.I know everyone's experience is different but if any of you are needing to hear that someone found AC manageable, I mostly did. A few words on taxol first: I had some sort of allergy to Taxol which led to my having asthma for the entire 12 weeks (and one rather severe allergic reaction during infusion). It also seemed to aggravate a bulging disc in my neck which led to a lot of pain in both arms for a lot of the 12 weeks, so I wasn't too sorry to see the Taxol come to an end. it was manageable but I had a harder time with it than a lot of people do. I kept quite a lot of my hair through taxol and almost all of my eyebrows, but my eyelashes fell out toward the end. AC: All four of my ACs went pretty much the same way (with some variation) I infused on Tuesdays with premeds of Emend, Pepcid and Steroids. Got the Neulasta OnPro as I was leaving and it activated 27 hours later. I took Zofran at 10 or 11 on Tuesday night and continued it every 8 hours through Sunday afternoon. I originally stopped it (at drs. suggestion) on Friday and found that i got really nauseous on Sunday morning so we extended. I had a compazine prescription also but never needed it. I took a daily Claritin through Saturday for the Neulasta and never had any bone pain. Around 11 am on Thursday morning I the fatigue hit. I generally slept most of Thursday, Friday and Saturday getting up to eat starchy foods (lots of them.) and drink water and then I'd go back to sleep. The crushing fatigue would lift around Sunday afternoon and I was mostly ok from then on out. If I had had to commute to work it would have been much harder but I worked from home once out of the fatigue state. At around day 8 or 9 I tended to get bad diarrhea that lasted for the next three days or so. I thought it was random at first but it repeated with each cycle. AC #2 was the hardest for me because I ran a lowgrade fever from the Neulasta. AC 3 and 4 were progressively easier, I think I got used to it a bit. Also, I made sure not to go long without eating, and to drink enough water. It made a huge difference. an empty stomach definitely makes nausea worse and dehydration makes everything worse. I drank a lot of gatorade during the first 5 days of each cycle and a lot of water and it helped. Side Effects: Hair loss. What remained of my hair ran for the hills after week 1 of the AC. My eyebrows and any remaining body hair did the same. Mouth sores: Had none, and I'd be lying if i said I did a whole lot to prevent them. Nausea: Mostly covered above but a few more things about it. I remembered that Yellowb had said that she had had nausea that didn't always seem like nausea but Zofran helped it I took that to heart. I had this weird \"ill at ease\" feeling that I couldn't place and i took Zofran and it went away. Have food in your stomach. Part of the nauseaish dread I had of the next AC, it turns out, was from being able to \"taste\" the Adriamycin and dreading doing so again. When I was diligent about keeping popsicles in my mouth during that part of the infusion, it was much less bothersome. Fatigue: This was easily the worst side effect. Its indescribable but thankfully relatively brief. And it got better. Sleep when you need to sleep. Appetite: Yeah, that was just fine. I gained 21 pounds. Aftermath: I went back to work at 4 weeks following my last infusion. The first few days I was EXHAUSTED by the end of the day but my strength ramped up pretty quickly. I suspect it would have been hard to do whenever I started so I'm glad I didn't wait much longer than that. I'm now up to my usual pre-chemo step counts and i'm upping the other exercise. My eyelashes came in almost immediately but are very light. My eyebrows started coming in at 6 weeks. Now that i'm at 8 weeks they are fully in. I already need to shave my legs, which hardly seems fair. I have a nice layer of dark fuzzy hairlike stuff on my scalp - its evenly spread over the whole scalep. I look like i have the worlds shortest crew cut and I like it. My post-AC echocardiogram was normal, but showed a 10 percent decline in ejection fraction and trace amounts of pericardial effusion (fluid). I'm not thrilled about either of these things but they are at non-worrisome levels. (my Ejection fraction went from 70 to 60 .. both are normal) I will need to do a follow-up echo in May. General Advice. 1. Try to eat well even if its challenging 2. Drink. Drink Drink 3. Try to keep moving some, even if you don't want to. It is far easier to retain strength than to rebuild it. But if you can't, you can't. 4. Listen to what other people have to say about it, but don't let it panic you. Everyone's experience is different and it is possible to freak yourself out over things that may never happen to you. 5. If people are offering to help. Let them. If they aren't, ask them. If that doesn't work, come on here and meet new people. 6. There are a lot of groups out there that provides both support and 'stuff\" and there is no shame in enjoying them. I loved the Look Good Feel Better program through the American Cancer Society. I signed up for Chemo Angels which was great and gave me two \"angels\" who wrote to me every week. That mail cheered me up every single week and I cannot recommend the org enough. Lastly do not hesitate to avail yourself of your medical team if you are having a problem that you find unmanageable. You aren't bothering them, it is what they are there for. I hope this was at all helpful. Amy. PS: Have something planned to look forward to. A trip, a treat.. something    ",
