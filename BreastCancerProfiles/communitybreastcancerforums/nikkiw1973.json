I have been taking Herceptin since May 2014 and Tamoxifen since March 2014. My tumor markers started out at over 2000 when I was diagnosed. I am thrilled to say that I am down to 180 a year later. I get Zometa infusions once a month. I am supposed to get radiation on my upper and mid back in a few weeks. This will be round three of radiation. I have mets to lungs, spine and ovaries.",

I asked my doctor if nosebleeds were a side effect and he said no. I see now upon reading here that it is in addition to the runny nose I now have. I have nausea for about 10 days after treatment thus far and I have fatigue, very little appetite. I tabernacle spasms in my side, stomach and legs. Was switched to this after taxon stopped working. Prior to that,had tried tamoxifen, herceptin and xeloda. Glad I found this thread.",
