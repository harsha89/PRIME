In my dreams, people are repelled by my reconstructed breasts. In my dreams, I lose friends because they see them in my dream. SOmetimes, I'll be having a really great one, like I'm on a date with Bon Jovi or something, and I will \"leave\" the dream early rather than risk Bon Jovi (ha ha) seeing my breasts. Conversely, this phenomenon has made me feel closer to my hubby. He really likes my new boobs and makes me feel feminine and sexy. I guess the reality is more important than the dream. Esp. in this case.",

My recovery (15 weeks post double mast, 2 1/2 weeks post revision surgery) has been so slow. I am young and was a triathlete right before my dx. Thank God, I can't imagine how difficult the recovery had been if I hadn't been! In some ways, I have come to terms with constant discomfort and about 50% pain (less and less but so slowly). This new year, I'm getting back into life like this isn't happening. I know that sounds a bit delusional but after so long, it's what I have to do. The best and most effective part of my recovery is 2 things; taking pain pills when needed; this saves my sanity and I'm much less grouchy with my kids and hubby and PHYSICAL THERAPY.",

I have to admit though, I'm relieve to finally find someone who is going through something similar to me. Misery loves company, you know. I am 12 weeks post bialteral, latis dorsi with bilateral SNB removal and reconstruction. I had my drains for 4 weeks. I then went in for 6 weeks to have my right side drained. Recently, my back has swelled. The ps explains that the severed nerves are tangled up with the scar tissue (that resulted from all of the aspirations) and is causing all of the pain. I said, \"No shit\". Anyway, he is going to anesthetise my back to \"release the pain cycle\". His theory is if my back can relax for a few days, perhaps the body will begin to heal itself properly. God, I'm so sick of my story of pain, but I appreciate the forum and for you reading.",

I, too have been to multiple pain specialists, PTs and struggle with my GP warning me EVERY month that I might be taking too much vicodin (no more than 2/day unless pain is severe like last night). Why don't they know more? Why is there no warning? If the stats are right, anywhere  between 20-65% of women undergoing breast cancer related surgery suffer chronic pain! We deserve to NOT be in pain. We deserve to NOT be called drug addicts. The vicodin work for me. I've been perscribed so m any diff drugs and tried nerve blocks, dreaded trigger point injections and would be willing even to endure another surgery if it could help! But so far, just the vicodin helps. Of course, the pain and the drugs side effects affect me negatively in my daily life. I'm only 39. My pain specialist told me I would probably have this pain for the rest of my life!! Is there NOTHING that can be done? So frustrated and depressed this week about my GD pain!",

It was a life saver when I was first diagnosed and longer. Thanks for being here for me and I'm sorry that you all know what I'm talking about (another club we don't want to belong to). Getting the word out there is a great idea. Sign me up. My worst pain is not in my implant area. It's actually on my right side where my lat dorsi muscle used to be. I have a large nerve bundle (my theory, no one really seems to know) that lives there and causes me most of my vicodin pain. What is it? Why do I have it? Can I get rid of it? Why does no one know?  I sometimes have shotting pains in my armpits and around my chest up to my pectorals. I can't do push-ups or pull ups. I tried and my whole body swelled up and I was laid up for two days. WTH? Again, so nice to finally \"talk\" to people who truly understand how I feel. Sometimes the lonliness is the hardest part. ",
