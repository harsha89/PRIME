I found a lump a month ago that didn't go away after my monthly buddy left.  Things happen so fast that we just educate ourselves and go through it!   I tooo have my doubts at times and think about all of the people I would like to leave nice letters for and some that will be shocked when they read theirs.   Has anyone else gone through IDC????  And if so what were your procedures???",
