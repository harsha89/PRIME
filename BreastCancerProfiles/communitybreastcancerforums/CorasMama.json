The doctor's all, \"No, you're just feeling a lot of pressure.\" And I'm like, \"No, I WAS feeling a lot of pressure.

(For those of you who read my previous thread, the tech got sick, and it's been rescheduled for Weds.) I want to know what to expect. How much will it hurt? How much will the lidocaine shots hurt, and how deep do they go? How deep does the core needle (is that what it's called) go? Do they insert the core needle more than once, and in more than one place? Will it hurt when the lidocaine wears off? How much, compared to, say, dental work? Will I have a bandage over it, or just a bandaid? For how long? Will it scar? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
