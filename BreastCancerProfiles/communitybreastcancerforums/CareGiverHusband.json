    "Content": "CareGiverHusband wrote: Hello - free to San Francisco Bay Area. Would prefer not to ship due to size and weight. These come with \"good luck\" since my wife did not develop neuropathy during or after AC + Taxol. There are two sets or 4 each. You need two sets because they cool down too fast during infusion. Also included is the rolling 28 quart cooler - perfect size plus wheels - heavy! I will throw in some freezer packs. I bought all the above based on some very helpful advice/links on this site. Catch because FREE: you must give ALL away just like me and it must be immediately after chemo completion! These must be rotated to the next person as quickly as possible to help as many people as possible. Can meet at Starbucks in Concord - east bay. PM via this site. PS: my wife just completed radiation this last Friday!!! Log in to post a reply",
