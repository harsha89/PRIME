Now that I think about it, is it common to be taking off the estrogen before follow up ultra sound ? or they pretty sure its cancer already ? Now that I have read everything online I know now there is a bi-rad score but she never said anything about this or size or anything . I was in tears and couldn't remember what she was saying . PLEASE anyone tell me anything asap I am n knots Log in to post a reply",
