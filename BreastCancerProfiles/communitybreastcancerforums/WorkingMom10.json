My CT scan showed NED, but my bone scan showed a new area of activity in one of my ribs on the right side that was not there before. I freaked out about it, but my onc told me that it was nothing to worry about because it did not show on the CT scan. They had me do a rib xray in case the activity came from an injury of some kind, but that xray came back negative. I am not having any significant pain around that area either. I'm concerned that something should be done, but I wanted to ask if anyone else has had bone scans show something like this and your onc said it was nothing to worry about. All the other areas of my bone scan where my previous cancer was all showed stable. I am currently on tamoxifen and completed 6 months of weekly chemo in April 2017 (taxol). Thanks in advance!
