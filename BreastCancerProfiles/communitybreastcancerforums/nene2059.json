Then along came BC.  I wonder if the Clomid did not speed up the BC process even though my BS said no.  Any way we did see a fertility specialist after diagnosis and I went on Lupron to \"protect\" my ovaries from the chemo by shutting them down during the treatments.  There was no guarantee but it was the only option I was comfortable with.  I did not want to put chemo off until eggs could be harvested and I was not willing to go through the hormones that would take with hormone + BC.  I went through all that only to find out when it was time to take Tamoxifen and hopefully be off to my new life after cancer that I was a poor metabolizer of Tamox and I needed to have my ovaries removed.  WOW.  Talk about devastated.  I did what I had to do and I have been to many baby showers and have basked in the glow of pregnant friends many times since. I have gotten to the point that I am just happy for them and not unhappy for me.  It took a while.  Being pregnant to have children is just something that we take for granted I guess.  When I was little it never would have occurred to me that I would never be pregnant.  I will, however, be a mom and we go to our adoption orientation tomorrow.  My hubby just wants me to be healthy and to be around to be with him.  I love him for that but also feel guilty that I took away his biological option.  It cushioned the blow that we had not been succesful in conceiving and that we were 36 and only had about 6 more years where it would even be advisable to try to have our own biological baby.  You both are under 30 and have many more years of possible fertility.  Healthy babies have and will be conceived after chemo.  A wise women on these boards told me one day, after I had found out about the ovary removal, that children grow in your heart or under it they are both the same.  We venture off tomorrow to begin the quest to \"meet\" our children and have them grow in our hearts.  Best of luck to you all and cheers to a great life and the family of our choosing after BC.",

I remember how busy Dr. Brackett's office kept me with all of the tests and it was all worth it.  My tumor was not large and my staging was 1 in the left breast, which was found only when Dr. Brackett did my first MRI, and 2a in the right but after 3 chemo treatments he did an ultrasound and they were gone.  I had 8 treatments all together.  We did the chemo up front and dose dense (closer together) because of my age.  My husband loves Dr. Brackett too.  He is intense and the anxiety meds will help (as they do with everything!) but make sure you always take hubby, a friend, or fam member to all appointments because they will always hear things a little more clearly than us! They can help ask questions too which helped me out a lot. You are going to be very overwhelmed and let your wonderful aunt (who may just have saved your life-you owe her a great dinner out!) and your husband (anal is good in this instance!) help you make sense of it all.  I had an MRI guided biopsy, CT Scans, genetic testing, and most other tests done right at Dr. Brackett's Imaging Center.  All of the techs, nurses, everyone there was sweet and caring. Let them help you. Dr. B will not waste too much time before he gets you started into treatment. Call his nurse educator Sabrina with any questions....I wore her out with them (mostly in tears) in the beginning.  I promise once he gets a plan in place Dr. Brackett will be giving you big hugs.  Also, there is a group of young women here that are young survivors and when you are ready let me know and an email will go out to them and they will answer any questions you have and will give support.  Welcome to the sisterhood that none of us wanted to join but are now so grateful that it exists and is STRONG! I'm here as are many others. ",

They will feel included and you can conserve your much needed energy.  As for you, this site is amazing.  I learned so much from the women (and men) on here and I had new questions for my onco every appointment.  Don't stress yourself about the lingo on here, ask what it means if someone posts something you haven't seen (there are no stupid questions) and before you know it you will be using it as well.  Lots of moms are on here too and can give you great advice on how to explain it all to your kids.  Take a deep breath (and keep breathing) and get into fight mode.  Choose the sites that you visit carefully because you do not want to get bad information that will just scare you.  I have received great information and support here.  So sorry that you had to join us but hopefully you will come to see that there are some positive things that come out of a terrible diagnosis.   ",

There is still a bit of fuzz as you go through treatment.  It is not really visible in pictures or anything but you will see it.  Don't forget that you are going to lose hair EVERYWHERE.  So don't be shocked although it sure does help to not have to shave your legs or wash your hair when you are fatigued from a treatment.  To answer your very first question I was told to expect the hair to fall out after treatment #2.  I had dose dense chemo so that was pretty soon for me.  Hope all this helps.  Hang in there and remember it does grow back and is so healthy.  Just remember all the bad hair days when you felt like shaving it off and starting over....here is your chance:)  Best wishes and stay strong.",

I don't know about all that but I can tell you that feeling and seeing that the chemo is working is huge mentally and helps me to worry less about mets because I know that my tumors responded to the chemo and they were both hormone pos, HER2 neg. My right tumor went away completely and the left shrank so I could of had two lumpectomies but I chose BMX because they were both producing cancer and I was 36.  I did not have nodal involvment and did not have to do radiation, yea!! The studies that have been done suggest that survival is the same for chemo given before or after so the hard part the way I see it is that neo goes against our urge to \"get the cancer out\".  We want the tumors gone right away and feel that leaving them in will cause them to grow or travel.  If you can get past that it was the right way for me to go.  I am confident in that I know the chemo worked (not that I don't worry about mets because I do, I think we all do) and that helps to calm the stress a little.

I have had friends and family that have had just the biopsy and/or MRI guided biopsy with B9 results tell me how AWFUL it was that they had these needles put into their breasts and bruises for a while after.  Not to minimize anyone's pain threshold but I would gladly have stopped at the bruises for a B9 result.  I never felt defeated by this.  I had a few bad days and I don't want you to be surprised if you feel like shite physically and mentally for a few days after each chemo session, it does that to you.  I called it my chemo funk and after the steroids wore off I lost my energy and just felt \"funky\".  Nothing too terrible.  I learned to laugh alot during this because if it was going to happen anyway I felt like it could not have six months, a year, whatever of my life before I allowed joy back in.  I had a reaction to Compazine (anti nausea) after my first chemo treatment and ended up going to the ER.  It was a dystonic reaction which means that muscles in your body spasm uncontrollably and may make you move in a weird way.  It happened to my neck muscles and I was with my best friend and she said it looked like I was doing the funky chicken. We laughed about that even while I was waiting to be given the Benadryl that would stop the reaction.  We still tell my funky chicken story.  I have told my onc that I do not feel that this is coming back.  I do not dwell on it every minute of every day.  I do not live in fear and I do not sweat small stuff any more.  This is a early stage forum so I feel comfortable saying that I felt hopeful during my treatment and I feel confident that I did what I could to prevent reoccurrence. I know others say that they don't want to be told to be positive or that positive thinking can help \"heal\" them. I am not a pollyanna and I am not saying these things either.  All I am saying is that, for me, I will not let cancer control the rest of my life.  I hope that it is a blip in the radar of my life but I also feel like if it isn't and one day I am given horrible news I do not want to look back and say that I gave away all of this precious time. I know some women have told me that at first you thing about BC all day and then as time goes by it is less and less.  I am still in \"treatment\" and I go most hours and minutes of each day without thinking about BC.  I post on here so I obviously give it some time and still need support and guidance but I don't try to live in a bubble or under the covers in crippling fear that I had cancer.  It sucks and if this happened to a member of my family or one of my good friends I do believe that it would consume my thoughts. I have made a treaty with my body that I will do what I can to make this a one time event and not take it for granted anymore.  If I am proved to be delusional one day and the beast comes back then I will deal with it then.  For now I want to live a full life and not have a part of me always waiting for the ball to drop.  Maybe this is a luxury of the early stager but I know I worried alot more about things when I was a \"no stage\" and did not know I had cancer.  Give it all you got and beat it down, keep your attitude, and get on with your life.  If there is no \"new normal\" for you fabulous but what I consider my \"new normal\" is better than my old normal because I am better. I think others will follow your lead as well.  At work we have a lady who is always hot and turns the air way down and freezes us out.  I looked at her last week and said, \"it is so freakin cold in here, I don't even have nipples anymore and they're hard\".  Laugh or cry, at some point it is a choice.  You are fab don't change a thing.  If you check into the loony bin see if we can get a double room.",

Mamaq-Prayers for you. I am sure that it is nothing.  We all have been down this road before and hit the cancer lottery but most things found are benign.  Most breast lumps too but you would never know it to visit us here.  Best wishes to you. Laura- I was node neg too and both my onc and BS thought no radiation but I told them to make me an appointment with the radiation onc. and let him be the decisive voice.  That is his gig.  Ultimately he made the same decision and explained to me the protocol.  If there is some \"gray\" area for your doc on this ask to see a radiation onc to a final vote. You don't want to miss anything but you also don't want to do anything unnecessary that may cause harm. I felt the same way you do about throwing it all at the cancer but I did feel confident that chemo, surgery, and hormonals would do the trick without the rads. Made my PS VERY happy:) Coolbreeze-Officially welcome to the Stage 1&2 thread!  Good luck with chemo.  It is tough but very doable. Something that helped me was to cut my hair short the week after my first treatment and then when it started to come out in droves my husband and I went into the bathroom and buzzed it off.  It felt great to have some control over that. First couple of days after were hard but then I totally got into the baldness.  My husband loved it and I had a few pictures done.  I always covered my head when in public but at home I was bald all the time.  It really helps not to have to worry about your hair when you're tired from the chemo.  Now people stop me all the time and say that they love my hair \"cut\" and I always say this is hair \"growth\"!  Best wishes as you get chemo organized and, as you feel yucky from it, envision it going in and destroying any little suckers that the surgery did not get. Anyone else on here do neoadjudavant chemo?  I did and feel like mentally it was good for me because I could see that it was shrinking the tumors.  Of course I also worried that leaving the tumors in could be causing things to travel.  Completely unwarranted fear but you know how this thing plays with your mind.  I do still feel for lumps and bumps even though my expanders are really all I feel.  I do check my chest and collarbone because I saw my onc doing that.  Hope to never feel anything.  I felt the lump in my right breast and that it what started my journey. I found out that I had cancer by going to the surgeon after my mammo(my first) and u/s and upon first meeting him he said (not hello),\" I am 99.9% certain this is cancer\".  \"The radiologist did not like it and I don't like it\".  He said \"if it comes back as anything else I will be shocked\".  He then proceeded to do my biopsy while his nurse wiped my tears.  After he left the room I started to sob to my best friend who was there with me.  I made her call my hubby.  I made him call my parents.  I could not break the news to anyone.  I don't think I really believed it.  It may sound like the BS was a real jerk but he said \"I will not lie to you now so that you will trust me in the future\".  He did not lie and I do trust him and love him.  He is the best.  He gives his patients his cell number and actually answers it any time.  What doctor does that? Anyway nothing like having the bandaid ripped off to get you started on cancer treatment! Stage 1&2 thread rocks. ",

I learned alot and so will you.  Do not go to any doctors appointments alone if you can help it because you need someone to ask questions and hear what the doctors are saying because you won't process it all.  You need to find out staging, treatment options, receptor status, etc as soon as you can and the doctors should be scheduling tests and scans at this point.  The BRCA 1&2 genetic testing is just a part of that.  I had instant reconstruction with tissue expanders with the mastectomies and I woke up with \"breasts\" which was great emotionally.  I am almost at the end of the recon journey and will have my implant exchange in December.  You need to focus on finding out as much about your cancer and your options for treatment right now (for example if you need chemo I had chemo before surgery and that may be an option to explore as some docs do it first and some still go for surgery first but you need to know your OPTIONS). Take notes, take someone to appointments, and BREATHE.  That is all we can really do.  Good luck and best wishes on your journey to becoming a survivor and a thriver.",

No one could have predicted and I would not have believed them if they did.  That was not fair but it is different because I really can not miss something that I never had and I would have liked the opportunity but there are other ways to become a mom.  For you, it is here and now.  You will get through this and will be over joyed at your precious little life.  Hopefully it will reaffirm that there is meaning to life and you will be around to enjoy many wonderful moments with this baby and all of your family. There are so many horrific moments on the BC journey and you are more than entitled to yours so cry, scream whatever you gotta do.  Then don't mourn the loss of you and arrange the future of your family just yet..you are still here.  You are here and you will be.  This strong little soul inside of you will come out just fine and then you will take over your body and defeat this BC.  Look at how strong you already are.  You will be a great mom to this little one and what a privelege it will be to have you, survivor you, as his mommy as it is for all of your children.  I am sending you loads of positive energy and am saying prayers of strength for you tonight.  I hope you don't mind if I pop in to this thread every now and then to check on your progress.  I can't wait to hear about your joy when you meet your healthy new baby.  Congratulations, not condolences, are in order.  Stay strong.",

Bilateral mastectomy was my decision right away even though the BS said that he could probably do two lumpectomies but was concerned that at 36 both of my breast were creating hormone positive breast cancer.  I also knew that chemo was a definite and I got three opinions and all said that doing it first would be the best option.  I ended up having the larger tumor shrinking to the point of no longer being visible on ultrasound after three treatments and after surgery it was confirmed that I had a complete pathological response with that tumor.  The left tumor shrank to almost nothing but had not completely disappeared.  The piece of mind that that gave me is invaluable.  It does not guarantee no reoccurrence but it sure felt great to know that the chemo was working...something I would not know for sure if it had been done after surgery.  I also had dose dense chemo but that was based on my age and I had no other health conditions that may compromise my counts rebounding.  I had 8 treatments total. 4ac/4taxol.  I know that studies suggest that there is no difference in survival of you do it before or after but I can not describe the elation I felt when I would check my lump (I could only feel one) and it just felt like a normal breast again.  I hope the same for you and a speedy trip through chemo with great results and very little SE's.  I know all treatments react differently with different people but I just wanted to start you on your treatment journey with a positive story.  Good luck, big hugs,and best wishes. ",

Needless to say I was thrilled.  I hope to give it credit on my five year cancerversary as well.  I hope to be there with you NED.  I also had a complete hysterectomy but only because I was a Tamoxifen poor metabolizer but I am happy now that I did it.  Get rid of the estrogen!  I am on Femara and have been happy with SE's so far. Don't care I will stay on it forever as well.  Totally NOT missing my periods! I haven't had one since my first chemo treatment in Feb. and have adjusted really well to skipping the tampon aisle.  My hubby loves that \"crazy woman\" does not appear once a month:) If I had a node I would have insisted on rads too.  Congrats on your five years out. Your my new role model! Nancy-love the t-shirt idea.  Forgot about not being able to wear deodarant for mammo's.  Certainly a time that you need it!  Hopefully all will be clear this year for you.  Do bilateral mx's have to have mammos?  I have heard different reports on here and was hoping that the surgery meant no more of those. azdiva-have a safe, fab trip!  Enjoy some sunshine and margaritas.  I know all of this has made me appreciate all the little things so much more. Have fun creating special memories.  After all of this treatment it should be mandatory for insurance to pay for a week away some where.....maybe covered under the mental health coverage?  I would be willing to take a therapist with me if that would get it covered!  Have fun. Best wishes to all and hope everyone is well. edited for spelling issues-chemo brain still!",

Totally agree on the wackiness of BCP's today.  Periods are natural.  Not fun but natural.  Also agree about the hormones in food.  I was already trying to watch that before BC but now I am really paying attention and the amount of crap in our food is criminal.  No wonder ten year old girls look eighteen. Scary stuff.  I do think the number of younger women getting BC is on the rise.  I know when I was diagnosed I was told it was still something like 5% but I know so many under 40's that are BC veterans.  Seems like there are plenty on these boards.  I know that there are no definitive links to lifestyle and BC like there are with lung cancer but it almost seems like that would make it easier, don't do this and you won't get BC.  That would make you feel like you had SOME control. Guess that is why I don't hate pink or any of the things sold that give profits to research.  Let's find out why our genes went crazy.  Wow I sound preachy......about to throw in politics and religion so we can all sit around and feel uncomfortable. After all the in-fighting on these boards recently I thought I was gonna have to start typing while wearing brass knuckles.  Just joking of course...I come here to support and be supported.

I found that I had a strength that I did not know was there and when the diagnosis came I was able to put on my big girl panties and meet the challenges and questions about my future head on.  See that is something that I might not have posted elsewhere because after all of the tests and treatments etc. my news and prognosis were pretty good.  Not guaranteed just good right now.  Nevertheless it was hard and I was scared.  The worst thing cancer took from me was the ability to have a biological child.  My husband and I had been trying and then I found the lump and life took another direction.  Children were still a possibility until I found out that I was a poor Tamoxifen metabolizer.  Then I had it all taken out, ovaries, uterus, the works.  I had to go into menopause so that I could go on an AI.  This was devastating.  I was taking away something that we both wanted so badly and I often scan the posts of the women of all stages on this site and so many are blessed with children.  I will never experience pregnancy, childbirth, looking at my child and saying we have the same eyes or nose or we do this the same.  This was something all my life I took as a given as something that I would experience.  I had to make a choice not to be bitter when I heard of some teenager getting pregnant completely unprepared for the blessing that people take for granted or if I heard on the news that a baby was abandoned or abused.  I decided, again, that I was not so special that things were always going to be easy and in order to live a complete life I was going to have to accept that bad things happen and it was not all going to be fair.  I survived this too and I moved on.  On to adoption, fostering, maybe realizing that we are meant for some special little person that just doesn't share our dna but could share our lives.  I also realized that, for me, things could have been worse.  Instead of remaining mad I had to find the gratitude that I may have had to start the process of saying goodbye if things had gone a different way.  That would be a tragedy to me. I hope to never experience that but I have now realized that the fact that we are all going to die at some point is a reality and not some distant truth.  I feel like now is the time to make it matter. Sorry that this post is so long and  this is by far the most that I have shared on these boards.  I am not some shiny, happy person who always sees the positive I just wanted to share my journey.  I made a decision that all things being equal I have absolutely no control over my having a reoccurence so I will not waste my time worrying about it.  My grandmother had breast cancer 41 years ago and is 88 now.  I can promise you she will die of something else.  I said to my onc well I guess I will have to wait 41 years to be able to say that and he said what would you get out of wasting that much time on worry.  At Stage 1&2 we stradle the fence on having this again but have the luxury of being able to be hopeful that we have seen the last of it. Some of us will progress to mets or a reoccurence but the vast majority will not.  Some of us will die in a plane or car crash but the vast majority will not.  Same odds. Today we survive and move on. Best wishes to all.  ",
