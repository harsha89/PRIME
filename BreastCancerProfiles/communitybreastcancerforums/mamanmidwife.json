I have had a ridiculous month from a wnl mammo 1/2009 to a highly suspicious one 4/26 - core biopsy of a mass in my right breast 5/5/10 to a diagnosisi of IDC 5/7/10. ok that sucks, but what do we next? well proceed to a PET scan and MRI which shows a \"hot spot\" in the liver and on t12. well i've been know to party a bit i am entitled to a little liver dmage go for the liver biopsy with high hope only to have them dashed last week. I am officiall stage IV with mets to liver and bone. WTF?! Ok so what do we do now? well first off lets get (what my mom clls) \"the Taliban AKA home grown terrorists\" out of my body i go to schedual my lap hyst ooph (have fibroids and adenomysis) today. and it can't be done until 7/9/10. my onc thinks it's too long to wait and wants me on lupron and femera tomorrow. WTH? I am leaving for Cozumel to certify in SCUBA diving (did the class for my birthday gift to myself in april - before any of this nonsense) on saturday.  figure the mexican heat will hide my hotflashes and the water will feel good. I feel very bleessed in the sense that i feel great exactly the same as before hearing about this war going on in my body. I have a sense of faith and know that hatever happens it's going to be ok, but each bit of news has been hard. and silly as it seems i would have preferred to have the surgery ,and still want it i guess to me it seems more hopeful to have the surgery because that would mean i expect to be around a long time. We celebrated my granmother's 90th birthday last year an she was the last one on the dance floor , both my parents are doing well in there 70's i reall can;'t see myself doing much less then they are. Wish me luck. I plan on having an absolute blast in Cozumel and exploring he new world under the water.

I really don't know  why i am walking on land i belong in the water lol. when i got back had to get this surgery scheduled, started on the tamoxiphen, caught a cold, started haveing hot flashes (or is it the 100 degree weather we are having), and going to work, going to my 17 year olds graduation, taking my 9 yo to great adventure and the fireworks.... you know living life. I haven't come to the boards until today, i was surprised i didn't fin time for it, but i guess i needed a hiatus (or a little float on the river of De Nial). i'm sure the surgery will be straight forward , but as a nurse just dislike having surgery in july (new residents come on board). it is ambulatory surgery so i am really glad about that. i'll be home for 2 weeks and i will be able to catch up. well think positive thoughts or prayers for me tomorrow Gigi  Gigi Dx 5/7/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 0/0 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I am the single mom of 3 girls (19,17, and 9) and work as a midwife. this alien invasion of my body is royally pissing me off! my preliminary diagnosis is IDC of the right breast after the core biopsy. I've met with the woman who i am leaning towards being my oncologist(i like her a lot) but i always have to examine my choices to feel good about my decisions. will have the MRI and Pet scan this week. meeting the surgeon next week. Treatment (surgery or chemo) will begin 6/21/10, because I will be going to Cozumel to do my certifying open water dives and SCUBA diving for a week. I can't think of a better way to start this battle. I am still absolutely flabbergasted at this thing. This is not a journey i was planning on taking at any point but esp not now. oh well the best laid plans of mice and men. I love my breast small though they are and will miss it/them terribly. I will miss my hair and will have my sister get me wigs short bob for work medium for the weekedns and the long one for diva times. I am afraid of chemo, but i will get through it because i have no choice. Listening the the oldies station and heard Queen's \"we are the champions\" and felt that it would be my theme song. I've been told already that i and a \"role-model\" and \"inspiration\" and that everyone \"know you'll get through this , because you have such a good attitude\" and too all that i say bullcrap! I don't want to be in this position at all. I've looked through this board and the site and you women are truly inspirational and seem to keep it real. The way i like it. thanking you in advance Gigi we are the champions my friends, we'll keep on fighting to the end....
