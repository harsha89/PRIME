    "Content": "unseen wrote: I have two lumps in each breast. They all showed up at the same time a couple of months ago. I have had two of them tested. One is fibroadenoma. The other one looked like a cyst on the ultrasound but it turned out later that it was something else. The biopsi could not confirm that it was a fibroadenoma but the doctor still seems sure that it is. The thing that worries me is that the biopsy showed that the lump had a remarkable high cell turnover. There was no sign of cancer, but I´m still worried. I have had many fibroadenomas in my life, and the biopsies have never showed this result before. I´m waiting on getting the other two lumps tested in a couple of weeks, but the doctor believe them to be papillomas. When the test shows a high cell turnover, does it mean that there is a risk that this can develop to cancer? Log in to post a reply",
