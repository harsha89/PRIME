She has 4 treatments of A/C - once every two weeks followed by Taxol/Herceptin once a week for 12 weeks. She will then continue the Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. Then surgery, then radation. Long road ahead.  I am writing for her since shes not as internet savy and I am kinda her link to all the information about what she is going through. I will be there every step of the way. Hope its ok I am here instead and look forward to hearing about everyone's treatments. Good luck! ",
