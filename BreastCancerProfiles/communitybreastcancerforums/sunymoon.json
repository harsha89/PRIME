My story so far is I had a routine mammogram, which led to a recall visit which resulted in another mammogram and a core biopsy. They found an architectural distortion in my right breast. So, I received my results today. The diagnosis is inconclusive so I have to have a surgical biopsy in 2-3 weeks time. What does B3b mean? I of course am anxious, but would love more information if anyone can help.",
