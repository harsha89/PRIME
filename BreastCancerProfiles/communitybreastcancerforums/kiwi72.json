Upon further looking into it, they said that there was a spot in the first lymph node but they still consider it negative if it is that far from the mean where they cut the node. They said in every patient they have seen that seeing a cell in that spot has never developed into anything more. So they said it is negative but you always wonder a little about those types of conclusions. They also said that they could only do chemo for the first three months after the surgery. That only brings me to month 5 in the pregnancy and is too early to go into labour. I wish I could just be monitored until the end of pregnancy and then if I have anymore then do another surgery and by the time the surgery is over I could do chemo after the baby is born. I am just worried that in that time, it will metastisize and go somewhere where they won't be able to fix it.  I have been doing more research and it is so inconclusive as to whether it harms the fetus or not. There are case studies that show weird and terrible problems  (anal fistulas, stillborn, hear problems, testes and vaginal opening problems) and then they go on to conclude that in most cases in teh second and third trimester, it is relatively safe. These seem so contradictory to me. I know most of the problems are from the first trimester but all of these things can still happen in the second and third, as shown in the case studies. I feel like I am deciding for the possible death of either of us. It is very difficult. :-(",

      "Content": "kiwi72 wrote: I recently found out I had breast cancer, the same day I found out I was pregnant. This is my first pregnancy and will probably be my last. I am 35 years old and will go on Tamoxifen after the baby is born. I was diagnosed with cancer and it started to spread quickly so had to do the bilateral mastectomy at 9 weeks (instead of waiting till my first trimester was over). The baby is fine so far and I am now 14 weeks pregnant. I saw the oncologist the other day and they recommended chemo (while still pregnant and then Tamoxifen after the baby is born). I have breast cancer in my family and none of them have had reoccurance (also none of them have had more than a lumpectomy with radiation). I feel that I have already exceeded what they have done as far as removing my breasts. They said I was node negative and ER+, Her-2 negative. They said there is a 25% chance of it coming back without doing anything else. They said with Tamoxifen alone, that drops to 16% and with chemo alone, it drops to 17%. Doing both would bring me to 10%. Under normal circumstances, I would do both but I just don't know in my case. I saw the baby on the ultrasound yesterday and it made me ache. I do not want to put the baby through all of this. They say that it is not too bad for the baby but it still looses all of its hair and has a lower white blood cell count. Some cases also report babies that are stillborn and who have either congenital malformations and heart problems (even though these are to women in the first trimester). I am trying to decide whether to risk it or not. As I said, I would do chemo if I was not pregnant but I don't know if we (the baby and I) are up to it physically and emotionally. I will deliver early (usually at about 7 1/2 months; all mothers that have had chemo go into labour early) and I can not go into labour while I am on chemo. If I start when my appointment is I will be done at about 7 months. I will be about 41 after I am done chemo and so feel like the options of having another child will be more limited. I feel horrible and just want to make the right choice but don't know what it is. All of the doctors recommend it but the case studies for my situation are so limited that I just don't know if 6% is worth all of the risk. I have even found some information that shows that these \"chemo babies\" are sometimes more at risk for cancer themselves in the first 20 years of life. As there is such a small pool of people to infer information from, they cannot rule or rule out what the true diagnostic effects are.  Most people say, just listen to your heart and that is the right decision but that is not working for me. I don't know what I expect to hear that will make me feel I am making the right decision but I do feel completely helpless to make the right decision for both of us. So if anyone has any suggestions, that would be great. I already can't breastfeed. I just think that going through chemo while 5,6,7 months pregnant will be so difficult. Especially with the 6% decrease in risk. Dx 4/26/2008, DCIS, 1cm, Grade 2, 1/3 nodes, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
