She started out as being treated for locally advanced breast cancer, but it was later discovered that the lesions in her liver were in fact metastases (they responded to the chemotherapy and shrunk from the time she had her first and second CT scan). She's done with six rounds of chemotherapy and is on break until her next CT scan in October.  Is that a good sign? Is surgery an option? I know this might sound a bit unstructured but its only after she was diagnosed that I became more involved while taking care of her and all. P.S. I can only express admiration and respect when I read through your posts. You are all a ray of hope and I wish each and every one of you well. ",
