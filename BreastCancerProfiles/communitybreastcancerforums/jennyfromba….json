I'm also a stomach sleeper and it was tough for awhile but I guess when you know you can't do it, you just get used to it. I was able to get back on my stomach right before I started my fills on my TE's (about 2 months later) Â and slept on my stomach throughout that process, except maybe the night of the fill. My exchange surgery is end of January so I'm dreading that sleeping on my back again but it will get better! I didn't really give you any pointers but just know you're not alone! Good luck with everything Mary! Jenny",

The doctor told me originally he makes everyone wait 3 weeks, I just got lucky and didn't have much drainage anymore. I've heard of others who had them even longer. I know it's tough but just be patient if you can. Jenny",
