Though it did relieve some of the intense needles in my nipple sensation, stabbings, etc. it did not address my pain with movement, back and chest burning. I'm curious if anyone else on here has tried a nerve block and had any success with the procedure? I go back in on Thursday to meet about what to try with my left side and am scheduled to do another trial on Monday. I found this doctor by reading articles on his work with others for various types of relief due to amputation, fibro, etc. but I'm his first PMPS patient. Nothing like being the guinea pig- but if it gets me some relief, I'll do it!",
