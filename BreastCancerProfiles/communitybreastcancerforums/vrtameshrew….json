Having problems with kidneys and white cell counts. Doctor changed Ibrance from 125 to 100 and that seems to help, but I just took a Ca-15-3 tumor marker test and it went from 48 to 58. I had a scan that showed the liver tumor first grew, then shrunk--but now another scan shows \"indeterminate\" concerning areas in other places in the liver...Does Ibrance work or not?",
