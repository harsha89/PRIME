      "Content": "Gk1299 wrote: I\u2019m 48 and just had a clear mammogram in November. But the nurse just told me I have very dense breast tissue so who knows? I\u2019ve been having breast pain on the right side near my nipple. Upon examination I found three lumps that were not there before. The painful one is underneath my nipple and the other two are above and below it. I\u2019ve had some itchiness on that nipple as well. The pain has been at times sharp but always a pulling sensation and some burning. I just saw my ob\\gyn. She said she is not concerned about the knots that I felt,but there is a hard place underneath my implant that feels abnormal. She thinks it may just be the valve of my implant? She assured me that she isn\u2019t worried but is sending me for an ultrasound and possible diagnostic mammogram today My question is - do they always tell you not to worry? Haha. And then send you for more tests to find out the real deal? None of it sounds good to me. Log in to post a reply",

I went for my ultrasound and the knots that she could see were normal. The area of pain around my nipple was fine she said. But the hard place that my gyn and I felt could not be located again much less reached with the wand. So i still don\u2019t know anything about that. My GYN said she had never felt anything like it. The us tech and I tried everything but couldn\u2019t locate it again. It\u2019s like it\u2019s behjnd the implant. Idk if I can rest without knowing for sure. I\u2019m waiting for a call from my doc to ask her about an mri. I understand this is my only option to fully view behind the implant.",
