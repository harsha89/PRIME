She had a 26 year old daughter who died of cervical cancer last December. I watched her walk through that with incredible grace and dignity. Therefore, the excuses are gone.  I might not get through this with much grace and dignity, but I will get through it, one day at a time. Boy, does that have new meaning.  Again, thanks for all your kind words.  I already feel a little better.  A meeting online would be cool.  I'm game. Love you all. Annie",
