Dr. did not think I needed another one but did tell me if margins are not clear this time it is a mastectomy.  He thinks it is more diffuse than initally thought. I keep wondering if I should cancel re-excision and just schedule mastectomy. I'm afraid I will always worry about the cancer coming back or still lurking just below those \"clean\" margins but on the other hand I worry if I don't give the re-excision a chance I will get a mastectomy I don't need. There is so much to think about and so much I don't want to think about it. I'd been doing ok till today. Oh well--tomorrow is a new day. Thank you again--it really is good not to be alone.",
