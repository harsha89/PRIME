    "Content": "Mar 16, 2016 03:10PM - edited Mar 16, 2016 03:14PM by lterry36 Good Morning, my story is the exact same as everyone, radiation burns are the worst. I'm six days out. I take Motrin 800mg every now and then. In between time I take Aleve for the pain. Also, I stopped the Silver Sulf. and the Hydrocodone. I went to the grocery store and purchased Aloe vera leafs, took all the aloe out of each leaf, mixed it with vitamin E oil in a bowl and put it in the refrigerator. It cool, soothing , healing and has antiseptic properties. IT WORKED WITHIN 12 HOURS- NO PAIN and today is my second day, the skin is soft. I also use Domeboro soaks twice a day. It's also a drying astringent. The Domeboro is about $9.00 at Walgreen's and the Aloe Leaves were 1.58 a pound. It's all worth it. Its also an inexpensive ALL NATURAL solution. By the way you can use the mixture immediately, cover with a non adhesive gauze. Also, if you use a regular gauze and it stick a little, put water on it before removing from skin. I pray this help someone. God bless you all!",
