You might find support through the triple-negative breast cancer foundation. There's also the Young Survival Coalition. Susan Komen foundation may have the most resources to help her connect to other girls who are very young when diagnosed. According to that path report posted, this is known as \"triple-negative breast cancer.\" What I have been told by my doctors is that the cause is unknown, likely a number of factors. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't not do something right. They have got to find what causes this. Please get all the support you can as early in the process as you can. I would take this to the news media. Ask the organizations for their help. My heart and prayers go out to you.",
