I had 3 rounds and then the cisplatin was changed to carboplatin because it was damaging my kidneys.  I also had two blood transfusions because of anemia. After 5 rounds the chemo was stopped because I could not physically tolerate it anymore. Now for the upside, it basically erradicated my tumours. The largest of multiple tumours was 4cm. After my ultrasound there was only evidence of one 9mm tumour found. Had I been able to tolerate a 6th cycle there would have been no tumours evident. I was then put on tamoxifen but after 2 mths the tumours were showing progression. I was then put on Xoleda (sp?) and there has been no further progression since July 2011. Another bonus is that you will probably not lose your hair.  Good luck......",
