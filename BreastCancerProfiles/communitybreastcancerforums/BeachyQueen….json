Apparently, having a recurrence in my mediastinal lymph nodes with pleural effusion moved me into a stage 4 diagnosis. I have been doing the double dosing of Faslodex since March 2011 and on 6/20 will be receiving my 5th dose. I feel as if I have aged 20 yrs since March!! The se's are tolerable but my qol has significantly changed. Not sure what being restaged to 4 really means. I could really use your help with this one ladies. My onc. is very difficult to volunteer info. Have to pry everything little thing out of him and even that is not much. He says he has had very good results with women on Faslodex and I believe him. However, I want to know if I am now in the category which basically says I have a poor prognosis because my mets are not in the bones but elsewhere? My dear husband seems to believe that I am overreacting with my fears and concerns because it is only now in my lymph nodes. (I had the fluid drained from my lung). What can you ladies tell me to confirm what I suspect to be the truth about this matter, are we in denial here, overreacting or both? Sorry to rant so....
