I was put on Femara even before I had chemo. That was five and a half years ago. Two moths ago I was switched to the generic. I had headaches, sleep problems, joint pains. When I went to see my doctor I wanted to go off the medicine. Alot of the info I find most are on it for 5 years. I would like to know if others with many positive nodes are still on Femara past the five years. My Dr. was insistant that I stay on the drug and switched me back to Femara and then back on generic for two months and then I am to go back and see him. Needless to say I am upset and set about to get some answers on here. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Are any of you past 5 years and are not taking any of these kinds of drugs.? The side affects are harsh !!!",
