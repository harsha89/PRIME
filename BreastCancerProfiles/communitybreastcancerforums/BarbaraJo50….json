How wonderful though that she was in your life, and supported you. (And I am sure you lifted her as well.) I am glad that you realize that she will always be in your heart and mind. Yesterday I read that...we remember the moments; not the days. I hope that you remember so many wonderful moments that it fills you with peace and joy.  Sincerely, with loving thoughts, BarbaraJo",

I enjoyed having it, all cotton. I took it with me for treatment but did not always use it. The nurses would wrap me up in warmed hospital blankets. Loved those warmed blankets. I think I used it at home more often. I also received a crocheted blanket from the church ladies. This I used much more often. It is maybe 30\" x 60/70. It is perfect for around the shoulders. Or even around the shoulders and down the legs if in a fetal position. This one I still use. Thank you for quilting for others. I felt blessed receiving and using these blankets.",
