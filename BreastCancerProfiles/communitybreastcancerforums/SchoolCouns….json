Apparently a resident of my town is a national spokes person for cancer and gave him books to pass along to anyone who he encounters to help them. I was so overcome with tears. When I returned to pick up my car, he asked me to go test drive it with him. We went on a 15 minute drive on back roads where he gave me a the best pep talk. I am so overwhelmed by his kindness!

As a result, I am still on percocet every 4 hours, the have also added flexoral (muscle relaxer). Today he took out one drain and I see him again on Wednesday, perhaps he will take out one more on Wednesday. So the incision looks great he says, and other than the pain, he says I am doing well.

I am continually haunted by the fact that my life will never be the same, that cancer has taken away my safety and security, but fortunately not my faith. I still have pockets of fluid under my armpits after the drain removal, at first I thought the PS took them out too soon, but judging by the fever I ended up with I am glad he took them when he did. Anyone have an idea how long it will take the body to absorb this? I see the oncologist tomorrow, at first my BS said I would not need chemo, but when the pathology returned, she said due to the size of the cancer and the aggressive nature of it I may need to, so just to ready my mind for it. In reading all the posts I remember those needles to the aereola(SP) with the radioactive isotopes, I thought I would die, I have never experienced pain like that before. I remember asking why that could not be done while I was already under and how barbaric that was. Then a nurse offered me some aromatherapy ate that and the lavender really calmed me down. My brain does not work well under stress I am finding because I wanted to respond to each of you individually, but please know I read every post and I am shring in your pain, sorrows and joy! Oh, I forgot, constipation can be horrific, and colace did nothing for me. I had to have a fleet enema twice and that did the trick, of course the antibiotic now is helping me wonderfully and I am back to normal. I can't believe September is over already....",

Sobering, to hear that cancer cells can be in your body for up to 10 years before they are manifested and for her to guarantee that I have cancer cells flying around now is really hard to hear. Also the reality that if I have a recurrence it would most likely not be found early. Yeah. But I loved the honesty so I am waiting for the oncotype test to come back but I am going with chemo and then tamoxiphen for 10 years and then something that starts with an \"a\" for another 10 years at least. Good to have a plan. In the middle of all this I of course have to keep seeing the PS for refills. How many of you are doing all this while working? Stay strong ladies!!",

Yesterday was my last day at work, very emotional, a colleague of mine's wife is at the tail end of a 1 year journey with breast cancer and he told me just to take it a day at a time. Some days will be really bad and some will be okay. Another colleague is a survivor and this is her fifth year. She just held me and cried. At one point she remarked , \"I don't know why I am crying\" and I responded, \"It's because you now the journey I am about to going through\". Then she said something that will stay with me. She said\" You will find strength that you never knew you had, when you are at your lowest , you will always find it\".....I just thought I would share that...Good Luck ladies....the journey continues...",

I can relate so much to what you are all talking about. With regard to pain across your chest, ask the doctor for a muscle relaxant. I used flexarol for a while beyond when i needed pain meds to relax the muscle and then there was no pain. My doctor took out my drain when one was still giving off 40cc a day and I ended up with a fluid build up, I am grateful he did because two days later I spiked a fever and went on antibiotics, he was so happy he had pulled the drains and so was I. He said he had a gut feeling to just do it and 10 days were enough. Today I went out with my family, to the mall, and out to eat, We went straight to buy them shoes, picked up cheese cake and ate. I was ready to go to bed when I got home at 3pm. So worn out a reminder that our bodies have really taken a beating! I have also driven twice. I have a large truck so you need a lot of arm motion to turn the wheel, big mistake the first time, okay the second time. We don't realize how much concentration and reflexes that driving needs until we can't do it. Tomorrow I see the plastic surgeon for my first fill, then I agreed to be in a clinical study about cancer and emotional support for women 45 and under and then I see the oncologist to tell him that I am getting a second opinion. Has anyone had to do that? I just need to know that chemo is warranted for my cancer and the type is the right one. I also heard that new cancer studies are suggesting that taking Tamoxiphen for 10 years as opposed to 5 years has better outcomes. Hope we all have a good week!",

Jessica, Thanks for your words.we have so many decisions to make! I'm glad it went well for you. Segunda, My understanding is that the choice of chemo is based off of reducing your risk of recurrence to as low as possible, so the conversation with the doctors should be about the chemo side effects and whether the risk of SE from either are less important than the risk of recurrence. Every one is different, when do you meet with your ONC to discuss? I have not knitted in about two years and went out today to get some wool and needles and decided to start making some hats.",

I stayed in the hospital until Friday evening and was discharged with four drains. Apart from a bad run in with a nurse, which I reported to her manager and hospital administration, everyone was lovely. There was a tremendous anoint of pain. In part, because I worked out precious to surgery, did a lot of push ups and pull ups, so my muscles were very tight in my chest. They will not start the expansion until three weeks from now, I waant my 40DD back! I got the pathology back and they got all of the cancer, so I am Happy about that. I also arranged for the visiting nurse to come and change the drains for me. Still really woozy. I am taking percoset, colace,an antibiotic and flexoral (SP). This typing is taking a lot out of me. Talk to you soon...",

The deal with recurrence as I understand it is this: My cancer was found because I was doing the MRI, US and Mammo as I was supposed to. Going forward with no breast tissue those scans will no longer be necessary...other than the annual MRI checking the implants, so if a cancer was to reoccur it would be elsewhere and would probably not be picked up until it gave some physical sign.Because there is no cancer in my lymph nodes, apparently does not mean i do not have cells in my body. Our bodies usually destroy theses cells but for whatever reason, it did not and I got cancer. I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I wanted her to be straight with me. Because of my age, 44 and all my other markers, they recommend the Taxotere chemo for me. 4 treatments over 12 weeks. Cancer and cancer treatments are very individual, chemo will add additional 2% difference for me with regard to reocurrence and I am already in single digits, but to me that's a big deal. I just don't want to ever think there was something that I could have done and did not and that is why I went to Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital for the second opinion which was the same recommendation from my oncologist. Again this was just my recommendation. I hope this clarify's this more for you.",

You're so right these are absolutely tough decisions and I don't see chemo as something to be afraid of although I am certainly not looking forward to it.
