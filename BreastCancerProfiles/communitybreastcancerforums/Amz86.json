      "Content": "Amz86 wrote: I'm 29, I live in Australia. About 4 weeks ago, I started having pain in my right breast. It was a strange, hot, burning feeling. I've had nipple leakage in that breast for years, so I thought maybe I had mastitis.So did the Dr. She gave me antibiotics and sent me for an ultrasound. I have no children. I finished my course of antibiotics, but the pain has remained. The ultrasound revealed a big black mass that looks like a cyst. I have to have an aspiration/biopsy now, but I'm terrified!!! I feel like I have every symptom of IBC, except the skin dimpling. I know it's extremely rare but I'm still fearful. This is going to sound crazy, but I believe the mind and the body are extremely connected. So I feel like I've asked for this, because a few years ago, I was at the lowest point of my life, suicidal, sad and depressed every day ect... And now I think my body is giving me what I wanted. I wanted to die. But now I have finally, in the past six months reached a pace of true happiness and contentment. A place where I'm very glad I didn't kill myself. Now I'm afraid that will all be taken away, even just being diagnosed might send me spiraling back. I'm so upset! Log in to post a reply",

So it appears to have gone away. Is this good or bad? Does it mean the biopsy is unnecessary or wont work? To answer your questions Lottermaine, the big black mass has fairly defined edges, with a tiny bit of white debris - so small I can barely see it. It's about 2-3cm at the widest part. I think the edges are defined. Not 100% sure though... Thanks for your advice. I think I will go anyway. I just wont be happy if it's gone and they charge me anyway...",

      "Content": "Feb 4, 2016 12:44AM - edited Feb 4, 2016 01:08AM by Amz86 Thanks Blondedoris. I live on the Gold Coast in Queensland, so that's a no-go, unfortunately. I've called around lots of places today to find the best price I can for this biopsy. The cheapest is around $250, after medicare. I'm extremely broke at the moment. I'm wondering if I should wait until I'm on centrelink (if I can get on it) and then wait even longer for my health care card. Which will give me a discount to about $50, all up. It could take up to a month though. But I feel like there's a certain urgency to get the biopsy too. This is the worst timing ever!! I feel stuck between financial stress and health stress. Why oh why did I have to lose my job at this critical time?!!! Why doesn't the government bulk bill things like this? It seems so wrong... Has anybody else ever experienced financial stress due to this stuff? My biopsy is booked in for Monday. I'm dreading it, yet super impatient.",

It didn't work, he said the cyst was too hard. I think he also mentioned the word fibrous.  So he tried again. Put in some local anaesthetic and used a bigger needle. He got out some white/yellow stuff. About a mm. I asked the lady on the way out how big the cyst was. She said it was really tiny. Like 5mm or less. I said why was 2-3cm on ultrasound? She said that was length from the nipple! I felt silly. It wasn't very big after all.   So now I have to wait for results. Won't see my gp for about a week now...",
