Due to microcalcification clusters found in both my small and EXTREMELY dense breasts I was referred to have have a bilateral stereotactic biopsy. My left breast was found to have ADH and FEA and my right breast was found to have FEA proliferation and adjacent ADH or ALH. Now I am scheduled for a bilateral excisional biopsy on March 28. I am optimistic...as my surgeon is, that the results will be benign. Yet I am still nervous..as I am human. Lol. I SO wonder about the bilateral diagnosis... I worry a little that this increases my chances.... I just can't find a lot on both breasts being involved at once. I also worry over recovery because I wear a 5 pound bullet proof vest and work in a potentially volatile enviroment. Have any of you ladies experienced getting bilateral biopsies....",
