Good morning ladies and welcome to Bev56.  This is a great place to get info and vent.  I have my last TC on Friday - yippee!! but spent 4 hours awake last night worrying about my entire life past, present and future.  I have a nagging pain in my wrist and sure it's just arthritis but darn it, it wasn't there before TC#3.  I understand everyone's concerns over depression.  Some days I just don't want to talk to anyone, cry in the shower or make the effort.  Then my SO holds my hands, tears in his eyes and tells me how beautiful I look bald.  So I pull it together wrap a pretty scarf around my neck and get out for a walk.  But yesterday and today he is travelling and it's so cold here in PA I just want to crawl back into bed.  So, have made an appointment for an afternoon pedicure - how about that? and will join my friend for a walk/run later this morning.  Have a beautiful day all - keep those SE's at bay and have good thoughts if you can.

Pam - I went to Jos Banks today to pickup my sons suit and got all kinds of compliments on my bald head. Finally said, thanks I'm going through chemo and both men started telling me about their neice and wife that also went through chemo.  So, my take is, tell curious people right away because often they know and just want to tell about their own experience which gives us Divas/Jewels a chance to share our own brave stories.  Anyway, just my take and I love you all.  Have a good night.  My last TC is tomorrow morning so won't be back on until Sunday.

I am rambling but just gearing up and grateful for all the support on these boards. Have a good day ladies.  hugs, Bobbi",

Happy Monday - hope everyone is feeling better...",

Firni - glad you are getting used to the new girls.  I know how you felt at first look - I'm still getting used to mine and how clothes fit and look.  My nipples are flattening out and the color of the tattoo has faded but I'm due for a touch up in 2 weeks. Exercise has gotten me through this whole ordeal and I have even started to run again.  It's so nice to be outside.  Have a good weekend all - we are heading to the beach this afternoon.",
