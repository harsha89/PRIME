But I wound up in ER day 7 anyhow neutropenia 1.3 Wbc platelets 83 etc fever 101.5 one week In hospital just got out. Some debate about wether the device delivered the nulasta but I did feel it and it did leave a small bruise where it injected into my belly so anyhow I got my second AC dose one week late and went back to clinic to get my nebulasta IM injection in my arm for sure so I will keep you posted if I get another neutropenia bout The whole episode was rough. The took out my port a cath and the worst experience yet was a PICC line placement so painful",
