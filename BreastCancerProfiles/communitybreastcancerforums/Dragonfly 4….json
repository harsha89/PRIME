But he had my my complete results and  I am not Estrogen + as I was told by my Onc as my rating  1/ 8, but I am Progestron + 8/8!  I am also Her2 + (3)!   Does anyone know what kind of treatment I will be getting?  Do they even treat Pogestron+ and if so with what?  We are waiting until our next meeting with my Ocn June 9th and then we plan on telling the kids.  I just kinda want to know what the Ocn plans.  I'm feeling a little better but still pretty upset about ev everything.",

My cancer doctor said something about pamidronate. River, I felt so deflated with the news but with the help of friends and people on this website I am determined to battle hard.  It took a lot to find the fight in myself.  I pray you find it too! Hugs, Dragonfly ",
