My first chemo is scheduled for 9/8. My tumor was exactly 1cm, clean margins, ER/PR+, Her2/neu-, and something I've not seen posted here anywhere. I had a sentinel node biopsy, and the three nodes were tested two ways. The first was done with the standard \"H&E\" stain used to test nodes for decades, and then again with the newer immunohisochemistry stain. The first stain's results were negative for all three nodes. The second showed a .5 mm metastatic carcinoma in one of the three. I'm from a medium sized county in Northern California, and the local medical community only recently started using the more sensitive stain. I'm only the second known case since they started using the stain a few months back. Since it's so new, there are no stats, as all treatment decision trees and previous studies with their corresponding %'s are based on node negative with the H&E stain. The Dr.'s didn't really know how to stage me, but all wanted to err on the side of caution and recommend chemo as though I was a clear-cut stage 2. Although the decision was not an easy one, I've decided to go through with the chemo. I have an 8-year old son, and feel I owe it to him, and my husband, to give this thing the full court press. Although I'm firm in my resolve, I can't help it, I'm scared to death of the upcoming treatments, 4 AC and 4 Taxol. Unlike a lot of those in other responses, my Oncologist says his nurses are \"great,\" and unless there is something wrong with my veins, a port won't be necessary. I'm also quite fortunate to have been \"randomized\" into a Stanford study, called the Peer Navagator Program. I will be assigned a recent bc survivor who has gone through additional program/training, who will help me through my journey. So, I guess I'm as ready as I'm going to get, and will be checking this site as well. Although my user name says MEF, my name is Michelle, and it's a pleasure to meet you all.",
