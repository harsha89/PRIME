There was one unexpected issue she threw at us.  She said there are 2 schools of thought when the lymph nodes are  involved, but no tumor is found in the breast.  We can opt for just removing the lymph nodes and monitoring the breast, or we can opt for doing a mastectomy when the lymph nodes are removed.  She said the they would probably want to do radiation if we only do the lymph nodes, but probably not if I have a mastectomy.  I was inclined to immediately say let's do the mastectomy since I had already decided I would do that if they had found anything in my breast, but I sensed my husband wasn't ready to make that decision.  We are going to consider our options over the weekend.  I did tell her to schedule enough time to do the mastectomy if that ends up being what we decide to do. I will have more blood work and a PET scan before the surgery.  She actually said that normally she would do a CT of the chest (already done), abdomen and pelvic area, but said that we could certainly do the PET scan instead if that was what I wanted.  I did.  She said she would not normally schedule a bone scan at this time unless I identified symptoms.  They could not  schedule the PET scan until Mon. because no one was there (where the scan will be done) to do it.  It will be scheduled for sometime next week. My surgery is tentatively scheduled for 12:00 on 3/12 to allow time for them to get the PET scan results. She will be out of town the week of 3/17 due to spring break.  She did not want to wait until after spring break to do the surgery. I will be referred to an oncologist after surgery.  .  ",

To everyone else, thanks for your support.  I know you will be thinking about me during my PET scan, surgery and the rest of my journey.  It certainly helps to have \"sisters\" I can talk to without having to primarily be focused on editing everything I say or write, casting news in the most positive way, reassuring my family and friends, putting on the brave face, etc.   ",

I've also come up with a scheme for \"practicing\" lying still in the required position for the amount of time the technicians told me it would take.  If you're squeamish, stop reading now.  :-)  I am going to sanitize one of the kids' potty seats that goes on a toilet, and use it as the donut hole you put your face in.  Don't have anything to use for my boobs, but I can practice lying still on an imaginary hard narrow table while my husband times me.  ",

Is the Breast Care Center on the west side of Meridian?",

      "Content": "BellasKids wrote: Finally had my first meltdown today.  I was scheduled for an MRI, but was unable to complete it because I coughed.  They actually tried twice.  I couldn't even complete the scan without contrast, so we certainly didn't  get to the contrast stage.  The only positive thing I can say is that they said they would not charge me for today since no contrast was administered.  I had trouble sleeping last night and woke up early this morning worrying about the MRI because I had a problem with coughing during a MRI on my back a couple of years ago.  I can honestly say I've dreaded the MRI more than anything else so far, including the biopsy, because of that experience.  I am rescheduled for Wed, so if I can get through it, my appointment with the breast surgeon won't have to be rescheduled.  The MRI is absolutely critical because two different radiologists (one who did the mammogram and one who did the core biopsy)  did not find anything in my breast in the mammogram or the 4 ultrasounds conducted by two different technicians as well as both of them.  Nevertheless, I have a malignant lymph node that they have tentatively diagnosed as breast cancer primary. I have already called my pulmonologist's office and  gotten recommendations  on specific medications to take (prescription cough medicine, a couple of different OTC nasal sprays and my minimal dose of Xanax)  on Wed.  So we have a plan, and I'm feeling more composed. Obviously, you can't help worrying about where the cancer may have spread when a lymph node is involved, but it is tortuous to be praying you do have  BC rather than cancer of unknown primary.  I never even realized there was such an actual type of cancer. Thanks to all of you who replied to my previous post.  I lurked on this site for 2-3 weeks before I posted the first time, so I knew how informative, responsive, supportive and kind you were.  Log in to post a reply",
