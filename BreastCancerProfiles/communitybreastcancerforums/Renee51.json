I am speaking from experience as I just received diagnosis a couple of weeks ago. I am \"waiting\" to go to surgery a week from today. I can honestly say, the waiting is horrible, but keep yourself busy and when those intrusive thoughts come, don't dwell there, read a book, surf the web, go for a run, just do something, stay active. Just some advice that worked for me. ",

If it's not cancer, well then, I will have mammogram every six mouths for about a year and half. The marker will pinpoint the area of concern. They explained that sometimes all the calcifications are removed during biopsy and they can have difficulty locating the specific location and this \"marks the spot.\" you can't feel it, it was only about 1mm in size. (they showed it to me before insertion) and It doesn't hurt, can't even tell it is there now. I say do everything you can to make it easier for those to treat you to be able to do their job to the best of their abilities. This titanium marker allows them to do this without second guessing themselves. ",
