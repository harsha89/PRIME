I am so sorry we are all going thru this. I had a crappy,frustrating and angry day. I live in South Florida and the driving really sucks down here. I need to vent here as well. I vented on another thread I hang out in. I went to reply to a private message and it told me I reached my quota for the day. WTF does that mean. Does anyone know?? I would have like to chat with some of my new friends but I can't. Now that I got that off my chest...I've been hanging out here but never really introduced myself. I am Lori, 54 years old and I live in South Florida. Married 20 years and have three children. 25 and 17 yr old twins. The rest you know. Hugs to all that are suffering, peace to all that are recovering!",

I am a newbie so I really have no experience to offer you except the experience in the same feelings you have. The ladies here will guide you. You will get through this just like I will. You are not alone. I can't stand to be alone because my mind doesn't stop. I still can't believe I have cancer. Seriously. I don't believe it. But I do. I saw the report. Do you know what type of cancer you have. How big. You might want to ask for a copy of the pathology report. Keep all your paperwork together. Start a file and journal. This is what was told to me. Take someone to your dr appointments because you will forget what you talked about. It happened to me. I see my bs on Monday and have no idea what we discussed last week when I saw him for the first time. I was in a fog. I know you feel overwhelmed and scared. So do I but together we will get through this. I know this because all the women here tell me I will. So will you. One day at a time or one moment at a time. The other day I cried all day long. If you looked at me I cried. It was horrible. But that is what I had to do. The women here told me it was okay. That it is normal. All of these feelings are normal. Hugs, Lori",

Doctor says I can have mastectomy, double mastectomy, lumpectomy with 36 rounds of radiation. I always said these girls would come right off if I ever got cancer.

I am also er/pr + her- I see my oncologist today for the first time since my surgery which was April 29th. I am assuming I have nothing to worry about since it's been such a long time waiting. If there was a problem I probably would have been called in to see him sooner. A nurse came into my room after surgery and told me she had same diagnoses and BMX as I did but had to do chemo because of onco score. I have a positive feeling that all will be okay. I'll check back and let you guys know my results. Lori",
