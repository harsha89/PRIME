After many discussions with doctors, I decided to have chemo first, then lumpectomy. I am married with 2 boys ages 6 and 9. They are very energetic and hard for me to keep up with. I started chemo on July 5. Taxotere and Cytoxan. I'm scheduled for 4 treatments at 3 week intervals. I've had 2 so far. Yay! Halfway there. I have my 3rd treatment coming up this Friday. My second treatment did not go so well. I had a reaction to the taxotere, about 15 minutes in. My upper back and shoulders felt real tight, then I got short of breath. I pushed the nurse call button, and they immediately knew what was happening at first sight of me. I got oxygen, which helped. The pain also went to my lower back. They stopped the taxotere, started a pain med and additional steroids. Things got better, and they slowly restarted the taxotere. We (my husband was with me the whole time) were there from 9am to 5pm. I was wiped out! I also had phlebitis at the 1st injection site- the vein was dark red/brownish for a couple weeks. The 2nd injection site is similar, but hurts like a bruise as well. This time around I'm more tired. I was expecting to have more energy like the 1st treatment cycle. Has anyone else had these problems? How concerned should I be about the health of my veins? I don't have a port, and have just 2 more treatments to go. I'm concerned about continuing the C&T drugs. I'm waiting for a call back from my oncologist.",

I will be sure to ask for left-side IV on Friday. I have had several kinds of reaction you mentioned. First is the phlebitis, which is a dark vein spot on my hand at the injection site. Second was folliculitis- a skin infection. It wasn't itchy, but like red pimples all over my chest. My face broke out a lot, too, but thankfully wasn't red and blotchy. I got antibiotics to clear that up. Now I have to take an acne antibiotic until I'm done with chemo. The 3rd reaction was feeling generally itchy all over. I didn't have hives, though I did give myself a bruise from rubbing an itchy spot too hard. Benadryl and steroids helped with the itchiness. At least the steroids haven't messed up my sleeping too much! My onco office called back. I will continue on taxotere/cytoxan, but they will give me more pre-meds this time. I hope that works. I didn't realize it going into my 1st chemo that C&T seem to be 'stronger' kinds. But I got that impression from others I've talked to about this. I try to think positive about at least one thing every day. At least I still have some hair on my head! It might be short (1/2 inch), but it's mine! And I still have eyebrows & eyelashes. Blessings to all of you :)",
