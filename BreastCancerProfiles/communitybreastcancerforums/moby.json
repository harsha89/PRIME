She said she wasn't worried but wanted it checked just to be sure, she said if she were worried she would make the appointment for me herself and send me straight there. My mammogram is in 12 days, how much should I freak out between now and then? Also she said it was a 2 cm mass and told me exactly where it was, but I don't feel anything, is that normal?
