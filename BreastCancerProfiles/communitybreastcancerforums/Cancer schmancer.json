    "Content": "Cancer-schmancer wrote: Hello everyone. I have only completed 11/33 treatments and am concerned about something. The last two nights, I have been awake because of the pain in my breast. I'm not talking about skin irritation, but actual pain. My nipple feels like it is on fire, but only when I move certain directions. I talked to my doctor yesterday and she said it is inflammation from the radiation and told me to take ibuprofen. She said I could take up to 4 at a time. I have done that 3 times since yesterday afternoon, and it's not helping. Any suggestions? I'm scared of how bad this may get over the next four weeks.
