I am too much of a newbie to post a link but the article is free on pubmed if you search for tomosynthesis detected sonographically occult. (I am a professor and know how important it is to search the med field's terms) The gist of this article is that it is worth pursuing if your mammo says something is suspicious but nothing is detected on US. Trying to get in ASAP to new clinic.  ",

Clinical Imaging. 2017 Aug 5;47:4-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clinimag.2017.08.002. [Epub ahead of print] Ariaratnam, NS, Little, ST, Whitely, MA Ferguson, K To assess the utility and pathological results from DBT VAB for lesions occult on 2D mammography and breast ultrasound (US). A retrospective review of 1116 consecutive stereotactic biopsies was performed over 27months. DBT VAB was performed for 38 non-calcified lesions which were solely detected using DBT. Imaging findings and pathology results were reviewed. Pathologic findings were malignant in 8 of 38 lesions [masses (5) and distortion (3)]. High-risk findings found in 14 lesions. DBT VAB is easily performed and the majority of cases yield actionable pathologies. Therefore, perform DBT VAB primarily when available. ",

Good thing I'm in the classroom and not \"bedside.\" The second opinion came back and they all agree the spot is benign and I come back in 6 months. I am less relieved than resigned because I do not think the data collected at the (satellite clinic with new equipment) diagnostic appointment was as good as the data collected at the main screening office. Alas, my voice doesn't count in this process. And I'm feeling pretty crummy about this whole process. We'll wait for 6 months and see what happens then. Also, I am never going anywhere but the main office again. I hope my links to the new research helps other folks in the meantime. Anita",

Because I'm a professor, I have access to medical journals and I'm seeing that 3D mammograms can pick up masses they are not detected on ultrasounds and end up as cancerous (25%) or suspicious (an additional 25%). YIKES! I'll be glad when I get in for that second opinion!! It should happen in the next week! Thanks! Anita",
