Also treatment will depend on the pathology of your type. Keep positive thoughts.",

I had the remaining nodes removed and 12 /13 positive. I found a swollen node in November 09 and went through neoadjuvant to shrink any possibles. Didn't really help in my case. Anyway, my arm is still stiff. It bothers me in the evenings and when I try to get to sleep. During the day it's not too bad, just like a tight muscle from too much exercise. I have NOT had any lymphedma problems. My BS warned about problems with my first surgery, nothing then either. ",
