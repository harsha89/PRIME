I am 37, had a complete Hyst. at 33 for endometriosis, have two sons - 17 & 14.  Family history - mom had a lumpectomy and is on some preventive medicine for the next five years - not tamox. something else.  She had two sisters die of BC - one at 40 & one in her mid-50's.  My maternal grandma, at least 2 of her sisters and several of mom's cousins all have BC too.  Now back to me - In February I started having discharge - seen my GYN - she ran bloodwork & sent me to a surgeon.  Had a glactogram and then in May a ductal excision where they removed 5 papillomas. In July - found a lump.  Had a mammo/US -saw nothing but post operative changes. Saw Breast surgeon in Aug.  told to only do breast exams laying down not in the shower (that way I won't feel it) and not worry and to come back in 4 months.  Left feeling like I was a huge hyprochondriac (sp). Oct 3rd-went for my yearly.  Told my gyn I was not comfortable and she ordered a MRI to pacify me.  She feels what I am feeling but I got the feeling that she thinks I am overly worried.  So in between my check up and yesterday - I noticed some discharge not alot.  At first - I thought it was just me having spilled or something.  So Sunday night it was there again.....Yesterday I went for my mri - I told the tech. She ran the tests and told me that they were ordering copies of all my previous mammos. They only had the ones from last year and this year and then asked me/told me I needed to make an appt. with my dr.  So I called my dr. today.  The nurse said they don't have any results - but they need to see me on Monday.  Is this normal - or is there something that they think is there?  I thought they would just call me back and tell me the results over the phone like the do for bloodwork etc.  Should I be in the panic I am?  Am I totally over-reacting and worrying for nothing???? I would really appreciate any feedback and advice you may have- because I am scared. Thanks- Melissa Log in to post a reply",
