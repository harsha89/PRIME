Eileen, yes I've noticed my hair thinning.  Mostly in my part.  I plan to ask the med onc about it next week.  I had a period a couple of years after I had my son where my hair really started to fall out.  Had a ton of tests and nothing was found.  So the docs said it was likely a delayed hormonal reaction after pregnancy.  Now I think it's related to stress. Brenda, I'm going to do some research on the emotional challenges to find some good reading.  Some of the psychology stuff is way too deep and I think finding something that's good and readable might be tough.  There has to be a way to get a better ratio than 50% good days.  Or in my case getting to more than 50% of each day being good. I can't seem to find importance in much of anything and find myself screaming in my head to people 'I don't care about xxx, don't you realize I have BC!'  as if everyone should understand my inner struggle.

Kim, I have the bumpy rash too.  I used a mix of hydrocortizone and lamasil (the cream for athletes foot).  Weird but it really took the itch and redness down quickly. I'm sorry you, Spendy, Karen, Kickon and so many are getting hit with the fatigue.  Know that this will pass soon.  I'm 2 weeks post rads tomorrow and just yesterday and today have started to feel human again.  Keep eating the protein to keep up your strength. Linda, hang on, you're almost done and your throat will get better soon. Julie, I hope you can get some rest.  Not sure how you're functioning with so little sleep. I really feel for you and admire you for pushing through all of this.  Is there someone who can drive you to the spa and back?  Grab any chance to get a cat nap in. Take care, and have a wonderful and restful night everyone!  Donna.",

Thanks for starting this topic, you really helped get a very supportive group together.  There is so much comfort coming from sharing here! Linda, what a great pink surprise celebration! You are loved. Julie/Karen, my rad onc said to come back in 6 months.  Then if I'm follwed by the med onc and the surgeon no need to come back.  I think the surgeon said every 6 months for 2 years then once per year.  We'll see what the others say.  I don't want to use my personal time or vacation time for those either and none have office hours evenings and weekends. Brenda, nice to know you have support from your new boss.  That's a tough position to be in changing jobs during all this.  You're right about the control, but maybe it's time we give some things up and let others take them on.  I haven't figured it out yet.  Instead of feeling the relief of giving up assignments I too feel like I'm letting folks down. Sonia,  sorry your struggling with all the feelings and emotions.  In time it will get better.  I worry too about everything now and wonder how folks can be going about their business without this cloud of cancer over them.  I'm happy for them, but then annoyed.  The whole 'why me' thing is very real and I have to admit that I didn't get it before it happened to me either. Spendy, I miss the techs too....even the cranky ones :) Patty and everyone still going to the Spa everyday, stick with it, we're here to see you through!

That one is really good and I usually double all the veggies and make it more like a stew and add some spices.  Have been too hot to make it lately ;) I'm getting my question list together for my med onc appt on Thurs.  I'm convinced I need every scan possible but I'm sure she's going to tell me the worry about mets and recurrence is unfounded.  Hopefully I'll come out with only the 'T' script and no need for any further testing for a while. Picked up a book called Embracing Uncertainty by Susan Jeffers.  I'll let you know if it has any merit and if it meets it's claim of finding peace of mind when facing the unknown.  Also picked up a book of curry recipes.  We started to really get into Indian food this past year and it seems like pretty healthy eating.  I'm going to mark the recipes with the most anticancer foods and give them a try.

Kim, I've not been asked about my prognosis. But I did ask the med onc and the surgeon.  Both said good, about the same as the general population.  It's not how I have always thought about cancer in general, so I'm skeptical and want to try to define 'about'.  Then again, not sure if I really want to know either. I'd like to think if you make it to the 5 years your less likely to have recurrence or mets beyond that, but I've know some women who have had it happen around 10 years out.  Likely the docs don't speculate because they simply can't predict.

Kim, Whine away, we're hear to listen.  Tooth pain is the worst.  I hate when then discover something that is painful to fix and costs a fortune when it wasn't even bothering you in the first place.  Hopefully they can get it squared with the root canal. Sonia,  I can relate to the cognitive changes.  It's amazing when I go back and look at my work how many mistakes I'm making.  Problem is, it's really not bothering me.  Just not important any more.  Cracking me up with the positive thought reminder shock collar.  I\"m sure they make one in pink with a little ribbon tag (sorry I'm anti-pink these days)  Julie, hope you get to the bottom of the arm pain.  I've heard it's rare but any lymph node removal can cause it.  I know a woman who has it and just broke her wrist too.  So pins, a cast and lymphedema, I really feel for her. Brenda,  Happy Thanksgiving to you too.  Hope your mom is ok.  My grandmother had cataract surgery in her 90s and did really well, my MIL too at 85.  It's just a lot to keep up with the eye drops and follow-up visits.  Hang it there with her. Patty, my BS called Tamoxifen a chemo pill as well.  My husband told me after I woke up that I had to have chemo and I fretted about it all week until the follow-up when I found out she was referring to the 'pill from hell'.  Ginny,  maybe draw a circle where the bruise is now and take a picture.  If it enlarges outside the circle, insist they take another look.  Best to you as you go through your rads.

Sorry we're all this negative angry cycle.  It has to be driven by the follow-ups.  It all comes flooding back walking into the hospital, just as Chicago says.  All the stress of missing a          possible recurrance, or false positive, or second guessing decisions is way too much.  I feel like I've aged 10 years from the stress not the cancer. Kim, I never heard about truncal LE until my appt yesterday. Sorry to hear you're dealing with it.   I kept thinking the swelling was from rads, but the doc thinks it may be LE because the swelling in my boob and underarm isn't any better.  My arm swells a bit when I over use it but it goes away with stretching.  She gave me a scrpt for a compression sleeve and bra and therapy if needed.  Like you I don't know how I'm going to fit it in and honestly don't want to fit it in. Rest of the appt was ok.  She said to put the inconclusive results out of my mind as there is a lot of radiation damage and likely due to that.  She pretty much blew off my hip and joint pain and said it was 'hip' week because everyone was complaining about their hips, but never really got any type of answer.  Almost forgot, the name of the book I keep carrying arround but haven't gotten into is  Embracing Uncertainty by Susan Jeffers.  Subtitled breakthrough methods for achieving peace of mind when facing the unknown.  Seems like a good fit for what we're facing. Best to you all and thanks for being here.  I always feel better after stopping in :)   Donna.",

I think we got similar patches when my son hit his back on a diving board and had about a foot wide scrape.  Very lucky he didn't hit his head, but his back was just raw.  I'm going to call my aunt who's a wound specialist to see if she can get me some...since it's pretty pricey and I don't have an appt till next week. Otherwise I'm just holding all the Vaseline gauze and Teflon padding in place with a really thin cheap inside out t-shirt.  I mold it to my shape on top of a thick layer of aquaphor at night.  A lovely sticky site in the boudoir :). Julie, you have a great celebration plan.  Nice to have something to look forward to. Almost Friday... have a good night ladies. ",

Marilyn, thanks for the insight.  I wonder how long the swelling will last?  I thought the rad onc said to expect the rad side to end up smaller. Linda, so glad you're done!  Congrats to you. Sonia,  my skin peaked at about 1 1/2 weeks after boosts...2 1/2 after the end of the full breast.  All the skin got darker and darker with alot of those little bumps that were very itchy.  Some spots, like the underarm and underneath the breast blistered and started to peel. Then it turned around and is getting lighter every day and you can see the new skin filling in really quickly. I use Cortaide and Lamisil (sp) on the itchy parts and Silvadene (sp) a prescription and aquaphor on the blistered oozy parts, with lots of vigilon, gauze and padding to try to keep it moist and avoid rubbing. Scary how the rads keeps it's path of destruction so long after being zapped.  Hope you can avoid some of these SEs and heal quickly. Take care. Donna.",

It would be great to keep this group going.  I've learned so much from you all and have kept my sanity knowing I'm not the only one going through these crazy emotions and thoughts.... and SEs.    Disappointingly I don't feel that I'll ever be done, even through I'm healed from rads.  I can't even respond when people ask if I'm done.  My mind races to future scans, and getting called in to talk about the results, and the whole nightmare starting all over again.  I've been in the stage IVs forums too and there both terrifying and inspiring.  But I've vowed to stay out as it only seems to fuel my mets obsession and I truly feel bad spying on their personal thoughts.  You're all right, keeping busy is the best medicine.

Kim,  glad to hear you're doing well.  I know what you mean about not wanting to deal with anything more. Even the little stuff that's just slightly frustrating wigs me out. Tracy, sorry to hear that you may have to have the hysterectomy.  Thinking about you and hope all turns out well.  Julie, we have to take these pills for years so waiting a while and letting other things settle shouldn't effect anything.  Maybe the name brand won't give you the headache.

Lear, I had an excision and then waited for a second opinion before a re-excision, then had a problem with healing an open wound.  So my radiation was about 3 months from my first surgery.  The Rad Onc wasn't worried.  He said that if it were longer, like 5 or 6 months, that they sometimes do the boost first instead of at the end.  You may want to ask them again to clear up your questions and feel comfortable. Karen, Tai Chi sounds nice.  It's fascinating to watch everyone concentrating and moving in unison.  Good luck with it and let us know how it goes. Sonia, glad to hear your having better days. When's the cookie exchange?  Wouldn't that be fun!  My BS calls tamoxifen chemo too.  It was very confusing at first, but it's powerful and hopefully what we need to keep the cells at bay. Brenda, you hit it on the head...big time denial.  I guess now we're facing the truth and that's ok, just hope this phase passes quickly :) Can't get in for the lymphedema eval until the 11th.  They're suggesting 3 times per week for 90 min each.  I wasn't expecting that. I thought they would measure me for a sleeve and show me some stretches.  I'm going to take it though, figure it will give me a forced break in my workday and will feel like I'm back doing something. Feeling better because today was my last day of work for the rest of the year!  Only a few more days before we leave for London.  Really looking forward to spending the time with my son and watching his amazement taking in the history.  Counting on ending the year positively distracted from BC and wish the same for each of you!    Donna.",

Definitely ask for the gel pads, they're cool and soothing. I think they're called vigilon.

I've missed you all and feel re-connected after reading the past couple of weeks of posts.  Thank you for keeping this string going, it's really a life line.  London was great, very productive work wise and had a couple of days to see the city.  I lit a candle for all of you July 2010 Rads girls at Westminster Abby, I hope the prayers help each of you.  While there I felt free and almost normal.  I think that was from being away from the regular routine and also that many of the folks I work with there don't know about my bc, so no questions or health updates. Back now to the roller coaster world.  Had a follow-up with the dermatologist for the eczema on my rad breast.  She gave me some more powerful steroid cream.  She also found a changed growth (kind of a cross between a mole and a skin tag) on my leg.  It looked pretty small, but three stitches later it's off and with pathology.  She told me that it was nothing and not to loose sleep over it, then she saw the tears in my eyes and said that she was sorry, realizing that I've heard those words before.  Trying to not focus on it.  I go back on Tues to get the stitches out and hopefully will have the results. Always something.  Still having rib pain from time to time and arm/arm pit pain when I use my arm too much (pulling the suitcase really bothered it).  Breast still sore when I roll over on it and it's still a little swollen.  Still itchy, skin very dry everywhere, nails peeling and the warm flashes continue....all the docs claim from the T.

Julie,  Your mom was really special and I was touched by her prayer jar.  Take your time with going through her things and your sister's.  My mom passed a month before my wedding and while I was away on my honeymoon, my dad thought he was helping and had everything cleaned out.  He thought we'd only want the jewelry, but it was some of the little things, known and unknown, that I always wish I'd had the opportunity to touch and hold and maybe save.  It's so hard, but you have wonderful memories and those will help you through it. Kim, Right there with you on obsessing over food and 'offsetting' good and bad. If I have two cups of coffee it's ok if I balance it with 2 cups of tea.  I feel so silly, but keep rationalizing this in my head.

Kim, I too was told only annual for the good side.

Brenda & Chicago, the race is a good idea.  My son would like to do it.  He's running cross country (has a big meet today that's why I'm up so early).  He laughs that he'd leave me in the dust, but training would provide some focus.  I've thought about the 3 day too, but it seems so emotional, so I'm not sure I'm ready to walk and cry for 3 days.  I think it's too soon.

I saw the BS today for these red scaly skin patches.  A week of cortaid and they only got bigger and few more popped up.  She thinks its eczema, or a delayed rad reaction, or SE from the T, but since their on my bc breast, she took a punch biopsy.  She said it would be really rare for a recurrence to show like this, and it would be really rare to have a different type of cancer occur after going through rads.  She gave me the choice to watch it for 2 weeks or have the biopsy today, so I said go for it.  Waiting until next Wed is going to be hard enough. So I'm with you Chicago, way too aware of BC everyday and could do with a little less pink.  Hope you're Onc thinks your bloodwork is normal too. Take care everyone and enjoy the weekend.  Donna.",

Thank you all for your support and positive energy. I would be in a corner curled in a ball if you weren't all here to encourage and share.  xo Donna. p.s. Tracye,  hope you get word soon.  Sending hugs and good thoughts to you.  Donna.",

Brenda, the ice cream sounds amazing.  When you're in Phoenix you can look for See's chocolates.  They should have the peels, and they also have Orange crispies, which are like peppermint patties but orange. Julie, good luck with the new doc tomorrow. Sonia, Have a safe trip.  Hope you have a wonderful time and see great things and eat great food (lots of turmeric). Karen, I'm going to give up being angry for Thanksgiving.  I'll let you know if I make it past tomorrow :) Take care everyone and special prayers out to you Tracye.  Donna.",

Sonia,  They said since the other side was beg nine last time so it has to stay on an annual schedule.  So that one will get scanned in March, one year post dx for me. I've started and stopped a book on living with uncertainty a few times.  Think it's time to push myself to read it. Julie, hope you're feeling better for your weekend.  Have a great time! Have a good weekend!  Donna. ",

Brenda, the thing about going through the door gave me some relief.  I've been tossing out and giving away a ton of stuff.  Hopefully it just means I need to get through the door.  I was worried that sometimes old people start to give away there stuff as they prepare for the end.  Thought it was some kind of foreshadowing. Sorry you're having a difficult time with feelings and docs and information everyone.  It's hard to know who to believe.  My BS said no MRI the first year because there are too many changes from rads.  She said we'll see maybe at 18 months or 2 years. Had the LE eval and they said it's mild, but I still need the therapy to keep it at bay.  Contra to what I've heard, they say that it is reversible and manageable.  So 4-6 weeks about 2 times per week (they want 3 but are booked), then they fit me for a sleeve and cami/sports bra.  The sleeve only when I fly and the cami all the time since most of my swelling is in the breast and armpit.  I'll have to keep a tally Chicago, my $10 parking 'donations' are going to add up again. Anyway, I'm going to the Rehabilitation Institute and it was a very humbling experience walking through there.  So many people with major major problems, including kids, and they were all working so hard.  Everyone was happy and smiling.   Kind of confirmed for me that the physical battle, when you're actively doing things to recover promotes hope and positivity.  Too bad it's such a small portion of this battle compared to this emotional/psychological recovery. Have a good night everyone.  Oh, Karen, have them point the machine at my muffin top :)  please.",

He'll get a good laugh. totally with you on the time commitment with the LE. It's a full time job between the massage, wrapping, washing the wraps, etc. If I get half in each day it's a victory. Trish, so sorry to hear about your recurrence. Sending you hugs of strength and hope your treatment all goes well. We're here for you. Take care. Donna",
