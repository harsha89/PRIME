Here is the website for the phase I trial: http://www.bionovo.com/media/mediaarchives/Bionovo_Breast_Cancer_Research_Treatment.pdf. In short, it had good activities in vitro with both Her2 neg and pos breast cancer cell lines and seems to be well tolerated by patients.  Almost 50% of the patients that took it had either disease regression or stable disease.  Hope this can be another option down the road. I don't post much, but for those who have read my previous posts, I am here mainly for my mom who is going treatments to liver mets.  I am happy to say that although her tumor markers are still high, her liver did return to the original size since she has been on Taxol/Herceptin.  Although side effects from Taxol is hard for her, especially the diarrhea, but she is fighting on.  Log in to post a reply",
