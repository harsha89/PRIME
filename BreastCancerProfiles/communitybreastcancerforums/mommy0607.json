It scared the crap out of me. It is almost 2am...I should be in bed with my husband and kids but I cant sleep. I am so scared. I have noticed that the nipple to that breast lately has been sinking in. And, my breast hurt often. My stepmom had breast cancer and made it through. But, she is a strong woman...I am not. I dont know what to do. I want to wake my husband...but I am scared. I have a 7 month old and a 22 month old....its not fair. I have NO clue what to do right now. I health insurance...except this woman's health program...maybe I can go to the ER and that will cover it. I dont know. Please, someone help...I dont know what to do. I am so young......I am sitting here crying while I type this I am so scared. Alicia Log in to post a reply",

It was so hard to tell my husband. To wake him up and tell him that I found a lump. He keeps telling me that everything will be okay..he always has a very positive attitude about everything that is part of why I love him so much. Thanks again for the advice.",

And, there is no way we can afford to pay for it. I was in a wreck the 13th where my car was totaled....so b/c of that we have gotten behind finacially. We are SO SO SO behind on bills it aint even funny. If we would get the check for my  up car then we would be doing better and could catch up bills and get me another car.back  Anyone know what I can do....I am stuck. Even if I have no way to get and forth....I dont know how to drive standard which is what the car is that my husband had to get after the wreck to get us some type of vehicle to get back and forth. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place...what do I do. I called and talked to my stepmom today...I thought she was gonna think I was stupid and all she said was get it checked out. She did think I was dumb for worrying so much. But, I was happy that she was supportive. Anyone know what I can do.....PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I am eating non stop..i have literally been eating since I have been up this morning. I know it has to be my nerves or the fact that it is about to be my time of the month. But, it sucks! I am SO scared about what they are going to say next Wednesday. I have a kid that will be 2 on monday. I am way too young for this. Well, I really say that because cancer doesnt have a certain age group that it 'sticks to',  I'm SCARED! And, there is no one talk will really talk to  me about all of this. I think because of that I am bottling up all of my emotions and  i dont know how to handle it. Everyone just changes the subject...and I think my husband is avoiding it because it scared him too. I just really dont know. I am totally lost..this is very scary and what makes it worse is I dont live near my famliy so I dont have them around for support. I am sitting here watching my kids play and I dont want them or my husband to loose me. I dont wanna think that way but its kinda hard not too. I am a religious person but even prayer doesnt even seem to calm me down. Someone tell me what I need to do. IM SCARED!!!! Is it always this scary?",

I have already started to talk to my Dr's office and they are referring me to the hospital for a mammo and a ultrasound.....then who knows what....its scary!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of my friends that I work with who is about 20 years older than me has told me that if I want when I go to have it done she will go with me. For extra support....and so I will have a female there too and not just my husband. I was tempted to just forget about the whole thing.....THEN....i looked at my 7 month old son and decided that I just couldnt not do it. He is sitting in his walker playing. So, I decided no matter  how scary this may be....I am going to do this for him and his big brother who will  be 23 months on the 11th. And, also for my husband who may be a pain in my rump sometimes...he is the best husband I could EVER ask for.  Even though my 23rd bday is 2 weeks from today and my anniversry is coming up and I DO NOT want to be doing this right now. I am going to for my boys and my husband. So, as soon as I get done typing this I am going to call the hospital and see about getting appt. set up....even as scary as it may be. WISH ME LUCK!!!!!!!!!!",
