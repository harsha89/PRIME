I don't have BC but my mom found a lump in her breast this past Monday(from what I gathered I think she may have had a mammogram last year) anyways, she found a lump and called the doctor. She went in on yesterday and they did a mammogram and a ultrasound. Both showed there was a mass in her left breast. Radiologist said it \"looked\" like cancer and was suspicious so they scheduled her for a biopsy on Monday. I'm really worried and didn't sleep a wink last night worrying myself. I've been researching since she said it looked like it could be. Asked alot of questions and from the symptoms it just sound like cyst. I know I'm no doctor but from what I've been reading, if it is mobile(meaning it moves) 9 times out of 10 it's not cancerous. Also asked if she had any other symptoms and there are none. Just a lump towards the bottom(outside) of her left breast that she can only feel when standing and she can move between her fingers. Again I know I'm no doctor and she is having a biopsy Monday to determine whether it's cancerous or not. It's the waiting game. Please pray for us. Log in to post a reply",
