So i did. ",

Then I went to Mayo and got a second opinion, and they sent me back to my oncologist saying he is on the right track and we should start again--so we did.  I take the Navalbene every week, and am getting some side effects, but am getting through it.    Get the biopsy and a scan and find out where you are. ",
