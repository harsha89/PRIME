The procedure though was very painful because the area they were trying to biopsy was right behind the nipple, so needless to say I cried like a baby when they injected me with the anesthesia. But once it set in, I didn't feel much after that. They wrapped me up and told me to put ice on it for the next 48 hrs. I'm just worried tomorrow may be very sore...will get my pathology results on Monday, unless of course hurricane Isaac doesn't cancel my appt ( I live in Miami, so the media as usual is being over dramatic about this storm). Will keep u posted on my results! I'm praying it's benign!",

I too have been googling like a mad woman, lol! but at the end of the day, i feel its best to not stress out because i dont think stressing out will get me anywhere. So im trying to stay calm and hope for the best...its out of my control at this point, so i'd rather stay positive and motivated. Im sorry to hear you are having similar concerns, are you seeing a doctor for your symptoms? if so, will you be doing any tests soon? Im praying for you as well...and thanks for checking in, it really does help to talk to others who are going through similar things :) Â All the best, Lisa xoxo",

I'm a 28 yr. old married woman, and my husband and I have been married for three years and do not have any children but plan on it someday. These past 6/7 months I started experiencing a yellow nipple discharge from my left breast only. When I noticed it, I thought maybe I was lactating and was pregnant so I went to the gyno and it was negative. Gyno told me nipple discharge was common and it should go away but when I saw blood then go see a breast surgeon. Months passed and I continued to have the discharge on a daily basis. Around May 2012, I woke up and my shirt had drops of blood on it and I immediately got nervous. So I called the surgeon my gyno recommended, and she sent me for an ultrasound....it came back negative. She told me to wait a few months and see what happens but I got upset and insisted I get screened again, so she sent me for a mammogram...again, negative. However, ive continued to bleed from my nipple and I insisted to the doctor there had to be something she could do because I was very frustrated and I needed an answer to what was causing this..she told me the next thing to do would be an MRI but that it was too expensive and wouldn't recommend it unless it was absolutely necessary and she didn't feel it was. But again, I insisted because I knew what I was going through was not normal for me no matter how \"normal\" the doctor said it was. Last Monday, I had my MRI and I was supposed to come in to see the doctor tomorrow for my results. However, this past Wednesday I got a call from the doctor's office and they told me the doctor reviewed my MRI and found an abnormality- therefore they want to schedule an MRI guided biopsy, send it to pathology and then the doctor will see me with results....so bascially, the MRI I insisted on, detected something. So now here I am, waiting on my biopsy which will take place this Thursday. I wanted to reach out to you ladies to get your thoughts, have u ever had an MRI guided biopsy? What should I expect? Is it painful? I have to admit that I'm not scared, just anxious to get this over with! Log in to post a reply",
