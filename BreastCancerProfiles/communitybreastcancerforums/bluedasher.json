That will also find a thread on an external 5 day partial breast radiation.  I looked into it a bit. Your stage is based on the size of your IDC, but you can't have Mammosite if the whole tumor (DCIS plus IDC) was too big. The cavity has to be the right size - not too big or too small and it has to be not to close to the skin.  I don't fit Mammosite criteria because mine was too close to the surface of the skin.  In my understanding, all of the partial breast radiation methods are considered experimental. They don't yet know whether it is effective enough to just radiate the breast close to the tumor bed or whether whole breast radiation is needed. It sounds like lemonjello's rad onc believes the latter. There are trials under way for various partial breast treatments vs the traditional whole breast one. They may find that partial breast is effective enough but it will take many years to track recurrence from the current trials to know.",

I think part of the rash was because I was washing my hands very often. I only got the rash during the first cycle or two of chemo.

I want to be able to have sentinel node biopsy rather than getting all the lymph nodes taken out and I don't think they can do that if one gets chemo first. Also, I didn't think that 3.5 cm was large enough to justify doing chemo first. Even that figure is a little misleading about the size. The lump looked like two round lobes connected together so 3.5 cm is the distance measuring the length of the two lumps together. The whole thing was about 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 3.5 cm before the biopsy. And one of the lobes was a cyst so there wasn't much left of that half after the biopsy punctured it. We didn't discuss the direction he will go in. It didn't occur to me to ask anything about that. The lump is pretty near the surface. Now I'm wondering if there is enough room for him to get margins between the cancer and the skin.  I'm amply endowed so I expect to have plenty of breast left. ",

The Herceptin that both my2boys and I are on is an antibody to a receptor on our cancers. Strictly speaking it isn't a chemo drug and it side effects are usually relatively minor - it usually doesn't have the blood effects that chemo drugs do. I've seen Taxotere or Taxol and Carboplatin referred to as \"light chemo\" because it has less side effects than some other chemos, but no chemo is really light. And I think just about every chemo drug lowers white cell and red cell counts because chemo drugs effect rapidly dividing cells and that includes the production of red and blood cells. Of course, the dosage used also plays a role in how strong the side effects are. Lower red and white cell counts are a common side effect of both drugs that your father is getting. Chemocare.com (a site with information on the various chemo drugs including side effects) lists increases in liver function blood tests as a less common side effect of Taxol and Taxotere. So far my creatine level has been okay. My white cells went down very low with my first chemo. The neutrophils (white cells that fight infection) went down to almost zero and I got a fever from that. Since then I've had to take a drug to increase my production of white cells (Neupogen). After three treatments, my red cells were low enough that I needed a transfusion before I could have my fourth treatment. Staying hydrated is very important on chemo and it is often a struggle to do so because there are times when chemo makes food taste bad and sometimes because of nausea and other digestive effects of chemo. I hope your father feels better soon too.",

Survival rate is essentially the same for lumpectomy plus radiation and mastectomy and recurrance is essentially the same (according to Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book). I decided to get the lumpectomy a week ago - now I'm waiting for the pathology report - hoping for clean margins. To me, the biggest disadvanatage of lumpectomy is that they might find out that they didn't get clean margins and need to operate again and the biggest advantage of the lumpectomy is I keep a breast that has nerves - reconstruction can produce something that looks like a breast but it doesn't have sensation. A similar issue applied to getting the SNB vs full removal of the nodes. The risk that more surgery would be needed later vs less risk of lymphedema. In retrospect the SNB has been responsible for most of the post op pain and discomfort so I'm more worried that a node might be positive and they would want to do more surgery there. ",

If low minerals are causing them, fixing that may help. I was told to eat bananas for potassium for the ones I had during pregancy.  I've had blood tests near when I had the cramps and all the blood chemistry levels were fine so I don't think low minerals or dehydration caused mine. If you had chemo, that might have made you low on one of the minerals. I was low on magnesium at the end of chemo though the level had been brought back up before I started getting the cramp.",

If the margins came out dirty, I could go back and get a mastectomy. Also mastectomy would have involved a lot more surgery and downtime from work for me. I'm large breasted so I would have had to at least get a breast reduction on the other side.  I'm glad chose that way.

I wonder if when they use the radioactive indicator they end up removing the sentinel node more precisely. I can't help you with the cording.

I did get tired around mid-afternoon a couple of times at the start and once took a nap. Maybe that was the after effect of chemo - but it wasn't any worse than one might feel some days when not on cancer treatment - sometimes the mid-afternoon drowsyness just strikes. Other than that, I felt I had normal energy levels - perhaps because I felt so much better than I had during chemo. I worked full time all through rads and never felt it was a strain to do so. Working through chemo was much harder and I did have to take some days off then. My RBC was low at the end of chemo and I was still anemic at the end of rads so I'm surprised I felt good. I had almost no burns from rads. Mostly my breast just got pink, swollen and kind of tender. The only area that felt burnt was under my arm. Perhaps that was because at the beginning I didn't think the field extended that far so I wasn't putting aloe vera gel and moisturizer there. But it also seems to be a pretty common place to burn. It was only first degree - no blisters.",

It doesn't matter how permanent it is - the skin cells flake off. Also, just about everything that you can use on skin will have some solvent that takes it off so the various creams remove it. My skin reacted and even blistered with the tegaderm after my surgeries so covering pen with tegadrem wasn't an option for me.   I went with the tattoos. Mine are tiny - one between the breasts and one on each side some inches under my arm. The two on the sides are hard to find when I look for them and the one between is quite small so I only notice it if I look for it.  I felt that any pen mark would be larger and would tend to spread and fade over time so it wouldn't allow for as accurate positioning. It seems like some places use tattoos in different locations or more tattoos than others. When you have your first meeting with the rad onc, you might ask what tattoos your facility uses. If you really want to use an ink and not cover it with tegaderm, it will just need to be redone often.",

I'm a conservative Jew and the religious prohibition was the one reason that I considered not getting the tattoos. It is permitted where medically necessary and I felt that the greater precision of the marking and the dangers of radiation to my left side avoiding my heart justified this. They did use markers to check the alignment for my boosts. Over the course of the weekend, the marks totally disappeared but that didn't much matter because they had a template that lined up on distinguishing features like my scar to redraw it with and they didn't really seem to need those marks except as a check because then never had to make adjustments to my position which was still lined up with the tattoos. Perhaps iodine would have lasted better. I have pretty reactive skin including my reaction to Tegaderm but it didn't react to the tattoos. It is just the tiniest dot of ink in one pin prick. I suspect that if your skin isn't reacting badly to the various external inks you have tried, it will probably do okay with the tattoo if your place is like mine and uses very tiny tattoos. I do some cake decorating as a hobby and when the full strength paste food coloring (such as Wilton's which you can usually find at craft stores like Michael's) in dark colors like purple or royal blue gets on my hands, it can be very difficult to get off. It seems to absorb into the skin a little ways. You might try that if the iodine doesn't work out. My whole year of treatment was marked by the Jewish calendar. Surgery recovery last year during the High Holidays. Sukkot Shabbat dinner with our Havurah at our house before starting chemo. Making goodies for my grandson's bris and Shalach Manot for Purim just as I was recovering from chemo. Pesach towards the end of rads. And coming up, my last Herceptin and port removal during Sukkot.

The difference is that I had a VAD biopsy which took pretty big hunks out of the tumor and cyst. That totally deflated the cyst part and it didn't refill. There is nothing on my biopsy report about the fluid that was vacuumed out so I don't know if there were cancer cells in the fluid. When the lump was removed, part of the solid part was DCIS, part was IDC, and the remaining wall of the cyst was benign. The IDC part was 0.9 cm. But it is possible that it was bigger before the VAD took hunks out of it and it is possible that part of the cyst wall that was taken out had cancer cells - especially since the path for the VAD was chosen to take the most suspicious parts of the lump.  Tumor size is always an approximation anyway - they are looking at the longest dimension rather than the volume of the tumor. A long skinny tumor could have the same \"size\" as a round ball shaped one. Anything between 2 cm and 5 cm with negative nodes makes it stage IIa. If it was between 1 and 2 cm it would be stage Ic. In any case, I don't think this makes much difference for your treatment decisions so you don't need to focus on it too much. It is more important that your tumor is hormone positive and HER2- (both are good factors) and that it is Grade 3. The NCCN practice guidelines for breast cancer take the same path for any tumor over 1 cm (and even for any tumor between 0.6 and 1 cm with unfavorable features which includes grade 3).  Another factor is the results of the oncotype. Grade is one way of determining how aggressive cancer cells are. It is done by looking at features of the cells under a microscope to see if they are more close to regular cells or more different. It is a somewhat subjective measurement. Oncotype isa another way of determining how aggressive the cancer cells are. It looks at the genes in the cancer cell to see how many are present that lead to aggressive growth. A score less than 18 says that recurrence risk is low and hormone therapy should be enough. Above 31 says that recurrence risk is high and you should probably have chemo. Between those two numbers is intermediate risk and a gray area for chemo (there is a clinical trial underway to see what the outcomes are for chemo vs no chemo in this range). I hope that your oncologist or surgeon has ordered the oncotype test. ",

My tumor was hormone negative and HER2 positive. The post surgery pathology said it was 0.9 cm but I was concerned that it might have been over 1 cm before the VAD biopsy took big bites out of it. HER2 positive, hormone negative cancers tend to be very aggressive so the NCCN practice guidelines say consider chemotherapy and Herceptin if it is between 0.6 and 1 cm and have chemo if it is over 1 cm. I decided to have chemo partly because I was concerned about the accuracy of the size - my tumor may have been over 1 cm before the biopsy.  About mid-way through my chemo in December 2008, MD Anderson released results from a retrospective study of women with tumors less than 1 cm who hadn't had chemo. It turned out that the recurrence risk for HER2+ tumors in that group was higher than previously thought  - about 23% so that made me sure that I had made the right decision. I'm glad that I considered my upper estimate of what my tumor might have been when making the decision.",

Is there anything out there that quantifies the effects they have found? Is it a matter of losing a few points on IQ tests or is it more severe? Is it just \"forgetfulness\"? My reasoning ability is very important to me and very central to the way I make my living. But I've always been a bit of the \"absent minded professor\" - my mother use to say \"You would lose your head if it wasn't glued on.\" Over the years, I've developed good coping mechanisms for that so if the issue is just forgetfulness, it isn't a big deal to me.  If chemo gives me slightly improved survival odds but with a significant change in intellectual capability, I would hesitate to get chemo. I'd rather live fewer years with the brains I have than more with diminished abiltiy in this area. I wish I could get the data to make an intelligent decision.

That is somewhat true though 90% sounds a bit high. I mostly work from home but my job involves some business travel. Fortunately we were able to schedule my chemo so that most of my travel falls during the third week of cycles when I should feel pretty normal. I'm on TCH like Sue and we are an example of how chemo hits different folks different ways. For me the day of treatment and the day after I feel pretty normal. Some people get Benedryl as a pre-med with their chemo - I think it is because Taxotere and Taxol sometimes cause an allergic reaction. If you need that, you may be pretty sleepy on the day of chemo - I look around the room and see many people sleep through much of their chemo. I don't get Benedryl - I take my laptop and cell phone and put in close to a full days work on chemo days. The first time the days 3 through 7 were bad for me - a couple I didn't work at all and others I had to take a nap and work only part of the day. For the second time my medication was adjusted (a bit lower dose of chemo drugs, adding Neupogen and tapering the steroid). Day 4 I started to get tired and needed an afternoon nap. Day 5 I was exhausted all day and did a couple of conference calls and not much else.  Day 6 and 7 were the weekend and I mostly rested. Day 8 I worked most of the day but needed to stop ealy to take a nap.  Day 9 I'm pretty much back to normal. So, it looks like I will miss about 1 day per cycle and have 2 that I'm not entirely functional. For 15 work days per cycle that isn't quite 90%. Also, the rest of the cycle I still need more rest than I do when not on chemo. I did a one week business trip the third week of the first chemo. This was for technical meetings including some that I chair so it is extremely demanding. During the day I was pretty normal but I couldn't do evening meetings because around 8 o'clock I would get to the point where I had to rest.  It was great to go to my meeting and be with my colleagues who are all very supportive. It has been great to have time to focus on work and not think about cancer. Colleagues do ask how I'm doing of course, but they have let me guide how much we talk about that and then we move on to work. For me to not work would be much harder - work is too much of my normal life and I appreciate the chance to be normal 80% of the time on chemo.  During the hard part of my cycle, I'm very glad to be working from home where I can lie down for  a bit on a bad day. ",

Once they know you have that problem, they can give you a medicine to encourage production of white cells each chemo cycle (either Neupogen or Neulastin).

For HER2+ tumors less than 1 cm and node negative without chemo, MD Anderson did a retrospective study and 5-year recurrence was about 23% and distant recurrence was about 15% -- distant recurrence = mets so that's bad stuff. Most of the recurrences occurred between 2 and 4 years after diagnosis. On the other hand in BCIRG 006, 4-year recurrence for node negative women was 14% after chemo without Herceptin (AC-T) and 6-7% after chemo with Herceptin (TCH or AC-TH). Now, I realize that's comparing 4 year numbers to 5 year numbers, but on the BCIRG 006 charts, most of the recurrences were between year 1 and 3 and they are tappering off by year 4 so I expect that the 5 year numbers will be about the same as the 4 year ones. And also note that the tumor had to be bigger than 1 cm to be in BCIRG 006. 23% recurrence (and 15% mets) without chemo for tiny tumors vs 6 to 7% recurrence for bigger tumors with the best chemo and targeted drug treatment that we know of today. I don't care what someone sees a cell do in a lab mouse. Maybe chemo gets some cells moving but kills them off before they do any bad. Data analysis and clinical trials in real women say that I had about a 1 in 4 chance of recurrence and a 1 in 6 chance of mets if I didn't have chemo. Chemo and Herceptin brought that down to maybe 1 in 20 (assuming that my 0.9 cm tumor is less likely to recur than the 1 to 5 cm or larger tumors in BCIRG 006). That sounds like a win to me. And Julie, I believe it is a good idea for almost everyone to have a diet rich in vegetable, fruits and whole grains as well as exercise. (Not for everyone because I know a couple of people with colitis who have to limit those.) But you didn't chose a very good example of diet helping - from what you wrote on other threads, you had 4 miscarriages and it doesn't seem to me that going from not conceiving or implanting to conceiving and miscarrying is an improvement. I'm sorry to bring this up, because I understand that that was a very traumatic experience and even more so when it occurs after you have gotten to the second trimester and feel you are in the clear, but it felt wrong to leave out.",

When it started growing in after chemo, it seemed pretty straight and I was worried that I wouldn't know what to do with straight hair. Now it is getting long enough to show the wave and it is pretty much the same wave I'm use to. Goldie, I think your hair is cute. It is hard going from the straight hair in your photo to curly hair now. It took years to learn how to work with my wave when I started wearing my hair short ages ago so I'm glad it has come back to that. All those who are use to straight hair and having to adjust to curly have my sympathies. There is a learning curve to managing it and because it doesn't look like you in the mirror, it doesn't look cute to you even though others can see that it looks nice.  The growth rate seems to have picked up a bit in the last month. I've got about 1 and a half to 2 inches (the top is a bit shorter than the rest) for 6 months from chemo.

The lump isn't always all cancer and the ultrasound and mammo just tell you the size of the lump. For example, the lump on my ultrasound looked like two balls connected together and the total length was over 3 cm. The pathology from surgery showed that part of the lump was a non-cancerous cyst, part was DCIS and part was IDC. The IDC was less than 1 cm.  That and negative nodes in the SNB moved me from a possible stage II after the biopsy pathology to stage I after the surgery pathology. For some others, it goes the other way with the cancer extending past the lump.  The MRI and PET are detecting the activity of the cancer cells so they should be more reliable on the cancer size. Radiation has some risks. I don't know which side your cancer was on - if it was on the left, there is a risk of heart problems. More so for radiation after mastectomy. On either side there is also a risk of lung problems. These risks are small but may be larger than the benefit. If the rads onc feels that the risk of rads outweighs the benefit significantly, she might not be able to prescribe rads even if you want them. The doctor can't be expected to use a treatment that carries too much risk compared to the potenatial benefit. If you don't agree with her, of course you can go get another opinion. It is fine to drive your treatment, but you might have to do that by finding a doctor that agrees with what your want.",

The radiologist knew which parts of my lump he most wanted to sample based on that (and part of my lump was benign - only part was cancer).  However, one doesn't know for sure until the biopsy. And even then, if it is cancer, the biopsy will tell some things about the cancer, but one won't know everything until the lump has been removed. After my biopsy, I knew that I had IDC but only had an estimate on the size of 2 to 3.5 cm (based on the size of the lump) so I might have been stage IIa or IIb depending on whether the nodes were involved. After the lumpectomy, it turned out that I was node negative and the IDC part of the lump was less than 1 cm so I was really stage Ib - the cancer was caught very early. Decades ago, I had a lung X-ray that came back with a shadow on it after pneumonia was gone. At the visit where my allergy-pulmonary doctor told me it was there, I was left with no doubt that it was cancer. I still remember the hushed tone in which he told me that it was behind my heart and inoperable. I left the office with no doubt that I would be dead soon.  Well, around a week later, the CAT scan showed that it was a harmless calcium nodule and follow-up X-rays over the next couple of years confirmed that it wasn't growing.  So a doctor can sound like he is sure and still be wrong.",

My leg hair came back around the same time, but I never shave it. My DH agrees because he doesn't like the stubble when it has been shaved and starts to grow back. At first the hair seemed to be coming back faster on the sides of my head than the top but that was mostly because the hair on the sides lies flat which gives more coverage while the hair on top started out standing up. I'm 4 months out now and it is pretty evenly covered except a little thinner at the temples. People keep telling me how good it looks and this weekend some people who didn't know I had chemo thought it was just the style I had - but I'm not sure I believe them.

Monday I did my opening presentations with hair, and Thursday with a scarf but the important thing is that all my motions passed as usual and we made a lot of progress.  Of course the main thing the guys did was still treat me the same way as always and respect me controlling the meeting.

If there is fever, hot breast, a lot of redness or maybe if the discharge is cloudy like there is pus in it, the situation is more in need of urgent action. But she should still call if possible to check. ",

Of course, I don't think that the effect of radiation on cancer cells or breasts changes at the border but there is one possible issue that concerned my rad onc that may not be addressed by a Canadian study. Both Herceptin and BC rads may interfere with heart function. Of course they do their best to choose angles to avoid exposing the heart to the radiation but they can't be sure it is getting none of the dose especially when radiating the left breast. Because I'm on Herceptin, my rads onc didn't want to give me the higher dose without studies that reported on the safety for women on Herceptin. The Canadian study didn't report whether the women were on Herceptin. I know that in Europe, Herceptin is usually give for 18 weeks so a women getting rads is done with it but in the US it is usually given for a year. I'm not sure which is usual in Canada. I hope that some of the trials of 3 week rads underway in the US will report on that for women going through this in the future. I felt that my rads onc was being over conservative particularly since Herceptin has so far had a negligible effect on my LVEF, but I understand his position. There is another limitation of the Canadian study that applies to me. The Canadian study excluded women with large breasts due to concern that the higher dose would hurt the cosmetic results for those women. To be in the study, you had to have negative margins, negative lymph nodes and not have large breasts. Something has to be under 25 cm for that last one, but I'm not sure how the measurement is done. I was more concerned about this one than the Herceptin one but it didn't concern my rad onc. BTW, my HMO owns its radiation facility and has doctors on salary. My rad onc had no financial incentive to do 5-week rather than 3-week. The HMO got a $10 co-pay for the rads consultation visit either way and there were no co-pays for my treatment including the rad onc visits during treatment. Any financial incentive is to treat as cheaply as possible as long as that doesn't produce a recurrence or side effect that they also have to treat (though I feel that they aren't driven solely by that and that I have received excellent treatment). They are participating in a clinical trial of various shorter duration treatments but not at the location where I was treated.",

My onc said that the bumpy red spots were acne but they may have been folliculitis which is where the folliculs get inflamed. (If they get inflamed and stopped up that's acne). She prescribed an antibiotic cream and that seemed to help calm my scalp down. She also said to go bare headed at home when possible to let the scalp get air.

The study is BCIRG 006. Here is the announcement of FDA approval for Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin and here is Genentech's timeline for herceptin. Both Cytoxan and Carboplatin are alkylating agents so the perform a similar function. And now a dumb chemo question that occurred to me after talking to a friend who is a chemo  nurse (and may be my chemo nurse) tonight: You get well hydrated before chemo and then you are sitting in the chair with popscicles, juice, ice chips and your lunch all hooked up to the medicine  - for first chemo she said it can be 5 hours because they have to start the Taxotere slow in case of an allergic reaction - what do you do about going to the bathroom? Even when not being super hydrated, I normally need bio-breaks closer together than 5 hours. ",

I had a VAD biopsy which took out a pretty big chunk of the lump so I'm a bit concerned that the IDC might have been over 1 cm before the biopsy. So I told her I would prefer to do chemo. We both agreed that the benfit of chemo for me wouldn't justify the cardio risks of AC-T or FEC so I will get TCH like TNT - 6 cycles and then continuing the Herceptin for a year.  I'm starting on October 27 so I'll just squeak into the October chemo crew. TNT thanks so much for the detailed description of getting the port. Until you posted I hadn't found much about ports other than the picture of one in place. I'll get one too. Is anyone getting Neupogen rather than Neulastin for low white cell count? My doctor normally doesn't use either unless there is a problem with white cell count. She said that on this therapy it usually isn't a problem. But since I may do some business travel while on chemo she said she could prescribe Neupogen for me. I've read a lot here about Neulastin but not Neupogen.  It would be a subcutaneous injection that I'd give myself - I'm kind of nervous about that.",

This person stuck me 3 times without getting a vein all the time blaming my veins for rolling. When she was getting ready to do the fourth one, I told her that if she didn't get it that time, I wanted someone else brought in to do it.  She agreed but got it on the 4th stick. Plus I don't know why but the sticks were more painful than usual - the back of my hand is still tender. And then I currently have a shoulder problem on the non-breast cancer side - where she managed to get the stick in my forearm meant that my arm was at an awkward angle that hurt my shoulder when they put in the solutions. Just to add to my discomfort, the chair was high to make it convenient for the tech and had no foot rest leaving my legs dangling. The tech was worried that he was going to get kicked - well, if they want to not worry about that they should provide some place for my feet.  Then the rest of it was lying on the table for over 30 minutes while they did the scan from 3 directions. He said that was because it was the first time the do 3 angles - later scans will just do 2. That was really boring - next time I'll have to prepare some problem to think about while lying there. Today I was too out of sorts from the multiple sticks and aching shoulder to think of something with which to distract myself. I hope the first part of this goes better when I have a port.

Mother78 - I don't know what to recommend. I think a lot of my problem was that I went into the procedure very uncomfortable from not eating. I don't know if the twilight sedation would have helped much. I'm not a terrible wimp about pain except I really don't like IV's but I'm not great at fasting. It would have been better for me to have made a firm decision ahead of time to not use the twilight and then I wouldn't have had to fast. Or to have been scheduled for an early appointment. I couldn't do that because of the chemo class and wanting to get this scheduled before my first chemo. I'm in the mushy middle too, but my tumor was a bit bigger than Jill's I think - mine was .8 cm and might have been a bit bigger than that before the biopsy took out a chunk. So I'm doing TCH which has little long term risk and less side effects than AC-TH. My situation doesn't have enough long term cancer recurrance risk to be worth the potential heart damage and very small luekemia risk of the Adriamycin in AC-TH. TCH is a newer chemo combination for Herceptin positive cancers but in the testing that was done it is about as effective as AC-TH.  Jill, yes it is odd how much the recommendations vary on a lot of things. They put a regular bandaid type dressing on my neck incision, not the plastic one so perhaps that is part of why they don't want me to shower. And keeping a wound dry at first does usually help it heal. ",

Partly it is because I was in the third week of my second chemo cycle so I haven't had much side effects to post about - just a raging case of butt rash due to the cumulative effect of days of diarrhea earlier in my chemo cycle. I switched from Beudreaux's Butt Paste to Balmex - the first is nice because it washes off hands so nicely but the Balmex is a bit thicker so it has more staying power and I needed that. The Balmex washes off pretty well too.  That got bad enough that I wasn't in the mood for \"you know what I mean\" one night but its better now and my DH has been great. Also, since I work and he is retired he already did most of the house cleaning, laundry and grocery shopping - even while providing day care for our 18 mo granddaughter so I'm pretty lucky. Quietness kind of feeds on itself because there aren't questions from others to answer.  On Monday I go in for TCH Tx #3 and I guess some of the others that started on the same day as me will be going in then too. I checked my blood test results on-line and they look the same as before Tx #2 so it looks like I'm holding ground. I'm a little anemic but everything else is in normal range. Maybe that will produce a bit more action.",

The hard part was getting the needle in the port - it took about 6 trys by 2 chemo nurses iand one sent up from radiology. The power port has a smaller target then the ones they use to use. Normally it isn't a problem, but sometimes like my case when they use it shortly after surgery they have problem. The area was still swollen tipping the port a bit and the dermabond around the incision made it hard to feel the bumps on the port that were under it. They used the numbing spray but it didn't help much. At my suggestion they gave me ice between trys which made it feel a bit better. And taking my bra off helped the area lie a little flatter. They said they won't have this problem next time when it is healed.  After that the rest was easy. I didn't feel the needle once it was in and I was able to work during chemo. There were no IV pre-meds for me. I had Decadron pills to take starting one day before chemo and continue the next two days and Zofran pills to take for 3 days starting the first one just before chemo. I also have a prescription for Comapzine to take as needed.  So far I haven't noticed any side effects - not even metal mouth or sewer mouth. Does that usually start right away. I almost done drinking my 8 glasses of fluids for the day. The sparkling Martinelli's apple cider went down really well. I brought that and a 20 oz bottle of water with a slice of lime to chemo. If anything, I have the opposite of dry mouth - my saliva glands are a little overactive at the moment. At first I thought that might be the beginning of Nausea but it hasn't happened.   Lynn, Doctors approach to anti-sidei-effect-meds sure varies. Mine starts out with minimal ones and then increases them if needed so I won't be getting something to raise my blood counts unless blood testing shows they are low. Normally she would test just before the next chemo but since I'll be traveling the 3rd week after chemo, I got her to order a test mid-cycle so I can know if I'm low for traveling and can get something. For my chemo, Taxotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin, she said she would Neupogen rather than Neulastin. She said one Neulastin does is about like 10 Neupogen so she would give me 3 Neupogen doses over three days if I need it. I would be taught to self inject - yuch but we do what we need to do. She said it isn't good to stimulate too much blood cell production - it can cause spleen problems and it causes more side effects. I like my doctor's approach - I don't want to take side effect medicines for side effects that I don't have when they will cause more side effects like being drowsy from benedryl. Certainly if I have problems I'll want the extra medications added.",

      "Content": "Nov 8, 2008 06:48PM - edited Nov 8, 2008 06:50PM by bluedasher unique, my sig is a translation of the full text of the song (modified slightly to fit the same tune - the translation would be a bit more accurate as: The whole world is like a narrow bridge and the main thing is to not fear at all). It is the sort of short song that would be sung aroud a festival table. The song doesn't have anything about faith. The source of the text is Rabbi Nachman of Breslav (18th centruy) though the Hebrew of the song isn't an exact quote - it's tightened up to fit a song. What he actually said was about not allowing fear to paralyze you. My parents weren't religious so I didn't grow up knowing the song. As a freshman in college, my dorm mate was afraid to walk on campus at night and pressured me to not do so either. A few weeks into the first quarter, she, her boyfriend and I had gone to the computer center at night to work on a class assignment. I finished very quickly and fell asleep on a couple of chairs waiting for them. I woke up with a stiff neck and they still weren't finished. That's when I realized I wasn't willing to live a life bounded by fears - mine or hers. I told her and went back on my own.  After college, I got interested in backpacking and hiking. It is pretty common to come to a place where one crosses a stream on a log or stepping stones. I grew up with amblyopia which was fixed when I was a teen and lacked confidence and experience with my depth perception. I quickly learned that fear can make a tricky situation of crossing a narrow bridge more dangerous. I needed to be able to step boldly across - not teeter with mincing steps. I had to set fear aside to do what I wanted. That activity is where I met my husband (now of 30 years). So, when I first learned the song it really resonated for me. It's my theme song (or mantra). The way I understand it, its a useful thought whether you are a person of faith or not.   P.S. When I was in my 40's, a guy with a sawed-off shotgun tried to hold me up. \"Tried\" because at the time I was walking with empty pockets. I didn't have anything to give him and had a hard time convincing him of that during 10 minutes of looking into the end of the barrel. I really thought he was going to kill me. He let me go because a couple came near and he turned his attention to them. Afterwards, I concluded, that even if I had died that night, I would rather have the years I had lived the way I wanted than many more lived constricted by fear.  P.P.S. After he let me go, I took the first opportunity seconds later to warn other people away and use a phone to call police. He had held up a sequence of people and the earlier ones scooted for home and called police then or didn't call the police at all figuring it was futile. The dummy kept working the same spot fortunately so they caught him as a result of my call. ",

Since I've been feeling lousy with a persistant light fever, I my onc ordered blood counts. The whites were really low so she started me on Neupogen. I'll have that propholactically for the rest of the cycles. This whole thing took about 5 hours because I had to go for the blood test, then the doctor appointment, then down to the pharmacy to get the neupogen and then wait for a chemo nurse to be available to teach me to inject myself. We spent about an extra half hour there to wait for my friend who is a chemo nurse to be available to do the instruction but I think it was worth it to have someone I trust so teach me. And if I have trouble she can come by and help me. For the first time I gave myself an injection and it wasn't bad.  Monday isn't a good day to do this - the whole place was so busy. And I had some frustration at the pharmacy because we checked that they were working on my prescriptions and then when they called us up, it turned out that they had done two pill refills but not the Nuepogen so more waiting. ",

They had seen something on the X-ray they did when I went into the emergency room for a fever during my first chemo but the portable X-ray they use there isn't as good so my onc had me go in for a follow up X-ray to check from various angles. Based on what the radiologist wrote, it could be calcium in old scar tissue. The odd thing is that I had a shadow on my X-ray about 18 years ago that my allergy and pulmonary doctor got me all freaked out about - normally a great doc but he really thought it was lung cancer and told me it wouldn't be operable because it was behind my heart. Then it turned out to be a calcium nodule from scar tissue - I'd had a spell of breathing problems for about 8 years at that point so scar tissue wasn't a big surprise. But on a follow-up X-ray in 1997 to check on it they couldn't find it. I guess this is around the same area because my onc said it was in the upper left quadrant - that sounds like behind the heart to me.  She is setting up a CAT scan to check it but she warned me that CAT scan's sometimes increase worries because they see little things that aren't significant so I shouldn't get freaked out about that in the report. I stay in for the 4 days or so of my cycle that I'm really exhausted, but the rest of the time I see people and various friends call to check on me. The Neupogen keeps my white cell count pretty good throughout my cycle so I don't worry about being around people though I do try to be extra careful about washing my hands. Between trying to keep very hydrated and some diarrhea, my hands get washed a lot anyway. I'm slightly anemic. I wasn't before chemo My doctor said iron won't help because the problem is low red cell count because the chemo slows or stops production for a while and the old cells that die don't get replaced. I do get tired in the evenings but I don't know if that is the anemia or just the chemo drugs. I noticed that when I took a walk the up-hill portion was much harder than usual and I think that may be because I don't have my full complement of red cells bringing oxogen to the muscles. ",

With so many prescription drugs being made non-prescription and sometimes not being cheap, I'm glad to be able to get them with a tax advantage that way. Check IRS publication 969 if you want to verify that. If your (or your spouse's) employer offers an FSA, you can get that regardless of your medical plan. A Health Savings Account (HSA) is the one that requires you to have a high deductible medical plan. The difference is that FSA amounts are use it or lose it - if you don't have enough expenses to use everything in the account during the year, you lose what is left. An HSA can carry over the part you don't use from year to year. RockFan, I haven't had any bruising other than where I have bumped into things and today on the spot where they did my pre-chemo blood draw yesterday. But I think maybe I'm bruising a bit more easily. The blood draw went well and wasn't showing anything when I took the cotton ball off after more than 30 minutes so I'm surprised to have a bruise today. Maybe you have had minor bumps that you don't remember?",

I didn't and was very tired and unable to do anything for about a week due to low neutrophils (a kind of white cell). After a blood test showed how low my white cells were, my onc gave me Neupogen and it brought the WBC counts back up after a few days so I felt much better. If you are getting Neulastin or Neupogen, it can cause bone pain. You might ask your Dr if you can take Aleve. I've found it much better than Ibuprophen for my pains. It really helped my bursitis shoulder. And I was on 800 mg dowses of Ibuprophen for that. Fammy,  I have tried the bands for seasickness and they didn't help me as far as I could tell. I only wore them for a day and a half because I found them too irritating to my wrists. ebann,  I walked about 2 km today. It does help but today I was having a harder time. My red blood cell count and hemoglobin were below normal on my pre-chemo blood test yesterday. It was day 20 so I'm disappointed that they had gone down instead of up since day 11. The long up hill on my walk was much harder than usual. I hope it doesn't stop me from having chemo tomorrow. I've been careful to get enough iron so that isn't the problem. I'm back to doing the resistance exercises for my bursitis shoulder and that is going well. Therapy has been delayed by surgery and chemo. I'm glad to be able to get back to doing something for it. Tonight I made some ginger snaps. I'll keep some out and freeze some so that I have supplies for combating nausea. The home made ones are so much better. I also modeled hats for my DIL and granddaughter to get advice on which to keep and which to send back. Since I got back from a trip yesterday, this is the first time that my DIL saw my almost bald head. I have a thin coating of peach fuzz but the scalp is very visible.  I was worried about how she would react - she is 18 months so it is difficult to explain to her. But it didn't bother her at all. She would look at a hat and say \"cute.\" Pretty soon she was borrowing the hats to try on herself and switching hats on my head.",

They did various checks for infection including a lung X-ray. It turned out the be a neutropenic fever (a fever due just to very low white cell count with no infection) but there was a spot that concerned them on the X-ray. It was a low resolution portable X-ray so the picture wasn't that clear. When I went in for my next pre-chemo check, my doctor ordered X-ray views to check it out better. Then the next pre-chemo visit she told me that there was something there that might be a calcuium nodule because it looked pretty smooth. I could either have a CAT scan to check it out or wait 6 months for a follow-up X-ray to see if it was growing. I asked for the CAT scan. Since it wasn't an emergency, the first appointment was 3 weeks later which was yesterday.  Now I have to figure out how to get the results as soon as possible. Normally they would come through my oncologist but she is on vacation until the 5th and the results should be available on the 2nd. Maybe I can get them from my primary physician.",

Monday I had to get 2 units transfused instead of my chemo because my RBC was so low. That made me feel better and I had chemo Tuesday.  Apparently, I react to Neupogen with nausea - a less common side effect. Strange because the chemo drugs haven't had that effect on me. Zophran and Compazine weren't helping it last time so this time they gave me Ativan which I used last night for the first time. It solved the problem but really knocked me out. Maybe that was because the Decadron had interfered with sleep for the previous nights. I'll try it again today if I need it and see if it still makes me so sleepy now that I've had a chance to catch up on sleep.",

At stage I and less than 1 cm, I'm not sure the doctor will say chemo, but I think he probably will because it is HER2+, grade 2 and hormone negative. Also, the VAD biopsy took out a pretty good chunk so maybe before the biopsy the tumor was over  cm. I'm hoping the onc will want to go with TCH because I'm concerned about having the heart effects of Adriamycin or FEC on top of those of Herceptin. I'm trying to continue to work. My job involves traveling about once a month to meetings with between 50 and 1500 of my favorite colleagues. I'm hoping to be able to do that with the chemo, My surgeon thought I could, but I'm a bit worried about lowered immunity. ",

Today I was scheduled for chemo class at 10 AM and register at 12:15 for port insertion at 1 PM. No solid food after midnight, clear liquids allowed until 4 hours before so I had a cup of tea and a glass of apple juice. I had pushed fluids the night before too because my veins aren't easy and I wanted to be well hydrated to make the IV easier. I took a shower and washed my hair since I wouldn't be able to shower for a couple of days. I would be able to have a late lunch at 2 after the port insertion. This all seemed so easy this morning.   Chemo class was okay though a bit boring since it was paced for the slowest adults in the room and anyway I already knew much of what was being presented, though there were items about the way things are done at this facility that I needed to listen for. So I get registered and wait for the port insertion. It turns out that the two proceedures (not ports - other things) scheduled before mine had run very long and they didn't bring me in until about 4 - by that time I'm feeling kind of shaky from not eating and I guess I'm not so well hydrated any more. The nurse had to do two sticks to get the vein - he said it was the first time he had to put down two attempts in the computer. When they asked at 2, I said I was unsure about whether I wanted the twilight sedation or not. As it got close to 4, I was pretty sure I wanted to get the sedation because I wasn't feeling like toughing it out at that point. After the IV was in, the nurse asked if I wanted valium and I said no because I wasn't tense, just cold and figured I would do the twilight so I didn't need that plus valium.. But they didn't ask again about the twilight. I don't know why I didn't bring it up - I think mainly by the time they took me in to the room for the procedure I just wanted to get on with getting it done. Usually I'm pretty decisive and push for what I want but low blood sugar overrode that. The room was really cold even with the blankets they had on me. The first couple of lidocane shots really stung, but the other ones weren't so bad because the area was starting to get numb. The procedure seemed to take forever though it couldn't have taken that long - we left before 5 PM. The worst part was that I got the shakes really badly in my arm and legs. I have bursitis in that shoulder at the moment so the shakes were making the shoulder hurt. They said that there is something in the shot with the lidocane that reduces bleeding and can cause the shakes. A couple of times I felt warm liquid gush down my neck - blood from the juglar vein. And then when they went to put the port in the pocket part of the area wasn't numb - very painful - they had to inject a bit more. At that point I really wanted to just get up and leave! After the surgery, the pocket area felt fine but my neck felt like it had been kicked. I guess it wasn't that bad because by about 8 PM it was feeling okay unless I moved the wrong way.  The blood had soaked the back of my surgery bonnet and gotten onto the back of my hair - so much for washing it ahead of time. The nurse tried to clean it up with a wet towel and thought he had gotten it out. Around midnight I woke up and found that my pillow was stained because there was still blood in my hair. I couldn't deal with going back to sleep that way so I went to the kitchen to wash it with the sprayer. Then, changing the pillow case, setting the pillow case and the towel to soak with oxyclean because of the blood. Changing my shirt which had gotten wet. The neck dressing which is suppose to be kept dry and stay on for 48 hours got damp too but I'm worried about changing it - that is the point where I melted down. They went in to my juglar vein - can I safely change the dressing so soon? Is it okay to leave on? - the surface has dried out and I can't deal with the mental picture of blood gushing out if I try to change it even though I'm pretty sure that they sealed the vein and that wouldn't happen - I hope its okay to leave it. The Versed that they would have used in twilight sedation acts as an anti-convulsant so maybe with that I wouldn't have gotten the shakes. I'm really not sure if it would have been better to take it or not. It was nice afterwards to not have sedative after effects and be clear headed.  I feel I shouldn't complain - I'm so much more fortunate than so many - my cancer was caught early so it is unlikely to ever become life threatening, I have an understanding boss. My company provides great health coverage so treatment isn't costing us much, but at the moment I'm having trouble keeping that in perspective.",

You will probably have 3 or 4 prescriptions to pick up so the copays could use some of that up. I have one for steroids, two for nausea and one for Neupogen. The steroid and my nausea meds are generics so they cost barely more than my $10 copay. If your copay is more it might not take the whole thing. Another nausea drug that some need - Emend, is not generic and the Neupogen cost about $1000 for 3 doses - the best value I've ever gotten for my copay. If you have a higher copay for non-generics figure that in.  I had one emergency room visit due to the effects of low white cells. You might leave something in the FSA for that copay until you get close to the end of the year.  Chemo has made my eyes a little dry and I use the preservative free drops that come in little single use vials because that is what my Lasik surgeon recommended.  It has also been drying for my hands - I got a non-smellly hand cream or moisturizer because chemo can throw your sense of smell/taste off.  Immodium. Those are the things on the list that I've used most so far. I got two extra digital thermometers - one for my desk and one for my suitcase. It was convenient to have a thermometer handy for monitoring my temp when low white cells made it bounce around.  If you start your chemo before the end of the year, you might see what you use most and stock up before the end of the year on more. I'm trying to decide on the amount for my flexible spending account for next year.  It is so unpredictable.",

The rest of the hair isn't showing any signs of coming out. My son clipped it short with scissors when I got home. My scalp is kind of irritated and has lots of little bumps on it so we were worried about using clippers or a razor to buzz it short or shave it. He did shave the sideburns.

I had TCH therapy - I'm glad I had that rather than AC-TH because of the risk of long term heart problems with AC-TH and also because about 2% of the time AC lowers the heart function to the point where the woman can't get Herceptin.

I'm glad someone is doing a study of 4 cycles vs 6 - but if Lisa participated in a study in 2009, it is probably too early to have results. There also is a study of using just T (don't recall if it was Taxotere or Taxol) and Herceptin for Stage I (or maybe Stage Ia and Ib but not Stage Ic). The early studies all focused on more advanced cancers - mets first, then node positive (sometimes plus some high risk node negative).

I definitely needed the Neupogen - I didn't have it the first cycle and my neutorphils went almost to zero, I got a neutropenic fever and felt extremely tired so not taking it was not an option. Mine was not as severe as yours - it wasn't 8 hours at a time. Mine was what I called evening sickness because when it struck I couldn't keep things down in the evening. Compazine and zophran didn't help. They had me try Ativan and that did work for the nausea. I found that I could take a half pill during the day without getting drowsy and still stop the nausea. Immodium worked for the other end for me - I had diarrhea off and on through chemo and didn't think to correlate it to the shots vs the chemo cycles. Like yours, it would strike too long after my chemo treatment for chemo to be the likely culprit and pretty close to when I took the Neupogen shots. I was on Taxtotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin every 3 weeks and this usually hit during week 2 a couple of days after I started my Neupogen shots.  My onc pooh-poohed Neupogen being the cause of the nausea - she thought Carboplatin can sometimes cause delayed nausea, but some of the chemo nurses agreed that Neupogen sometimes causes nausea. I guess it is a fairly uncommon side effect. What I had was also kind of wierd in that I wouldn't get much warning - I would feel okay sometimes, eat something and suddenly feel nauseous and vomit. You might ask them to check your magnesium if you have been vomiting a lot. They didn't check mine until they did a full chemical panel 3 weeks after chemo and it was quite low. Vomiting can deplete it and it is really important to a lot of your body functions. I lousy for the 3 weeks after my last Tx - at that point the nausea didn't go away. Then they got the test results and gave me an IV with magnesium along with a transfusion and I felt much better. Apparently, low magnesium can also cause nausea and vomiting so it can be a bad spiral if it isn't fixed. Mine must have gotten really low because they retested in a few days and it was still quite low so they gave me more IV magnesium and put me on a supplement for a while.",

The lumps are near the surface and can be felt but they  still used the ultrasound to make sure they got the parts they wanted. They spent some time discussing the location and the best path to use. I liked how the doctor (male) listened to the suggestions from the techs (female). And they all kept me informed about what they were doing.

Where she talks about trials that I know about, such as BCIRG 006, she is presenting the results accurately and her logic holds together. I think one of the issues is that the taxanes are relatively new (given that it takes 5 or more years of follow-up to have confidence in a trial result) compared to anthracyclines. They spent a while being tested for mets and when they moved to adjuvant testing the first tests were of adding them to anthracycline based chemos.  Therefore, there are lots of trials showing the older chemo regimes with anthracyclines work. There is only one trial, BCIRG 006, of AC-TH vs TCH - it was a large trial with 1000 women per arm so I have confidence in it but some feel that one can't be sure about the results until there are multiple trials. I think that is also the case for the trial where she said TC wins. So some more conservative oncs stick with a chemo that has had more trials showing that it is effective. Some others use them for node positive disease but use the non-anthracycline ones for earlier disease becuase for the former they want to use the one with the most proof of effectiveness and for the latter they lean towards using one with lower risks of severe side effects even if it doesn't have as much proof. In your case, the recommendation might have been partly because of your medical history of a nerve issue - they might have wanted to avoid using a taxane. There are some chemos that use neither taxane nor anthracycline. She mentioned CMF. Maybe that is something to discuss with your onc. You could also ask your oncologist about the video directly. Or perhaps the MUGA should be repeated. There is some variability in the test results depending on the tech, the equipment and your individual variation.",

You also didn't say whether you were PR- (progesterone) which often goes along with being ER- but not always. MD Anderson reported on a retrospective study of wome with small (less than 1 cm) node negative tumors who didn't get chemo. They looked 5-year disease-free survival (DFS, i.e. survival without recurrence and distant-recurrence-free survival (i.e. mets - I don't know an acronym for that - I'll use MFS). For triple negative:   DFS ~ 85%, MFS ~ 96% For HER2 +:           DFS ~ 77%  MFS ~ 87% All women with HER2+ were included in the HER2+ group regardless of hormone status. Other studies that have separated out HER2+ hormone negative and positive show higher recurrence for hormone negative so if you are hormone negative the numbers above under estimate the risk a bit and for hormone positive they over estimate it a bit. The numbers would get worse as tumor size gets larger than 1 cm. Based on those numbers and the fact that there are very effective chemo plus Herceptin treatments available for HER2+ cancers, I'm very happy that I went with chemo. In BCIRG 006, women with node negative tumors had a 4-year recurrence of ~ 93% (still waiting for longer term results to be released). That's a lot better than the 77% in the MD Anderson study and to be in the BCIRG 006 study you had to a have a tumor larger than 1 cm. Triple negatives without chemo don't have as much risk as HER2+ but still enough that many opt for chemo.  Not all chemos carry the same risk. I didn't want to do a chemo that included anthracyclines like AC-TH or FEC because that would increase the risk of heart damage especially in combination with the Herceptin that reduces recurrence risk for HER2+ so much. Therefore, I went with a taxane based chemo, TCH which BCIRG 006 showed was about as effective as AC-TH with less long and short term side effects. ",

From what you have said so far, it sounds like your onc is planning to use TCH chemo which is what CCBaby and I got. The side effects vary depending on how your body reacts. Usually they give you steroids (e.g. Decadron) starting the day before chemo and ending the day after chemo.  Like a lot of people, I felt pretty good the day of chemo and a day or two after except for not being able to sleep much due to the steroids, then the tiredness would hit. They give you drugs for nausea but tiredness just is.  The first round is sometimes a bit more difficult because you don't know what to expect or how to deal with it. It turned out that I needed a drug to boost my white blood cells that my onc didn't give me until my body showed that it needed it and that made the first time harder. For the 2nd and 3rd ones, I felt really tired from day 4 to about day 8 or 9 and then got somewhat better.  By the 4th cycle, I started getting the cummulative effect and the last two were the hardest (I came down with a cold as I got chemo 5 which contributed to this). On all but the last two of the 6 cycles, I felt close to normal on week 3 of the cycle. I worked all through exept occasionally on days 4 through 8 of the cycle I would take a day off or work a very short day. I occasionally took a nap on the days when chemo was making me tired and I was working a full or almost full day. I work from a home office so I was able to do this. I went on business trips sometimes during week 3 of a cycle. After the last cycle, I felt kind of weak. It seems pretty common to have some muscle weakness after the 6 weeks of chemo. By about 5 weeks after my last chemo, I felt I had my physical strength back. After I was done with chemo, I got Herceptin every 3 weeks until I had had it for a year. It can be a bit confusing when people talk about getting Herceptin because sometimes they include it as \"chemo\" but it is really an antibody and doesn't affect your body the same as chemo. It usually doesn't have a lot of side effects. I don't notice any. My last Herceptin is in two weeks. If you are getting TCH, we have a thread for people on that chemo.",

You might as her oncologist or surgeon for the pamphlet.  Chemo is hard on mucous membranes including those in the vagina. So gentleness and some extra lubrication may be necessary.

At the place where I go, the check-in for rads is very streamlined - I type my last name into the computer. The picture gives them a double check to make sure they have the right treatment matched to the right person. The other pictures are so that they have a reference for what your set-up looks like so they always set you up the same way as when you were scanned. I think just about all the places take pictures. They told me 30 treatments, but didn't tell me that was 25 whole breast and 5 boosts until I asked. Boosts are extra treatments of the tumor bed - the area around the tumor that was removed.  The CAT scan shows your soft tissues as well as the hard things like bones. When they started the boosts, they showed me a picture on the computer that showed the position of the cavity where the tumor had been taken out. There was an outline of 2 cm past that all the way around which is the area that gets the boost. They use the information from the CAT scan to decide the position of the machine to get radiation to all the area that they want to hit while getting as little as possible of the other tissue.  The area being treated normally has at least some swelling and pinkness. For some it goes farther toward burns. I'm in the March radiation group with Nelia. I think she has had about the hardest time and I've had about the easiest so between us you can get an idea of the range of side effects. I'm almost through - just two more boosts - and I'm not noticing any fatigue. Mostly my breast is just tender (i.e. it doesn't hurt just sitting here but hurts a bit when pressure is applied), swollen and pink. I have one small area on my side that is more red and hurts like a 1st degree burn - no blisters so far. I think in the beginning I didn't realize how far on my side the radiation was going and didn't apply the aloe vera enough to that area which may be why it burned a little. The information packet they gave me indicated that some of the side effects like sore ribs are more common when they are radiating after a mastectomy than with a lumpectomy. I had a lumpectomy. My place has separate waiting/locker areas for men and women, but they are open to the hall so they aren't really private. The changing cubes have real doors that close with an overlap, not restroom stall doors with a gap that someone can see through so it doesn't bother me that the locker area is open. The gowns tie in the back and I'm wearing pants so my bottom is covered and I usually don't tie my gown. They normally take me in right away so it isn't worth it to tie. I think you might get better answers about the LCIS by posting in the LCIS area. Ductal cancer is more common than lobular. From what I have read, LCIS is considered to be a condition that is a possible precursor to cancer but isn't cancer and it may not need treatment other than hormone treatment. But if you have doubts about what your onc is suggesting, you could get a 2nd opinion.",

Oddly, three other toenails have popped off without warning. This happened in the last couple of weeks about 5 weeks post chemo. None of them hurt at all. There seems to be a bit of toenail that had grown under the old nail before it came off and the part of the nail bed that is uncovered just is like regular skin rather than the usual sensitive under the nail skin. One other seems like it may be getting ready to come off. My toenails are growing really slowly so the ones that haven't come out don't have much normal toenail growth on them. My fingernails are much quicker growing. My fingernails are almost entirely normal nails except for about a quarter inch at the tips of the thumbnails and an eight of an inch on the others.",

Recurrence free survival means any recurrence including both local and distant. The BCIRG 006 results I've seen only give that number. The MD Anderson retroactive study on recurrence for node-negative tumors less than 1 cm without chemo gave numbers for recurrence free survival (77.1% for HER2+) and distant recurrence free survival  (86.4% for HER2+). So about 23% had recurrences and a bit less than 2/3 of those (14.6%) were distant recurrences. Edited to add the BCIRG 006 numbers because the numbers without chemo might be rather alarming - with chemo the numbers are much better. Disease-free survival after 4 years with TCH or AC-TH chemo was around 93% and with AC-T it was 86%. Minimum tumor size in that study was 1 cm so everyone in the BCIRG 006 study had bigger tumors than anyone in the MD Anderson study but with chemo plus Herceptin about 7% had recurrences while 23% in the MD Anderson had recurrences. (The BCIRG 006 data I have is for the 2nd interim review of results so it is after 4 years rather than 5 for the MD Anderson numbers but most of the recurrences occurred between year 2 and year 3 so I expect that the 5 year numbers will be about the same as the year 4 ones.)",

I didn't get benedryl and was on Decadron, a steroid, so I was always very alert during chemo and I felt good on chemo days - the side effects didn't hit me until a few days after. So I always brought my laptop and worked during chemo. I also brought a lunch or snack bag depending on the time. They had water and ice chips there. If you get taxotere, sucking ice chips during the infusion is suppose to help prevent mouth sores. I wore comfy clothes and made sure my top had a v-neck, scoop neck or buttons so that they could access my port easily. They had blankets and pillows so I didn't bring my own.",

An odd reaction to either the carboplatin or Neupogen would cause me to have sudden nausea and vomiting late in my cycle. I'd feel okay and then suddenly be sick before I had time to take anti-nausea medicine. I was a bit worried at the end of chemo about how weak my leg muscles had gotten and how long it would take to get strength back, but between week 5 and 6 after chemo most of it came back. I think getting my magnesium levels back up helped. I worked through treatment - though sometimes during chemo I worked a pretty short day and took the occasional day off. Rads fortunately went very easily. I didn't have any tiredness from rads.  People generally took their attitude from me. I worried about my husband because he is the type to put on a strong face to try and help me through but be worrying inside. I've been done with treatment long enough now that that would have shown up and he seems to have come through fine. My kids (all adults) were fine, my toddler granddaughter didn't seem bothered by my bald head. I didn't have to tell my parents - my Mom died long ago and my Father is kind of senile and barely seems to remember that I exist. One of my sisters was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer a few years ago and is in remission with a targeted drug so stage I breast cancer seems relatively minor in comparison. Recently, the mother in law of one of my son's found stage IV ovarian cancer and had pretty massive internal surgery to remove what they could find. I've been able to help with some info because her chemo will be with similar drugs but her surgery has been difficult to recover from to get to chemo. She has been told that it is likely to kill her within 5 years. A less than 10% chance of recurrence seems pretty good in comparison. A man in one group I work with had had treatment for stage IV prostate cancer a few years before and was back looking fine. During my chemo, it recurred and he was restarting chemo. He died within a couple of months. That was one of the hardest times for those around me - he'd had cancer, got better and then it killed him. Some were afraid that the same might happen to me. I tried to gently point out that there is a big difference in the risk for stage IV cancer coming back and stage I and that there was very effective chemo plus a targeted drug for my cancer and they seem okay now.",

It took a few weeks to get range of motion back on my shoulder but wasn't too bad and for the first week it was a bit awkward making the transition from lying down to getting up - partly because I had bursitis in the shoulder on the other side that had treatment put on hold to take care of the breast cancer. I'm an engineer and work at a desk when I don't have a business trip so I didn't need to take any days off for that. I had TCH chemo (taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin). I think I had an about average or perhaps a bit worse than average time with this chemo. 6 cycles of 3 weeks so that's about 4 months.  About 1/3 of that time, I didn't feel like doing much - I would push myself and get some work done but I would need to take a nap. There were a handful of days when chemo made me so tired that I spent most of the day in bed but not many. About 1/3 of the time, I felt almost normal - just needed a hour or so more sleep each night than I would when not on chemo. I went on business trips during some of the good weeks. And the other 1/3 was somewhere in between. 3 weeks after chemo, I had a blood test that showed I was anemic enough to need a transfusion and my magnesium was low so they gave me IV magnesium. That fixed me right up and from the day after that I felt pretty good. Radiation for me was about the same as ddlatt said. Toward the end, I did get a few square inches under my arm that got a 1st degree burn but it was a walk in the park compared to chemo. My life was very normal then except for not being able to travel and having to take 30 minutes travel time plus about 15 minutes for treatment each day.  It has been 9 months since my lumpectomy and I feel totally back to normal.  I had between 45 and 60 days when I felt pretty sub-par - mostly during chemo and a half dozen or so when I didn't feel like doing anything. Since my cancer was HER2+, I would have had around 22% or worse chance of recurrence without chemo (based on the MD Anderson study of women with node-negative tumors less than 1 cm who didn't have chemo).  Chemo should have reduced that to about 5% (my extrapolation from BCIRG 006 results for node-negative women on TCH where the recurrence was about 7%, that included women with larger tumors than I have so I figure my odds should be a bit better). I think it was worth that.",

I've had some trouble with cramping too. Eating foods high in potassium and magnesium seems to help. Mostly I've gotten them in my legs and feet especially at night, but sometimes I get one in my abdomen. One night, I had cramps at the same time in the shin and calf of the same leg - usually it helps to stretch the cramped muscle, but I was kind of stuck with cramping in opposing muscles. And they can be so painful.  I think hormonal changes can also bring them on. The only other time that I've had a lot of problem with cramping is during pregnancy. There is a post in the Help me get through treatment area from some women on the anti-hormone drugs who are having trouble with cramping. Depending on your age, hormonal changes might be a factor - I can't blame mine on that as I was fully in menopause before I started chemo.",

Even someone else can't flex it at the shoulder joint - if they try it is incredibly painful but it doesn't go anywhere. Once it starts to unfreeze by itself, PT can be helpful in speeding the process. The shoulder joint has an exceptional range of movement and a variety of things can go wrong with that movement. I agree with Athena, you need to start by seing your primary care doctor. Your primary care doctor might order X-rays of the shoulder to see if there are any issues with the bone structure of the joint. Depending on the problem, the doc might refer you to physical therapy for help in getting the strength and control back. Anti-inflamatory medications or a cortisone shot in the joint might also be used depending on the problem. Your primary care doctor could also refer you to an orthopedic doctor (a specialist in bone and joint issues). If you have already seen your primary doctor and what he/she has done isn't working for you, ask for a referral. ",

Therefore a lot of oncologists choose it first for node postive or larger tumors. TCH has been in one trial, BCIRG 006 - a trial for HER2+ cancers that included three arms:   AC-T (no Herceptin)   AC-TH   TCH The results for AC-TH and TCH were statistically the same. After 4 years, AC-TH had a disease free survival (DFS, i.e. no recurrences) of 83% and TCH had 82%, but the difference could be just due to statistical variation. For AC-T without Herceptin DFS was 77%.  The issue is that if Adriamycin reduces your ejection fraction, you might not be able to take the Herceptin portion of the treatment. Both Adriamycin and Herceptin can reduce ejection fraction, but the effect of Herceptin is usually temoprary - the heart recovers after Herceptin is stopped. And getting Herceptin is probably more important than Adriamycin for improving your survival. That is probably why the oncologist changed the recommendation. Here is a link to a report of the BCIRG 006 results.Page 29 shows the effect of the three treatments on ejection fraction.",

I think sleeping in a different bed helps a lot - my husband and I do that when one of us gets a cold. The sick one can't be careful to not breath on or cough on the well one when asleep and the well one can't take precautions then. Towards the end of my chemo, my granddaughter who was living with us with her parents got a cold. Her mom, my husband and I all got it. I came down with it at the start of my 5th cycle of TCH. A cold on top of chemo side effects made chemo harder but nothing terrible happened. I think the worst part was that having a cold plus chemo taste issues made it more difficult to drink as much as I was suppose to and I needed to go in to get IV fluids. If she catches the cold, keeping fluid intake up is important. ",

I completed treatment (last Herceptin infusion) about a month ago. I hate it when people post something like \"everyone has a new normal after breast cancer.\" I just feel normal - no change from how I felt before treatment. Yes, I realize that many (or even most) have their view of themselves and life changed more by breast cancer than I did but its my nature and I think its a good way to be. I had a previous experience involving a bad man with a gun threatening to kill - there were a number of others involved and I was the least traumatized so I already knew that I was at one end of the spectrum for reacting to a life threatening situation. Actually that was more life threatening because for a time I really thought he was going to pull the trigger and he was too close to miss and I always understood that the BC was stage I and unlikely to kill me. Mostly I have been without fear or worry through this. I did have a very sad moment when I mapped out my treatment on the calendar and realized it had started before Rosh HaShanah and  I wouldn't be done with rads until after Pesach - all those doctor's appointments and blood tests. But that was just for the disruption of my life - not long term fear for my future. And I was a little worried about the possibility of long term chemo brain when I learned about it but I decided that I needed the chemo and it would be what it would be. Fortunately, chemo brain didn't hit me. Chemo was a rough 4 months but not long term life altering. BTW, I think your odds are better than 85%. In the BCIRG 006 study after 4 years, disease free survival was 93% of node negative women who had TCH chemo and most of the recurrences happened between year 2 and 3 so it doesn't look like the 5 year number will change much from that. The number was slightly but not statistically signicantly better with AC-TH chemo - 94%. We are unlikely to get a recurrence but if we do, we won't have been better off for having worried about it now. I realize that not everyone can turn off that worry but if you can, that's great. I don't think you are wierd - unusual, yes but wierd, no. And I'm glad you posted becauseI thought I was the only wierd person. ;^) It's hard not to feel wierd about it when so many people insist everyone feels differently than we do.",

I was node negative so they weren't purposely radiating my axillary nodes, but part of my node area was in the field anyway because the beam went through there to get all the breast tissue. At the beginning, I didn't realize how much of it was getting radiated so I didn't put lotion on there and that was the only area where I burned. To get all my breast while avoiding my heart and lungs, I can see that the beam pretty much had to go through my axillary area. My techs were good at answering questions without getting defensive. When they were setting me up for the boosts, I asked why part of my nipple was in the boost field when the tumor didn't seem that close to it. They showed me the picture from my scan on their computer of showing the area that was removed in the lumpectomy and the outline around that with x cm of margin that they want to hit with the boost.

The main risk is that there will be a minor blood factor that will produce an allergic reaction - they type for A, B and Rh but there are other more minor differences in blood type.  That risk gets higher when people have a lot of blood transfusions (much more than the 4 units that I got during the course of chemo). That is why bone marrow stimulating drugs may be needed for someone on long term chemo for mets but not for someone on chemo for a shorter term like us. They have a lot of procedure with the blood transfusions to protect against the very small risk of a bad reaction. For my first blood transfusion, two techs had to do two separate blood draws for typing and they put a wrist band on me that I had to wear until I got the transfusion (to make sure that the same person who got typed is the person getting the transfusion. Then when I went in for the transfusion, two nurses checked my band and I had to identify myself. They both had to check the blood units against the paperwork to make sure that they were the right units. A nurse checked on me and took a blood pressure every 15 minutes during the transfusion.  My onc did the transfusion when my hemoglobin fell below 9. Have you asked your onc why she prescribed Procrit when that seems to go against the black box warning? It is against the Procrit drug instructions in two ways -- it isn't suppose to be given for chemo when a cure is expected which should apply with our stage I tumors and, in cases where it is appropriate, it shouldn't be given until hemoglobin is below 10. Seyla, recurrence statistics are usually shown in a graph of recurrence free survival - how many people have had no recurrence vs the time since chemo started. So it will start out at 100% and drop. At first, it stays pretty flat because they have taken out the tumor and it takes a while for recurrences to show up. HER2+ cancers are pretty aggressive so sometime between 1 and 2 years, the recurrences start showing up and the graph starts sloping down. By 3 or 4 years, most of the recurrencens have happened and the graph starts getting flat. BCIRG 006 is the clinical trial that compared AC-T, AC-TH and TCH for treatment of HER2+ tumors. In their second interim analysis, they included a graphs for recurrence in the node-negative participants. That graph follows the description that I gave above. So do the graphs for women with small (<1cm) node-negative HER2+ tumors who didn't get chemo in the MD Anderson retrospective analysis. With HER2+, most of the recurrences happen between 1 and 4 years after treatment. ",

If you got Procrit back when you were diagnosed, that may have been before the study that found it was increasing tumor growth and the FDA worked with the drug companies to change the drug warning. Before that, there was a theory that chemo might work better if you had plenty of red blood cells. So your oncs may have been following the accepted guidelines when they did that.

The routine annual mammogram isn't ordered by anyone. I just go in when it is about time. The health plan actually started sending reminder to get it about 8 months after my previous one. Radiology called me the day after the mammogram to say they needed me to come back in for an ultrasound. A radiology tech did the ultrasound and then asked me to wait for the radiologist to read it and come in and talk with me. The radiologist said I needed a biopsy and that radiology would call to schedule it. He also gave me some information on the type of biopsy.  A radiology tech called to schedule the biopsy. She asked questions about the types of medicine and supplements I take and told me what to not take for the 5 days before (the sheet sent home with me from the ultra-sound also had the list).  We met with the radiologist doing the biopsy (a different one than the one that read the ultrasound) before going in for the biopsy, he showed us the films and what he wanted to sample and suggested a core needle biopsy but from what I had read I thought VAD would be better for me. After a bit of discussion about the pros and cons, he agreed to do the VAD.  The radiologist called with the biopsy results and put the referral to the breast surgeon in the computer while he was on the phone with me. I got a call from the surgeon's office that day to schedule my first visit. I liked this method as it kept the delays down. Maybe now that a breast surgeon is involved, it will work more like AlwaysHope says if a future biopsy is needed.    ",

They do say the survival benefit was due to the reduction in the rate of contralineal cancer (i.e. cancer recurring in the remaining breast). That risk went from 1.1% with the unilateral mastectomy to 0.18% with the bilateral. Even in the group where it made the biggest difference, about 99% of those who had a unilateral mastectomy did not have cancer recurrence in the remaining breast. The death rate due to such recurrence must be less than 1%. Getting the bilateral improved that number to 99.8% - about 80% improvement in risk (1% vs 0.2%) but a very small absolute improvement.  And I wonder whether there are other ways to get that improvement.  For instance, the study did not look at women diagnosed in the last 5 years (for obvious reasons - they need to look at women who have had enough years post treatment to have survival and recurrence statistics). But 5 years ago was the very early days of Herceptin. Now women with HER2+ cancers, even very small ones, often get chemo and Herceptin. 5 years ago I don't think they did unless they were in one of the clinical trials for adjuvant Herceptin. On the other hand, if I had had to have a mastectomy, the decision would have been difficult even absent any survival benefit. One concern would have been back issues due to lopsided weight because I'm large breasted. I was told that it would be advisable to at least get a reduction on the remaining side to minimize the imbalance and to allow getting symmetry with a prosthesis or reconstruction. So one way or another I would have had a surgery on the remaining breast. On the other hand, I enjoy having sensation in my breasts and a bilateral would eliminate that. They can reconstruct something that looks like a breast but it doesn't have the nerve connections. I was able to have a lumpectomy and avoid these issues.",

Carboplatin can be hard on the liver so they may want to get through the liver biopsy before they use it. Taxotere (which works in a similar way to Taxol but isn't excactly the same drug) is the one they usually give with Carboplatin and Herceptin. Also, TCH was tested for adjuvant chemo. Metastatic breast cancer has its own list of therapies in the NCCN guidelines for breast cancer treatment. In first line agents for HER+, they list Herceptin plus Taxol. They also list Herceptin with Taxotere with or without Carboplatin.",

What I've read before is that surgery can have disrupted the circulatory system near where they operated so that area doesn't get as good a dose of the chemo as the rest of your body. They do radiation to target that area. Did you mistype 0.5 cm instead of 0.5 mm above? Half a centimeter would be good margin and since the text says it was very close it sounds more like half a millimeter.",

After the surgery, I felt fairly good. I was at the hospital form about 6 to 10 AM for the surgery then they let me go home. For the first few hours, the anesthetic made me drowsy and I napped. I took one pain pill when I got home and one that evening before bed time. After that I didn't need them for pain in the breast or SNB incision. (I have an unrelated bursitis issue at the moment with the shoulder on the non-SNB side so I did take the pain pills occasionally to help me sleep while I was off Ibuprophen for the surgery.) I was able to cook a simple dinner that night. I agree that the SNB was more of an issue though even it wasn't that bad. Right after surgery, the under arm was numb for a few days. After that, it had prickles and felt tender because the nerves were recovering. The prickly feeling lasted about a week. It helped to have a thin pillow between my arm and body at night to allow some space for the minor swelling under the arm. Also avoiding shirts with shorter sleeves because the hem on the sleeve would bother me. Something with a short sleeve closer to just above the elbow or a long sleeve was better. I was so glad when the nodes came back negative because I didn't want to deal with more surgery under the arm. That was more of a worry than margins because the breast incision didn't hurt much. Fortunately my margins came back clear too.  The transition into and out of bed was hard for the first couple of days (though that might have been okay if I didn't have bursitis in the other arm). And I don't like sleeping on my back. A wedge pillow helped with both these issues. Our granddaugher lives with us so not being able to pick her up for a couple of weeks was hard. It is good that you will have help for a bit. ",
