Regarding hair - I have not used anything to promote hair growth.  My hair is about 1/2 inch long 3 months PFC.  I think this is less growth than what is typical but I am happy now that my head is covered with hair.  The color is salt and pepper with much more salt than I would like.  I'm waiting for a little more length to see if it's going to be curly as I understand most chemo is curly.  I look at my my hair re-growth as an adventure.  I would have never cut my hair this short.  Now I will get to see what it looks like at various lengths.  I plan to wait awhile before coloring it as it is so baby soft/fine, I would be afraid of using chemicals on it.

My emotional brain could not handle a one day delay, especially since it pushes me over the weekend to a Monday.  School starts the following Wed. (8/22).  I so want to be healthy and back to \"normal\" by the time school starts.  The structure and routine will do wonders to focusing on something other than bc.  My logical brain knows that one more day is not that big of deal but the emotional brain had a difficult time accepting it--thus the tears.  I think I am so tired of this cancer journey that I just fell apart.  I haven't felt this emotional for quite some time.  I still have one \"cushion\" day left.  I must keep a positive mental attitude. I'm feeling better now.  Thanks for listening.",

The plan is to make a decision after my boost block check on Thursday.  I just recently learned about this boost block check.  In case you don't know, it means an extended period of time (about a half hour after my regular rads tx for a total of 45 minutes) with your arm held up above your shoulders (OUCH!!!) while they direct beams and draw on your boob just like we had done previous to starting regular rads.  She wants to see where the radiation beams will be directed (ie. through my tender area or through another area).  She has a feeling that the beams will need to go through this \"bad\" area and I may need a break.  More disappointment has entered my life.  I need to accept the fact that I might not be done before school starts. Thanks for the hugs I received after my last rant.  You made me feel better. Aside from the one bad patch of red skin mentioned above, I don't have any other SEs.  I only had very light pinkness until about a week ago after about tx #20.  The red skin patch happened over this past weekend--kind of suddenly.  I have no itching, no pain, just a light-medium pink color on most of my breast.  The red (4x4) area does cause me discomfort although not extreme.  I am still able to wear a bra.  I like the Genie bra.  It has a soft, stretchy band that doesn't bind under the boobs. Isabelle - Congrats on finishing treatment #1.  Soon, the process will be routine.  It does get easier.",

I've always wanted to have darker skin instead of my pale white skin but now I see a possible advantage to my Irish heritage.  I have very little body hair--and no BH (boob hair - that made me laugh).  Since menopause I have no leg hair and very little underarm or arm hair.  I know, TMI (too much information).  I find it amusing that we can talk about such personal things with strangers here on BCO.  BC certainly creates a bond between us!!!! One more thing about my block check today.  My RO said that my red spot will be spared (except for one small corner) during my boosts.  This means that I almost certainly will be done before school starts.  It doesn't take much to make this bc patient happy (or sad).  Got to love those mood swings.",

I am so lucky to have such good friends and family to help me through this difficult journey.  It's nice to be able to share my deepest feelings and it's refreshing to be able to laugh with people I love.",

Regarding my hair and eyebrows - I lost my eyebrows/eyelashes during chemo but it was not all that noticable as they are very light colored.  My hair is about 1/2\" long now.  My last chemo was April 26 so it is growing very slowly but it is growing in evenly on my entire head.  It is salt and pepper in color with much more salt.  The pepper color is much darker than my normal hair color.  I think it is getting wavy but it isn't really long enough to tell for sure.  I'll be glad when I can color it again.  I don't want to damage it by putting chemicals on it too early. TAB55 - The photo of you and your brother made me smile.  You both look so happy.  I'm sure everyone will enjoy your slideshow celebrating your brother's life.  You continue to be in my thoughts.",

The planning session was not too bad.  The worst part was holding my arm above my head for 20+ minutes since my lumpectomy and lymph node dissection was just 3 weeks ago.  My arm mobility is good but still not 100%. I'm a bit nervous about this rads thing but have resigned myself that it is in my best interest to do it.  So far, I have kicked cancer's butt but plan to give cancer one more punch.  I am the victor!!! I look forward to keeping in touch with all of you July rads ladies.  I saw the bell on the wall today at the radiation center and can hardly wait to be the one ringing it.  The end is in sight!!!",

Karen - Have an absolutely great time at your son's wedding.  My son is a groomsman in a wedding this weekend.  We are invited as we are friends with the groom's parents.  I'll have a drink (or two) and do a happy dance for all of my breast cancer sisters from BCO.",
