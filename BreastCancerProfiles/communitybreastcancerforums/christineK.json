Last week I had thryoid surgery and made sure I had no BP or sticks on my left side, they put a red bracelet on me etc.. all went well, no problems and NO cancer. Today I went to my endocronologist, as I am diabetic also. She took a finger stick for blood from my pointer, which I never use, although, I do use the middle finger thru pinkie on that hand (the affected side) often. When she stuck me, I noticed that it really hurt, it just bleed a normal amount, but now, the whole tip of my pointer is red, really swollen and hard. Is this a lymphedema thing and if so any recommendations, so I don't wake up with a swollen hand/arm. I do see my ENT surgeon in the am and will be sure to show him. Suggestions? I never have really been dx w/ LE, just some suggestions that I \"may have a little\" arm. breast and truncal, I think, but I am always so careful. Love when you can, Cry when you have to, be who you must, that's the part of the plan.- Dan Fogelberg Log in to post a reply",

It goes to show, if you are able to make it to the get-togethers- do so. We never know... I know that if Deb had the good health, she would have been at '08. I've got some great pics of her and the gang. I'll post them as soon as I can. My heart is broken for her family. Deb was a gifted writer and I am sure she left some awesome words behind. Godspeed Deb, give a big hug to Cy with love from one of the Circle Girls...",
