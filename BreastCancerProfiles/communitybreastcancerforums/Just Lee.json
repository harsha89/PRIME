I have degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease (arthritis) of the lumbar spine, as well as some debilitating hip problems that no one can seem to DX. I guess I have just learned to live with it, since there is no treatment/ cure for me. I get 10 nerve block injections in my spine a few times a year, but they are not as helpful as in the beginning. I also cannot walk even 1/2 of a block, due to poor leg circulation, so I just don't do much...that pain cannot be controlled by any type of narcotic. I need testing to rule a variety of autoimmune diseases, but my kidneys will fail if I have any dye injected, so I just don't get any! lol Fibro is very tough! My mother suffered for years, but did get some relief using muscle relaxers. I know another lady who gave up on the typical medications and went to a homeopath. She swears she is cured and she was pretty much crippled with it. From what I know, tailored, restrictive diets can help a lot, along with a tailored exercise plan....that is vital. I am so sorry you are dealing with this, but just keep searching for the right specialist to help you! You may have to try a few different paths for treatment, because fibro/ treatments seems to be different for everyone. I would for sure try acupuncture!Â ",
