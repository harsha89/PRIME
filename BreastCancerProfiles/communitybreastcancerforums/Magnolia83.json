I agree with Kayb that setting an alarm to remind you to eat and trying various protein shakes, etc might help. I also agree that you should look into medical marijuana as an option...a friend of my MIL has a husband who has various pain/appetite issues due to being adouble amputee and he takes it in chocolate bar form, so keep in mind that it takes many forms nowadays!",

Look at all the gals here that keep coming back after 5, 10, 15 years of living cancer free after a Stage III diagnosis. There are more out there too...it's just that once people put the cancer behind them they tend to go out and live life and are not actively posting on message boards anymore.",

They are using the brass mesh on me, which I guess is called a bolus? All this radiation stuff is new for me! Chemo was less daunting because my mom had it a few years ago so I got to see it firsthand, but radiation is like a foreign planet! I am using the My Girls calendula cream twice a day, so we'll see how that goes. I am trying not to use Aquaphor because it gives me PTSD from when I had a bad road rash injury years ago...I was admitted at a teaching hospital and this one crazy med student would come in all the time to put Aquaphor on my road rash wound and it would hurt SO bad when he took the bandage off that I just kind of associate Aquaphor with pain now, even though I know it wasn't Aquaphor that was causing the pain, lol. Thanks and congrats to all you gals who are finishing up, your stories and advice are invaluable!",

Right now I put a form in a sports bra so that I'm even, but I'm thinking that when rads starts it may be uncomfortable with a form in there (and with a bra on)...but since I work, I can't really just go lopsided. I am thinking of taking the advice I read about here to get a sports bra a size or two larger, along with some of the famous Wal-Mart camis, and hopefully I can make that work. I'm thinking layers will have to be the name of the game! Either that or I may have to get creative with what I stuff with...maybe a rolled up cooling towel! Haha :) Anyway, sim is tomororow! RO says he wants to give me \"some time to heal from chemo\" but I am 3 weeks out from it already and feeling good so I'll see if I can convince him to start me ASAP!",

I have a late appt for the first 2 weeks because they are really busy, and then I get some more favorable times. I had my X-rays on Friday and got surprisingly emotional about it...after a mastectomy and a 16 rounds of chemo, I've had a few weeks \"off\" (if you don't count my Herceptin/Perjeta, but that's every 3 weeks which seems like nothing after doing DD AC and weekly Taxol!), so going in and getting the x-rays and knowing that rads was about to start really bummed me out (in a \"here we go again\" type of way, not because of anything in particular about rads). Luckily Halloween cheered me up a bit and now I'm ready to dive in. To the Radiation Gods: please don't let me burn to a crisp! ;)",

I had a unilateral mastectomy and am wondering what I should wear during rads. I know lots of ladies like to wear tank tops but I will look super lopsided with just a tank top on! Even if I cover up with something over a tank top, it's pretty noticeable (plus, I live in SoCal and it's still crazy hot here! Combined with my superfun chemopause at 32 I don't know how many layers I can stand). Currently I wear sports bras and just stuff my \"stump\" side with a cotton boob-form thing I got at the craft store (made for lining a dress...yes I have been too lazy to get fitted for a prosthesis!). But, I am thinking that having that boob form on won't feel good during rads, nor will the sports bras? Will I need something looser than a sports bra? Anyway, if anyone has any insight into this it would be greatly appreciated! I work full-time or else I'd totally just go lopsided and free around the house :) Although my office is casual so I don't have to get too fancy...just trying to look \"even\" and not be in pain during rads is my goal!",
