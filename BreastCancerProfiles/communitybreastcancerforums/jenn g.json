    "Content": "jenn-g wrote: I had a Core Needle biopsy yesterday afternoon. And I did receive a lot of information about many of the questions i asked yesterday on this forum, my doctor was very informative and helpful. But, I now have a new question....does any one know if specific colors from a core needle biopsy mean anything like some of the coloration for Fine needle aspiration? My doctor did not want to assume anything regarding the residue removed from my right breast, it is being sent to the lab. But, I remember quite a few years ago, ....\"if you saw a pink or or cloudy film from a Fine Needle Aspiration ...that meant a \"possibility\" of malignancy\" I know that the Core needle is different, but I don't know if there is a possible guideline of coloration for \"benign or malignant\" regarding a Core needle Biopsy? Does anyone know? Jenn-g Log in to post a reply",
