Regarding the infusions, I really haven't had nausea. The darn steroids after the second infusion gave me crazy dreams and well, it seemed like every really bad thing I have ever thought, or happened to me came to mind either in dreams or my thoughts on the second night after my infusion. I really think it was the steroids and told my doctor who immediately lowered the amount. I never want to experience a night like that again. At one point, I just started praying so I wouldn't have such awful thoughts and dreams. The next night, I had no problems and I never want to experience that again. Oh, emotions, God bless my husband, because it is like PMS all over again. My WBC count has dropped. My 4 year old granddaughte, whom I babysit, has a cold which worries me. The steroids have increased my appetite dramatically and I just can't say no to food. It is almost embarrassing. I eat like a horse. Since I am diabetic, that has me worried, too! Is anyone else going through these experiences? ",

I have good veins, but maybe I should request a port or is that up to the nurse or doctor??? It just seem to boggle my mind that so many women are getting breast cancer. Sometimes I think that if had been men that were getting cancer like us, they would have already found a cure. Yes, that's frustration talking. My cancer was the size of a thin crayon box, yet they said I was lucky to have discovered it. No cancer in my family, a lot of diabetes and heart disease, but no cancer. Go figure. I just felt a thickening in my left breast and some unusual sensations. It involved one lymph node, so I guess I'm stage 3. Geez, it is so hard not to be depressed. Oh, just colored my hair. I'm 64 and I'm not going to get any reconstruction. May I ask if anyone here has acrylic nails? My surgeon said that I should stop going to the salon as he pointed out the possibility of infection. You know there are so few things that make me feel like I'm pretty and that was one of them. It breaks my heart to stop. God bless you all for your comments, it has really helped me.",

I told them about getting my blood work done the day before which should have made everything fast and easy, but no. Even when they put me in the room, I still had to wait another 10 minutes or so.

Felt it enter and go up my arm, then the feeling eased. My husband was with me all the time, which was so helpful. He pretty much watched TV and me. LOL I was given no anti nausea meds. It was suggested that because my veins were pretty good, that I not go with a port for now. Sounds like everyone here is getting a port. It kind of makes me feel uncomfortable that they didn't feel it necessary. The young lady that supervised my infusion was very kind and positive. She explained how the infusion would go in the future. She actually made it easier and I am utterly grateful. I have to say that I ate so much that day, it really surprised me. I noticed no side effects. The second day I lay around a bit. Saturday, I took my granddaughter to a park event which required me to walk a lot in the heat, but I still seemed ok. Sunday, all I wanted to do was lay in bed, still, went to church, came home and then lay in bed, a lot of the day. I had pains in my right foot. When I went to bed, the pain in my legs, kept me up most of the night. At this point, I don't know if the walking caused the pain or it was a side effect. It has really helped to read everyone posts. I'm a little afraid of the depression. I feel ok and then suddenly it hits me and the bottom wants to fall out. Has anyone here ever heard of a person who hasn't lost their hair through chemo? I think it may have just have been a story my nurse told me, I am still hoping. Well, I felt frustrated this morning and cut half my long hair off. I guess I'd better be realistic and order a wig.

I had been trying to get sliding insulin for 3 or 4 weeks, but the nurse said that I had to keep a record of the readings for a few days so she could get a picture of how my numbers were. Then a day or so later they started to run in the 300's, fortunately I saw my surgeon that day and casually mentioned that. Well, he was shocked and took my sugar reading right away which was 390. He call my hospital (internal medicine) and insisted I see a doctor right away and set up an appointment. Saw the doctor and she increased my metformin to 1000 in the am and 500 at night. She prescribed the insulin, but said to wait till I saw the nurse three days later so the nurse could instruct me on how to use it. Trying to get the insulin has been kind of a nightmare. I share the blame with my doctors as I was not keeping consistent records. I go see her tomorrow. Thank you for the tip about water. I will start drinking more water. I'm so hooked on Diet Pepsi, it is hard to drink water, so tasteless, but I WILL DO IT! Regarding my neuropathy, my doctor told me today that this would be the last taxol infusion. He said that the symptoms would persist for a month and slowly ease off. I was like, \"Wait a minute, it is going to get worse for a month, \" and he reluctantly said, \"Yes.\" YIKES! He also said that neuropathy caught early, like now, should be reversible. WHEW! So, he said that they would give me an ultra sound of my heart. Three weeks later I would be put on the next and last set of drugs. I would get them once every two weeks for 4 times, after that, I would get radiation and later a pill taken at home. There is an end! Yay! God bless us all!   ",

The stylist said that she would not be able to trim my wig as if a mistake was made, it would be too much to replace the price of the wig. While I was disappointed, I made myself not cry and pushed forward with the hair cut. It was traumatic, but I laughed. I looked like Mr. Clean. She said that the hair cut would not cost anything. I was so happy. It is so hard not to cry when people around you are being so nice. She told me of a wig place close by that did cut wigs. I got in my car and told myself it was ok to cry now and get it over with. I drove around and found Ann's Wigs. I went into the back door and met a man, not a woman, who owed the place. He was over 70 years old and originally from South Korea. He had lived in America for over 40 years. He was so nice and said that the trim of the wig would cost $10. I was a little afraid that it would be much more. I put my wig on and he sat me down and started to trim it. We started talking and discovered we went to the same church and began talking about that. He was so very nice and we both enjoyed our conversation. My wig looked like everything I wanted. I was so incredibly happy. As I stood up, he said that I didn't owe him anything. We went to the same church and he was happy to do it. I left there feeling so very blessed. When I got home, my husband said my wig looked GREAT! I looked so nice.

I made the mistake of eating something acidic right before my last infusion and got sick after they gave me the pepsid and steroid. My temperature rose, they got scared, I still don't know what all happened, I just know I was there for 4 hours. They must of had to wait till my temp went down, then restarted again. My poor daughter got frightened when I didn't call her for pick up at a reasonable time. So, don't eat like I did, learned my lesson. Something else I have learned from this experience: If you are diabetic, as I am, your sugar will rise. When your sugar rises, watch out for UTI's, try to keep your sugar under control. Make sure they give you 8th drug your UTI is most sensitive to first, if you get one. I went two weeks on two different antibiotics then got a yeast infection. That kind of experience will really get your depressed. Watch for the neuropathy, I think most people will get some form of it. You are going to get tired, eventually, as you go through this. I was doing pretty good until recently. Get some sleep, as much as you can. Do lots of things that make you happy and God bless us all! :)",

They tested my lymph nodes and found one that was had cancer cells. The surgeon decided to remove only the left breast as the right appeared cancer free. I have to say, I cried after he said that. I keep trying to feel like the same woman as before this started, but the removal of my left breast made me feel less a woman than before. I've come to accept this, but sometimes it hits me and I get depressed for a while. Well, I got through the Chemo and it went pretty good until the Nulasta failed on the last chemo dose. I live in Cleveland and we had this horrible cold going around, so as soon as my white blood cell count dropped, I naturally got it and coughed for three months. My husband said that that was the only time that he thought I might not make it. He has been an angel through this whole experience. I put off radiation until I thought I was over the cold. Radiation was not bad until the 4th week when the skin started to feel pretty tender. By the time my radiation treatment was over, well, the last two weeks were pretty painful. Then the healing started and it was about another two weeks before I really started to feel like I was going to be ok. It was worth the pain to think that I may just survive this to live several more years. My hair has grown about 4 inches. No more wigs! My husband and daughter said that the short hair was very attractive on me as well as a friend, so I have been considering keeping it short and maybe gray. Oh, don't be surprised that your hair grows back in curly or wavy when it used to be plain straight! It happened to me! I look in the mirror sometimes and ask myself, \"Who are you?\" LOL! After the radiation, they put me on anastrozole. My wrists have ached, I have a chronic stiff neck, I sometimes get leg cramps, but I am happy, alive and feeling well! We went camping with my 5 year old granddaughter this summer and had a great time! The only thing I have faced recently is a rash. I have no idea where it came from, but it itches pretty bad. I want to see my onocologist about it soon and maybe a dermatologist, but it is the only thing that is really bothering me now. I feel so very lucky to be alive. My mother died at 65 of a heart attack and every day I live past my 65th makes my heart sing. I just want to encourage everyone who is going through this, you can make it, you can endure, you can survive! God bless you all! SueR.",
