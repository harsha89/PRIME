Hope you are doing well now!  I had a friend sew pockets inside of a bunch of tee shirts so I could coil the drain line and put it under the shirt in the pockets. Worked really well. When it's winter you can put a loose pull over sweater over the tee shirt and feel human. For my upcoming surgery I will have two in my back so I am having my friend sew three pockets inside of a large mens short sleeve button down shirt and one on the right side in case they can do the procedure in one step....I will be ready this time!",

When I complained of a full feeling in my abdominal area I insisted in an ultra sound then had an mri Huge enlarged uterus with so too many fibroid/tumors to count.  I was out of my mind.  I said if I need to be operated on I need to know what exactly needs to come out.  They suggested a breast mri but I could not get in for 6 months.  I took the brca blood test and waited two weeks.  My genetic counselor told me that at my hospital people who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer the surgeon will not do surgery until results are in.  I did not understand this until my surgeon said that the way the need to operate on you depends if your brca positive.  As I was they had to open me up and take parts out in whole so they they could test every couple of inches and then everything went for slice pathology.  I was so lucky everything came back fine......my uterus had a fibroid of a 22 week pregnancy and being a large woman I never knew it was there!  Once I was diagnosed positive any test I needed was done immediately.  When the breast surgeon knew I was having the abominal surgery she said you wont be on your stomach until November.....I laughed.....she was right!  So a few days prior I had a breast mri with constrast die.  I had very large breasts, but they were not dense and she said the physical exam was fine and mamo films looked great but just to make sure she wanted the mri done prior to my surgery.  Three days after I got home from the hospital I was back in having 3 core biopsy areas that didnt show up in the mamos.  Everything came back negative so I had the double profolactic mascectomy 4 months later.  Many complications and in the middle of reconstructive hell but I feel great that the potential bad tissue is gone and looking back.....knowledge is power and gives you the information needed to make personal choices that make sense to you.,  I hope you are doing well.",
