They decided to do 6 rounds of chemo to shrink the tumor so that they would be able to do surgery...however...after chemo they cant find ANYÂ cancer! So the doctor said that they're not even gonna do any surgery and just start her on hormonal treatment... I am a little confused because I've read a lot of info saying that chemo doesnt completely cure. Is this a miracle or is she at very high risk for reccurance? The doctor hasnt even offered to remove the breast to reduce that risk... What are your thoughts on the doctor's decision..should my mom go for a second opinion? Thanks ladies!
