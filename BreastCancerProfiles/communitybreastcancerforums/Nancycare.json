Take a sample and in 24 hours apply the appropriate chemo and see if the cancer cells are killed  in a testing container.  Let me know if you find it on the internet. ..............   Yes Paula,  Nancy is  hooked on shows like Apprentice, Dancintg With the Stars, Wipeout, Americas Got Talent. Survivors.  She never got into the show 'Lost\" probably cause it was on the same time of ofher favorite shows. The shows helps her  not think about the SEs and puts a smile on her face .  Thank you!  Nancy's hubby Steve",

Fever, occational low white blood cell count , lack of appetite,  tired,  fatigue,  cant get out of bed diahrea , chills, constipation, all intermittent or occational.  Our ONC  said it's the chemo and side effects from other  pills like neurontin or gabapentin percoset for pain  etc...   Chemo  kills the cancer cells along with  white and red blood cells too.  In two instances  Nancy had to have lukine injections to pump the white cells back up.  Also in two instances she had to have  blood transfusions to get the red cells up.  Some people take one shot neulasta to get the white cells up but  most people dread neulasta.  I've read so many bad comments about the drug side effects.  Our ONC said lukine is a lot easier than neulasta but  it's not a one shot thing like neulasta.  It's two to four injections prior to chemo day depending how low the count was.   It's  given  one injection per day. So far as lack of appetite.  They  gave her appetite enhancement  and anti nausea  meds.  There are several kinds.  Chemo also can mess up your tastes buds so when you eat something you really dont feel like eating more.  We go to favorite resturants for her most favorite foods either for dine in or take out.  Do whatever is takes to get nourishment.  It will help maintain white and red cell count which means better protection from other virus like colds , flu, etc.  Red cells take oxygen to all parts of the body which gives you better energy less fatigue. The fevers are almost daily  accompanied with hot sweats mostly during the nights.  Temperature  would range from 100 to 103.  At times she would  take tylenol.   Tylenol is also in her  pain killers meds  percocet  she takes for neurapathy.  Its either one or the other we dont want to take them both which would cause a tylenol overdose.  Doctors have told us fevers are a sign that cancer cells are dying.  But it kills the whites and reds too.  So far after having three complete halaven series   Nancy has had two instances where the reds needed blood tranfusions.  One time for  two pints and this past wednesday starting the fourth halaven series she had to have a one pint transfussion.   Since  you both experience similar problems read our past inputs.  They may give you a clearer picture of what  Nancy has been through.    I hope this info helps.  Nancy and Steve",

Should a person  abruptly stop taking the pain meds they can experience  withdrawals symptoms which brings on a host of other ailments and pain. .. I suspect  neurapathy is a major cause of many of the pains cancer patients suffer  rather than the cancer itself.   Nancy has been dealing with Neuropathy pain and everything else that it causes for several years. It's  a side effect from chemo Abraxane taken in 2006.  It knocked the cancer into remission for one and a half years but reoccurred in 2008. The neuropathy was suppose to have lasted only six months but she still has it.  Neuropathy affects sensory, peripheal, motor,and autotonic nerves within  the body. .Read up on each nerve category and see how each one affects your body.  Other diseases like diabetes can bring on neuropathy too.  I suspect it may be the cause of your pain in your jaws and other places or your loss of voice from time to time.    We're still trying to make heads or tails out of  all of this learning as we go.  I  suggest gathering more information on Neurapathy and the SEs of it's meds Neurontin/gabapentin and discuss it with your ONC.......Higher doses of the  meds may eliminate the need for pain meds.. I hope your scans will show great results!!  Our prayers are with you. Keep the faith!  If we knock out the disease, all the other SEs and ailments should  disappear.    God Bless,   Nancy and Steve.   ",

The fireworks and all the places to see was fabulous!!   We're going to Hawaii  next month during spring break.  We booked the trip several months ago prior to going on halaven.  Nancy is really looking forward to it. Halaven may put a stop to that trip but we'll see what happens. So far Nancy is doing well as Halaven has reduced the size of cancer lesions in two  limp nodes (From Feb and March scans {Paratracheal LN  2.2 cm X 1.5 cm reduced to 16 m and second limpnode Subcarinal LN was 3.6 cm X 2.5 cm reduced to 21 m)  Theres lots more lesions or tiny nodules of cancer in her lungs and bones to erradicate.  She starts her second 21 day cycle tommorrow as it was delayed a week due to high fever and pain several days in hospital. .They told us that fever is also a sign that cancer tumors are dying. She has slight fever everyday around 100 to 101 degrees.  I'm taking it as a good sign. ........ Most importantly keep doing things or finding ways to lift others that may be suffering more than you are in the world.  Major  tragedys  are happening around the world.  Even if  the only energy you have is to type and click a mouse you can reach millions of people and provide help  from your experience and knowledge.  Write a book, compose and sing songs make a CD, write poems, or share any other talent or resources you have that may  lift others.  It does'nt have to be about cancer just anything the world needs help on.  The sick, the starving, the homeless, the lonely.  I believe the blessings we seek can come when we become the instrument to bless the lives of others who are also in need and despair.  The Lord will bless you!  He not only said \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"  he also said as you do unto others, you do unto me\"   This blog set up by Paula  PJB is great example. Paula is not on halaven anymore cause it did not work for her but,  she is still here checking on us to give hope and encouragement.  God bless Paula PJB and all of us!      Nancy and Steve",

She was well enough to continue halaven last wednesday.  Since then she had slight to moderate fever every day even today.  This could be a good thing because as I mentioned before her doctors all said it could be a sign that cancer cells are dying.  Her latest scan in the hospital showed that several lesions were reduced in size. The back spinal pain and femur pain was due to bulging disc in the spine  and pressure on sciatic nerve.  She also felt very tired, fatigued, at times confused, unsteady, quifering  and disoriented from time to time during parts of the days all week long.   She definetly did not have all those bad symptoms   during her first  21 day cycle on halaven.  This could also be caused by some very strong medication given in the hospital. The side effects for some of the medication  are similar to the above symptoms  mentioned.  Some of these side effects  lasts for weeks and even months after a person stops taking it.  We'll see what happens this coming week after todays treatment.  One positive thing is she can still drink and eat to keep up her strength no nausea.   Congratulations to all of you who are having good results with Halaven.  May God bless us all with the cure.  Nancy and Steve",

Thank you for your good mojo.  We'lll welcome  all we can get.  Nancy prescription reads take two 300 mg pills three times a day.  Kinda hard doing that.  She wakes up at different times each morning around 9.a.m.  However we told her ONC taking three late afternoon around 5 pm and three around bed time 11 P.M works better.  This helps cause she won't be so sleepy during the day. Some days are good meaning alert, cognizant, upbeat, with some energy  and some days are weak,tired sleepy, dozing of and on.  Occational constipation, and  mild diarea, and slight head ache.  Night sweats are constant, and slight fever 100 to 103 almost every morning past few weeks except for past few days no fever temperature at all when waking in the morning.. I hope this info helps.  Thank you   Nancy and Steve",

I will get it straight with my oncologist today.  Thank you for your input",

Nancy's progress  after first treatment slight stomach ache  in the evening,  slight nausea but  managed to eat some mild food, feeling tired, but perked up and and looked like her old self having fun  watching Survivors on T.V. Today no stomach ache,  feeling tired laying down.     Nancy's husband.  Steve",

They will do thorasic surgery to drain fluid effution fluids and or pneumonia fluid today.  It was  postponed  from yesterday.    Maybe it is best cause she is stronger now with all the antibiotics and fluids given her over the past few days to fight infection.  She is looking a lot better than the night we took her to ER that's for sure.  They will make small incision at her side and by video camera laprascopic suction device to   draw out all  bad fluids .  They say this is the reason for high fever 105 degree.  Watch out for fever  it is a side effect for cancer and or some of the SE for medication.  If more than 100 degrees contact doctors to check for infection  by blood test.  She has had fever from time to time  but we passed if off as normal side effect  but this time it was 104  degrees.   Always check temperature when fever occurs.  We were told the surgery  is routine and patients feel a lot better however,  there is always danger of complications.  She will be in ICU for a day or two and transfered to a regular hospital room for about 3 days.  I see there has been some disappointing news for some about halaven.  We're so sorry to hear that.  Yesterday, the nurses gave a  lot of good comments about halaven success amoung  the patients being treated.  ................ We are all in Gods  hands!    Keep the faith1  Jesus said many times \"Thy faith hath made thee whole\"  That you may believe it , may the Lord cause a feeling of joy and peace throughout your body and spirit that it is true , even as you read this.    Thank you all , till next  Nancy and Steve ",

After the first series of Halaven we were engcouraged that scans showed several cancer lesions were reduced in size.  Her CA 15 tumor markers were 88 however after the second series of halaven her tumor marker spiked to 123.  Her ONC said it may have went up due to recent surgery to remove pleural effusion and or pneumonia fluid in her chest/lungs  and to see by video exploration how extensive the cancer was in her lungs. CT scans reveiled areas in the lower area of her left lung may be cancerous or just scar tissue.  We did not know that surgery could spike tumor markers.  We also  learned there are  several other factors could affect turmor markers therefore giving a false reading.   She recovered from surgery and just finished her third complete series of Halaven  this past wednesday.  She is now on her off week.  Nancy also had an epidural cortizone injection ten days ago in her lumbar area to relieve  ocasional severe pain in her lower back which radiated to both thighs.  They found a bulge discs in her spine which was affecting her sciatic nerve causing great pain from time to time. At first we suspected her pain was due to cancer in the bones cause MRIs showed she does have scattered cancer nodules in her in spine, stenum, both iliac hips and in one rib and both femur thigh bones.  However since the epidural cortizone injections she has been almost pain free in her back and thigh area. We anxiously await our next scan to see if the Halaven is working as it did prior to surgery.  We don't want any of her bones to break.  Her ONC said it takes longer sometimes many years when it is in the bones .  She had it in her sternum five years ago with still no pain and from there it spread to other parts of her body.  This past several weeks on halaven she deals with night sweats, slight temperature rise 100 to 103 upon waking in the mornings. It goes away with tylenol .  She experience  tiredness and fatigue from time to time, slight head aches, occational, nausea and  diahrea.  Some of these syptoms could also be caused from side effects taking neurontin for neuropathy and percocet for pain killers.  She lost ten pounds in one week and  is now 127.  The chemo and meds for side effects can cause  lost of taste in her taste buds causing her not liking what she eats.  Doctor gave her appetie enhancment pills and past several days she been eating pretty good.  It could have been my bad cooking so we go to her favorite resturants for dine in or take outs.  Past few days she felt well enought to go shopping for clothes as she lost weight.  Normally she was always in the  the 150 range.   We're headed for Hawaii this coming Monday the 18th for seven days. We booked it in Decemer last year before she was told she had to have chemo.   Her ONC gave his approval and said  have fun  try to stay in the shade or wear sunscreen. She needs more excercise and the  trip will  will be good for her spirits.  The entire family is going all the children their  husbands and wives and five grand children. It started with just me and Nancy and one of my daughters her husband and two kids but now all the rest have joined in on the vacation. We did this once before about 10 years ago during thanksgiving holiday week.   We could not get on the same flight or the same day but will be at the same hotel most of the 7 days. ........... Please no more earthquakes,  tsunamis or rain while we're there. .  Thank you all for sharing and your support .  May God Bless us all with the cure!!   Nancy and Steve",
