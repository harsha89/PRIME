Hope that helps.  I'll be thinking of you.",

Am I allowed to excersise during healing?  Usually your doctor will tell you what you can do.  I would ask specifically about the exercise you and to do.  I asked about walking on a treadmill about 2 weeks out and that was ok with my doctor but nothing more. How long will I stay in the hospital?  Depends on your doctor.  I was in for about 23 hours then went home.  The nurses there explained to my husband about the drains and how to keep track of the level of fluid was draining. Will I need care when I get home or can I take care of my self?  For the most part I could take care of myself except for my drains.  My husband took care of that for me. Will I be able to take a shower?  Probably after the bandages come off.  You will probably still have your drain.  I used a belt from a robe and tied the drain to it and hung it around my neck while I showered to keep it out of the way. When do I shop for a prosthesis? or camisole? now or later? These questions I don't know maybe some of the other ladies can answer for you. Will I have scars under my arm?  If you have a sentinal node biopsy (which you should) your scar will be under your arm - at least mine are. As far as the scrubs, what you have will probably work.  I chose to use scrubs because they were easier to find. Hope that helps.  If you have any other questions, I will try answer for you. Have a Merry Christmas.  Your surgery will be here before you know it.",

You have a lot going on but you also have a lot to live for.  Your little boys need their mother.  Not just now but when they are grown.  I know because I still need my mom but unfortunately she passed a few years ago. All children need their moms no matter what their age. Please let those who have gone down your same journey help you.  I don't know what you are going through as my diagnosis is very different but I do know you need to remain positive and keep picturing yourself how you will be when all your treatmeant is complete.  Make plans for what you want to do when this part of your life is over and concentrate on that and your boys. One thing I have found out through my journey is my health, my family then my job.  That is my order of precendence in my life because if I don't take care of me, then I can't be there for others when they need me.

We worry about our parents/syblings as we can tell when something is not right.  When I was diagnosed with BC I immediately called my sister and told her.  I have kept her informed of everything - dx, tx, genetic testing, etc.  I do this so she can inform her doctors of family medical history.  She has been a wonderful support even though she lives far away. I have been on both sides of the equation and I am grateful to those who know about my BC.  They know when I need them and when I need space as I am able to articulate my needs. I am now being a support system to my boss who was diagnosed with IBC.  She tells me her fears and asks lots of questions.  I am happy that I can be there for her.  None of us wanted this but if I can be of help/support to a fellow sister, I will be.  Nancy - WOO HOO on your last rads treatment.  Have a nice glass of wine to celebrate Sue - did u ever receive the pin I sent you? AE & UB - the next time I am in the NYC area I will have to send you and Nancy a PM and maybe we can meet up.
