She had the breast completely removed then chemo and herceptin back in 2010. The past few months she has had bone pain in her hip. Its a deep pain, local and its the bone that sticks out at the top of the femur( I hope I am explaining this right) maybe called the trochanter region? Anyways she says it hurts for a couple of days then about a month later it returns for about the same amount of time then goes away again. Off and on like this for months. What worries me is she says its feels like its in the bone and that hurts her mainly at night especially sleeping on it. I honestly dont like the way this sounds and I can not find any other reason than mets to cause her pain. She has blood work every 3 months it all has been good but I have seen that its probably more like 50/50 on catching recurrence so I don't have very much confidence that it would have caught mets.",

She called last month when it hurt and they told her to go to her GP but by the next day it had quit and she never called. I'm really worried and I know she isn't wanting me to talk to me about it much since I'm pregnant and she is worried I will get too upset.",

I agree and will try to stay as calm as possible so I don't stress her out. Although it is so tempting every time she has a bone ache or head ache to take her running and screaming in panic to the doctors office in fear of it coming back.Â ",
