After the lowered dose I started noticing some mild itching in the evening after the treatment, no rash just itching, reported it to np and she put me back on 4mg nite before and 10mg with infusion. I have been gaining weight like crazy since. My stomach looks like I am four months pregnant, and I have 5 more weeks to go. My question is is there a way to avoid the weight gain...drink more water, limit salt, anything? If not, who has gained while on the steroids and how long does it take to go away? HELP!!!!
