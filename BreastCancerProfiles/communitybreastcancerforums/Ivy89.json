For the last two years I have been having pain and I've noticed increasing puffiness in the same area. The pain is usually a constant ache that's been happening more often or a fast shooting sort of pain that extends down to the side of my breast. If I pinch the area that's always puffy it feels like a had oval lump. I can also feel lymph nodes where as in other axilla, nothing at all. I had a non contrast ct done yesterday and saw my doctor this morning for my results and it has come back clear. Two months ago I had a ultrasound done for my breasts and axillas and they found 1 simple cyst in my breast breast and two simple cysts in my left. It recommended I get a ultrasound guided FNA for the one they called a 5mm hypoechoic lesion. I saw a surgeon and he said they were all just cysts and not to worry about any of them. I'm 25 years old by the way and from Australia. I don't know what else to do and nobody understands how this is making me feel. Has anybody had anything similar or am I worrying myself sick over nothing! xo Log in to post a reply",
