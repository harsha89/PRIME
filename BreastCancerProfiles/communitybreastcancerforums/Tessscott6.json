I've had 2 treatments then last Friday my white blood cell count was too low so I'll try again this week. So far my hair ( which is shoulder length) is shedding a lot. I'm obsessed with whether or not to just clip it off. Like you, I hear that occasionally someone out there doesn't lose it. However my Oncologist and every nurse has said I would. I'm annoyed with hair everywhere and prepared with a funky wig. I think this may be the day. Maybe I'll take control and decide it's gone. ??    ",
