She has gone through chemo on and off ever since. As of 3 weeks ago, she started experiencing pain around her gallbladder. An exam revealed she has excess spinal fluid around her brain. Next, a spinal tap showed breast cancer cells in her cerebrospinal fluid. So as of around 3 weeks ago, she has had full-brain radiation treatment twice a day on weekdays. Unfortunately, around the time she started radiation, she started experiencing excruciating pain from her head, down to her neck and spine. She has been on many pain meds ever since: From the meds to the radiation to the pain, she has been very weak for the past few days and bedridden for nearly 24 hours a day. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY THIS SPINAL PAIN IS OCCURRING? Is it a tumor or excess spinal fluid in her brain that is causing pressure on her head or spine? Feedback needed ASAP! Thank you for your time and I hope all is well with you who are reading this.",
