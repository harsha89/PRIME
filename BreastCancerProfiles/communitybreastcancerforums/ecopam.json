Everyone keeps congratulating me and saying it's all good from here, but we all know it's not that easy. I've looked for help here with my two most annoying SE's.(i  need to learn the shorthand so help me please!). #1 My fingernails are sooo sensitive and starting to lift, and i have an appt with the onc tomorrow  to get treatment for fungus which started to cause quite an ugly odor in my nails!  I've cut them back and expect they'll get uglier before they start to grow back nice, but any advice is appreciated.  #2 - my muscle fatigue and shortness of breath has grown worse with each round, and I couldn't even take my around-the-block walk yesterday. Can I expect this to diminish now that TCH is done and only Herceptin through the final 8 months?   I look forward to healing with you all!  Many hugs, Pam",
