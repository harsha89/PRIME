I will get a second opinion on the biopsy results, I will get informed and will make sure this does not caught me so out of it as it did now. I just went for a mammo because I work for the company that makes these machines. I was just using an employee benefit to use our latest design and they found this. I never expected something like this, what a shock! So now I think it was a wake up call! It was on the week of my birthday too, last week. Thus, I am glad things are ok now but my perspective on life and what everyone else here is going through has changed. Thanks and good luck to everyone. Hopefully I keep here giving you just good news and encouraging others to always get the screaning done! Thanks!",

The magnified view of the microcalcifications showed suspicious calcifications that needed a core biposy. I had the biopsy on Monday and got the results today. They are benign. Normal changes and will go for mammogram in 6 months. This has been the most stressful time of my life. I have been waiting for 3 weeks since the initial mammogram, then diagnostic mammo, then biopsy, then results. The Dr. called my home and left a message yesterday asking to call back. I didn't get the message until late at night. I called this am and it took me 3 hrs to finally have her call me back. I was thinking the worst, I went online and looked for breast cancer, massectomy, reconstruction, dying, etc. I got crazy! She called and said it was benign. I was happy but exhausted. I had during those weeks decided to eat better, I am not smoking anymore, I need a life style change anyway. I am exhausted and relieved. Please please do not worry until you have the result, one step at a time, you handle it as it comes. There is nothing you can do in the meantime. Inform yourself as you know what is happening to you but do not read about what if and what might and what would I do. Good luck to you. 80% of biopsies are negative. If your happens to be in the 20%, microcalcifications are the earliest type of a pre cancerous condition and it is highly curable. Please do not worry as I did, wait for the results, inform yourself but know that you need to take one step at a time. This worry was literally killing me and that is what we are trying to prevent here. Ask questions, get the appointments as fast as you can, continue with your screaning mammograms, think this is a time to renew your dreams, your life, give your Dr. a number where they can reach you immediately, call if you don't hear from them, get support from friends and family. If negative don't forget about it, keep your new life style, if positive take it as it comes. Nothing that you cannot handle will be place for you to handle. Good luck! Log in to post a reply",

At least if something happens to me in the future, I'll know I did not contribute to it by smoking and eating unhealthy. I am 41, I like to exercise and I am aware that I do need to keep watching any changes in my health. Thanks for your support. !!",
