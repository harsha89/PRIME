      "Content": "Oct 19, 2018 09:32AM - edited Oct 19, 2018 09:34AM by Mama2BC Hey friends! In 05/2016, I was diagnosed with stage II, grade B (I know my profile says A), triple positive breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy, followed by chemo, bilateral mastectomy (in 01/2017), radiation and completed Herceptin in 08/2017. I did have cancer in 2 of my lymph nodes, which were removed but have not had any issues with lymphadema. In 01/2018 I had my expanders switched out for implants and in 05/2018 I had fat grafting surgery. About 2 weeks ago, I noticed slight pain on my rib. It feels like maybe I pulled something. Or maybe bruised it. It is located on the side on my original right breast, breast cancer. It is to the right of my right breast. The pain area begins begins just below my breast, but slightly to the right of the breast. It's my 2 inches of \"pain.\" I don't even know if pain is the right word. It's not a constant feeling. It's when I reach certain ways, or sleep on my side or when I press on it. Which, of course, I do often now because I am paranoid. I contacted my oncologist and he recommended I put a heating pad on the spot for a week. I am on day 5. Still having the sensation. Side, note, the heating pad caused me to get a little burn on breast. Oops. Skin sensitivity after radiation. This is all I can think about this week. I am not having any other symptoms or pain anywhere else. I would say I over the summer I started a new heart burn medication and noticed some dizziness and irritability and maybe feeling anxious. I stopped that about a month or so ago and the dizziness is much better. Still anxious. I've never really been an anxious person. Maybe that just comes with going through something like this. I'm sure being anxious and irritable has nothing to do with this \"pain,\" I'm describing. Anyway, just trying to give all of you the full picture. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks!!",

I had a bilateral mastectomy with TE on 1/18. Pathology results showed one of the lymph nodes removed had cancer. Long story short, I have received 2 opinions and both doctors are recommending radiation. That's fine. However, I am struggling because one doctor thinks I should do the whole chest wall, while the other believes I should localize the radiation under my arm. I just don't know what to do! The physician that recommended the whole chest wall, has indicated this is a proactive approach to reduce recurrence. Which I like. But I am also aware that there are some risks involved with doing more radiation. I guess I am primarily concerned about reconstruction issues. My plastic surgeon has already started filling my TE's in preparation for radiation. I am leaning towards the whole chest wall, even though there are more risks. That being said, when I met with both doctors, I still like the personality of the one that recommended the more localized treatment. Anyone else in a similar boat? How did you decide what to do? Has anyone ever spoken to a doctor about their 2nd opinions and wanting to still treat with their doctor, but do something based on another doctors recommendation?",

On 5/27, my baby was born. He's perfect! 7 months now! I have completed chemo. I am still getting Herceptin. I am gearing up for BMX with reconstruction scheduled for 1/18. It has been incredibly helpful to read everyone's stories and experiences. Like all of you, right now, the anticipation is the worst. I know the pain and the drains won't be fun. But the anticipation is killing me. The holidays were a nice distraction from this whole ordeal. Reality kicked in pretty much the day after New Years. I know I have to look at the big picture here. But I am quite sad about losing my stupid boobs. I already have these moments when I just don't feel pretty between having had a baby fairly recently and the physical changes that come with chemotherapy side effects. I have tremendous family and friends. They lift me up. Unfortunately, when I talk to them about my sadness around the physical changes, I often feel like I walk away with the feeling that my feelings were minimize. I feel ungrateful for even saying that because of course, they are nothing but kind to me. I think I just want to scream to them, \"You don't get it!\" I would never expect anyone to \"get it\" if they hadn't gone through it. And I definitely don't ever want ANYONE to go through it. Maybe I just wish I had a better way of explaining my feelings to everyone. Who knows. Fortunately, these feelings of sadness are not frequent. Just creeping up again because surgery is looming. I know you all know what I mean. I know there are a ton of boards more specific to some of my questions, but it's difficult to find time to go through all of them. Would anyone mind answering a couple of things for me? After my maternity leave, I went back to work and worked through my treatment. I have a desk job. I actually work from home. For those of you who have desk jobs, how long do you anticipate being out of work? Do I need to bring like a surgical bra or cami to my surgery? I don't even own one. Should I buy one. I thought they just wrapped you up with an ace bandage. I did buy 2 sports bras that clasp in the front. Are any of you having (or did you have) your caregiver spend the night with you at the hospital? Thanks for listening everyone!! mama2BC",

I am now 37. I was diagnosed with BC when I was pregnant and 34 when I was diagnosed with BC. Went through chemo, surgeries and radiation. I had my last reconstructive surgery a year ago. And right now, I am cancer free. So like I said, I am fortunate. I'm not sure if anyone else has felt this way, but even when I was diagnosed and in the trenches of treatment, I felt like there was a bigger purpose for this having happened specifically to me. Not getting into the science of all of it. Now that I am beyond the bulk of my treatment, I have been trying to navigate and sort through these feelings. It's not so much a depressed feeling. But I definitely feel a heaviness on my heart and a calling for something....not sure what...YET! That being said, I have spent time in the last year, reading the self-development books, watching video's, on the search for self-discovery, etc. Some of it has been great for mindset. But not a lot of action on my part. Admittedly, that's on me. I definitely need someone to keep me accountable. I am in a spot where I would like to would with a life coach, or spiritual coach. When you go through something like this, I almost feel like it should be integrated in our treatment. Anyway, here's my question...has anyone ever heard of financial resources that contributes to the cost of something like this? It is an investment. I know the investment can vary of course. It's not that I don't want to pay for some of it. It's my choice. I must be reasonable with that. But it is difficult to prioritize the cost of this, when there are so many other things in life that this could be used for. I'm not sure my husband gets it, so it's difficult to explain, and get him on board, with spending money on something like this. I could maybe save up for it, but it's tough to put in the waiting. When I have already had this heaviness/ calling for almost 3 years. I almost feel guilty bugging people with a question like this. But I suppose this is what happens for some people during survivorship. And I guess I just never know if someone knows of a grant or sort of scholarship. Thanks friends!",
