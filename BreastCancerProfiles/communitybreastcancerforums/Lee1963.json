I expected to be much more uncomfortable then I am. Had difficulty sleeping last night but caught a few good naps today. Summergal, so happy for your results!! Hope mine are the same. Katlebbie, hope you are well and recovering nicely. All the best, and healing energy to those still waiting for surgery. :)",

I discovered a lump at the beginning of August, had a biopsy on the 28th, received results on September 4th. I had my BS appointment yesterday (16th). I am having a lumpectomy with SN dissection on the 20th. Very nervous, haven't heard about the 'wires' until I read about them here. Is this standard? I know about the dye injection...sounded like the worst part of the whole ordeal to me...that is until I read about the wires. Can anyone explain this to me? I probably won't hear from surgeon before Friday, so this would be very helpful. Thanks :)",

I just hate the way the Percocet make me feel. They make me angry? Weird, I know. StacieRae, wow, what a surgery experience. Never heard of this type of epidural, sounds incredible. I hope you heal well and fast. Schoolcounsler and Moonflwr, be well and heal quickly. And Moonflwr, enough with the detours! Get on that express train :)",
