Right before surgery, I re-emphasized to my surgeon that I was not going to decide later to do reconstruction. I am 42 and youthful (in my mind at least) and athletic. She did a great job, I am indeed flat like a 10 year old boy. But I can attest, it IS tight. But the stretching exercises REALLY help. It gets a little better every day. Just sitting up really straight and arching your back provides a nice gentle stretch. I am hoping after a while it will be unnoticeable. Good luck!",
