She was simply told she had bc and put on pills for a few months and told to go back and get checked again. My sister about 1yr ago found something and it was biopsied almost immediately and was diagnosed as dcis, tye tried to remove it a couple of times and couldn't and within a couple months had a masectomy. I'm just suprised and have never heard of this other form of treatment as a first step.",
