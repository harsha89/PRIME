After my first lumpectomy the pathology report came back stating that my margins weren't clear and I required a second surgery and a few days after that surgery I had the SAVI inserted and completed the 5 days of radiation treatment. My main concern with radiation was the side effects which were eliminated with the SAVI. I had minimal discomfort through the whole process and just a little bit of skin irritation, and was able to perform most of my daily activities during the treatment. The incision were the SAVI was inserted healed well and I am now back living my life, scuba diving and working out with no problems. I am so happy that this type of treatment is offered now for women and if you meet the criteria I would recommend it. I hope all goes well for you.",
