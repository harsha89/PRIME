To this alternate universe where feeling sick is the norm and feeling good is a blessing? Where my own body has revolted and is actually trying to kill me?! This is something that happens to other people. Not ME! Not MY family. And yet here I am. Hair buzzed off, trying not to feel self-conscious in the wig I'm wearing to work to minimize the reaction from everyone. Trying not to make my frequent bathroom trips noticeable. I'm honestly not sure which I hate more: the constipation from the Zofran or the diarrhea and vomiting from the chemo. I had my second infusion Thursday. I'm working, as much as possible anyway, and I completely understand why my doctor advised me not to. I had to leave early Friday and was completely useless over the weekend. Of course, without work I don't have insurance - and I'd get the luxury of living in a cardboard box. Neither option sounds appealing right now. Especially since insurance was billed $156,987 for the first infusion. So basically, without work, I die both mentally and physically because paying for this without insurance is impossible and working keeps my mind off of this nightmare. I realize I could get disability and not work through this, but that isn't an option since I am the only person at work. If I weren't here, they would have to replace me and I would have no guarantee of coming back to my job after it's over. My employer has been very understanding so far, but I know they are frustrated with the amount of time I am missing. I try to tell myself I am nearly halfway through this - okay, 1/3 through. But then I remember that surgery follows in January. More fun! I literally have a year of this left before I am back to a new normal. I've been pretty good at keeping a positive attitude so far, but dang!!! This sucks on so many levels! I am grateful my kids are grown and I don't have to worry about them but then I know this is so very hard on them also. Especially since they can't be here. So there is my rant for today. Hopefully I will feel better tomorrow and the next day. Maybe even a little more upbeat. I meet the plastic surgeon Monday - not sure how I feel about that since I never expected to be losing both tatas at 43. Sorry if I'm a downer, but man.... how do we keep this from getting to us every now and again? ",

Day 4 and 5 were rough. I had to leave work on day 4 after throwing up - despite the anti-nausea meds. Spent the day trying to sleep and popping Tums like candy. Only threw up twice but felt like poop for about 2 to 3 days. Fortunately I only had to miss that one day of work and was able to muddle through the rest of the week. My other side effects haven't been horrible and I'm probably lucky that way. I guess the worst is that I've developed a few canker sores in my mouth which makes eating a bit painful so I go rinse my mouth with biotene about every 30 minutes. I haven't noticed food tasting any different, but I would sure love to eat some without pain. The past week, despite all of this, has been incredible. My son swore into the Army Thursday (he is in college now and will Commission as an Officer when he graduates), my niece got married Friday and I was able to see most of my family and had a wonderful time. Sunday was my grandson's first birthday party and then, afterward, the very best surprise imaginable! My daughter who is in the Army and Stationed 3 states away - who I wasn't expecting to see until Christmas - surprised me by showing up at the house. Talk about water works!! I can't tell you how happy that made me. I didn't know how much I needed that - and so did she. It's been tough on her being so far away through all of this so far. She's just barely 19 and still my baby. So I got to have both of my babies home and we are going to the coast for a night before she has to go back to Colorado Saturday. Despite everything, I know I am truly blessed. Just gotta get through this little spot I've gotten into. A year seems like such a long time to deal with this, but I know it will pass and I will be healthy again and stronger than ever. But right now, screaming obscenities at random intervals seems acceptable.",

I theoretically have 4 more treatments (total of 6) but my dr. says not everyone can handle all six so he will give me as many as my body is willing to cooperate with. About the hair - a tip a friend gave me.... use a lint roller. It pulls the loose hair out and makes your scalp far less painful. Sounds bizarre, but it works. I found that rather than rolling it over my head that it works best if I tear off a sheet and rub it over my head instead. I've given up on the prospect of keeping much hair and anything I can do to keep any small amount of pain at bay works. Feeling a little better today. SOOOO tired. I pretty much sleep as soon as I get home from work. I understand it gets progressively worse with each treatment Yay!! I'm so looking forward to being a complete zombie by the end of this! Where is that light at the end of the tunnel? Because if it's there, I still can't see it. Believe it or not, I'm the \"little ray of sunshine\" at work usually. They are not much accustomed to seeing me down at all. I even cried yesterday when someone told me I looked good. Ugghhh! I can't wait to get through this!!",

Felt surprisingly well over the weekend - even went to a birthday party and shopping with my 1 year old grandson. Back to work today and just hoping it doesn't hit me like a freight train. I've already warned my co-workers that if they come in and I'm lying on the floor that they should just walk away and pretend that is just normal office behavior. Trying my best to stay upbeat and ignore the mild sick feeling that keeps rearing it's ugly head. I figure that keeping myself occupied should help keep me from noticing. It's going to be a rough few months. Ugghh!",

      "Content": "ThatFox wrote: I am 43 single mom with two grown children - a 20 year old son in college and an 18 year old daughter in the military. I noticed something odd about my right breast nearly 2 weeks ago where my nipple was slightly pulled to one side and my breast is a bit more dense in one area - not hard and not a lump, just harder. I called my family doctor and asked their office to order a mammogram (since I knew I was overdue because well, why? - I'm young and literally no obvious risk factors so I kept putting it off). I figured it was something easily explainable and a mammogram would settle the issue. I went for the mammo Friday the 15th. Results came back Monday as BIRAD 0 - inconclusive with 3 cm mass and requesting additional focal compression magnification and ultrasound. Went Friday, August 22 for additional imaging - results came back as: FINDINGS: At the 2 o'clock position 5 cm from the nipple is an irregular hypoechoic somewhat wider than tall 1.8 cm mass with partial obstruction of sound. IMPRESSION: Massive the right breast highly suspicious for cancer. BIRADS 5 HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF MALIGNANCY I go for an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy tomorrow. I expect the worst, although everyone tells me that I shouldn't. I still haven't seen an actual doctor. My doctor is aware - he is chief of staff at the hospital and was called to confirm scheduling the biopsy. I will see him Monday - hopefully once the results are back. In the meantime, I am researching and trying to get as much information as possible. I live in a very small town and, if the biopsy comes back positive, I will likely go to a cancer center about 2 hours away near where my son lives. A few questions (to help me figure out my work situation): I am the only person who works in an office for a small Indian Tribe. It is a great job and I love it - pretty low-key and I have a great relationship with the Tribe. I literally only really have pressing deadlines every two weeks (payroll and bills). However I am concerned of possibly losing my job over this because of the amount of time I may miss. Again, I am the only one in the office and without me here, nothing gets done. Also, Indian Tribes don't really have to follow rules the rest of society does as far as retaining employees in a situation like this (although I do hope they support me). So, when should I inform my employer - when has everyone else informed theirs? Once I get the diagnosis? After I meet with a surgeon? Also, how much time should I expect to miss for doctors appointments and such and how quickly after diagnosis do they generally schedule surgery and other treatment? I do realize it is a very individual thing and all treatment plans are different, but I'm just trying to understand what to expect and I'm hoping some of you can share your experiences so I have a better idea of what to expect. I'm pretty much terrified. Not only of the cancer, but, as much as I appreciate cardboard boxes, I'd prefer not to have to live in one. I'm trying to piece together some sort of \"plan\" to submit to my employer to reassure them that it will all work out and I won't be gone forever. Sorry for the long post. I'm rambling.

I'm hoping that even if my surgeon is out of town that I can get any chemo, radiation or other treatments at our local hospital, although I honestly don't know if that is even possible or an option. Right now I am in a hurry up and wait pattern which is awful because it is so hard not to think about it. I was planning on letting my employer know as soon as we have a treatment plan in place, but I'm also trying to learn as much as I can about possible treatment scenarios so that when I do tell them I can lay out how and when I will miss work, what critical items need to be done, and how I can ensure they are still completed during the process. Fortunately my kids are grown and, although they are worried, they are more than capable of taking care of themselves. My daughter is looking into getting emergency leave from the Army to come home to help me if I need it. The dogs, on the other hand... my boyfriend may never forgive me for that... (a great dane, a German Shepherd and two ankle biters). I will get through this. I have to. I have future grand-babies to spoil (not soon... but it is an absolute requirement). Ugghhh! I feel like it's going to be a very LOOOONNGGG week.",
