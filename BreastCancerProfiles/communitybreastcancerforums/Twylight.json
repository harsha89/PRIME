Congratulations as you've made a giant step!  I can't tell you anything about Taxol as I was on TCH (taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin)regimen, and it was completely doable.  A few of my breast friends were taking Taxol, and other than the usual minor side effects, all seemed fine as I never heard them say otherwise.",

Is it unusual to not have the ultrasound?  If so, I will definitely ask for one before ANYTHING ELSE is done to me.  Please let me know your thoughts... Tabatha:  How did the surgery go? ",
