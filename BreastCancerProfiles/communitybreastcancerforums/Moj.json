I just wanted to be done with everything after ACx4, taxol x 12 and three surgeries. My husband, friends and MD kept on telling me I was almost done, but that was no solace for me, I was mentally done. Anyway, I did get through it. I suggest you talk it over with your MD. I also had a friend with me at every treatment, which helped. Hang in there! MojÂ ",
