Have a great weekend, we are having wonderful fall weather here in Wisconsin and I am loving the cooler weather. Michelle ",

I'm still undergoing my reconstruction.  They halted my \"fills\" on September 3 due to my WBC's being so low because they didn't want to tax my body any more that it already was from the chemo.  Since I only needed TC x 4 every three weeks my oncologist did not give me Neulasta and I did not have a port put in.  I only had to miss one scheduled chemo due to my bloodwork and that just delayed me for a week.  I will finish my \"fills\" starting October 23rd, I had two before and they figure 3 - 5 more before I will be ready for the switch-a-roo to implants.  I want to thank each and every one of you for the wealth of information and insight that I just could not have never gained had I not stumbled on to this board.  I applaud all of your spirit and resiliency.  This is not an easy journey and together it seemed truly bearable.  Thank you again and God Bless You All.  We are indeed all Warrors!!!!

Just a little background, I had surgery on June 16.  A bilateral mastectomy with a sentinel node biopsy and immediate reconstruction with tissue expander and aloderm (I think that's how you spell it). I had the cancer in the left breast but had the right taken so I wouldn't go through this again.  I have family history.  Good thing I did because the right breast had 4mm tubular carcinoma, Grade 1.  My surgeon said it was a miracle patholgy even found it, but they want me to do chemo because of the 1 auxillary node on the left side.  My Sentinel Node was clear.  My case did not follow the norm, but who's does!   Michelle",

I also have a sister that is a beautician so she can do it when I need her to and she doesn't charge me.  I know alot of you just shave it off and I think it's great you can do that but for me it just was to drastic.  It's amazing how individual this journey is for everyone.  To everyone else that has either started chemo or are starting, my well wishes and prayers go out to you all.
