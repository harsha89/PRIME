I found a lump last December, and mamo & u/s showed possible malignancy, so I had to wait all though Christmas to meet a surgeon in early January. What fun that was! I arrived at the outpatient clinic and was put in a gown. Then I was moved to another room and told to lie on the bed. Then this man walked in and his opening line was \"Well I've seen your scans and I'm 98% certain you have cancer, but I have to do this biopsy just to prove it.\" No good morning, no introductions, no warning. He then proceeded to fiddle about with the ultrasound machine and threw a tantrum at the nurses because he couldn't get it to work. He stormed out of the room a couple of times, then had another play with the machine and gave up on it. (I'm not sure he really needed it as my lump was big, hard and visible on the outside). I got one shot of local anesthetic and then he started. I found out afterwards he had made a small incision and stuck the core biopsy needle in through that, but I never felt it. My husband was right with me holding my hand - a bit nervously, as he had made the mistake of holding my hand during childbirth (I nearly broke his hand!) With the first shot, I heard the gun go off, immediately followed by unbelievable pain which went on for about 30 seconds. He had missed altogether as the lump was very hard, and the needle had bent and skimmed off the surface of the lump. He then had 2 more attempts with the same result. The fourth shot at least got a reasonable sample. He then stormed off again and came back with a new gun.He asked if I wanted him to stop and try again next week. He asked me if I was crying because of the pain, or something else - as if it didn't occur to him that he had just told me I have cancer! My boob was on fire and bleeding, I was still screaming inside from the offhand diagnosis of cancer, but I said let's get this over with so then I'll know for sure. Thankfully he put in more local, and with the new gun and new needles, 4 more shots, not as bad this time, and finally got enough tissue for the lab. Then he just left, without a word. He had a registrar with him, who looked almost as traumatised as me, and kept apologising after he had left. The bleeding finally stopped, and I was given a couple of paracetamol for the pain, and sent on my way. My boob was black from the bruising, and still looked bad at the mastectomy a couple of weeks later. Sadly, the test was positive as predicted, with the results you see below. This was the same man who did my mastectomy and lymph node removal - I still have issues with the scar and nerve damage. Not surprisingly, I now have it on my record that I never want to see that man again!",

Apparently it's called a dog ear, but mine is a giant Great Dane! All my other doctors agree I should go for scar remediation and get rid of \"Mount Kyle\" (Kyle being the butcher who created the mess). The scar across my chest kind of curves around, then goes down at the side then wanders up my side. This may not be entirely his fault, as he took 24 lymph nodes. After 8 months, I still have pains from the nerve damage, and random dead patches of skin. It doesn't help that I have just been hit by lymphodema, and the fluid is building up in Mt Kyle and it's getting even bigger.

I have not yet heard about the CT. I have another appointment with him next week, on the 21st. I had signed up with my local med center to have online access to my medical records and test results, so I have seen my x-ray report, which says nothing has changed (despite giving a different location and size for my femur tumor). Last Friday 9th, I read my Bone Scan report, which says I have 2 new tumors - definite progression. Damndamndamn !!! However, despite his promise at the time, he has not told me the news about progression. I have been expecting a call from him, or an appointment for a CT or MRI, but nothing, nada, zilch. Not even a call from my Med Center. I've decided to say nothing, and wait to see when he sees fit to tell me that the Tamoxifen has failed. It was partially expected, so not a shock, but it will be interesting to see how he breaks the news to me. I hate being left in the dark (even though he doesn't know I already know). GGGRRR!!!",

I found out that a friend of mine - we home-schooled our kids together many years ago, but hadn't been close recently - was in Hospice not expected to live long. I spoke to her on the phone, and went to visit her. She had, 2 weeks previously, suddenly felt very ill, and went to the ER. She was diagnosed quickly with uterine cancer spread to bowel, etc, etc. She was given only a few days. She went home and spent 2 days sorting out will, trusts, house, car etc, then felt she could relax and get on with it. She went straight into hospice, She also had family issues to sort out - brought her ex-husband and their children together and demanded they reconcile and bond. Thankfully they did, and she died a few days later. In all, she had nearly 3 weeks from DX to death. We had an amazing conversation about death, as only those who are both facing it can have. I envied her for her quick end, and she envied me for my long time frame. I felt that she did not have to linger, with the constant testing, changing meds, and side effects, and she felt I had more time to be with my family and to prepare for the end. In the end we decided that \"It is what it is\". We were both very impressed with her care in Hospice, and it reassured me that this was the place where I would end my journey. I visited her again on the day before she died. She was pretty \"out of it\" but in no pain - evidently on some pretty powerful meds. She did wake up a few times and acknowledge my presence, and seemed quite at peace, even happy, in those few lucid moments. She died peacefully, surrounded by her newly reconciled children. My main observations, overall, were that Hospice is awesome, hers was a \"good\" death, and that I am no longer afraid of what I am facing. I also woke up to the fact that my time is not yet, and I am more at peace with waiting it out. As she said, \"It is what it is\" and there's no point in worrying about it. I like that. I hope this helps those facing this horrible fate - mine feels a little less horrible because of this amazing woman. From Sue",

I was diagnosed as Stage 4 de novo, so did not see the point of reconstruction. However, what most people call dog ears, I call Mount Kyle. This is a huge lump under my affected armpit, which I estimate to be a decent B cup if it was on my chest. Kyle was the idiot surgeon who did my mastectomy - on a Friday afternoon just before he raced out of town on holiday. My drains were removed too early, resulting in a large haematoma under the scar and a large seroma above it. Both of those lumps are still there. I have long-standing random nerve pains in the entire area, and lymphodema in my arm and mastectomy area. Part of the scar opened up after radiation, I think I will start the process of laying a complaint and demanding scar remediation. My Medonc put in a referral for plastic surgery, but it was declined - partly because I'm terminal, but partly because he has never seen the mess left by the surgeon, so couldn't possibly describe it.",
