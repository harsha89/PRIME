Most often caused by surgical nerve damage Prior to my diagnosis of de novo metastatic breast cancer, For almost 2 years, I had an itchy, tingly armpit but no swelling, redness or pain. Then I developed a visible cord in my armpit. It is called axillary web syndrome and is caused by nerve damage. In my case, the nerve damage was caused by the cancer raging in my axillary lymph nodes.",

Routine mammograms were always negative (no lumps or suspicious lesions detected). Starting in Jan 2012, I began to experience an itchy armpit. This itchiness increased in frequency until October 2013 when I began to feel a tightning in my armpit which limited my range of motion. Concurrently, I discovered cording in my armpit. Finally, I had a physical symptom to present to my GP which sent me down the path of MRI's, biopsies, and PET scan which revealed cancer in my breast, axillary lymph nodes, and spine. A breast cancer surgeon who I consulted speculated that the cording was caused by nerve damage caused by the cancer raging in my lymph nodes. The good news is that, with hormonal treatment, my cancer is now diminished and stable. The cording has disappeared and I now have full range of motion in my armpit/shoulder.",

I've tried talking to various oncologists about this but they always manage to change the subject without giving me any enlightenment or affirmations. I had axilla web syndrome as the only symptom of breast cancer. I had an itchy armpit for 2 years but no swelling or rash or redness. Routine mammograms did were always negative. Then, in addition to the itchiness, I developed a cord in my armpit just under the skin. At this point, my GP ordered an MRI which showed enlarged axilla lymph nodes. After all the diagnostic scans were done, it turned out I had a very small tumor in my breast, multiple involved lymph nodes much more active on PET scan than the breast tumor, a tumor in my spine, and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. So, I was metastatic from the get-go. I have now been in treatment for 2 years (Femara for 18 months, and now Tamoxifen due to too much bone loss). While on Femara, my breast tumor and spinal tumor disappeared. The stubborn axilla lymph nodes still show up on PET scan but are greatly reduced. In 2 weeks, I will have my first PET scan since switching to Tamoxifen. Wish me luck! I used to get very angry that I went 2 years with this symptom and my GP was clueless. But I now believe that by the time my lymph nodes were so enlarged with cancer that I had that itchy sensation, I was probably already metastatic. Best Wishes to All...",
