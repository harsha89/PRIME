Needless to say, I am changing my date of birth to something else!  I too am surprised how young some of you ladies are. This shit totally sucks!! Big hugs and prayers for us all Dawn",

Then treatment ended and back to work so I didn''t come in much and finally stopped coming in altogether. Fast forward 7 years and now my lobular has pretty much taken over my abdomen with cancer cells in my stomach lining and colon. So what do I do, head straight back for here. The names are all different but the same love and support is still here, thank goodness! Being treated at UofM in AnnArbor and like my doctors. Had 1 dose of taxol with gemzar and tomorrow get ct scans and 2nd dose of gemzar. Got my fingers crossed and praying for us all. Love and hugs Dawn ",

It is about an hour drive to UofM from where I live and think that is part of it. Scans showed nothing new so I am hoping it has not spread any further. Have to admit I am feeling much better than I was 3 months ago. Am thinking seriously about going veg, anyone have any fave recipes, or cookbooks? I am open to all suggestions. My daughter is a serious vegitarian but she can't cook!!! Thanks again for the welocme back, prayers to all. Love and hugs Dawn",

Please feel free to PM me anytime too! Jen, great idea but I've only heard of Whole Foods and I heard they were horribly expensive but I am willing to give them a try. In addition to the cooking class, it would be nice to meet some stage 4 ladies. Love and hugs Dawn I am sooooo happy I came back to this site!!!!!!!",
