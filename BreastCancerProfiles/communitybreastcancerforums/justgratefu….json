Before mastectomy, i was told i had multi focal DCIS grade 3. But the pathology report showed on top of the DCIS, 4 sites of IDC ( 1mm each) that MRI, MAmmogram and ultrasound did not pick up and 1 lymph node out of 5 positive with 0.25 mm of cancer cells. Hoping to get a low score. but still wondering what would be best regardless of the result.",
