I realise there are different drug regimens now but all I thought about then was killing my cancer. I think it worked!! Sarah",

I didn't want to have my breast removed which is why I needed radiation. Why would you assume I did not have any biopsies? I offer my experience and get a response like yours - why? Sarah",

Scans, however, do present their own risks (radiation exposure), which is one of the reasons they do not do them frequently.  That said, my cousin lived in the US and was diagnosed with stage IV disease, was having her blood checked often and was told her tumour markers were good, but sadly died 14 months after diagnosis, so in my mind the tumour markers are questionable anyway.  There is nothing you can do (I know it's not easy) but to try and get on with your life and just hope you never become symptomatic.  I visited a specialist the other week to discuss my situation and he did ask if I wanted a scan and I said no as I feel I no longer wish to know if anything is wrong - if it is, it is and there is nothing I can do about it. However, it has taken me a few years to reach this place where I am now.  I suppose it's all about making the most of what we have right now?",

That said, it didn't made any difference there was no other treatment available only chemo and radiation.  Tamoxifen was the only hormonal drug available at that time and it was no good for me as I was er/pr neg.  So, if you have a poor prognosis things are not always as bad as you think. Keep positive, make any changes to your live that you wish (I made no changes!!), keep busy and things sometimes do work out for the best.  I think have been fortunate and I thank god every day.",

I was originally diagnosed has having a 1.8mm tumour and 1 lymph node under my arm had cancer. I was not staged but my plan was to have radiation then chemo after a lumpectomy. 3 weeks later I felt a node in my supraclavicular area which turned out to be cancer so had to start chemo more or less immediately. No doctor, at the time, could have predicted the supraclavicular node being cancerous as there were no signs. I didn't know then as much as I know now and there were not so many options available. but sometimes I think that a good thing and I just followed my doctors advice (more or less!).To jump from a Stage II to a Stage III can sound quite frightening. I was never staged so found out myself I was a Stage III as a, b and C didn't exist! As long as you go for the right treatment initially that is the probably best thing to do. I am surprised you have not been offered chemo. I wish you well with what you now face and hope you make the right decisions. Sarah",
