Now I only have 2 treatments left. I read yesterday that some doctors are now recommending that patients with a tumor smaller than 5 mm can safely forego radiation. Wish I had read that 3 weeks ago. Actually, these treatments have not been too bad. I do feel more confident knowing that I have done everything possible to keep the cancer from returning. At my treatment center it seems that for every person that finishes, there are 2 more to take their place. I have meet some very nice caring people over the past 3 weeks. The support from the members of this board has been extremely helpful. I'll be starting Tamoxifen on Thursday. Then I will have a whole new set of worries.  ",

I've been using Lubriderm, Vanicream and Pure Aloe Vera. Nothing seems to help. I met with my RO for the last time yesterday. She told me to continue what I am doing even after treatments stop and things should start to improve in about 2 weeks, but they will get worse before they get better. Hope everyone enjoys the weekend.",

I have only had 4 treatments and the only discomfort that I have is the nipple area. I am using Lubiderm for sensitive skin. My RO told me to be sure to apply the cream to the entire breast which includes the lower portion of the armpit. My lymph nodes are not being treated, but the lower portion of the armpit is in the treatment field. I was frightened to begin radiation but I think now I am more afraid of the tamoxifen. The side effects sound terrible and 5 years seems like a very long time to take any medication. Have to get ready for treatment #5. Wishing everyone a good day. Thanks for being here.",

Taking an Aleve before I leave for my treatment has helped ease my shoulder discomfort. When I meet with my doctor this week, I am going to ask her about the boosts. How soon after finishing the radiation treatments do you start Tamoxifen? Is there any follow up screening done when rads are finished? I am just full of questions today. I'll be sure to discuss this with my doctor, but it is interesting to see how my treatment compares to others. Wishing everyone a good day.",

She does not feel that they are necessary due to a small 5 ml tumor and very good margins. Based on what I have read in all the posts, I hope that this is the right decision. My skin was starting to get pink when she checked it last week. Most of the problems, if there are any, will start after my treatments are complete. I do have a burning sensation during the night and over the weekend I noticed some redness under the breast. I have lost about 6 pounds since I met with my MO on Dec 7. There is no followup planned after my treatments are complete. I told her that my surgeon has scheduled a mammogram in May, 6 months after my surgery. She stopped short of telling me to cancel it. She thinks it is best to just go back on a yearly mammogram schedule. I plan to keep the appointment and meet with my surgeon as scheduled. Then I will continue with annual mammograms.  Did any of you not have boosts? I certainly would like to see this come to an end and the sooner the better, but if getting 5 more treatments will prevent a recurrence I would be willing to do 5 more.",

It was during this week that I had considerable redness and considerable discomfort during the night. I got up to apply more cream, but it doesn't give me much relief. Most of the redness is on the outside area of the breast where it comes into contact with the arm and also under the breast. RO nurse told me to use cornstarch there and it did help. Redness was gone this morning but was back after my morning treatment. I only have 3 treatments left now. I'll be finished on Wednesday. Everyone reacts differently so you might have very mild SE. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck.",
