    "Content": "bigsky2 wrote: I am not bragging about my health before my cancer. I just wanted to share my experience here since there might be risks in my life style. I am from a very healthy family with no cancer history. Both my parents and their family members live past 85. I have a healthy diet - mainly home-prepared meals high in vegetables and low in meat, fat and sodium. I work out 70 minutes a day, six days a week. I don't smoke or take drugs. I only drink one or two glasses of wine a month. All my life I was almost never sick. I never filed for a claim against my health insurance, and I only visited my doctor once a year for physical - UNTIL, I was diagnosed with BC last year!! I am done with my treatment, and am waiting for the recurrence. I feel pessimistic. How can I not after I did just about everything right? OK. I admit. I did not do EVERYTHING right. Here are my sins. And maybe some of them have caused my cancer: 1) I am childless 2) I like to stay up late - often till 5 am, then I sleep in the morning. I do take a nap from midnight to 1 am. 3) I don't get enough sun. I work from home. I only go to the gym in the evenings. 4) I don't take vitamins since I was very confident about my healthy diet. 5) I eat a lot of dairy food, e.g., two or three servings of cheese/yogurt a day. 6) I eat four or five servings of fruits a day since I love sweets yet I don't want to eat pastries or candy. I do not drink juice though. 7) I overeat maybe once a week. I might be a bit overweight, with a BMI of 24. I am small on the midriff though. I am trying to modify my life style, e.g., eat less dairy food and fruits, become a teetotaler, take multi-vitamins. I can't have a child now. And I still stay up late because I cannot stop taking my nap at midnight. I still don't get enough sun. With a demanding job, it's hard to get out during the day. And it's too hot to walk out in the summer anyway. I still work out seven hours a week because I enjoy it, and because it keeps my weigh down. But who knows if strenuous exercise is what cause my cancer? I have extremely dense breasts, which probably are from running and pulling the elliptical machine. As I said, I just wanted to share my experience here. Hopefully it can help others. Log in to post a reply",
