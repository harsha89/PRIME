I was eager to get it out because I am slim and it stuck out like a giant ugly bump. You could see the tube too. The procedure was on a Friday and i was able to go away for the weekend the next day. If it had been in the middle of the week, Iwould have gone to work the next day. I was not allowed to drive myself home from the hospital because of the sedation.",

      "Content": "Dec 6, 2017 06:24AM - edited Dec 6, 2017 06:29AM by StubbornDog I read somewhere that if someone is grieving or going through a tough time, one should never ask the big open-ended, \u201chow are you?\" but rather, \u201chow are you today?\" which is easier to answer honestly if one wishes, and, who knows, the person being asked may be having a good or better day amongst a sea of bad. And even if not, it is easier to answer honestly if one wishes. It is certainly what I'd rather be asked. Now how to train people to ask that? I'm new here by the way. Last day of work is today before surgery Friday. I've been drafting in my head my email to coworkers explaining my leave and figuring out the best way to head off nosy questions from the get-go. (I haven't yet figured out how to make the signature you all use.) By the way, rubyred, I like your avatar and screen name. It's from my all time favorite movie.",

I ended chemo on May 22, 2018 and stopped the wig 2 months later. My real hair and wig were somewhere between chin and shoulder-length. If I had a do-over, I would have gone with a short style to make the transition back to real hair easier. But, I think I may have been too self-conscious to do that, as any comments/compliments would have put me on the spot fearing people could tell it was a wig! I am not good at dishonesty/acting.It was hard to start wearing a wig, just as hard to give it up! (yellowb your port looks just like mine did.",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2017 09:58PM - edited Dec 7, 2017 10:02PM by StubbornDog hi - I saw a breast surgeon first but an oncologist well before surgery too. She was able to counsel based on biopsy results. She also recommended genetic testing to see if I had BRCA1/2 which could affect surgery decisions (one side vs two). And she put me in touch with a helpful social worker. I am glad I saw her \u201cout of order\" before surgery. (Btw she is at BI and does research at Dana Farber.) The surgeons and oncologists really each do have their \u201cscope of practice\" and are careful not to counsel outside their area of expertise and not step on other team members' toes or give conflicting information.",
