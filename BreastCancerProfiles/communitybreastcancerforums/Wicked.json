They did bloodwork, took history, and I had to have a physical with my primary care, which could not occur more than 30 days prior to surgery. They did an EKG before my lumpectomies and that was good for my mastectomies as well, as it had to be within 6 months. They also told me they require a pregnancy test before surgery for all pre-menopausal women. This cannot be done more than a week before. I'm in the US. I signed my consents at a separate appt.",

I've had 5 breast biopsies at this point- 1 FNA, 2 stereotactic core, and 2 wire-guided excisional biopsies (one of which ended up technically being a lumpectomy). I'd rather be told \"you have cancer\" than be told \"you have to wait for the results to find out if you have cancer.\" Waiting is THE worst. And honestly, if you have never gone through this, you don't understand. At all. So glad we have this forum. Amlere, I like your approach of telling yourself, \"nothing is going to change today,\" because you're right, nothing will change until you get the results. I might be stealing that approach as I wait for more test results in this odyssey.",

Cysts look different on ultrasound from solid masses. If they're telling you it's a cyst, it probably is. And if you're in the US, don't get it biopsied and expect insurance to pay for it if the docs are not recommending biopsy. Insurance usually won't pay for a biopsy unless doctors say it is necessary.",
