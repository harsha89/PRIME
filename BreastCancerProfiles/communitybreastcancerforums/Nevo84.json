I know that whoever Dxed with BC specially new ones like my mom are so sensitive. All of sisters and their families are searching for inspiring stories. Here is one: My uncle's wife was dx with BC in her two breasts at 2000. She Had mastectomy her right breast and nothing is done even lumpecomy with her left breast. She had node involvement and hormone receptor +.She is doing really fine and with a lot of hope continuing her daily life. There are a lot of people around us who at a certain time suffered from BC. You should go on with your faith and belive me very soon in the near future all of us happily will listen that the concrete cure for BC is found. We all shold pray for that special day. A big HUG to you. ",

I think it's common to think like what you do but with time passes by you'll feel more comfortable and won't panick everyrtime that something unusual happen to you. The best you can do is inspire yourself and wait until your examine. I truley wish that you'll come back and write to us and inspire us with your great GOOD news. We are here with you",

Everywhere I poked in said early stage breast cancer is curable.What about her stage?Do you have any idea about her case? Her doctor gave hope to her and said your results are OK.",

The nly thing I'm concerned about is her bones. I am determined to ask her onc to do a bone scan this time when we go fo her check up. Dear Krcll Thank you for your answer. I think the same way. The difference between my mom's case and stage IIb is 1cm excess in her tumors size. And there shold be differences between her case and some stage IIIa which has involvements in breast tissue, vessels and a lot of nodes. We should hope that in very near future the complete cure of cancer will be found. And there won't be any victims from this so called cancer",
