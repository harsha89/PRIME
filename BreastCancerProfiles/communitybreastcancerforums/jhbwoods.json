Thank goodness I went to see this surgeon.  She told me she's learned to not simply rely on the x-rays, bloodwork, etc.  She also relies on what she feels and sees and if something just doesn't feel right than its better to be absolutely sure about it than not do anything at all.  Hope this helps! ",
