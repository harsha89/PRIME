It was the worst pain I've ever felt. After that, my breast began to grow bigger than the other and everything. So, considering my age, is it more likely to be fat necrosis instead of cancer?",

She looked at me, felt my breasts a little and said that there is nothing wrong with them, other than the asymmetry. I didn't like the way she consulted me. She quickly dismissed me, because of my age, and i feel like she didn't pay enough attention. My mother insisted on having ultrasound tomorrow, but I hope everything is ok.",
