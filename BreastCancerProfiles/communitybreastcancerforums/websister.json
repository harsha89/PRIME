I will share your blog with her. I also enjoyed the song you posted, I hadn't heard it before but I'm going to add it to my music selection for chemo. Take care :)",

      "Content": "Jun 14, 2012 08:43PM websister wrote: Can anyone tell me how long is typical to wait for pathology results? I live in Canada, I don't know if that makes a difference, from what I'm reading some people seemed to hear fairly quickly, I was told to expect my results in 5 - 7 business days, I had the mammogram/ultrasound last Friday. As I put in my original post, they seemed very concerned when they did my mammo, bringing me back for more pictures twice, they changed the plate on the mammogram machine to a smaller plate the second time and said they required more magnification, used this plate for second and third sets of pictures. Then when I went into the ultrsound room the first thing the technician said was 'Oh good, I see you already have a breast surgeon\". Again, as described in my original post, they decided to do biopsies right then, I had three areas biopsied, several samples from each area, one of the areas was a lymph node in the axilla and then a fine needle aspiration of some fluid from a cyst near the axilla, the fluid was bloody. it's been hard waiting but I knew from what they told me that I might not hear until now or early next week, I was told to contact my doctor and alert to the fact that biopsies were taken and to watch for results. I did this with both the breast surgeon and my GP. I told one close friend at work and she was talking to me today and said she thinks that I can assume from the fact that I haven't been contacted yet that it's not cancer; suggested that if it had been I would have been contacted already - in her words 'bad news travels fast'. I don't know what to think now, it seemed pretty bad when the biopsies were taken, I have an appointment again on the 20th with the breast surgeon but I have another weekend to get through if I don't hear tomorrow.  To sum up my question, what is a typical wait for results? and is it true in other people's experience that if I'm waiting a long time to hear, that I can assume that the results are benign?  Thanks, everyone ",

I felt a lump about two weeks ago on my right breast - 9 o'clock area. I have an appointment for annual physical in July but felt I should get this checked out so called the Breast Health Clinic and asked to see my surgeon. I saw him on June 6th and was booked for mammo/ultrasound today. After first mammo films taken, told to wait in cubicle, then called back for mor films twice. With the ultrasound after it was done the tech went to check with the radiologist and came back in with a cart and said the radiologist wanted to do a core biopsy. She also said, 'good, you already have a breast surgeon'. The radiologist did another ultrasound and ended up biopsying three sites within the nine o'clock area and then a lymph node in the armpit. It doesn't look good, so once again glad to be able to reach out for some support.

I had a great week away with my oldest son and family but, probably due to being a little immunosuppressed from rads, came down with a good bronchitis. To top it off my Mom fell again a week ago Sunday, at first we were told no fractures but now we are told that she re-fractured her right hip and pelvis. It doesn't look like she will be able to go back to the lodge. I was last in contact with Benny on the weekend. She had her RO appt and it was hard on her, the docs always like to give all the reasons why they recommend the treatment they do but it can be scary to hear.

I find the activities, within reason, actually helpful in many ways. I hope that the rest of your week is now uneventful for you, I will be thinking of you. Sending hugs to everyone, tomorrow a.m. is my third MUGA scan so early morning",

I agree that you should probably go to a much lower age range and he will need to be very special Edi - sending hugs. I do understand and I did do a post on my blog called 'Picking up the Pieces' that speaks to what it is like post treatment. There is a book by the same name that our Breast Cancer Supportive Care Foundation uses with it's patients. Nihahi - hope you finally got some sleep and that the feeling when you turned over was nothing. I glad putting the abdominal binder on helped. Liefie - you sound so good these days! Congrats on the bloodwork. The cupcakes were lovely, no icing needed :). I didn't have the heart to wake up Traii after she fell asleep. Traii - so much playing on your mind. I also had liver and spleen lesions and wonder. I'm glad that you are going to call sooner than the 22nd, that is much to long to wait for results. Alive - with you waiting Maria - in your pockets with those other rowdy gals Re: back pain - one of the reasons that I have put it off is I don't want to be running to the dr with every ache and pain now. I also didn't feel heard last time I was in or when I had my appt at BCSCF on Monday. I have been having discomfort in my right upper abdominal area since before radiation. I told the oncology fellow that saw me at my last appointment and he just brushed it off and said if it was still there in two weeks to let them know. Since then it has remained as a burning pain but then the lower back pain has eclipsed it. At the BCSCF appt the doctor asked me how I had been since last appt. I mentioned the back pain and said I supposed that I should get it checked out. No response. Then she asked me whether I was continuing with my exercise and I said 'as the back pain allows' - again no response. I didn't expect her to do anything about it but an acknowledgement that I should get it checked out would have been appreciated. Yesterday afternoon in the meadow I used ice and took a Tylenol 3, that gave me 30 minutes of complete relief but then back again. Worse this a.m. so I have placed a call to my oncologist's nurse and I am waiting for her to call back. Sending love and hugs to everyone",

It is a type of breast cancer where many gains have been made and it seems more all the time. I'm sorry you received the news over the phone, not the best way for sure. You will have a plan soon enough, that really helps. Mitotic rate is how quickly the cells are dividing - 1 is low, 3 is high - so 1 is good Sending hugs Take care, we're here with and for you",

The end of active treatment can be tough for the reasons you state.

Hope you start to feel caught up on that sleep again soon. Nihahi - Murphy's law eh? re: daughter and move. We will be in your pockets on Wednesday. I have been a little quiet. Combination of several things. We had a surprise 87th birthday for my MIL on Saturday and there was planning and preparation for that, my oldest and family came from Cranbrook. Everyone at my house later Saturday evening. My MIL has a pelvic cancer that would have required extensive surgery, she decided over a year ago not to go through that. She is starting to experience more symptoms and moving to a facility with more care at end of June. She was very touched by the surprise party and the efforts everyone went to to be there. Sunday our church had a special lunch to honour all who had graduated this year. I had to make a poster board for that, kind of like a 'this is your life' for Kenny June 8th one year ago was my mammogram/US/biopsy - I had my follow up mammogram today. Seemed eerily similar including the weather and time of the appointment. I was there for two hours with a few tense moments that reminded me of last year when they asked for more pictures and told me I might be going for an US. This was the good breast. They had told me there was an area of calcification on it last year that appeared to be benign. Today they finally compared to last years films and decided it hadn't changed. I got out of there pretty quickly after the tech said 'you can go, have a wonderful day, we will see you next year' This afternoon I saw the radiation oncologist for follow up visit. She is happy with how skin has healed, she gave me a prescription so I can claim for massage and wrote on it that they are free to massage the area that was radiated. She has put in the referral to the plastic surgeon for my reconstruction. She thought it would be at least 6 - 8 months before the appointment and then at least another 6 - 8 months before the surgery. Hugs to all",

They do seem to be working for me, if I do wake up I am able to get right back to sleep. It is a small dose. I know they don't seem to work for all but I am very thankful that I have slept well for the last 4 nights. Benny - loved the rescue pigeon story, I was well rested so it didn't put me to sleep ;) Re: back to work - I haven't officially returned yet, that date is July 8th but I am gearing up and there have been some meetings they wanted me to be part of as they related to the projects I will be working on once back. Dr. Taylor at BCSCF was very helpful in creating a return to work schedule for me and submitting it to the insurance company. She has me returning pretty gradually, I won't be full time again until October 28th. Today I was in for 3 1/2 hours and my back was bothering me by one hour in. My next MO visit is July 15th so if haven't heard anything re: MRI by then and it still isn't settling I'll push further. My SIL told me her best friend was diagnosed today with BC, knows it is in lymph nodes also but not sure how many. Will meet with BS next Friday. I've given her info re: this site and told her she can talk to me anytime she needs. This lady is very active and fit, it still makes me wonder at times at the 'stereotype' out there that cancer is a lifestyle disease. Even at my last BCSCF appointment there was a Fellow taking my docs patients and she stated to me 'Now that you've made such healthy lifestyle changes you will have cut your chance of recurrence by 50%'. I'm afraid I reacted and told her that actually with the exception of stress I had been leading a very healthy lifestyle prior to diagnosis, had not had to make changes to live healthily and that so many of the ladies I 'meet' on these boards also have had very healthy lifestyles and diets. She apologized and said it was good for her to hear this, telling me that docs can tend to make assumptions and that it was like 'blaming the patient' Wishing you all a good weekend.

Care to share the recipe? Jennie - sorry to hear about how you have been feeling, even though it helps me to know I am not alone in the slow or stalled healing process. It can be discouraging when it seems that everyone else is doing so well and getting on with life. Last evening I had another 'crash' where I just suddenly felt completely energy depleted and had to head to bed at 8 p.m. Then, even though body was physically exhausted my mind wouldn't turn off and I couldn't sleep. Finally took a sleeping pill at 2 a.m. and that worked. It will be a quiet weekend on here as it sounds like lots of fun activities going on. Carla - still thinking of you, please share as you know what is happening. Wishing all a good and relaxing weekend",

As others have said take one day at a time, one thing at a time, you have a good surgeon, he was mine also. I did have local anesthetic for the needle localizations I had in 2009 and I would like to bet that you will have also. You will probably know right away if there were positive nodes or not but pathology will take one to two weeks to have back and he will review with you at your postop visit so don't worry about that. I was visited by a physiotherapist prior to discharge from the hospital and she reviewed the exercises with me and when to begin them, how to progress with them and also the lifting restrictions. You will be prescribed adequate painkillers. The physiotherapist and a nurse I had both had mothers who had gone through breast cancer, one was last year and one was 11 years ago, they were very good with me and it was very nice to hear their stories and know they understood. You can do this, Benny!",

Re: wig - my family rarely see me with a wig on in the house and if I wear one when we're out I have been known to take it off in the car on the way home. Susan - welcome. Yes, we should compare stories. I have been given the OK for chemo #6 tomorrow, after that it will be Herceptin infusions every three weeks to August 2013. I am booked for another MUGA scan in early January to see how my heart is doing since epirubicin and now Herceptin, hopefully all will be good. I was also given a prescription for Tamoxifen which she wants me to start taking the first week of January, she didn't want me dealing with side effects of that over Christmas. My diagnosis and treatments are now back in my signature for you to see. I didn't have clear scans at the beginning - lesion on liver and one on spleen. Both organs are very vascular - they don't biopsy spleens so they will just repeat the scans in the New Year. I will be interested to know how you find the naturopathy and acupuncture, sorry to hear about the diarrhea. I have quite a variety of meds on hand now for diarrhea, constipation, nausea and pain - and I have always been someone who hated taking medication. Hoping to get back to that after this is all over. Benny - I emailed you, ended up hitting send before I was quite finished. I hope you aren't too tired for your oncologist appt tomorrow and that it is helpful re: reason for tiredness. Mom had her surgery today and is back in her room, they are working on pain control but the surgeon said the surgery itself went well. Bev - hoping your oncotype is low and no chemo is required, I smiled at your son asking you to show your cut to his friends :). 6 - 7 weeks postop is fairly standard for start of chemo Liefie - thinking of you as you make your long trip to South Africa. Hi to all the other warrior sisters, hope today was a good one for you.",

Is it possible that because you had cut your hair the night before that the salesperson may have touched it to indicate that she realized you were losing your hair and looking for solutions, when she did, some came out, not an intentional pull? A difficult experience for you, especially when you are feeling so vulnerable. Do you think you will enjoy your purchases anyway? It has been very cold here in Calgary, hasn't it? I only made it out once this weekend myself. The chemo fatigue is cumulative. I think the issues you had with first chemo have caused a lot of your fatigue, next time may not be as bad. I am hoping that by mid-January things will be becoming more normal for me energy wise. Sending hugs",

The course ends on Monday so I've been catching up on assignments and studying for the final test. I visited Mom yesterday, she looks and feels pretty good, my chemo brain was a bit of a problem though - I plugged in a curling iron to do her hair but forgot about it when I left. Halfway home I realized I'd left it on, had to quickly call the hospital and get them to go do it. Today is a potluck Christmas celebration with the Autism association that I have worked with here. I also have a gingerbread house decorating party this evening. Hope my energy holds out :) Traii - hope you are doing ok with side effects. Dakota - I'm so glad you have your kids.

And I still haven't treadmilled. My manager asked to talk to me and he has received official information that I'm not returning Feb. 1st, so insurance company must have accepted the oncologist's documentation. He wanted to know what had been happening as he never expected me back until April. Herceptin not too bad so far, went to bed early last night, legs achy this a.m. and napped this afternoon (but that could have been the McDonald's also ;).

Saw my Dr. yesterday and she told me I was getting too tired, told me to take today and tomorrow off and I will not be progressing to the next step on my return to work plan for at least another two weeks. Kind of glad about that, I am very tired and looking forward to an extra long weekend Take care everyone",

I'm the same as many of the ladies, it is not something my MO does regularly - basically besides mammo and my MUGA scans to check heart function due to epirubicin and Herceptin - other scans are ordered only on an 'as needed' basis if symptoms appear to warrant. With you on Tuesday for your appointment Maria - sorry to hear about DD of friend - I know she will have appreciated your visit, sending prayers for her Nihahi - re: any change to diet that might help - I have been very good in trying to ensure I am well nourished. I am having lots of greens and salads, making sure I get enough protein and not having any simple carbohydrates, this is a diet that I maintained all throughout chemo. I do allow myself a 'cheat meal' once a week so I don't feel deprived. I have lost between 5 - 10 pounds since June. It is a gray day here today, I can handle it but I am looking forward to the crisp, sunny autumn days. Movie - how are you doing? Caitlin - saw your pictures on Facebook Benny - hope your sleeping improves - no fun being up in the middle of the night Jo - good news re: no lymph nodes - sorry that you have to have re-excision and are trying to decide re: mastectomy. There were a few ladies on another thread last year who required re-excision, they received news of clear margins after the re-excision and seemed OK with that choice also. Do what you feel is best for you. Wishing all a good weekend.",

I participated in the Run for the Cure today, about 8,000 participants in Calgary, got in on a free foot massage at the survivors tent - heaven :) Still a little brain dead after the last week so forgive me if I neglected to comment or add support - we have had a houseful since the funeral on Friday, Thursday was my final Herceptin infusion (18 in total), I rang the bell in the chemo area and shed a few tears as I walked away, I'm sure there were a few people in the waiting area wondering about that. Yesterday, we went and cleaned out Mom's room at the lodge (they called Thursday to ask about this). This week I will start to go through what we packed up as well as work on some of the financial aspects ie banking, closing accounts For the rest of today though, I will rest Take care everyone",

Morwenna and I went to see Benny last evening and she agreed that it was OK to share this news with her sisters here. On Tuesday afternoon of this week, Benny's beautiful horse Diamond developed colic and following a vet consult, required euthanization. There was no sign of this to prepare Benny for the loss, she had a wonderful day with Diamond on Sunday, telling Diamond how much she loved her before she left. She also spoke with the person who boards her on Tuesday and all seemed well, Di was her usual self, up to her usual antics. The loss has been hard on Benny. Morwenna brought her the wonderful soup the she provided the recipe for in her post above mine. Benny had not eaten since breakfast so we made sure she drank some water, we did not need to convince her to eat the soup. She scraped the bowl clean, thankfully Morwenna was very generous and she has some to tide her over for a bit. We also ordered a vegetarian/gluten-free fruit basket for her which should have arrived today. Benny wanted you all to know that she will be taking some time away from the board here in order to process her loss. It was a privilege for us to spend some time with her last evening of behalf of all of us on this thread. Take care everyone",

It has been a bit of a crazy last few weeks for me - work has been very hectic - I was rushing from one meeting at one hospital site to get to my car so I could get to a meeting at a hospital on the other side of the city two weeks ago and had quite a fall. I tore three ligaments on the outside of my left ankle and I have an avulsion fracture on the inside of the same ankle (means that ligament took a piece of bone with it when it tore off) . I still made all my meetings that day but have added physio three times a week for six weeks to my schedule.  We also had Paisley's first birthday party  with lots of people on the 29th, my oldest son's family all down and stayed with us that weekend, the we set off on vacation to Saskatchewan on Monday.  Morwenna - love the rose story - it must have been very moving. Also enjoyed the pictures. Adagio - good to hear the eye is healing well.  Edi - in your pockets until CT results back - hope all is good and it can help with settling nerves.  Liefie - you also sound very busy, what a milestone to celebrate for you - 60!

Hope mobility of shoulder improved soon and pt works wonders and hope that your BP settles into a nice, boring normal. I don't think I had propofol for any of my colonoscopies, there are other meds that could be used. Mine was conscious sedation Nihahi - re: ankle - love your description! - I am in a air cast walking boot now. It has helped with the stress fractures and cyst toe region - pain now more localized to areas of initial injury - medial and lateral ankle. The thought is that I tore the ligaments that make up the retinaculum and so the peroneal tendons are subluxated. I will see a WCB physician on Wednesday, my case manager feels that might speed up MRI, possibly referral to ortho surgeon. Long, long time but I've given up being frustrated and just do what I can How was the BRA day, I was thinking you were possibly placed at the complications table because of the implant, not the DIEP (I know, I'm a little slow sometimes)  Edi - how is everything there?

We had a good trip and great birthday celebration at my son and daughter-in-law's, then saw my son off to Arizona for a week with the grade 9 class where my daughter in law teaches. He goes on this trip every year to oversee and build houses with the kids in areas that need the help, last year it was Mexico. This meant that my daughter in law is a single mom for a week with the three children so we stayed as long as possible yesterday to help out before heading home again. Today was rads 3, followed by the rads class that I should have had prior to rads last week but Monday was a statutory holiday last week. There were a few things I learned that were helpful. I stopped at a bakery and meat shop and picked up some things then went to the building where the Breast Cancer Supportive Care Foundation office is. My appt there wasn't until three so I had arranged with a friend who is a psychologist and has an office right next door to have coffee/lunch with him. Turns out he went to a bakery also and bought the most decadent brownies! We had a nice lunch, time flew - I usually let him talk and tell me about his life as so much of the time he is listening to and helping other people with their problems, then I send supper and some treats for his kids home with him. Traii - hope the blood results were good, I'm going to need some of that toenail polish Nhahi brings to your pockets, my toenails are exiting one by one also.

Hope Easter dinner goes well for you, sounds kind of stressful. Edi - glad the Immodium did it's work, enjoy your visit, so nice to be chauffeured! The diaper is beautiful! Thanks to all of you who voted for my DIL, she is doing really well in the contest, she has received 70 votes in the last 24 hours - if she continues to receive votes at that rate it looks very promising for her.

I will visit my Mom this afternoon for a while and then I think I will watch Les Miserables this evening. Take care everyone",

Edi, you will get to see what a beautiful person Liefie is. Bearcub - re: Herceptin - I just had number 8, 9 more to go. I have a MUGA scan on Monday, April 8th and then another visit with my MO on April 15 to discuss. I will ask her then what my LVEF is. My understanding is that they would consider stopping if it drops by 10 or more, but that being above 50 is good. Mom is still at the hospital but she is quite anxious to convince them that she should be able to return to the lodge. She is more confused though. She was sure that I had visited her with two of my cousins on Friday and I hadn't and she was also sure that I had told her I had decided not to work anymore. I am hoping for a really good assessment both physically and cognitively followed by a good placement that provides the right amount of care for her so this pattern of falling and hospitalizations becomes history. Traii - how exciting that your vacation is so close Nihahi and Dakota - countdown to surgery for the two of you, put yourselves first right now as far as people you need to look after Thanks to all for the birthday wishes. I am looking forward to a much better year.",

One thing that I have done since starting Herceptin with my MO's blessing is take CoQ10 twice daily. It is supposed to help with heart function, I can't guarantee that is the reason mine seems to be doing OK but it isn't hurting it. You could ask your MO if they would be willing for you to try it My bloodwork was also all OK so I am booked for the next 4 Herceptins, we do MUGA, bloodwork and appt again and if OK then I will be on the 3 month home stretch of the Herceptin. I was sorry to hear of the bombings in Boston today when I got home - so sad Take care everyone",

Keep up the cream, you can also call and see if they want to prescribe something else like Flamazine. I just kept using the cream given to me, the worst of it was about a week, then it cleared up really quickly after that. Now looking in the mirror there is only a slight pink tinge to the skin. Nihahi - so good to hear from you. Rest up Carlads - I also am wondering whether I will go through with any reconstruction. There is a tremendously long wait list here just to talk to a PS and then another long wait for surgery so I will get on the waitlist for the appointment to talk to the PS and see what they have to say Have to run as busy day but sending love to all xxxooo",

I was feeling pretty good, I was able to add some stuff I knew/remembered to the meetings and they were all very complimentary re: my hair. Then I got a good reality check when I went to Costco after and was called 'sir' by the clerk :( Yesterday I paid for all the activity the previous few days, very achy, my lower back has been bothering me for a couple of weeks now so will probably have to get it checked out, I was hoping it would just go away.

Love GD with your DH, she is a treasure. Nihahi - you are an inspiration to me. If/when I decide to have my surgery I want you to still be here giving out your wisdom, stories and support. My reasoning for having surgery would be just to be able to buy regular lingerie and put on a swimsuit without worrying about a prosthesis. Movie - Japan sounds wonderful. Good for you. Liefie - I hadn't had supper yet when I read your post about last evening's entertaining and I was wondering how quickly I could get over there for leftovers ;). Your surgery is not too far away, you sound so good! You will do well. Traii - I enjoyed reading about your visit to the park. Hope the sinus infection has cleared up. Re: peripheral neuropathy - I have also heard that Neurontin can be helpful, it is a prescription medication. There is also some information out there that alpha lipoic acid might be beneficial - it is a supplement. Maria - there can be pains when the nerves start to regenerate. I'm not sure when you had your drains out but sometimes you can get a bit of a build up of fluid called a seroma after the drains are removed and that can be painful also. If it doesn't go away or gets worse it would be worth checking out. Re: my back pain - not going away unfortunately, Nihahi pass the peas please ;). Since I was just traveling I will give it to Thursday to settle down and if not, ask about it at my Herceptin appt. Today I was at work for a few hours of meetings and had to place my fist against it behind me in my chair to help. If I had had any narcotics with me I would have taken them and I don't do that. Visit for grandson's birthday was wonderful. I told a friend at work that it was good medicine. Take care everyone",

My oncologist's nurse is supposed to be booking the bone scan and getting back to me with the date/time. Until then I am doing what I can activity wise and to control the pain. I am not comfortable, sometimes to the point of tears and nausea. Combine that with post Herceptin aches and hormone imbalance and you get the picture :( Family has been great and yes, I am being spoiled. I want so much to go out and work in the yard but I am resisting doing that.

Wondering how the water feature with the lighting looked at night, I remember your DH being anxious for the sun to go down so he could admire his work?

Not paid per se for it but I give my feedback and input on various items/processes/documents in the works and so far, they keep inviting me back ;) Movie - can't wait to hear about tomorrow's escapades. So glad you were able to go Benny - yay!!! Rads over. You will find that it takes about a week to 10 days for the full effects re: skin and fatigue and then things will start to settle down. Raining here again today so I guess you will probably be spending a quiet day at home. Benny has been such a good companion for you through all of this, definitely took it's toll on him. Looking forward to the picture of you and Diamond with rabbit ears Carla - looking forward to update from your PS appointment Jennie - how are things now that you are a couple of weeks post rads? Dakota - you should probably get the swelling checked out, could be lymph edema and you want to catch that early. Cording can be present without lymph edema Yesterday I spent a very relaxing but productive day outdoors with the exception of a brief rain shower in the afternoon. I would work for about 20 minutes to 1/2 hour then rest for a bit and plan the next steps in the garden as I rested. All is looking very nice, not neglected like before. Probably a good thing it is raining today - for the plants I planted and so I am not tempted to get out there again today. I have to take my Mom for a doctor's appointment this afternoon so that will take up a few hours of my day. Haven't heard anything re: MRI, pain still there but trying to get on with life Greetings to everyone else,",

I will have it on July 10 at noon at the newest hospital to open up here, it is fairly close to home but I haven't been there yet so will have to find my way around. I had my performance review at work today and feel very blessed to have the manager I have. It went very well and he is incredibly supportive.

Understand, sending hugs (((()))). Your hair sounds lovely and it must feel so good to be able to eat without all the pain etc that was associated with it when you were going through chemo. Your body is now trying to restore itself, be good to yourself. Liefie - congratulations to you and DH on your 34th wedding anniversary. You are a lovely couple, my DH and I so enjoyed meeting you both last fall, we could see how much your DH loves you. He is a sweetheart, how special that he surprised you on your wedding day with the flower arrangement and card. It sure is working for you, therefore it is perfect for the two of you. ((())) I took it easy this a.m. and then went to a bridal shower this afternoon. The world goes on, even with the flooding. The wedding is booked to the place at the zoo on July 14th, it is currently still under water. Not sure what plan B is but she seemed to be taking it all in stride. Albertans are tough! :)",

At the bridal shower yesterday I laughed while talking to some younger ladies and spilled my coffee on my chest.

Might have to make some up myself soon. ;) Liefie - how was your appt and retail therapy? Thought I should update you on my appointment today. It was a long morning. I was there for bloodwork at 7:45 a.m., I was supposed to see oncologist at 1000. Turns out my MO is on holidays and a GP that works with her was filling in, she was running late so didn't see her until about 11:30. She rushed through the appt - MUGA was good, booked last 4 Herceptins. She said 'good news' - MRI showed no mets to spine but did show degeneration to the facet joints in the lower lumbar spine resulting in L5 slipping onto S1 vertebra (anterolisthesis) and that is causing the pain and muscle spasms. She said my GP could follow up. Last Herceptin will be October 2nd and will not see MO again until December. Realized after while driving to work that we didn't discuss port removal.",

One day at a time, use that Glaxal base, rest when needed. I found about about 7 - 10 days post rads to be the most uncomfortable but once the skin starts healing it seemed to get better very quickly. I sometimes get a little down when I see others moving on and I still have 3 more months of Herceptin to go, port removal at some point and reconstruction to get through - I let myself wallow for a bit and then look back at how far I've come and decide to get on with it again - the ladies here have been the best, couldn't do it without them Everyone else - sending greetings, Dakota hope you are healing well and not too sore.

The genetics counsellor emailed me a link to the syndrome she suspects I have and told me they would be reviewing my case tomorrow with a geneticist - should be interesting, it would put a lot of puzzle pieces together for me. Liefie - glad you didn't let that accusation go without challenging it - how dare they!!! Hope and pray all will fall into place now Found it a little funny that I spent the week reviewing the booked surgical process at the various hospitals in our city, ending up at the one I will be having my port out at tomorrow. When I returned home I had a phone message from one of the people I interviewed this afternoon regarding instructions for my procedure tomorrow.

The fatigue hit me at Costco, can't wait for that to be a thing of the past. I see the Dr. again tomorrow to see how fatigue issue is going - nowhere is going to have to be the answer for now. I get to see GD tomorrow after the appt, looking forward to that :) Love you all, take care",

It is always hard when the choice is left up to you to decide. Ports are not bad things, honest, so don't decide with that in mind. I would suggest you look at what some of the other triple negatives like Carla, Edi, Morwena and Adagio have had as their chemo regimens to help with any decisions that you make. Take good care, hope you found yourself an eclair and that you got crumbs and chocolate all over the bed - sending hugs",

Thanks for sharing the great picture of Maria Nihahi - I also have been wondering what it must be like for Liefie to be in SA at this time, I also have a co-worker who was there, she will be back for work Monday Morwenna - now I can't get 'six white boomers' out of my head :) Caitlin - hope those keys stop being so elusive I am so happy to finally be in off the roads here, they are skating rinks in many places. I was rear ended when I was driving home from the support group today - the guy was texting - got caught in slow bumper to bumper traffic there and back and then was driving my 18 yo DS around this afternoon. I don't plan to drive anywhere tomorrow! Dakota - another busy sports weekend? Take care everyone",

This time they took me right to the room with the machine they use for greater magnification, so I didn't have to go through the multiple sets of more pictures that was my experience the last two times. The tech has been there awhile, she had the radiologist look right away - radiologist says no change to the microcalcifications since June. On the side the tech said  'I am no good at hiding what I am thinking  or feeling - you didn't hear it from me but I think you would be wise to have the mastectomy your GP is advising for the left side'.  I will wait for results of genetic testing and also my discussion with the plastic surgeon who will do my reconstruction - apparently he has the longest waiting list in the city which is why I haven't heard anything yet. If I have reconstruction on the right, then I would do the left mastectomy with immediate reconstruction at the same time and be done with all of this.  Cici566 - I also am HER2 positive and it sounds as if our diagnosis is similar, I had 2 cm IDC and 7+ cm of DCIS with two lymph nodes positive for macro-metastases on the right side. I had a right mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection June 29, 2012 followed by chemo, radiation and a year of Herceptin. I finished the Herceptin in October of 2013. It is a long haul but it is do-able, one day at a time.

Momof2 - hope you have a very enjoyable vacation in Georgia, glad you could have this time on the coast. Hope that September goes by very non-eventfully for you. We are off on vacation for two weeks starting Saturday. We had a wedding last weekend that we attended and another one this weekend on Sunday - it is in a smaller town north of us. Following that we head west to BC and then down to NW Washington with my oldest son and family for a week, then I'll have some time at home to catch up with some people, including some ladies from this thread - very much looking forward to it.  Re: my ankle - it is not healing well, so I am back in a splint and asked to rest, ice, elevate - very frustrating. I'm told that if when I return from vacation there has been no improvement then they will do some more imaging and go from there - hopefully that won't mean surgery. I saw my breast surgeon yesterday re: prophylactic mastectomy left side when I have the DIEP on right and he is happy to do that so his office is contacting my PS office to coordinate. A little scary as more things are put into place for the reconstruction.  I saw the genetics clinic today and, as expected, the BRCA 1 and 2 was negative, now I am booked to see the geneticist in September re: investigation for Cowden's/Lynch syndrome - seems like a long process but getting there.  I also saw the dentist last week and need a crown on a back tooth so that is booked for September 4th. Told my husband last night that I am tired of appointments - glad to be going away for a bit. Take care, everyone",

I decided to go in to the PT on Friday instead of waiting for my appointment on Monday. She wanted me to go and have it seen that day and my GP couldn't accommodate so I went to a walk in clinic. The doctor was good - he asked me if I had told my oncologist about the ankle. I said no and he said that I should - that kind of surprised me but I guess it makes sense. Anyway, he ordered an ultrasound and re X-ray of the ankle and foot and some labwork. I had that all done yesterday. Meanwhile I had seen my doctor at BCSCF on Tuesday and she wanted me to have a bone scan so that was booked for today. It has been an interesting couple of days.  At the ultrasound the tech asked me about my cancer. He took quite a bit of time and then also looked at the x-rays. He went and got the radiologist and they looked again at the lateral foot/ankle and first metatarsal area. As they were looking at something they turned to each other and said 'maybe that is why she is having pain'. When I was done the tech asked me if I had children and then said they were lucky. Then he asked me if I had a husband and when I said yes again, he said my husband was lucky. Then he told me to 'keep my spirits up'. All kind of weird. Today, for the bone scan they injected the tracer and took a scan of the feet right away, then sent me away for two hours. When I got back they did the full bone scan, then she came back and did more images of both hips. Following that she had a discussion with the radiologist and they did SPECT imaging of the ankles and feet. She consulted again with the radiologist who wanted more images and then she sent me out to the waiting room while she talked to him. After that she came and got me again and said the radiologist needed one more set of pictures and said it was a good thing that I took the afternoon off. Once those images were done they let me go.  I have no idea what they were seeing or what it means but it certainly wasn't the norm. Nice to be home but I am having trouble not consulting Dr. Google. I hope I find out something soon. Not going to worst case scenario but best case scenario in my mind was that I was just a wimp and that doesn't seem to be the case - I could still be proven wrong though.",

I know that you had Neupogen in the hospital and so that probably contributed to your bloodwork being OK at this point but because your counts dropped so much lt time they will give Neulasta, probably for each chemo from this point on. Hopefully this time you will have your anti-emetics straightened out and on hand and you will be prepared at the first sign of either diarrhea or constipation. Take this 'opportunity' to get prepared for next week, make those veggie dishes, soups, prepare something extra special for you and Benny and Diamond for Christmas, celebrate early with them so you can really enjoy the celebration. Print out all the encouraging posts and emails and keep them very close to read over when the going gets tough. Get outside this week, spend a reasonable amount of time with Diamond and at the farm (tell yourself that you will leave before you are exhausted and make sure you bring food and drink), go for some walks, spoil yourself, play your guitar, eat well, contact friends - do anything and everything that builds you up and makes you feel good. Then when you go for the chemo, visualize it killing any remaining cancer cells and making your remaining cells stronger, not weaker. Think of the reduced dose in the terms that you have also lost weight since the original dosages were determined, maybe at your new weight it is exactly the right dose for you. Sending healing hugs",

Mucositis is caused when chemotherapy attacks and kills the rapidly-dividing cells in your mucous membranes. This condition feels like sunburn (or heartburn) on your mucous tissues, and often leads to sores in your mouth or on your tongue. It is a common side effect of chemotherapy for breast cancer.' This means that things that might be scratchy on the lining of the digestive tract like a rice cake or cereal is probably not the best. Here are the recommendations from the site I got this information from - 'Drink 8 eight-ounce glasses of water daily. Purified or deionized water can reduce irritation, if you are feeling very raw. Drink sports drinks with electrolytes (Gatorade, Poweraid) to stay hydrated. Cut down on or avoid caffeine and alcohol (these dry your tissues). Eat soft comfort foods: ice cream, popsicles, milkshakes, smoothies, pudding, yogurt, gelatin, mashed potatoes, bananas, and applesauce (not spiced). Avoid food and drink that irritate tissues: citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, spicy or salty foods. Forget about hot peppers, curry, salsa, and raw ginger and onions, until you feel better. Avoid all forms of tobacco and nicotine, because these irritate raw tissues (such as mouth sores) and delay healing. Avoid foods and liquids that contain a lot of sugar. Use lip balm (not mentholated) for dry lips, and avoid breathing through your mouth. If you wear dentures, use them only for meals, to let your gums rest, and to reduce irritation. Use a soft toothbrush and floss gently, to avoid irritating your gums.' Let us know what how the saddle pad worked, glad you are able to get out today, I'm sitting waiting for my Herceptin infusion, quiet here today :)",

Our library made a new rule that parents had to stay in the room with their children during storytimes or other children's activities due to Kenny (age 3) looking out the window, seeing a car like ours and thinking my husband had driven away and left him there; he panicked and ran down three flights of stairs and out the door into traffic, screaming the whole time. Not a typical library scene and it didn't happen again, but part of the joy of story time for me used to be browsing the books alone while my boys were being occupied. We weren't popular with the other parents either! Off to see Mom and do a little shopping this afternoon; have a good day everyone.",

Even though overall survival did not change with radiation (my understanding is that includes death from any cause) the rate of recurrence was decreased. I would prefer not to have to go through treatment again in the case of recurrence and my understanding is that if there was a recurrence there was a greater possibility that there could be metastases with that recurrence. I decided to do all I could with initial treatment to prevent recurrence after reviewing the studies and I am currently going through radiation treatment, so far so good. The second RO also told me that it is now considered standard treatment for mastectomy with one to three positive nodes at our cancer facility.

Today was back to two Joes but there is absolutely no way I can compete with the young lady who seems to be either right before or after me this week. She did not have chemo and had lumpectomy, looks to be late 20's and an absolutely gorgeous blonde - hope the treatment does it's thing for her Liefie - love the visual of the energizer bunny getting ready - enjoy! Glad you will be able to keep up via Internet - if DH is Ok with it, otherwise you'll have to hide the laptop like Edi Dakota - hope the snow has stopped now, have a good weekend, you will start dreaming again soon <3 Jennie - sorry to hear about the upsetting RO visit, so difficult when doctors aren't really listening to your concerns, hope the PT works wonders and you are raising that arm high quickly Caitlin - your skin is your first line of defense against infection, chemo depletes your WBC and makes you more prone to infection; if also depletes platelets and red blood cells - anything that would break the skin or cause bruising/bleeding would not be a good idea while having chemo (my opinion) ;) Carlads - hope the side effects are improving for you Nihahi - hope your new strategy works, I won't mention about what ;) Beautiful day here isn't it, I was thinking of you as I drove to rads today, lots of snow to snowshoe or ski in and beautiful sun and warmth - hope you are able to get out and enjoy Wishing a good weekend to all Take care",

When I had my appointment the other day with the nurse practitioner and I was discussing my weight and frustration with taking off the chemo weight she was very understanding. She said that hormones definitely play a role and suggested that, even though I wasn't describing the present as well as past few months as 'stressful' that she felt they were and that cortisol is produced by our bodies in reaction to stress and acts much like the steroids we are given with chemo; increasing insulin levels and making our bodies want to store fat. She suggested that I think of things that I can do to help with relaxation as she felt my diet was good and that I was getting there exercise wise. Maybe more of the yoga and adding some relaxation/deep breathing exercises would be more effective than adding more exercise for you also? No matter what, please do not feel that you don't want to be on here, we share everything here - the good and the bad. Nihahi - sorry to hear about your back; hope it improves over the weekend; remember that what doesn't get done before surgery isn't the end of the world.

I saw our back garage light on and door open and without thinking went out back to check it out. Turns out one of my husband's friends was there and doing some work for us. That is when I realized I had nothing on my head. I came back later with my wig on and offered him some pie. He looked at me, winked and told me he kind of liked the other look better. Edi - I remember how rads got by about this time. It seemed that I could either end through the posts on her or I could post but I had trouble doing both. Sending hugs. Rest this weekend. Liefie - hope the sun shines a bit while you are there. I'm glad you found Antonio, sounds like he did a great job. You must be looking and feeling really good this evening. Enjoy!

Good for you. And yes, hard for our MIL's, mine had BC about 15 years ago so this is her second run in with cancer. She has an incredible attitude and I am enjoying this time with her Nihahi - hope the healing is going well, we'll be telling you to try not to scratch in no time. Liefie - so good about your friend and the 'show and tell', would she be able to have the same surgeon? Hope DH is feeling better Dakota - I'm afraid that I am cheering for Chicago as my DIL has picked them from the start of the playoffs, I feel I have to be loyal ;) Benny - I sure hope you can find those unreleased John Denver songs, could make you some money also. The other night on a PBS station from Detroit they had John Denver concert on, I could have pigeon sat for you ;) My 18 year old has started exams this week, he had one at 0900 this a.m. so I drove him to and from, then took my Mom for a haircut and set this afternoon. She was a little concerned to go to a salon she wasn't familiar with but I think she was pretty happy with the results. It was my first time in a hair salon since August, the hairdresser was a little confused at first when she came to introduce herself as I sure don't look like I need a haircut yet, Herceptin seems to keep growth slow for some, I seem to be one of them. Tomorrow I'm going to a special demo at one of the hospitals with some of my co-workers in the morning. It's been a busy week. My back complains but I try not to let it stop me.

      "Content": "Jun 27, 2013 08:09PM - edited Jun 28, 2013 12:46AM by websister Hi everyone I am so sorry I didn't get back to you about our new granddaughter until now. It has been very busy lately. I'll try not to write a novel ;) Traffic since the flooding has not been wonderful here so it has been a bit of a challenge to get around and today one of the railway bridges started to give way under a train carrying volatile materials so that made traffic even more challenging most of today. I had an I an unscheduled tour of the flooded areas downtown on Tuesday. I had neglected to check the road report, I had taken some food to a friend in the NW part of the city and, by habit, started to take my usual route home. The lights at the intersection where I usually turn to go east were not working, the road to the east was closed and a policeman was directing traffic and waved me over the bridge and into the downtown area. It was bumper to bumper traffic and a few lanes of it and I was in the wrong lane to get out the best way I knew. I found myself driving around and getting stopped at various places by road closures. Finally another policeman helped me by directing me towards one of the few routes out o the south of the city, which is where I live. It was still very slow going and right through the cleanup efforts. So much damage, so many incredible people helping out. Anyway, back to grandbaby. They stayed at home until afternoon and then drove to the hospital, parking a ways away and walking there, then taking the stairs to the maternity floor. That seemed to speed things up for them. At three she was 4 cm, at 4 she was 7 cm and by about 6 pm fully dilated and ready to push. Paisley Adeline was born at 6:24 pm with a full head of very dark hair, 7 lbs 5 oz and 19 1/4 inches long. We stayed until about 10, by the time we got home I was just too tired and achy to go on line. This a.m. I had a meeting at the children's hospital on the other side of town and with the news of the train derailment/bridge on the radio headed out early in order to try to make it there on time. I did make the meeting, in the parking lot there was a man being gentlemanly behind me on the stairs up to go to the hospital. I waved him ahead of me, telling him it was going to take me a bit - Benny/Liefie/Edi - you are not alone in this area. The meeting concerned me a bit as I am gearing up to go back to work and it seemed that the managers etc in the meeting were under the impression that, with my return, I would be working with them to help solve many of their problems - pressure!!! How good to go and visit with DS and DIL and hold Paisley then! Puts everything in perspective as to what is really important in life. After visiting there, I got some supplies my Mom needed and drove out to see her with here laundry. I have to confess that when I got home I was too tired to do anything but grab the nearest junk food and now here I am. Paisley and her parents are doing well and they hope to discharge Mom and babe tomorrow, they just want to make sure she is nursing well first. I will read up on how to post pictures and see if I can't get a few on her before the weekend is over. Edi - thanks for the picture of the baby girl :)",

Life can change so suddenly Caitlin - hope MIL has an uneventful recovery and DH gives a little advance notice when he decides it's time to visit Trai - keep on top of that sinus headache, get more antibiotics if you think you will need them Liefie - your lake sounds wonderful, what a nice way to enjoy the long weekend. Yes, let the boys take turns driving the boat Nihahi - you asked what I was doing up so late. We had been over to my DS and DIL's place, they came home with baby from the hospital about 1 pm. She really wants to breastfeed and it seems to be going well so far but needs support. When two families are involved there are always things that were done differently and are considered the 'right way' by each family. DIL's parents bottle fed and, especially her father, really enjoyed that aspect of having a baby. He feels that she should bottle feed also, her mom is just a really anxious woman and everytime the baby squeaks she says 'Maybe she should try a bottle'. Hard on my DS who wants to support his wife but has his in-laws staying with them. Small apartment, very warm with all the people in the house, not a lot of places to get away from everybody. Since parents are in town her sister doesn't understand what it's like to have just had a baby and is planning shopping trips and suppers out. DS and DIL called and said 'We need you'. Went over and helped out/reassured re: breast feeding but want to tread lightly also, don't want to cause future family problems. My instincts were to 'rescue them' and bring them over to our house where it is much cooler, much more room to move around and get away if needed but know that DS will need to work this out for himself. His first responsibility is to protect and care for his wife and baby, after that it is to be a host. May need to stand up to in-laws, could see that there was stress being felt all around. Then couldn't sleep. :( It will all work out I know, just need to have wisdom in what I do/say. There, nice to have sisters to share that with :)",

Last year we had a resident porcupine who decided he like living under our deck and we had to watch when our son's dog came to stay with us. I have had some trouble with insomnia and it seemed that the tamoxifen made mine worse - Dr. Taylor at BCSCF prescribed Clonazepam 0.5 mg at bed time as needed. I don't use it every night but if I'm feeling really tired and know the next day I have important things to do I will take it and it works great for me. It doesn't make me feel groggy at all and I wake up in the morning feeling good. Until you updated on your activities I was also going to suggest you get your hemoglobin checked as it may take more work to get it back up post chemo/rads with your vegetarian/gluten free diet. Edi - hope Johnny Cash is a thing of the past and you are able to go to wedding and enjoy it Traii - good to hear from you again, hope that DS gets better quickly Movie - hope you are regaining your energy and that DD will come to know a new 'normal' without the pain she has lived with prior to surgery Liefie - sounds like you had a wonderful time in Vancouver and will be in better shape than ever in no time Dakota - getting ready for back to school with the kids? Hard to believe. Glad healing it going well Nihahi - I was in the chemo area late afternoon yesterday for my Herceptin. Should be getting easier but yesterday was hard for some reason, want to be so 'done' with all of this but still have to keep visiting them every three weeks. One person did ring the bell as they left, it did make me smile to know they were done that part. Can't wait for my last one on October 3rd. Hope you will have a restful weekend after your busy week of helping others Morwenna - almost there with rads. I remember well the constant changes to the times. Take good care of that skin. Wellspring has their new fall brochure out, there looks to be some good programs starting out. I attended the Healthy Steps workshop a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the instructor and the movements - there is a weekly Healthy Steps workout that can be registered to for fall. Everyone else, take good care and have a good weekend",

How exciting that DD had her first US and what a relief re: one, not twins. Now you can concentrate better on your shopping and crafting :) Nihahi - it must be so discouraging for those people and it seems that volunteer help is now dwindling. What a mess - in so many ways. I hope you slept well. MariaNL - good to hear from you again, have a wonderful time with your BFF and sister - we need those times. BTW pity parties are allowed here and they aren't reserved for just the surgery/chemo/rad period of time. I allowed myself a brief one yesterday when I was also exhausted and sore and wondered how I was ever going to get back to full time hours at work when I felt this way now working part-time. Over it now and will take one day at a time. Hello to everyone else and wishing all a good weekend",

I'm glad the instructor will modify the yoga for you Morwenna - you should be very proud of your hiking accomplishment at that point in rads - pretty amazing! And so happy to hear that piano will stay intact and funding is working out for DS Edi - so sorry to hear of your worry and so glad that all is well. I can understand why you would choose to avoid a confrontation with DH but I do hope he comes around and realizes how good it is and what it means to you Carla - any further news?

Honestly, I don't remember ever feeling so exhausted for so long as I have this summer, not after any of my surgeries or during chemo/rads. Goodnight, lovely ladies",

All I will add is that I found it very hard to concentrate at work, especially when they were making plans for weeks and months and I wasn't sure what my treatment was going to be yet. Once you have a firm treatment plan it will help. I was advised to stay off work after my mastectomy until all treatment was complete and I did this, but I did try to keep myself busy and away from Dr. Google. I am alike Liefie, I did not have a choice re: mastectomy due to previous lumpectomy (quandrantectomy in 2009) and extent of IDC/DCIS.

It does seem hopeful that they couldn't see anything on ultrasound, doesn't it? Morwenna - I also felt a big letdown from the BRA - day today. For everybody else - BRA stands for Breast Reconstruction Awareness - I think there were many of us who were there that were 'delayed reconstruction' and yet the focus seemed to be on immediate reconstruction, which was not a possibility in either Morwenna's or my circumstance, as well as probably many others who showed up for the presentation. They had a room for 'show and tell' and I was looking forward to seeing/talking to someone who had a DIEP or TRAM flap but all the volunteers in the room were one surgeons patients and all immediate reconstruction implants. Wonderful of them to volunteer but it would have been nice if the person organizing had arranged for all types of reconstructive surgery to be represented. There was a big contrast between the general surgeon's discussion with Morwenna vs the plastic surgeon's - the general surgeon did say that the plastic surgeon would have to be the one to help make the decision but he was rather discouraging, it would be disheartening. I think the worst moment for me was a video at the beginning of the presentation - one of the people on the film said that they wouldn't have been able to stand taking off a prosthesis and seeing it stare them in the face every night - a few of the volunteers with immediate reconstruction implants standing in the aisle beside us were laughing at that and yet that is our reality - not of our own choosing but out of necessity. Nihahi - re: my back - it is still sore, worse if I walk too much but I seem to be getting used to it - I was thinking more of my husband riding and me watching if we went out to the farm ;). Traii - so good to hear that DH's results were clear. So sweet that you have a new nephew - enjoy! Liefie/Adagio - I don't know if you are on Pinterest but I have found lots of ideas for Quiet Books on there - search 'Quiet Books' if you do use Pinterest. Now I need to narrow down what kind of pages I want in each - for the oldest grandson I think I will go with roads/cars/construction machine type theme, not sure about the other two yet. Past time that I should be in bed - Benny - thinking/hoping that you took something to help you sleep tonight and that Benny is cuddling in nice and close to bring comfort to you.

I couldn't see any damage on my car whatsoever and it was so cold that I let it go Marianelizabeth and Bearcub - good to hear from both of you I had a call from my insurance caseworker on Thursday. Not sure what to think. Because I am still not back to work full time and it has been over three months my case was referred to a rehab specialist. That person reviewed my file with my caseworker and declined the referral - she said she can't see anything else I could be doing to improve my stamina - they have created a new return to work schedule for me for the new year, I will continue to work half days with one day a week off, they hope I will progress to one full day a week by end of February - I was a little shocked by that, hoping it won't take that long, but they also suggested I might need to consider staying part time. My caseworker told me to try to have a restful Christmas and suggested a holiday in February. Not sure about your fatigue, Edi - the fatigue I feel is not constant but hits suddenly - I usually start my day feeling fairly energetic but by about 1:30 I suddenly feel nauseated and very tired. I've been more forgetful of words, names etc., I've also fallen a couple of times in the last couple of weeks, one was in the washroom when I lost my balance and couldn't regain it; also missing my cup twice last week when I was pouring coffee - you know where my mind goes with all of that. Anyway - I have had a pretty good weekend, I feel like I am making progress towards Christmas preparations, a very nice feeling Take care everyone",

They were moving offices mid-January but finally got them last week. Turns out the referral did not seem to get there, they had no record of me! :(  I think the receptionist could tell how stunned I was - and disappointed. She told me that if I had them re-send the referral, she would put it in the queue for the date it was originally sent. I was on the phone right after that to get my referral re-sent - they had it on record and were happy to send again for me - wrote on it 're-send' and that it was to be queued according to the original June 12th date that it was sent.

Once a plan is in place regarding treatment it helps. Breastcancer.org is a great place to find support and others who are or have gone through the same things you are going through. Take one step at a time, don't look too far into the future and get lots of support. Wishing you all the best and please feel free to come back to this thread and read posts from our breast cancer journies, there are also pictures, including one from our lunch last week. Benny is on the far left in that picture, I am far right. I hope you are inspired. Take good care",

The other ladies have given you good advice, I hope your treatment is going well. Please feel welcome to come here for support and any questions you may have. Mo - re: ankle. Friday was a frustrating day for me so I kind of put it aside so I could get better perspective. My recap - early Friday a.m. I received a phone call from a clerk at the walk-in clinic I went to. She said WCB had approved an MRI and she wanted to give me my appt date - wait for it - Feb. 5th!!! Not sure if the Dr. Is aware of the date but ...  Decided not to do anything in that area until after GP appt. She had the bone scan and printed it for me but she didn't have the ultrasound or x-rays. As the annual physical progressed she realized her records weren't up to date on a lot of areas so was fairly focused on that. She was very concerned that my vitiligo (autoimmune skin condition - pigment dies) had really taken off this summer and she wants to check out thyroid and rheumatoid arthritis once results are all gathered and she identifies what she needs to order (my Mom had RA and hyperthyroid). By end of visit she asked if I would make another appt to address ankle/foot as we hadn't had enough time to address in that appointment. I agreed - next available appt for her was Sept. 22nd. Meanwhile I have been told to use RICE - ready to scream if I hear that suggestion again after 12 weeks of this!  Bone scan says no convincing evidence of bone mets - two new spots on spine that are probably arthrosis, left ankle had high uptake on lateral and medial malleolus but too homogenous to indicate fracture, first metatarsal had uptake he thinks is from stress fracture (compensation) and there was uptake between first and second metatarsal that he does not know what it is. Lower uptake to both knees and right thumb joint are considered arthrosis. He suggests the ankle uptake may be synovitis. Sorry for the rant, very tired of lack of progress and increasing difficulty getting around instead of it getting better.  See, haven't gotten there quite yet re: gaining perspective ;)",

We are planning to get together for tea when I get back from my son's. Just as I was going to head for the airport the hospital called and told us my Mom was in emergency after falling from her wheelchair early that morning. After all her hospitalizations in the last year and a half and having just finished rads I decided to get on the plane anyway. Since then I have heard that nothing is fractured, she spent a day in hospital and has now been placed back in the rehab facility until she is more mobile. I hope they assess her well before sending her back again, she has not managed to stay in a lodge for more than a month since her first fall in December 2011.

I remember getting ready for a trip when I was in my twenties and I was cleaning out an old purse I decided I wanted to take. There was an old, dried up piece of gum in the purse - I impulsively decided to pop it in my mouth and the next thing I knew I had broken my tooth. Went on the trip anyway and got it fixed afterwards but definitely not fun. Update re: back pain - the nurse called me back and said she had spoken to the oncologist - in the nurses words - 'while she doubts it is anything sinister she is going to work you up. When you come in for your Herceptin today they will do a urinalysis and bloodwork and she is booking you for a bone scan, we will call you with the appointment date and time'. So, I do feel 'heard' now and it takes away some of the worry as I know that I have set things in motion for investigation. Have a good day everyone",

Good for DH for making you go Traii - you continue to be in my thoughts. Hope you get results and date in the next couple of days Movie - you are such a good daughter. We had Mom here yesterday and she is getting worse. She was worried that we were leaving our youngest at home alone while we took her back to the lodge (he is 18). Then she asked if we thought she should get a car and start driving again. No!!!!!! Lots of signs that this past couple of years have taken a toll on her mind as well as her body. Hope things are going better re: your molar Dakota - hope you're enjoying your 'best mom' award, so sweet that you are also their hero. He's out there but maybe one thing at a time Edi - your GD will enjoy that playhouse so much. I've been trying to go through some things also, so interesting to rediscover things long forgotten. Liefie - you sound so organized for your surgery. Hope you heard from your children yesterday, you'll be seeing the boys very soon. I think you should get both chocolate and flowers from DH - don't settle for less ;) Maria - I remember the chemo fatigue, it can hit so suddenly. Glad you were able to get out and also that you napped when you needed to Carlads - looks like you had a wonderful 50th birthday celebration for your DH, hope you were spoiled yesterday and that you are dealing OK with the post treatment blues Scottie - thanks for sharing re: your experience with back pain and nausea. It does help. I am already taking D3 4,000 i.u. daily and Calcium/Magnesium supplements every night. the back pain is new for me since about 3 weeks ago. I was experiencing stiffness of my joints from the tamoxifen but after my last MO appointment I was given permission to start glucosamine, it wasn't instant but since then the stiffness of my joints is all but gone so I am very happy on that front, now just need to get ride of this other pain. I hope Toronto wins their hockey game tonight. Nihahi - thanks for sending those birds and the deer to the meadow, how wonderful to see the heron especially. Hate to think you are worrying about me and you are so sweet to offer help - I received a call this a.m. to tell me that my appt for bone scan was May 27th. I have to admit I wondered how I was going to get through to then and decided that I would contact my MO tomorrow when she was in clinic and see if I could get prescriptions for Tylenol 3 and Maxeran. I have my youngest's grade twelve grad ceremonies on May 22 a.m. and then banquet starts at 5 p.m. The next day I am supposed to be driving out to Fairmont with a good friend from work for a 4 day weekend retreat. Early this afternoon my MO called me to ask how I was doing. We talked for a bit and then she said she would phone in prescription, she is arranging to move up the bone scan date and is adding an ultrasound of liver/gallbladder. She was very nice and it was good to talk to her. Meanwhile pain is a constant but I am trying to distract myself. Take care everyone",

My thoughts are that scan was yesterday and I was told that MO would have results by Tuesday, 2 business days. The fact that she appears to have gotten them already today and asked them to arrange an appointment for me for next week is a concern for me. After the lab results were back, she called me and asked how I was, which is what led to the bone scan being moved up and the ultrasound added urgently. I would think that an oncologist would know the concern that would be generated getting a call with an appointment and no explanation and would not choose to do that unduly. If I was the oncologist and the results were good but I wanted to see the person and discuss 'what now' I would call them like she did this week and, first ask how they are, second tell them there was nothing to be concerned about on the scans and then tell them that I would like to bring them in for an appointment next week so I could examine them and discuss where we go from here. My rant. Can't do anything until Tuesday as it is a three day long weekend here. So, since I can't I will take the wise advice given and have a restfully glowy weekend, making sure I spend lots of time in the meadow looking up at that double rainbow.",

Caitlin - sounds like you are doing well with rads so far, play it by ear and of you find you are getting tired or too sore to work the full day you have that option. Thanks for the comments re: my son's grad and my MIL's surprise birthday party. With my MiL her surgery would have been what they call a complete pelvic exenteration. This would mean colostomy, urostomy, removal of bladder/anus/rectum/vulva/vagina/cervix in addition to uterus and ovaries. Quite a lot to deal with for someone her age and no guarantees. She has really enjoyed herself since her diagnosis, not taking anything for granted and visiting with and being visited by many friends and family, just recently she is starting to get more pressure on nerves from the tumor causing pain and problems with numbness to legs/feet. Went into work for about 3 hours this a.m. and then did some gardening this afternoon. Nice day Take care everyone",

It is incredible to see the damage, very difficult to comprehend the magnitude of loss and total impact at this time. It will take a long time and many people to accomplish all the rebuilding/starting over that needs to be done. Very thankful myself that we had no damage and grandbaby has been obedient and stayed put for now. Always in awe of and touched by how people rally in times like this to help each other out. The sun is shining brightly this a.m. which almost makes it all seem somewhat surreal. Wishing all a good weekend",

I sent in my thoughts on the BRA -day yesterday and here is a portion of the response I received back - 'I was forwarded your thoughtful and constructive comments about BRAday by the Willow Foundation. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to formulate and write your critiques. You have very valid points in a number of areas, but most especially, at least to my mind, are your criticisms of the show and tell area. I absolutely agree with you that we need to do a better job next year of having a more diverse representation of reconstructive options. Unfortunately we got no TRAM volunteers when we put the call out. I have full intentions of actively seeking out some TRAM women for next year's event. This year we were still at the bottom of the learning curve and we are much wiser now thanks to our experience at the event and to thoughtful people like you who have pointed out weaknesses. Who knows, you might have been through your surgery by next year and could be one of our show and tell hosts!' Nihahi - I responded and told her that I could provide contact information on a local 'DIEP woman' if she would like for next year's presentation.",

I have another mammo booked for January due to an 8 mm cluster of microcalcifications seen on June mammo, my GP is pushing for mastectomy on that side also, I've had a previous lumpectomy that side already that was atypical ductal hyperplasia. I will wait until after this next mammo, if there is a change in the calcifications for the worse, I may consider the mastectomy. It is hard to have the continual scares. Edi - sounds like a nice relaxing day, I'd take Nihahi's offer of some of her km's ;) Liefie and Movie - your weekend together with your DH's sounds wonderful I am staying close to home today to try to get some more paperwork things sorted out before my work week. We had GD and her parents here yesterday as well as some other friends with their 11 month old GS. Really nice visit - GD is rolling herself over and pushing up on her elbows, also laughing and doing lots of vocalizing. The 11 month old was quite intrigued with her. Greetings to everyone else, staying in pockets of all having procedures in the next few weeks. Tomorrow is another MUGA scan for me first thing in a.m., still working on trying to get 'de-ported', they don't seem to be in any hurry Take care",

Hope all the bears are snug in the beds We are supposed to get lots of snow this weekend so it sounds like a good one to stay in and do some sewing. As Morwenna said, the Recovery group session was quite grueling. The topic was loss and grief, we had reading and homework prior to the session and then sharing within the session. After that I had my genetics appointment. It was one and a half hours long. Very tiring again, but possibly very beneficial. I will be tested for BRCA 1 and 2 which I don't anticipate to show as positive for. She was very interested in my physical history and family though in relation to another syndrome. This syndrome isn't tested for here though so they would need to get out of province approval to go forward, part of that approval process would be to rule out the BRCA 1/2. Exhausted once home, not much good for anything last evening. Looking forward to a productive day today. Take care everyone!",

It did really shake me, I enjoyed so much messaging with her on Facebook, she was great to check in and encourage, funny how you can get so close to someone that you have never met in person. Edi - thanks for sharing the information from her daughter and for the picture - she truly was beautiful. Morwenna - have you got over your jet lag yet? Looks and sounds like a wonderful trip, so glad you were able to do that Liefie - DS should be in possession of that temporary passport by today, not a moment too soon. So happy that you are able to go sooner and spend more time with your sisters and mother. I hope that you being there spurs some memory, that would be so nice for you both. Momof2 - hope healing is continuing well for you, hope you have been able to get back to your sewing a little Movie - love hearing from you Dakota - you never stop :) Take good care of those children and yourself Traii - hope you are busy and happy - the weather there should be getting summery? Benny - my mechanic knows a thing or two about furnaces and plumbing - have you thought about calling the mechanic? ;) Love your sense of humor At work we just spent the week supporting an update of an application of software our team is responsible for, we are doing it one or two clinical areas at a time - should get easier but this was the first. I was 'command centre captain' which sounds impressive but I think it was their way of keeping me out of trouble ;) I received and documented the issues, sometimes problem solved them myself, sometimes triaged to the appropriate person. I enjoyed it but I was glad to leave after the morning as it was tiring. Today we are ramping down the support and all seems well. You may be right, Nihani - maybe going back full time is not what I should be aiming for. The genetic counsellor I saw has been in touch a couple of times since my appointment with more info on the syndrome she feels I have. It has also caused a lot of thinking - if I do have it I had an 85% lifetime chance of getting breast cancer, there are other cancers I will need to be screened regularly for and I need to seriously consider prophylactic mastectomy on my left side as I guess I have a 25 - 50% chance of a new cancer occurring on that side - with the changes they are watching it seems possible. I had almost made up my mind not to have reconstruction but now that this choice may be in front of me I may do it all at the same time. Lots to think about. Love you all! Take care everybody",

Not to influence you but to share my experience - back when my sister was dying from cancer she wanted to be at home. I told her I would look after her there. The last two months were particularly taxing on me physically and emotionally. I was getting up every two hours at night and turning/changing her, doing skin care, etc. She would ask me to stay and just talk to her, she was lonely and wanted company. There were many times I was just too exhausted to do that and the physical care. If I had to do it over again, I would have either done hospice or arranged for someone else to do the care so I could have been more present for her. Again, just sharing an experience.  Momof2 - beautiful setting, gorgeous bride - you must be so proud. Love the bracelet, so glad that she did end up appreciating all your incredible work. I would love to visit you on the Oregon Coast - I hope we can make something happen - do you have room for all of us at the same time?  Edi - so happy for you with Headstrong and your biking, you are doing fantastic work! I received an outdoors bike for Christmas and our weather is finally nice enough to get out on the bike paths :) The treadmill was getting a little boring.  Liefie - my thoughts have been with you, I'm wondering if you are still in South Africa? Dakota - your son is getting so big, he made a very handsome birthday boy on Facebook! Trai - not sure if you still visit here but I also enjoy the pictures of your little guy Sal - you sound like you are doing amazing, glad your surgery is over and had such good results - you will be very happy to have the drains out. As long as you are good with your decision that is what counts.  Morwenna - add yourself to that amazing women out there group! We got back late last night from Mexico, it was a wonderful trip, very relaxing - my husband wanted to show me some of the little towns he had driven through on the race he was in and meet some of the people. I was a little fearful to do that with him, but after breast cancer treatment decided I could do that also. I'm glad I did. We were served incredible fresh food and treated very kindly in addition to some amazing scenery. When we left the hotel I was very touched by one of the ladies who worked there running out to our rental car and asking for a hug before we left. She promised she would teach me more Spanish next time we came - I think we might have to take her up on that!  Today was unpacking and groceries, tomorrow I have to tackle the gardening, Sunday we will see P and parents and Monday it's back to work for me. Take care everyone",

Nihahi - enjoyed your photos Edi - smiling at imagining you owning your mentorship role with Headstrong I saw my PS at long last today. We talked for a bit. I have the area on the left breast that they are watching, next mammogram June 9th. He says I don't have enough abdominal fat for two breasts but is advising left mastectomy with immediate implant and flap reconstruction of the right breast (which I believe is the DIEP). I was thinking he would tell me my surgery wouldn't be for a year or year and a half but he tells me that it will be in four to six months unless I need the mastectomy sooner. He has asked me to make an appointment with my breast surgeon to advise and then they would work together on the date. Wow! Feeling like you, Morwenna - gulp! Am I ready for this?  Hi to everyone else, busy work week, hit the fatigue wall yesterday by noon. It was so nice not to feel the fatigue when I was on vacation, thought maybe I had mastered it but it found me again.  Take care everyone ",

Really needed it today - too close in dates to two years ago - mammogram, ultrasound, biopsy. I had the mammogram, they did a digital as well as two high magnification views on the left, then asked me to go back to the dressing area and wait. Then they came and took me over to the ultrasound waiting area and asked me to bring my clothes with me. Hadn't expected an ultrasound today and didn't realize just how traumatic it all was for me two years ago until they decided to do one today. The feelings all came back ten times over! They did the right chest wall and axilla and the left breast and axilla. When the U/S was done the tech told me the radiologist would be in touch with my doctor and let me go. Not sure I really breathed until then. So glad to be out of there. So glad you were all with me. Morwenna, please pass the peanuts ;) Take care everyone",

This time the area of Barrett's had changed from 4 cm three years ago to 8 cm. They do several biopsies. I was told results would take about 1 1/2 weeks so still some waiting time but not losing any sleep over it.  It has been hot here, this evening it is raining so a nice break.

Maybe I'll ask her next appointment. I've been busy with my Mom's move from hospital to long term care facility, she is being moved today after spending the last 4 + months in hospital. She is very anxious about the move. My husband, youngest son and I took some things over last evening and the place is beautiful. Hopefully she will settle in well. I am having the muscle aches today that seem to happen with Taxotere, especially in the thigh muscles but I'm doing better with the GI upset. Take care, everyone.",

My uncle died on Tuesday, he is my mother's brother. I had to break the news to her, it was difficult for her as they lived in the same lodge previous to her latest move and were quite close. I am still getting at least one call a day from the lodge, sometimes more about my Mom and questions related to her care. I am also finding myself more tired and achy with the cumulative effects of chemo, #6 is scheduled for Tuesday if bloodwork OK on Monday. Another friend with BC was also hospitalized last weekend for serious infection post chemo 4 and a young girl in her twenties contacted me last evening following a suicide attempt, asking for help. Kind of sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it? My husband and I went out to visit my Mom this afternoon, after our visit I received a phone call saying that Mom had fallen on her right hip when they were getting her up to go for supper, they wanted to know if I was able to come back and take her for an x-ray of the hip. I was alone as my husband had taken my youngest son to hockey so I told them that they would need to call EMS to do this. Now I wait to hear if it is broken, hopefully not. I'm glad you are feeling better today Edi and I am liking the wig Benny, glad your friend was able to pick it up for you and hope you were able to get out and find some nice scarves today for your cowboy hat look, you will rock it. To everyone else, I've enjoyed catching up on your posts this evening. Take care",

Make sure you keep on top of constipation with that clearlax - codeine as well as the anti-nausea all contribute. Take those deep breaths as Nihahi advised. We're all here for you.

Take one step at a time. As others have said DCIS is not invasive, it would be considered stage 0, your mother may have been a different stage, your grandmother definitely was so you can't go by their experiences. From what I can tell from what you wrote the excisional biopsy sounds like the equivalent of a lumpectomy. Your oncologist will discuss with you whether you require any further treatment. As far as I know it is not standard practice to give chemo or Herceptin to someone with DCIS and no IDC component, although this may have changed in recent years. I am also HER2 positive, if you find you need further info re: Herceptin those of us receiving it can help your with that. Take those deep breaths, try to keep yourself otherwise occupied while you wait for the appointment with the oncologist and know that we are here for you at every step. Take care",

I haven't heard from her since but I'm thinking that her phone battery may have run out of charge since her last text. The doctor told her if she had waited any longer to go to the hospital that she would have ended up in ICU. Edi - hugs - it is hard to stay positive when all these things keep coming up and interfering with chemo. I hope it all gets straightened around soon for you. Liefie - it was great to hear about your weekend, the purse sounds lovely, what a great deal and your 55 year old friend is very inspiring.

Nice moment :) Mom is doing quite well postop, they are going to try to get her up to walk today, I'm not sure how that will go as she isn't able to support much weight on the left hip following fracturing it. It will show thought whether she needs to be placed in a rehab center for a while and possible need for reassessment re: where she was placed for care facility. So far, not too bad for side effects - Traii - started getting the sore feet yesterday, feels like a burn Benny - c. diff usually presents as severe diarrhea, often with blood in it. Hope that you show clear for it. Keep up those fluids and foods to keep your blood sugar up. Did you ask about the Claritin pre: Neulasta?

Don't worry that the Neulasta is not working, if you don't have symptoms, be thankful. If you have taken you allowed dose of anti-reflux you could try Tums or Rolaids, don't stop eating and drinking. Keeping your head raised even while sleeping can be helpful also. I found heartburn worse after I started the Neulasta shots. I know it's hard not to, but worrying doesn't help re: digestion. Sending hugs, read over some old posts, drink lots of fluids and do something to distract yourself. Thanks for the well wishes for our time in BC. Take care",

Also wondering if the carrot soup is spicy - ie ginger? That can irritate the mucositis. Codeine itself on an empty stomach can irritate the stomach lining for many people, make sure you are taking it with something like crackers/potatoes. Forgot it was only 2 weeks, seemed like three to me :). I have my Herceptin infusion tomorrow which is why I was asking, thought maybe we might have a similar time. Sending hugs, hope some of my advice helps.",

Peripheral neuropathy is usually numbness and tingling in the fingers or toes, but can also be experienced as burning or pain. If the motor nerves are impacted it can cause balance problems or muscle weakness or cramping. Benny/Edi - kefir is kind of like yogurt or buttermilk - here is a link to some information on probiotics and kefir - www.naturalnews.com/024477_kef... Benny - glad you are getting out and enjoying this milder weather we are having, so glad the side effects are easing and you are getting some quality days prior to next chemo Bearcub - happy to hear of your radiation experience so far, will find out for sure if it's for me on the 14th I'm doing OK post Herceptin - feel like I have a head cold, maybe it's not the Herceptin ;)",

You will see that stages 1, 2 and 3 all identify incidences where no tumor is found but there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes Re: node removal - I understand your concern, I had 27 nodes removed, my right arm is still not completely comfortable. I know I am still fairly early but so far so good as far as movement, I work out and do stretches for the arm, I don't tend to limit my lifting too much on that side, basically because I forget.

Re: vein irritation - sometimes warm, moist heat for 15 to 20 minutes at a time can help - we used to soak and then wring out towels in hot water (make sure not to hot), wrap it around the arm and then wrap a plastic backed blue pad around, at home you could use plastic bag. Make sure it is not so hot that you are uncomfortable, you don't want to cause tissue damage to the skin. If it doesn't seem to be getting better or seems to be getting worse have it looked at or at least call about it. Be careful with massage right over the vein. Take care everyone",

I hope I didn't overly influence her decision at the time. Benny - I like your list of positives, I hope you have already called to speak with the MO re: sucralfate this a.m. and also to discuss with your own MO what is going on. Let me know if you need my help. I noticed I have a bruise on my thigh in the last two days that also looks like someone hit with me a lead pipe, can't remember bumping it but must have. I am trying to figure out when the best time to take my tamoxifen is in order to best manage the side effects and haven't got that figured out yet. Experiencing more frequent and severe hot flashes, nausea and some dizziness/tiredness with it. For the first few days took it at noon, but thought I'd try it at bedtime yesterday to see if it would be better. No. Nauseated this a.m., didn't sleep much last night - I will try at bedtime once again this evening and then if tomorrow a.m. is still the same I'll try mornings the next day. I'm so glad that I don't have to worry about trying to deal with the side effects in addition to trying to get back to work, it should all be settled out by then. Mom is doing well, I plan to see her this evening, her wash is in the machine as I type. Take care everyone",

Good for you for the yoga and strength training :). Mom is mom, she seems to be adjusting OK but doesn't socialize with the other residents much then tells me she's lonely.

Benny - that was so sweet of you to offer your car, I was really tempted when I read that it was a sports car. Fortunately the insurance company has waived the deductible as it wasn't my fault and they are supplying the rental car, my husband got a call from the rental company this afternoon. It all seems to be falling into place quite well. The oatmeal I used was steel cut, Costco has a nice big 5 kg box for 9.99. It takes longer to cook but it has more protein. I add apples to the water and then when water boils add the oatmeal and a little cinnamon and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring fairly frequently.

He was young and had a binder that had all my information in it. What nobody told me was that not only were the CT scan pictures in there that they used for mapping but there were also pictures of me lying on the table, with bare chest, arms over head, hands holding onto handles above head. My face was scribbled over with black permanent ink but it was a little unnerving to see the pictures and know that other eyes besides the techs who took them had been upon them. Hope they are destroyed soon! The educator redeemed himself by asking if the picture on my iPad was of my daughter - it was a pic of my 6 year old GD. He did a double take of my birthdate and then said he would never have known. You could have done anything to me after that statement and I would still have been smiling :) Take care everyone.",

It provides access into the vein but they still need to use a special needle to access it. The port is usually placed just under your collarbone, mine is on my right side of my chest, sometimes they put them in the upper arm though. There are usually bumps on the port that help the nurse to feel where to insert the needle. My port is quite prominent and the nurses have never had trouble accessing it but I have seen them struggle with some other patients if it is deeper into the subcutaneous tissue or if it flipped. The first few times they accessed mine it stung but now I don't seem to notice it much. You can use a cream like Emla cream over the port prior to your treatment to help with that.",

Maybe we can have a raft convoy ;) Lots of towns around here declaring states of emergency. Fortunately our roof leak stopped so we are dry and did not have to sleep to the drip-drip of the water into the pail we put under it. We'll have to check it out up there this weekend, just had our roof done about two years ago after hail damage. Managed to get my son to his Biology exam on time and get a calculator to him (he forgot he would need one). Having a cup of coffee now and relaxing for a bit, think I'll head over to the other side of the city early this afternoon for Herceptin so I don't have to do the same traffic maneuvers as I did this a.m. Dakota - that is so sweet that DS is so excited, I also remember when Calgary won the cup and then again the second time they went to the finals. Great fun! The jersey story is cute too, I won't tell anyone ;) Hope the weather is better elsewhere and everyone has a good day/evening/night",

Happy to hear that you were able to help those people out and glad to hear you weren't affected by the flood either. Rest that arm up, I hear you about the aches and pains, chemo and hormone therapy plus less activity during treatment does a number on our bodies Today has gone well so far. Yes, Liefie, this is this son's first baby. They took her to the clinic this a.m. for a quick check and they are pleased. She has regained her birthweight and is nursing well. They came here after that and it was very relaxing. Our house does stay fairly cool and I had a room set up for them with a fan, etc. for nursing or resting. Our backyard faces east so by afternoon the deck is in the shade and a very nice place to hangout. I also got some hammock time in with Paisley on my chest sleeping. After spending that time with us, they went back to their place and planned to bring her parents and sister back here with them for supper however I don't think this was something her family wanted so they are now going to stay at the apartment and her sister is making supper. I have made our place available to them anytime, night or day, and they are grateful for that.",

This was the same tech who has always done my MUGA's and bone scans, no trouble before. Yesterday had to be poked four times before she had success. Went in for my first official 'day' of work after (4hours) and when I got home it was definitely nap time.

So glad the visit with DD and SIL went well Nihahi - beautiful day here, almost set record temperature! Oh, how I need to make an appointment for that massage. Beautiful pictures Caitlin - belated happy birthday to you, looks like Canada is treating you well Today was our 31st anniversary - last year I spent the day having chemo and then counteracting the side effects. Nice to go out this evening for a special dinner :) I am really having a time with fatigue, I am supposed to be increasing my hours at work as per the insurance company but can't seem to do it. Even having days off and the long weekend don't seem to be helping in restoring my energy. It is frustrating for me - so glad I have an understanding manager and can work from home some of the time. I am trying to keep up here but not always posting Love u all <3",

Traii - so good to hear from you and that you are feeling like you are getting back to normal. Your hair sounds wonderful! Glad to hear you are safe from fires, it does sound awful for those impacted. Dakota - I think you should join the get together - absolutely! Edi - your DH sounds like he is starting to enjoy his retirement! Glad to her your hip is doing better Nihahi - thinking of you, by my time you have five minutes left and you can go home - very long day for you Liefie - I think you are probably a better sewer than you are giving yourself credit for, hope all goes well with it. I think you were wise to stay home from yogalates! Sounds like lots of work with those plants Benny/Morwenna/Nihahi - I will try to get to the meet up, I am back to work and have a big meeting on Thursday morning that I have to prepare some documents for. I have set tomorrow apart in my schedule to prepare the documentation. If it goes well tomorrow a.m., I might be able to get it all done and then come over and meet with you. Benny - do you still have the same cell phone number? I could text you about noon and give you an update on how it is looking for me. I had the MUGA this a.m., thanks for the pocket party, you are quite the rowdy crowd, I wasn't told any results but I'm sure the MO will have them soon and no news will be good news. Went to work afterwards and I am getting a little discouraged. Four hours in and I was really fatigued and trying to push through. Went to Costco after work, started supper and DH finished it, I was done! I am going to try to walk for 30 minutes now as it is supposed to help but so far, it doesn't seem to be having the desired effect. I know, be patient - right - but I am so tired of being tired Take care everyone",

Momof2 - In your pockets, just rest and float on that raft - and my fingers crossed also for negative nodes Ridley - that pumpkin spice muffin sounds good. Glad things are moving, albeit slowly.

It would be nice if it was just Costco, I'd probably save a lot of money if I had to stay away from there ;). The fatigue seems to hit anytime/anywhere - when it does I also seem to have more trouble with the chemo brain and forgetting words/names - not good with my job where I am leading meetings and needing to be on top of my game. Oh well. Adagio - my doctor is keeping me back at half day shifts for a while, hopefully that will do the trick. Next two weeks I will do 4 half days with Wednesdays off, then reassess on December 12th; she was non-committal when I suggested I might be ready for full time by the New Year. I did get a nice hug from Benny when I was there, she had an appointment also. After that, I got a few cuddles in with my granddaughter.

I had the privilege of having tea yesterday with a lady from another thread on this forum and we both agreed that the fatigue that we felt from rads seemed worse for us than the chemo fatigue. Know you are not alone and that as Nihahi said, you are safe to say how you are really feeling here. Sending gentle hugs also. Momof2 - beautiful photo and beautiful story of the agates, how wonderful that you thought to do that. Hope all goes well for you over the next few days, especially the Neulasta. I used the Claritin the day of the Neulasta and for 7 days after, with my MO's blessing and I do feel that it helped. Morwenna - glad you can breathe a sigh of relief over the gecko ;) Nihahi - I will have a look at next week's schedule and let you know what looks good for me for meeting Love to everyone, here's a picture of me meeting with my friend from the Canadian Connection and Survivors 2013 thread, I'm in the dark grey sweater.

Hard on poor DIL when the kids asked why they were back so soon yesterday! We drove home last afternoon/evening. We had a more than an hour delay where they were cleaning up an accident by Fernie - not good for a family from Alberta - the roads were quite icy/slushy on that stretch and they were trying to pass someone, they lost control of their vehicle and ended up upside down in the Elk River - Mom was killed, two children in serious condition now here in our children's hospital and Dad and another child with minor injuries. To make up for lost time my DH was driving quite fast the rest of the way home, not fun for me but we made it. Today I was lucky to be able to work from home, just feeling a little tired and a little blue. A cousin's husband was diagnosed with malignant brain tumor and is having radiation followed by chemo, a co-worker's husband was just diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer on Thursday, their family is reeling - she has two teenagers and their financial situation is not the best. One of the ladies from another thread I post on frequently passed away early last week - she was a wonderful person, we used to private message - she was diagnosed and had treatment about the same time period that I did, they found mets during the summer and it was widespread. Weather here not helping - it was really nasty out today. I need to try to contact Benny tomorrow - my husband was telling me of a customer of his who also had her horse die from colic recently - she was very surprised to have someone give her another young horse - Benny was sad that she could not afford another horse but it appears there are people out there who give horses away - wouldn't that be something for our Benny? Edi - as others said, the cake was beautiful, and you looked beautiful in the picture with your GD's, glad your birthday was a good one. Nihahi - so glad to hear that you had a wonderful GWA and made it home before this storm hit. Jackpot - so lucky to be on the same sides if the ocean as Edi - with her cakes and cooking and wonderful sense of humor Morwenna - hope you continue to keep away from Dr. Google, not good. I like Nihahi's advice. I know that I have not even come close to addressing all of you, know that I have read and enjoyed hearing from all of you - hugs to those that need them, welcome to the new people who have posted.

It was my GP that ordered the mammogram I just had as she wasn't happy waiting a year with the calcifications seen on last one. My MO said last time it was my role to report symptoms and her role to follow up if necessary, but now when I reported some issues with heart arrhythmia post treatment, she said 'that is concerning, you should get it followed up', seems side effects of treatment she is not concerned with, only looking for mets or recurrence. I do have a good GP, just disappointed with MO. Hope all are staying warm, I had some quality time with Paisley yesterday so all is good :)",

My left ventricular ejection fraction was 51% which was down from previous testing but is considered a 'normal' value - could possibly be a reason for some of the fatigue and shortness of breath. My bloodwork was beautiful as was my chest x-ray, passed the stress treadmill test and considered 'fit', oxygen saturation only 94% but low end of normal and pulse still around 100 at rest and they can't really explain that. They have suggested that I may be one of the one in six people who have cancer fatigue syndrome and there is not too much to be done abut that that I am not currently doing. So I will carry on. I have negotiated with work to continue part time hours and some cutting back on the number of projects I am involved in and it feels a little better to have done that. Have 20 minute naps when I get home from work and that helps me for the evening.  Spring is definitely in the air here also",

So many trees damaged by the snow, when driving it looks like a hurricane hit. I sure hope we return to some good weather again before we have to face more winter weather. I had my geneticist appointment on Wednesday. Funny to be a patient at the children's hospital here but that's where the genetics clinic is. The geneticist was not how I would have envisioned her. She was very attractive, youngish I.el late 30's or so). We reviewed my history and my family history on both sides and then she examined me. She will pursue the Cowden's testing and says that I should have results within three or four months but said I should contact them if I get a surgery date that is before then. They are also testing the tumor tissue from my Dad and paternal aunt for Lynch syndrome and if that turns out positive I will be tested for that also. So progress in that area. I am not so patiently waiting for my appointment with my GP re: left ankle and foot - it is not improving on it's own So nice to have a weekend again - I wish you all a good one  Take care",

It seems to do the trick for me but there are some people who say you have to have the ones that require refrigeration (expensive and not sure it's necessary). Greek yogurt would do dual purpose for you (no fruit, just honey yogurt) - if there is active culture it would help supply probiotics and it would supply more protein than regular yogurt.

The prawn jambalaya sounds wonderful, hope there was enough to share with me also ;) Traii - sorry to hear you had to wait so long for chemo, glad it's done. Love your avatar, you are cute ;) Dakota - I better start watching for stubble myself! The feet symptoms seem to happen with the taxanes. I do have to confess that I had a hard time understanding a lot of what Traii and Edi posted but then you started talking about your baby ties hurting, thinking maybe I may need a whole new dictionary for this thread ;) Benny - re: anything urgent - TBCC is the best resource at the moment. BCSCF make an appointment with you and a nurse calls and interviews you, they also obtain a copy of your medical record from oncologist to help them help you. The 'Eating for your Life' class at TBCC is being held next on January 16th at 10 a.m. The TBCC class on Breast Cancer - Special Food and Eating Issues starts in February, first one Friday February 8th at 1:30 p.m. Link to info and phone numbers for support and classes TBCC - www.albertahealthservices.ca/f... There is more information in the 'Patient Guide to Cancer Care' book they give at the orientation class. The number for the dietitian is in there - 403-521-3719 There is also a 'Fatigue Nurse' - 403-698-8104 and lots of other resources. Hope this is helpful. Hugs to all ((()))",

Diamond made you a very proud Mama :) Luvmygoats - that was me poking you in the ribs, sorry ;)",

This won't be long but I saw my oncologist this a.m., passed the MUGA scan so able to continue with the Herceptin infusions for another three months until the next scan. Hemoglobin was low, good to know that was why I have been short of breath and tired, she says that will probably take about three months to get back to normal. Mom is making good progress, I have a feeling they will send her back to her lodge either this week or next, I hope that's it for a bit, for both our sakes ;) Dakota - in your pockets on Thursday Carlads - glad you are doing well, please post pictures of your headshaving for us Benny - are you getting ready for Wednesday? Edi - I think we got your snow here today, now tomorrow it is supposed to go above zero so we will really need our windshield washer fluid Traii - hope you are able to go to your aunt's pool again to stay cool Bearcub - counting down those rads :) Liefie - glad you had some sunshine today, sounds like a wonderful way to spend your weekend and today Off to bed, supposed to take my tamoxifen for the first time this evening - not quite sure what to expect, the hot flashes in the night have already been pretty intense Take care everyone",

Your husband sounds a lot like mine, so nice of him to help out the neighbour with their car also. Enjoyed hearing of your GD's trip to London Luvmygoats - keep those goats warm and dry, I'm with you, I don't think I could throw hay bales around either Bearcub - woohoo!!!! Halfway. Back a few pages ago (this thread moves fast!!!) there was a story about hitting a moose. My oldest son was traveling with some friends after a snowboarding outing several years ago, it was dark and the roads were slippery. He says he heard the word 'Duck' (not sure if it means the same in all countries so here it means to 'get down'). He is a tall, big guy and this was a small Toyota but he managed to get under the dashboard just as the car hit an elk'. The elk's antlers came through the windshield right where my son had been sitting. The car was totaled but he was fine. The other three guys in the car said they hadn't told him to duck as they couldn't see the elk, didn't realize they were in danger. Liefie - when we were on the island there was a cougar warning in one of the provincial parks we hiked in, I was constantly looking in the trees and over my shoulder Dakota and Benny - in your pockets today. Benny, wow them with that rhinestone belt - might as well go all the way! Re: taxanes - as others said, I didn't have the gastrointestinal symptoms with them, if this is the main problem at the moment for you, you might just sail through treatment with one of them Carlads - hoping you are over any side effects you may have been having and have some good weeks before the next treatment Caitlin - thinking of you Bevlee - miss you Nihahi - today would be a great snowshoeing day, hope you are able to gets outside and enjoy it My son is in the final game for his division for Minor Hockey week here in Canada after winning last night's game - guaranteed at least a silver medal, next game on Saturday afternoon. My 10 1/2 month old grandson started walking yesterday, received a video of it, precious :) Favorite moment of yesterday was watching the magnificent sunset with my 17 year old, wonderful memory, we had a good day together yesterday Take care everyone",

Re: arm - it looks like you may have needed pressure on a little longer after they took the IV out, afterwards if you were using it or carrying anything heavy that could make it more swollen and bruised, platelets that help with clotting are also impacted by chemo. You may want to use an icepack with a towel against your skin for 15 - 20 minutes then be extra careful about too much activity or carrying anything heavy with that arm for the rest of the evening. Glad you have Heartland this evening, you also have us. One day at a time. Breathe. Nihahi posted those beautiful meadow pictures at just the right time. Go there for some refreshing this evening.",

I like that term 'Rock of Gibralter' I saw the second radiation oncologist this afternoon, she said that according to the guidelines used at our cancer center radiation therapy to the chest wall and to the regional lymph nodes is indicated for me and would be extra insurance. She spent a good amount of time reviewing results from recent studies. She kept referring to me as 'young' which I loved. My 'rock of Gibralter' and I are off tomorrow evening for two nights in the nearby town of Canmore (mountain getaway) courtesy of the people I work with, our weekend includes dinner on Saturday evening, two breakfasts, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and a tea service, as well as a generous gift card to spend on whatever. I am very much looking forward to it, we spent our 30th anniversary on September 4th in the chemo area, we will try make up for that this year. The board has been a little quiet today, I hope all are doing OK with side effects, etc. Hugs to all",
