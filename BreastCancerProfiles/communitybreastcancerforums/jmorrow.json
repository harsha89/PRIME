At first I thought maybe there was something else wrong with me but I guess its just a side effect from the chemo. I just keep telling myself that it could be worse. But it really hurts! Thanks again-Julie",

I start Paclitaxel(not sure if theres an abbreviation) Just going by the papers my onc gave me. I didnt seem to have any SE from the nulasta shot the day after. I read that some people have alot of pain. My diet pepsi and coffee taste terrible...mostly drinking water now. Milkshakes taste good too. I took some time off from work...not sure if thats a good thing or not really. But I work in a hot factory and thought a break might be a good thing til I get used to this. Itrs so nice to talk to people with the same issues. Thanks again!",
