Here I am 4 years later still having the same problem.  Why some people improve and others don't is a mystery.  I think antihistamines help me somewhat by stopping some of the watering.  I love eye makeup, but it is hard to wear with this problem.  I thought in the beginning it was due to losing lashes.  My eyes are still very sensitive to light and cold and breezes.  I am, however, angry that this side effect, which happens in 77percent of cases, was not disclosed to me at any time.  My doctor acted as if he never encountered it.  What a dunce!  I hope your problem goes away, as this is irritating and sounds minor, but makes your life miserable.",
