The 5 th one stung for just a second but the other 4 didn`t bother me at all. In pre-op they gave me something to relax me and that is the last thing I remember until waking up. The BS believes the lymph nodes are clear so was very happy to hear that. Got to my room about 5 and they tried to get me to eat dinner but I felt very nauseas. They applied a patch before surgery and gave me some medicine afterwords but it really surprised me because usually I have an iron stomach. I was finally able to eat a little something around 11:30. They did not take the catheter out until the next morning. Came home Saturday morning. I do bruise easily but the bruising looks awful. The bruising and the swelling are the worst. I can do more than I thought I'd be able to and I am more uncomfortable than in pain. The BS is a big fan of Motrin so I have been taking that along with an antibotic. My goal today is to poop and shower. The drains are the worst but knew that going in. Hoping each day brings more healing. Hugs ",

I have been lurking around on this forum for a few weeks now and have found it has been a source of great strength and comfort. I felt it was time to give back. I have kept myself busy getting everything ready for after surgery (making freezer meals, renting a lift chair (don't think I will be able to get in and out of the water bed for awhile), purchasing PJ's and button down tops, pre-op tests etc. I think I am now ready and the wait for surgery is taking for ever. I am very nervous (scared) but I am also just ready to have this part behind me. I like everyone else am worried about the final path report but realize \"it is what it is\" and I will get through it as will. SBKH - I would love to hear more on the cancer devotional you are doing. I have been flooding myself with affirmations and visualization and it has helped a lot.",

Usually my husband paces and makes me very nervous pre-op. When I had my colonoscopy last year I made him stay in the waiting room and would not let him come back before they wheeled me in.",

For everyone expecting results this week, I pray you all get the results you have been hoping for, but if not, I know you will handle the next challenge with determination and grace.. For those having surgery this week I pray for minimal pain, a speedy recovery and for peace to wash over you that you are now on the other side of surgery and the cancer is out and you are officially in remission. For those old timers that are now a few weeks out...Thank you for your invaluable information on what to expect. I pray you are recovering beautifully. And lastly for those that still have to wait another week or two. I know it is the hardest on you. I pray the worrying and waiting lessons today. Godspeed ladies. Make it a great day! (Hugs)",

I also have one of those pillows you use on an airplane. Is that what you are referring to Susan? So my next question.... For those of you have already had surgery. What was your first outing and how many days post surgery was it. (Going to the Dr. does not count). Maybe I am deluding myself here. I am wondering if I will be able to spend a few hours out on the 4th watching the night works. Also who all has pets? I have 2 small dogs that are not going to understand the lack of attention from me when I get home. They are my fur babies and spoiled rotten. So it's countdown Leathers and Danielle. If you see this before your surgery tomorrow. know that we are all praying for you and sending good vibes your way ",

Did your surgeon say the initial node biopsy was negative and went ahead and ordered the oncotype test or will they wait to do that after the final path?

Also thank you for reminding me to focus on the positives. I am anxious to get this behind me but am feeling more nervous the closer to surgery I get. I am like Illamie and hate the idea of being put under. Curious on how you did with the 5 hour trip! My commute will only be two hours that I am not looking forward to. My DH is a LEO and hate to say, his driving is the worst! Always has to be messing with the radio or phone etc. I don't know how many times I have said Gee we made it 15 minutes without hitting rubble strips. I can never relax as I feel like I have to watch the road for him. Curious what everyone wore home. I am thinking about just putting on PJ's. That way when I get home I won't have to change again. (It's the little things I am focusing on now!) I hope everyone who had surgery last week is getting stronger every day and healing perfectly. SBKH: Are you still in Kansas? I lived 50 years of my life in the Shawnee Mission area and moved to Central (Western) Kansas 6 years ago when I got married. I will be having my surgery in Wichita.",
