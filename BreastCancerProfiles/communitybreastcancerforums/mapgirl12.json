My surgeon mentioned a port placement yesterday so I am hoping to have that done at the same time as the lumpectomy! I am 45 with 2 adult daughters and 3 grandkids (3 years, 9 months, and 7 months). My daughters are supportive. My younger daughter and the 3 year old and 9 month old live with us so she has been at every appointment and every step of the way. My older daughter lives 2000 miles away by the rest of my family. My mom had a MX at 42 for Paget's. My BRCA tests came back negative! Breast cancer has been part of my life since I was 12 so I am not worried about beating the cancer. (My younger daughter was 8 at the time. We were waiting for my mom to go to church. My daughter walks down the stairs and says,\"Grandma is putting her boob in then she's ready to go.\" My dad laughed so hard!) My plan is to clean everything so the next couple of cleanings can be light cleaning so my daughter and husband can take care of it! My daughter and the 3 year old will take care of decorating for Christmas! I am out-sourcing the gift buying and wrapping to my husband and daughter this year! (((((HUGS)))) to all!",

My surgical oncologist took the mass out with clean margins.  One of the 6  nodes had a 1 mm microscopic spot.  I see my oncologist next week to confirm 4 chemo treatments followed by 6 weeks of radiation.  I am looking forward to July.   The best thing I found was taking a shower with a bra on then taking it off to finish washing up then quickly put a new one on!   Sincerely, Nancy",

Today I finalized all of the remaining doctor's appointments and procedures for surgery on 12/12. The genetic testing typical testing time was 2 weeks but the genetics team was able to send it priority so I got my results back in 6 days. Then I could make the final surgery decision. My surgeon's office scheduled my surgery before the results were back. I pushed for a surgery date in early December so I could recover in 2013 and start back in 2014 (if I have recovery time in 2014 I would lose vacation days). I started keeping a journal just for this journey. It helps my anxiousness. Also schedule in some time to see friends/family. I think it has helped a couple of friends and my sister to be more comfortable when they are kept up to date on the process. I told one of my guy friends last Friday. Saturday he called to have dinner together. We just chatted and talked about families, relationships, work, and \"old times.\" This gave him some time to make sure I was doing ok. Get out of the house for all of those meetings and events that you have put off \"until you have time\" Use some of the anxiousness to start getting the house ready. I am doing the deep cleaning so my daughter and husband will be able to clean the house on their own for a couple of months. Holiday gifts and cards - get the information together so someone can follow the instructions and take care of it for you! For me delegating processes to my team while I am recovering is key to my team being successful and reduces my stress. It is also the end of the year so reviews and reporting need to get done so it is not my usual work. These are just some of the tips that have worked for me. Today I feel at peace knowing that there are dates for the remaining open items. Feel free to message me if you want to chat more! Sincerely, Nancy",
