(if I can figure out how to add pics here)  She's a mix, with alot of black lab, and was 1 year old in June..and still very much in the puppy stage. She brings so many laughs to my hubby & I! Anyone who has a labrador..knows that they stay puppyish for around 2 years, when most dogs settle down some at around 1 year. ",

The gatorade is to help keep you hydrated, the crackers are for something 'lite' on your tummy. I found that the hard candies really helped with the metallic taste that I got while I was getting my chemo. You will find much info and support here sweetie. I also had my dear hubby with me at all of my chemo treatments, which helped alot. Good luck and prayers will be with you! And angeljoy...ditto about anything red after adriamycin. Red jello even made me shudder. Thankfully..3 years later, the red no longer bothers me.",

This is the start of my 3rd year survival and I've decided to \"live\". So, once again, I am putting that little spoon of sugar in my coffee in the morning. Making sweet suntea, and having a candy bar once in awhile. I figured I could keep depriving myself of things that I liked and possibly get a recurrance---or--- start enjoying things that I liked again..and possibly get a recurrance. I believe it's up to the person on which studies they want to believe. There is soo much info out there. But according to God, All things are good in moderation. So that is what I'm going to live by.",
