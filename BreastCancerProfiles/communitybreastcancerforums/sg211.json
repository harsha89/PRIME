I have my first treatment in two weeks and I know I'll know much more then, but the cancer center wants the second treatment scheduled now. So, for those of you who have gone thru Taxol, would you have been ready to participate in Christmas festivities 3 or 4 days after treatment? I know we all react differently to treatments, but any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Diagnosed at 44. Monthly Lupron injections.

It was less expensive there than on amazon. I like it - seems to help with the itching. I have been using it 2-3 times per day - along with Green Tea Spray and Lavender Healing Mist - since the first day of treatment. I'm almost finished with whole breast radiation and my skin is just slightly pink.",
