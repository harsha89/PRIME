It made me bone mets stable and live mets gone that did not show up on PET/CT scan after 9 treatment. I started had blured vision since Jan, but that time checked with eye doc, said dry eyes , everyone thought chemo was the cause, I even posted  here. People responed with the same. But in the middle of April, the vision getting worse, barely can read from computer, watch TV and traffic signs. Then I had  headache, nausea, and vomiting for several weeks and I lost 12 lbs. in 4 weeks. I had a brain MRI on May 28, 2008 and was diagonosed with leptomeningeal metastases, and there were cancer cells in my cerebrospinal fluid. Since then  in the middle of May I stopped the Taxol, May 30, 2008- June, 10, 2008 - I had 10 sessions brain radiation at Brigham and Women's. May 30, 2008 - I was in ER due to severe headache after radiation. June 26-27, 2008 - I had neurosurgery to install a port for chemo treatment in my head. The surgeon digged a hole on my skull and inserted a port in. June 27, 2008 - I was in ER due to seizure. July 3-4, 2008 - I had a failed neurosurgery to take the port out. Oncologist could not access the port and inject the chemo drug. July 10-12 2008 - I had the third neurosurgery to put a new port in and had a brain chemo treatment on July 11, 2008. July 29, 2008 - I had second brain chemo treatment through the port, scheduled to have more brain chemo every two weeks. Also the Onc put me on Arimidex now too. Yes, the Onc told me I had very poor progonosis. but no one can tell us which day we will die. It is really hard to survive from this, I felt I seem die once and be alive again. The good thing is my vision was back to normal 6 weeks ago. no headache, nausa, vomiting. Hang in there.  Shend",

In the week of my second treatment, I could not get sleep and had a lot of pain, my sister kept calling me and said \" you should go out  and take a walk, etc\". Seems that if I walk three miles a day, my cancer will be gone...or my life style is wrong. Just put so much stress on me, then my white count dropped, I could not get the third week treatment followed by sore throat, mouth sore....I had to tell her, don't call me, I call you....I know she cares about me, just people don't know how chemo can knock you down. I need afternoon nap and I might have good days, I also have days to have hard time to get up. I used to take all the pain and hardship to myself and endure, then I found out I treat myself too hard. I was kind of living in double  life. I am a human being and I have no difference from others. It is not a shame to admit I need more rest and I am suffering rather than put a happy face in front of others. Also in Oct, and Nov, my superviser called me every other week.   All he cares about when I finish my treatment and go back to work. The most mean thing is  he called me on Friday evening and said \"I worked late today.....\" I felt he wanted me to feel guilty to take short trem disability and be home. Then one Friday night I did not pick up his phone call and replied him an email and told him what side affect I am dealing with, then after Thankgiving, he did not call me anymore. I know now he thinks I am a goner now, no longer useful for him. I do have a couple of good friends and really cares me and my husband is fine, I tried to keep myself away from people who might hurt me. Dealing with cancer is not easy. How could they know how hard we put ourself togather after failed treatment or had bad scan results. How could they know how many bleeding scars in our heart when we are on the cancer journey.

The first two treatment, I was given premedication Decadron and Zantac pills and took them before treatment. I was told if you don't allergic in the first two treatments, then you will be fine in the rest treatments.  Right now I just have strange taste when I was pumping into taxol. Please noteI was given the benadryl before I got the Taxol.  So when I am getting Taxol, I am in a kind of sleeping mode. There are certain orders of the drugs they need to give to you( oral or IV), before you get Taxol. Double check them. We suppose to trust the chemo nurses, but we also need to keep an eye to ourself to protect ourself.",

After the first surgeries, evrerything looked good, but after I just laid down on my bed at home, I had a seisure...then back to ER again. The Docs lack experience to treat us since there are not many case like us. I was also overdosed Docordron for three weeks....who knows how those drugs interact with each other. The more drugs they give to us, the more SE we suffer, I also put on the Arimidex for 5 weeks, just stopped it and started Doxil, since they stopped chemo taxol+avastin, my liver is getting much worse just in two months. Four weeks ago I had double vision( lasted 3-5 mins) and headache after I change my position( sit to stand). I think it related to Arimidex. but docs have no clues about it. The ER doc said we gave you some pain medicine...Anyway, very disappointed. I want to know why it happened. Hang in there. I will pray for you. Shen",
