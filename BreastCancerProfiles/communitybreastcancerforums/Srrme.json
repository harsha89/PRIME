      "Content": "Srrme wrote: I am 22 years old. When I was 13 I found a pea-sized lump in my right breast, located under my aerola. My mother said it was due to hormones, and we left it at that. It's still there, and hasn't grown in size or changed at all. It's round, smooth, and can move a little bit, but not much. It doesn't cause me any pain. I check my breasts often, and just recently found more lumps, 3 maybe. They're located under my aerola as well, on the side, and in the same breast that other lump was found 9 years ago. They almost feel like they're connected to each other (the recent lumps, the old lump is on the other side), or very close, they feel smooth and round too, and move around a bit as well, but again, not much. They're not painful. Two of them feel small, and one feels larger than the other. I don't think they were there recently -- last week even. I felt them while I was feeding my baby, and surely, I would have felt them before. I am breastfeeding my 18 month old, and my 5 month old. I hand expressed for 3 months while my first son was in the NICU, and hand expressed again for 3 weeks while my second was in the NICU. I was on weekly progesterone injections while pregnant with my 5 month old. My menstrual cycle has not regulated yet.Â  I have NO family history of breast cancer. I am waiting a week (because I have to wait until I know which days my husband is off next week) then making an appointment to get them checked out. In the mean time, I am freaking out. Seriously. Do you gals have any advice? Log in to post a reply",
