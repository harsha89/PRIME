My partner said he would like it if I did early on, but as I had a rough time with the anaesthetic, he has left the decision to me. I just did not want to put my body through more stress of surgery, even though my surgeon does an amazing job. My boobs are not that big anyway and I am not a vain person about that sort of thing. I was just happy to get through everything and keep my health. I only went and got my form (named marjorie) about two weeks ago and am very happy with it. I don't wear it every day as I hate wearing a bra and only wear one when going out. Being in Australia, the majority of women prefer not to have reconstructions, and as forms are so very good these days, nobody can really tell anyway.",
