Never felt well on any of the AIs and so after the bilateral mastectomy and CMF chemo as well as the 5 years of tamoxifen, we decided that it was ok to stop the AI treatment. Well, that didn't work out. 2 years later,- mets in my hips and spine. I restarted on an AI; TMs kept rising; tried Faslodex with no response and finally started on Abraxane (also have been on Xeloda). After my TMs started rising after the Xeloda, my Onc put my on An A/A combo and the numbers kept going up. Since I had done so well on the tamoxifen, I searched for articles that used an everolimus and tamoxifen combo. Found one! Here it is: jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2012/05/03/JCO.2011.39.0708.full.pdf To make a long story short, I am on an Everolimus/ tamoxifen combo and my TMs are going down! So, if you are not doing well on the A/A combo and you responded well to tamoxifen in the past, this is a treatment you may want to consider.

Haven't been here for a bit and just saw your post.  Nausea is the worst.  Pot brownies, ginger, scopolamine patches and sea bands are all worth a try.  Before you go for the scopolamine patch, you might want to try Dramamine or bonine. They both help with nausea as well.  Benzodiazepines (like Xanax and Ativan) also help with nausea, so they are also worth a try. They can make you sleepy - so you may have to fiddle with the dose.  So sorry you both are going through this... ",

Please feel free to email it to anyone else if you want to give it a go.  I set up a new gmail account with the name metastaticmarian (couldn't help myself).   Hello all, There is a t-shirt printed for those with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that in a continual loop says Scan >Treat >Repeat >.What it really should say is Scan >have horrible anticipatory anxiety until you get the results, with moments of black despair. Brace yourself, find out results and either continue with current treatment regimen or find that your disease has progressed and start a new treatment that has its own wonderful world of side effects; sob quietly for a bit >Repeat >. Harder to fit that on a t-shirt though... The sad reality is that approximately ONE in THREE women who have had invasive breast cancer will eventually develop metastatic disease. It can occur anytime after the initial treatment. Five years clean is NOT a cure; i.e., I was diagnosed approximately 7 years after a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. As we end the month of October, I think we can pretty much agree that we are all \"aware\" of breast cancer. All those pink ribbons and rah-rah survivor attitudes do not help the tens of thousand of women with MBC. Currently MBC-focused research makes up only 7% of money invested in all of breast cancer studies. So, here I am making a plea for you to donate. I hate to ask, but for me and so many others, it is literally a matter of life or death. I have conveniently provided a website for you in which you click \"Get Involved\" and then \"donate\" and send what you wish. Here it is: mbcn.org Then - please send this email to five other generous souls to get the word out. I hope people will keep forwarding this, so that if nothing else, people will understand a bit more about metastatic disease. NO more pink t-shirts, pink ribbons, pink shoelaces, pink PF Chang's horses (I mean, really???). Just a cure. Many, many, thanks Marian Dx 4/2002, ILC, Right, 1cm, Stage IV, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 5/5/2002 Mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Left Chemotherapy Xeloda (capecitabine) Chemotherapy Halaven (eribulin) Surgery Prophylactic ovary removal Chemotherapy Abraxane (albumin-bound or nab-paclitaxel) Log in to post a reply",

I also plop a bag of frozen peas on top of my feet. I got both of these things on amazon.com, or you could also google something like \"ice packs for feet/hands.\" These constrict the blood vessels in your hands and feet, so you don't get as much of the chemo circulating in there. It has really worked! I get funny looks, but no neuropathy! This has worked for 6 months and I hope it continues. Also, try taking B6... Neurontin does wonders for some people too.

Sometimes a good old fashioned cry is what you need.  Glad to hear your tx went better today.  One thing that I have been doing is getting out and seeing music and broadway shows.  I have this memory that you are out in Long Island (yes/no?).  I schlep into the city and mostly go to matinees. There is a very good website that had discount tickets for a number of shows - broadwaybox.com  Also recently went into this little cabaret/piano bar with a friend and it was really fun.  Do what lifts your spirits!  Also pick a drug, any drug that eases things for you.  Antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, marijuana, gin and tonic (very nice in the summer), etc. I agree with Dbla-  if you are not finding this therapist helpful - find another one!  You are the consumer here and you want someone who can help you cope with all of this.  It might be helpful to get a recommendation from your Onc's  office, Gilda's club or the American Cancer Society.

Of course,it would probably mean some sort of chemotherapy, which has its own wonderful side effects. Maybe your onc doesn't feel like its enough of a progression yet.  Does he also check TMs and CTCs?",
