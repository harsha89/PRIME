    "Content": "Situationcoach wrote: My mom got her mammogram results back yesterday. They told her everything looked good, except that they saw a dark spot in the middle back part area of her breast. They said they would need to do an ultrasound and possibly a biopsy. They said cancer sometimes hides deep in the breast. She has had a history of dense breast and also calcifications. But also no symptoms of breast cancer. Should we be worried?
