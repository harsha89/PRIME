But this time they found something and then they did a mammogram. That was questionable and they did a biopsy. The results came in last Friday but I have my daughters baby reveal in 2 weeks and if I get bad news I would be so sad and I don\u2019t want to ruin her special day. I have been putting off going in . But the wait is killing me not sure what to do . ?",
