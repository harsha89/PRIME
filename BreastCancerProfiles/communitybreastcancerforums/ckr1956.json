After that it's Arimadex for 5 years or more. I am worried about the effects of radiation and how that will impact my ability to work to full-time. I too am on my own and need to be able to earn a living. If  the effects are too bad I don't know what I\"ll do. How are you doing with your treatment so far? I hope all is going well. this site is such a relief for me. Finding other women going through all of this and feeling similar feelings, it makes such a difference.  ",
