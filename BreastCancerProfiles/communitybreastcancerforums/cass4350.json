My gyn sent me to a surgeon & he told me it's normally a hormomal thing if it's in both sides. Since mine was only on one side, he watched it for a while (meantime he found a lump that needed to come out). I ended up having what he called a 'ductogram'-cut off the milk ducts before they got to the nipple. That took care of the problem, but left the nipple numb (he hadn't mentioned that before the surgery). After that, I had 3 more lumpectomies, a couple needle biopsies and a couple other biopsies of another kind, but can't think of the word for it. Also, since then both my sisters had breast cancer. My mom had breast cancer in 1970. 7 weeks ago, I had a preventive bilateral mastectomy. I'm not implying that you should do the same, but my peace of mind has sky-rocketed. Learn all you can before deciding on a plan. Ask as many questions as possible and don't let up til you get answers. Knowledge will make you strong!",
