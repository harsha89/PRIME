I didn't think much of it, told her to put neosporin on it.Â  Today she mentioned it again (we were bra shopping) and then later on the way home she said something about having swollen lymph nodes in her armpits. I am very concerned now. Can breast cancer present as an open sore? Or is it more likely the lymph nodes are from the sore and she just needs antibiotics? Her fiance was with us so I didn't ask many questions. I did tell her she needed to see a Dr ASAP and told her even if she needs to go to prompt care. Is there anything more I should ask her?
