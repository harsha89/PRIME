Lymph nodes are clear and PET scan also clear. She is also post menopause. she had the tumor moved 2 weeks ago and did a breast conservation surgery. The oncologist recommended for her to do TC chemotherapy 4 cycles, followed by hormone therapy (arimidex) and radiotherapy. We're all reeling from this recommendation to do all 3 treatments notwithstanding that she is stage 1 and everything. Wen don't know if she should do the chemotherapy or not and everyone is really having so much anxiety over what to do. The oncologist didn't really make it sound like it was an option for my mum not to do chemotherapy. Any thoughts or experiences is greatly appreciated! Thank you. Melissa",

Her oncologist didn't mention doing this test. I'm planning on asking for the oncotype test to be done but does anyone know if the recurrence score is only in relation to recurrence in the breast or recurrence anywhere else? Thanks so much.",
