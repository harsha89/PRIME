However, I have found strength, inspiration and information here that has been invaluable during my journey with breast cancer. I was diagnosed with IBC in 2010 while I was pregnant with my second child. Had chemo, surgery and radiation. In February 2013, I was diagnosed with one small brain tumor, which was removed via surgery. I had radiation and am currently on tykerb and hercepitin. Ever since my initial diagnosis, I have had PET scans every six months.  Once the brain tumor was found, my testing also included a brain MRI every six months.   My question is - how often do you have scans? Are scans done routinely or only if a problem arises? Log in to post a reply",
