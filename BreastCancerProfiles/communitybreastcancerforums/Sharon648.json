Dianarose Just yesterday my oncologist want me to come in and discuss my treatment but didn't tell me my score when i asked..My surgeon want me to heal 6 weeks..before chemo..Score 6 is low risk and i was told if it to low risk chemo don;t work..The reason i wait was deal to the 6 hrs drive to her center..I am seeing a local oncologist and pray he is good so i have to only drive 1 hour..I know when i start chemo it going to be to much of a drive for me to deal with..But will do it if i can;t find a oncologist i have confident in..locally...i live in a fairly small town..Palo Alto near Stanford ,much more choices.. I am stage 2A..cos my turmo size was 2.1 stage 1 is 2.0 with a grade 3..nodes negative..I feel it importand to have 2-3 opinion.My first oncologist office staff was Incompetent..i dumped them when i found out they wasted a week cos the nurse forget to send in the paperwork for the Oncotype..that blew my confident totally..The staffs are as inportand as your oncologist..After all one is dealing with chemo..that alone is scare enough..The second oncologist she is very good..it just the 6 hrs round trip that a bummer..and if something go wrong i have to drive that distance to see her..So that alone a concern..",
