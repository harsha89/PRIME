The thing is, I have bone mets and could live for many years.  I don't want to throw my life away because I am feeling down right now.  And, I do have some pleasure in life.  My cat, Buddy, just discovered rubber bands as I was typing this.  He makes me laugh every day.  We're not in an easy positon.  I guess, like has been said, there is an inner voice that will, hopefully, speak to us and let us know.",
