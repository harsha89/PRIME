I can surely relate to your first post and I am thankful for having read it. With that being said I am still praying for a Birads 5, B-9 result, I know it has happen. But either way you have prepared yourself for a battle and I applaud your strength. (Hugs)",

I am surprise your surgeon said only tamoxifen. My surgeon said if my mass had been a few mm larger he would have insisted on standard of care, but with a very very small foci of DCIS he felt R/T would only have been of min benifit and my RO cuncured and that's how I made my choice of no RADS and also after looking at my risk #'s.  I didn't want to take the tamoxifen either but after all three, BS, MO and RO pushed that issue I agreed. It has been two weeks and side effects have only been the hot flashes.",

So I met with a RO today and she is also leaning towards no RT, she says that with my DCIS being low grade, very small and with no family history that I could be over treating in my situation. She stated that she is always aggressive with treatment and thinks she tends to over treat, but in my situation she feels that I would be better off with closer watching with my screening and she also concurs with my MO about the  tamoxifen. But the choice is mine and I am leaning towards no radiation, I feel like the risk of RT out way the odds of it coming back, one never knows and even with RT there's no guarantee that it won't return. Decisions decisions, it's so hard to know the right thing to do, I have been praying about all of this and what to do and my gut  (Holy Spirit) says to pass on RADS. So I will believe in my choice and not look back once I make it. Oh, my RO also felt I would benefit better with 10 years of tamoxifen rather than 5 (YIKES!!!). I thought I would be joining the summer 2014 RADS group but now I may not be. :) Has anyone else here been given this choice by you dr's, I know the final choice is mine but just wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation?

I will make a decision and like you said once I make it, it will be easier to deal with and  I will try not to second guess. Thanks again!!! ",

I question my MO after I decided not to do RADS as to why she said I needed RADS and she also said standard of care. Butt after I had a LOOOONG consult with RO and she gave me my numbers on benefits and risk (long & short term) I was okay with skipping RADS. Who knows if it was a right choice or not, only time will tell but I try not to worry and just go on with life. I did choose to take the Tamoxifen as I am 100% ER/PR +, not to happy about that either but I felt I really should not skip out on that. I took my first pill last night, praying I will be okay with no side effects :) I am so sorry about you SIL, 20 years later, I have to admit, that is one of my biggest fears, not knowing what lies ahead, I have to remind myself to live in the now. If you don't mind me asking, what size was your DCIS?",
