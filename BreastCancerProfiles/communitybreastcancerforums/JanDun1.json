Spoke with the surgeon who told me my mammogram looks the same as it did prior to treatment. Granted, my mammo prior to treatment showed very little, it was the mri that showed a large questionable area. Has anyone else had this situation? What was the outcome?

I'm not angry just anxious to be through with all of this. I will be having a bi-lateral mastectomy. I had DCIS previously in one breast, now I have ILC in my other. I have a strong family history of bc also so mastectomy is my only option. Thanks again. I hope you both have a speedy recovery back to good health.",
