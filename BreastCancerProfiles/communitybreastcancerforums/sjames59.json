Thanks, AmyJo for the suggestion on aloe - I have the 100% gel but maybe should look for the real thing. GirlFriday, the itchiness has started to wake me up at night and I take more benadryl. The burn has started to wake me up too, and being really thirsty! So I keep a bottle of water on the night stand, and ibuprofen/acetaminophen (I do a combination of the two). I look forward to sleeping through the night again, ha ha! Hope everyone has a good week :-) Sharon",

For the techs, I'm giving them all some markers, since they seem to like to draw so much (on me)... and some \"Math with Bert & Ernie\" activity books from the dollar store. There was a SS book there, too, called The Fix-It-Shop so I'll put a label over \"The\" that says the RO's name, and change some of the story to fit a rads clinic. There were some rubber ducky bubbles that I picked up for the receptionists, and some bags of life-saver (not SS) candy for the nurses. Amazing that the trip to the dollar store REALLY took it out of me on Friday, wow!",

I also especially like using a cotton tank undershirt, after hearing about it on this board, big thanks. I'm really nervous about how the next six weeks will play out, but hoping for the best. Thankfully my job is coming to a little bit of a lull soon and I'll be able to take time off if needed. Best wishes to all.",

I'm tired a lot, finished #17 on Friday and am lubing and using saline compresses a lot more often, due to increased soreness. I'm very thankful for the weekend! I find at work that it's hard to focus and to get into the higher gear I need to get things done. My treatment time is now in the afternoon, so I hope having a somewhat uninterrupted morning can give me the oomph I need but it's discouraging, especially the feeing that I'm not going to catch up before deadlines hit. BUT I'll continue to do the best I can and talk to my boss if need be - she's been more than understanding and supportive through all of this. When I went to the  dentist Friday they talked to me about how radiation can change your saliva and might be why I have an area of decay when I NEVER do. That was discouraging, but they gave me some toothpaste to use at night to help with that. Hope you're all having a restful and good weekend :-) Sharon",

It was kind of uncomfortable to lay still for 20 minutes (also had some images done for the RO to review before tx), but otherwise uneventful. When I was done I asked the techs about skin care, and was directed to the nurses. They gave me samples of aquaphor and miaderm. They weren't directing me to use them but said that I should use some type of lotion 3 times a day and to avoid anything with alcohol or fragrance. They also gave me a sheet of general information about the treatment. I have a gratitude journal that I write in, and my most recent entry is about a co-worker who donated their parking place to me for the duration of the radiation treatments. I work at our community college, and parking is at a premium. I get to work early enough to park on the street, so to leave for any reason during the day and come back, chances are slim for finding anything. My co-worker's kindness relieved a LOT of stress, yay! One down, 33 to go.",

Yesterday when I woke up I was red from under my arm down my side, started feeling anxious because I hadn't been red there before and have just been lubing the breast area. Plus there were a lot more shooting pains. When I went in for tx yesterday the techs reminded me that this new red area is part of where they had drawn on me at the beginning. So now I'm expanding the area to lube and to uses the saline compresses. I was supposed to have the simulation today for the boosts, but they were running WAY behind... had to wait an hour for tx and they bumped the simulation to tomorrow.  On another note, I've always had cold hands - well, they are proving useful for the sore or itchy areas... the cold in my hands comes through the tank top and provides temporary relief... just have to be careful not to do so in public, esp. in traffic! I find I am tons more exhausted this week, and have started working from home instead of going in to the office. That saves some energy, plus I can stop and lube and use the saline compresses so much more easily than at work. Take care everyone, Sharon",

I finished boosts a week ago and am still really tired but am trying to get back to a normal work schedule too. This weekend was the first time I got out to do something fun since probably the 3rd week of rads. I'd been so sore and exhausted for so long - it was really great to just spend some time with my husband, and all we did was a little bit of letterboxing, lol! I go back to see the RO nurse this afternoon - apparently they want to keep track of me weekly until my skin clears up completely. It's getting there, too - the boost area is lighter but still pretty red, and the rest of the breast has lightened up considerably with some peeling & itching still. Hang in there! Wishing everyone easier days ahead :-) Sharon",
