Argh! I don't want to be the face of breast cancer.  I don't want to constantly be reminded I have breast cancer.  I don't want to wear clothing or jewelry that reminds me of breast cancer.  I don't want to walk or run w/ hundreds or thousands of other women who have or have had breast cancer.    I am reminded every day when I get in the shower, when I put on my mastectomy bra with \"foobs,\" when my joints are stiff and it takes me forever to stand up after sitting due to Armidex.  I am reminded every day when almost everyone asks how I'm doing, seemingly expecting me to whine or complain or come up w/ a symptom list indicating I've only got a couple weeks to live.   I'm reminded whenever I have a \"wierd\" ache or pain and my first thought is the cancer has traveled. We try to live with dignity after diagnosis and treatment.  We must be courageous and always aware of our bodies.  We must watch our weight, exercise, think about how much alcohol we're consuming, what foods we're putting in our body, which supplements are good or bad.  Cancer takes up an incredible part of every day... for every day going forward.  I don't have time for pink.  It doesn't make me feel better, feel safer or somehow make having breast cancer easier or \"fun.\" Thank you for starting this thread and letting me rant... I had no idea I was holding all this in :) ",

Hair started falling out w/in 14-15 days on red devil; I had a friend shave my head on Day 12 and started wearing a wig.  Halfway through Taxol it started growing back in.  I go out in public starting a couple weeks ago w/out the wig but my hair is REALLY short, thin and very white.  It's also very very soft.  Growing quickly but there's a chance I may have to do more chemo so I'm trying to not be attached to my hair.  Tho I really did find the wig incredibly hot, especially as we moved into summer. Agree worst side-effect was constipation.  Stool softeners w/ red devil were a must, especially as I had to take the anti-nausea drugs.  Worst side-effect w/ Taxol was joint aches/pains and insomnia for 2-3 days after treatment every week.  I'm 6 weeks post Taxol and joint pains and insomnia have gone away.  Hoping if I do have to do more chemo that doesn't happen again... At about halfway point in red devil I had metallic taste and virtually no appetite.  That's when you eat whatever you can that sounds halfway good... toaster waffles, mac and cheese, etc.  About a week after ending red devil my appetite started returning and the metallic taste gradually went away after about 4 weeks. I had no problem eating on Taxol, good appetite.  Did have loose stools and some diarrhea, but again chief complaint on Taxol was joint aches/pains and insomnia. Eyebrows and eyelashes -- last to go and mine seem slow returning.  I do miss my eyelashes.  Nose hair wasn't that big a deal, tho it's also slow to return.  Leg hair went away, came back slowly and much less coarse.  Pubic hair growing in gray/white but started coming back about the same time as head hair and growing at about same rate.  I'm sure it's different for everyone. I didn't miss a day of work on chemo, though there were a couple days I really could have stayed home and stayed in bed.  I also never threw up once... TAKE THE DRUGS THEY GIVE YOU and follow the instructions.  My oncologist was truly concerned about how I felt and how I was reacting and they want you to be as comfortable as possible!   I work every other day, which in retrospect, was / is the perfect chemo work schedule.  Every other day I rested as much as I needed, which might be one reason I never had to miss any work.  Best days were day of chemo and day after.  The Neulasta shot on day after red devil is a killer... you feel as if you have the flu for a couple days and it really gave me some serious aches/pains.  Since I did my Taxol weekly I didn't have to do Neulasta w/ it -- only w/ the red devil. Good luck -- you can do it !!!!!  It's a surreal time but also prepares you for the next phase of your healing journey.   ",
