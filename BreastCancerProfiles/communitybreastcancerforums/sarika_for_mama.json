I promised i would keep in touch but time flies when you are having fun :)  My last post was when my mom was in ICU and we ( my 3 yr old daughter and I) were planning to go spend a couple weeks with her. Well I am happy to report that by the time I got there she was out of the hospital and even came to receive us at the airport. She had energy for the first time in 5 months to play with her grandchild. She was put back on chemo though as the onc didnt want to keep her off too long but she got 10 day rest on her liver and she was back on Xeloda and Taxol. I must say though, i was heartbroken to see her almost bald head and really dark palms and feet. She has lost weight and looked 10 years older. But I am focusing on the positive side that she was happy for the 16 days we spent with her. We bought her a new wig and made plans for when she would come and visit us. She has her scans on July 2nd. We are all nervous again - tummy is all tied up. I am hoping for an excellent result this time. Hope the tumor shrinks to nothing and she gets a break )looooong break). Just thought I would update you all. Lots of love Sarika Mom DX in Feb'08 with liver mets Log in to post a reply",

It's not good news. After 3 rounds of Avastin & then 6 rounds of Xeloda + Taxol , we went in for scans last week. Results - she is where she was 9 months ago. Except the uptake has increased. The lesion in tumor stayed on and was bright in the PET Scan and also the breast lit up right where it did 9 months ago. the scan we did in the middle had shown considerable improvement so now we were hoping for NED, instead she is at the starting line all over again. ONC says he wont give more chemo and prefers we go for RFA and masectomy. He doesnt seem too enthusiastic anymore. He had taken an agressive approach and now it seems he is giving up on her. Or is he just giving her a break?  Any words of wisdom for us? Thanks Sarika Mom DX in Feb'08 with liver mets Log in to post a reply",

After exhasting all chemos and losing 40 pounds i asked her to stop and try something else which wouldnt harm her just to we could keep her stable and try and get her health back. So i brought her to US and she getting immunology treatments in PHX at Envita.  The issue is as soon as she got there she started developing ascites. She has gained 18 pounds in less than a month. Her belly is distended and we started her on diuretics two weeks ago. She is urinating more but still gaining weight. She is frusterated because i got her here to get IV Vitamin C (high doses) and a NK cell treatment and she is refusing IV because it has sodium in it and she is eating even less now because she feels full almost immediately. There is no breathing issues or pain so far. My question is - has diuretics worked on any of you? Should we get her tapped even though we know the fuild will accumulate again? Her liver functions are improving but ascites is not reducing. Her clothes dont fit, she cant walk and cries all the time in frusteration.
