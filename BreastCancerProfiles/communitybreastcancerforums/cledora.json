Last year my ps said he would do implants. I was told before no due to my radiated breast. He put in t.e. and they got infected. I was then referred to a ps that does fat grafting. My surgery is now scheduled in Dec 2013. It got postponed twice due to a wound that didn't heal properly and also a seroma. I am excited and looking forward to this procedure. My radiated breast is so hard feeling. How long is most people out of work is what I have been trying to find out.",

My left breast is flat after the expander was removed and my right breast is the radiated breast. My ps said he would be able to do all with fat grafting and not have to use skin from my inner thighs. My stomach was used the first time I had bc and my back was used for my left side the third time I had bc. I see my ps in about 2 weeks and my surgery is in 3 weeks. I will be asking him how he will handle both sides since their is a difference in sizes at my next appointment. I know the radiated side will take longer to soften up. I went thru radiation twice and it is very hard and had more damage after my other ps filled the expander and then it got infected. Won't walking be the best to help with the lipo healing or will that have to be limited. Thank you again, I truly appreciate the blogs. It truly helps in finding out answers and information.",

Last year when they found bc in my left breast, my prayer was not to have to do chemo a third time. HE truly answered that prayer. However, I didn't expect almost over a year and a half of being sick with all I dealt with the expanders, infections, hives and being anemic. I to had to rest more than I was use to. At least when I took the chemo I knew when I would be sick and for how long.(trust me I wouldn't want anyone to have to take chemo). I am just saying that being sick for a year and a half takes a lot out of someone. I am not complaining, because I was thankful that I am alive and all is and will be well with me. I am looking forward to this surgery in 3 weeks so I feel like I am getting back to some normalness. Did you wear spanx or just the compression garment from the hospital? Thank you again, Cledora",

She found out that she had bc in left breast Aug 2002, I found out in Sep 2002 that I had bc in right breast (mammogram came back fine, but I have dense breast) We both did chemo/radiation about the same time frame. I had reconstruction/mastectomy surgery Feb 2004 and they found cancer in middle of chest lymnode. My twin found out she had cancer again Jan 2004.  We both again did chemo/radiation.  She found out she had cancer again in Mar 2009, it spread thru her bones and she died Oct 12,2009 and I got to be by her side. May 2012 found out I had bc on left breast. I had a mastectomy and a latissimus dorsi surgery in June 2012. Thankful I didn't have to do chemo or radiation. My expanders both had to be removed. I would keep getting hives. I switched to another ps since I didn't want to try expanders/implants route again.  I had the BRACA gene test and it came back negative.  My older sister was to have a double mastectomy to prevent having cancer, but a month before the surgery they found out she had bc. Luckily she didn't have to do chemo/rads. She did have implants put in. I am 51, married to an awesome supportive husband, have 6 kids and 8 grandkids.",
