Does anyone here have the same or similar numbers as me?  I am 53 years old, post menopausal and on an emotional roller coaster ride.  But I must add, am better than a few weeks ago during the \"waiting for results hell\".

I am very fortunate to live in a city where there is a very reputable cancer center so I really do feel I am in good hands.  I am also soooo thankful that someone mentioned this site to me.  It is very comforting to know I can talk to others going through what I am going through and my questions will be answered honestly.  Thanks again Makraz!",

Wishing everyone a quiet night and am praying for minimal side effects for everyone!",
