When I went back in for my follow up appointment, she recommended a PET scan, which showed a very small amount of cancerous cells in the lymph nodes. She said that the radiation should wipe that out. I do not think your surgeon will want to take out all of your nodes, research has advanced us past those days. If he/she wants to do this, I would get a second opinion. Best of luck!

I think about what my OBGYN told me while I was pregnant when I asked her if I could drink an occasional glass of wine. She told me that it was probably fine, but if I did drink alchohol while pregnant and something was wrong with the baby, I may always wonder if I had caused the problem. That made my mind up for me right there. I approached chemo the same way, I just wanted to be sure that I have done everything that I can. I had my last THC treatment a year ago and, all in all, it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Neuropathy was not a problem for me and I feel back to normal today other than having a mild case of LE. I know it is a tough decision and you need to do what is right for you. Love and hugs...

It is good that you applied in July since there is a 5 month waiting period. Since you are stage 3C, you are automatically qualified, whether or not you have to fight for it a little.  I agree with what Lisa said, once they meet you and see that you are legit, they are much more likely to take you seriously and speed up the process. One other thing that I did was to speak to my doctors in advance. Good thing, since my medical oncologist is a little prudish and did not agree that I was disabled. On the other hand, my radiation doctor was more than happy to stand behind my claim. I believe he was instrumental in getting my case approved. One love, Jackie ",

Social security has an official cut-off at IIIB, but I was able to get it at IIIA -- it should take 2 years to be approved in any case... maybe a few months at most. Also, if you are taking medication that makes it hard for you to focus or are on antidepressants, I would mention that to them as well.

As an interesting sidenote, I also used this lotion on a skin growth that was on my bc side, right above where my lump was, and the growth disappeared completely in 3 days!

It all seems kind of obvious to me. ...maybe it's because I live in New York, but if some kid is asking me for money to buy shoes for his mom, I am going to assume that he is scamming me and is going to buy cigarettes or something. ...when the day comes that I am on my deathbed, I sure as hell don't want a pair of shoes!!! Lol! Anyway, as soon as my kids picked up on how much I hate the song, they would run for the radio and turn it up full blast whenever the song would come on. They would sing it to me at the top of their lungs until I would bury my face in the couch with my hands over my ears, shouting for them to TURN IT OFF!!

What I am curious about is th 3 cm. mass of ECE, which was \"matted together\". What is the significance of this? My oncologist is wonderful, but she doesn't like to talk about prognosis, etc. She tells me that there is nothing to worry about as I am NED. Thanks ladies!",

SSA would consider you disabled when you can no longer work, i.e. when you quit your job or went on disability. Then there is a 5 month waiting period before benefits kick in. I have heard, however, that you can get accelerated benefits at stage IV... can anyone clarify this? Worse yet, there is a 2 year waiting period before being eligible for Medicare. SSI is totally income based, though, and you would be eligible for that if you cannot work at all and have no income coming in. SSDI will deduct any SSI benefits from the amount you receive once that kicks in. It is confusing, and I think it is that way to discourage people from abusing the system. When I went in for my interview, the people at SSA were very nice to me and very helpful. I think they want to help the people who really need it. Don't worry, there is always help available for basic living expenses. We ended up having to file bankruptcy because I could not work last summer (I worked freelance and was at doctor appointments 3-4 times a week, leaving me with no time to work). It sucks, it is frustrating, but it is what it is.  (((hugs)))) Jackie ",

Don't let that stop you from applying, though, and the earlier you apply, the better. From what I understand, as long as you are unable to work now, it shouldn't matter how much money you making at the job (the Fearless One could be right about that).  You should automatically qualify, and I think that knowledge will be helpful for you at the interview. When you do go in, make sure you have all of your paperwork in order and talk to your doctors in advance, since Social Security will be interviewing them. I did this, and I think that is why I was approved so easily. The thing you will want to do is to convince Social Security that you cannot work right now due to pain, side affects from medication, or mental illness.  Good luck, and let me know if you have more questions.
