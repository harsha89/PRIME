I am squirting the open sore with hydrogen peroxide 2x/day to try to dry it out and still in no real bra alternating between tight camis, sports bras and a couple of surgical bras they gave me.  The opening is getting smaller but very slowly.  I want it to heal ASAP before I start chemo on 7/23.  Anyone else have this issue?  Tips to make it heal faster?",

Has anyone ever heard of anything that helps with Vitamin D absorbtion?  Maybe take the Vitamin D supplement with another vitamin that helps with absorbtion?  I am not sure if this is one of the main reasons I developed breast cancer but I am definitely going to try to solve this to keep my Vitamin D levels up the rest of my life.  I am only 43 and have alot of years to go. Stay strong, ladies!",

Onco rec TC regimen with the option for AC/T if I preferred.  She feels like the long term risks of AC/T do not outweigh the benefits of the heavier treatment in my case.  I think this might be the way the universe is trying to make me 'happy' about my chemo.  I was really feeling like I wasn't sure I could do the AC/T (4 x AC every 2 week and 12 x T weekly) and my onco thru me a curve ball by recommending TC (only 4 x every 3 weeks).  Less time, fewer sessions, no port (!). Here we go....buckle up, I think this might be a bumpy ride!",
