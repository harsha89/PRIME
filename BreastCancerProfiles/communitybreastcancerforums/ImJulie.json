I had to experience an enema after it became so unbearable after the surgery and before the chemo even started. I felt so horrible for my DH, talk about grossly intimate. I don't want to put him through that again, nor do I want to go through that again! My ONC said that during chemo, NO enemas! I struggled with drinking water. As my mom put it when she was going through chemo for lymphoma, water tasted like what swamp water would taste like. It was terrible. I am almost two weeks out from my final chemo and water is beginning to be palatable again. Maria-I sympathize with you and the moving situation. My father spent 30 years in the Navy and I married into the Air Force! I went to 5 different elementary schools in 6 years. It got harder as we got older, but my mom ALWAYS made it exciting for us. Checking out what we had to look forward to at our new base. It was always an adventure! Before we had any children, DH was stationed in Las Vegas and got orders to England. He had to drive our car from Vegas to LA to get it on board a cargo ship, then fly back, get our house packed up,quit my job and vacate quarters in less than two weeks. It was such a whirlwhind time and I was beyond stressed. I called my mom in tears and asked her how did she do this with 4 girls in tow?!!! She gave me some of the simpliest yet best advice in my life, \"You do what you have to do.\" Of course, that was after she consoled me and comforted me like any mommy would!! Once we talked, nothing was impossible, it would all work out. A few bumps in the road, but no major crashes. Her birthday is tomorrow, she will be 80!! She is my hero! I've rambled... I hope everyone had a wonderful Father's Day! And thank you for graciously welcoming me into the group. ~Julie",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2011 10:55PM - edited Jun 21, 2011 11:01PM by ImJulie Hey ladies! I have labs tomorrow, followed by an echo, bone scan and xray of my spine and left side, due to some pain I have been having. ONC wants to get some tests done. Frankly, I think the pain is due to my sitting on my can all day! Maria: I'm so glad your DH will not be going out of town this week! And a big thank you for your \"soap box\"! I think that given my circumstances, you all do \"get it\" in regards to exercise. I had 26 lymph nodes taken from the right side and have a risk of lymphedema. As a result I am seeing a PT, but then discovered I have an impingement in my right shoulder which makes raising my arm above my head difficult. So I am seeing another specialist for that. I need to get that resolved as much as possible before rads begin since I will be holding my right arm above my head for 15 minutes at a time. That doesn't seem like much to some, but for me 2 minutes is painful. I have to do these exercises, but I have been so weak and weary and truth be told, I don't want to because they hurt! And I'm not a big fan of pain. Whine, whine... BUT, like any exercise, I know the benefits outweigh the discomfort. So the accountability is what I really do need! An occasional kick in the virtual butt! This last chemo (and it was my last!) has been the hardest in terms of fatigue and weariness. The day after chemo, I had my neulasta shot, then went straight to my PS for a double fill. My NP told me that was a bad idea! I sooooo agreed! I was in so much pain, I could hardly breath. I slept for the better part of 4 days, mostly drug induced because I feel no pain when I am asleep! At least I have no more chemo, but I won't be doing a double fill anymore either. I start rads in July for 6-7 weeks, then I have to wait about 4 weeks before I can have my exchange surgery. I will also have a hysterectomy at the same time. I have 3 tumors that I don't want hanging around in my body any more! One on, and one in my uterus and one on my left ovary. They are b9, but I don't want to risk them becoming cancerous. I tested negative for the BRCA gene which I am so glad, but I'm 53, my children are 26 and 21 and I don't need those organs anymore! I'm looking at my exchange surgery in Oct/Nov time frame. In the meantime, I know what Supersally means about thinking you can take off your bra for some relief, then realize it's the TE's! I do that all the time! I am concerned about having rads done with my TE's in place, but PS said we will have to \"work with it\". They won't take them out to do the rads. He did say that there is more risk involved. Had we known I had BC in the right breast as well, and had they known I would have to have rads, they would not have done the recon at the same time. But... hindsight is always 20/20. Do any of you know anybody that had rads done with TE's in place? Melanie: I don't mind if you count down! Please keep us posted as to the progress. I would like all the warnings and heads up I can get! And for those who have difficult family members/friends, I have a book to recommend. It is called \"Irregular People\" written by Christian author Joyce Landorf Heatherly. If you google either her or the title, and go to Amazon, there are some good reviews. The flipside of that is her book \"Balcony People\" on how to be that cheerleader we all need. Both are very good books. Suebee: Hawaii! We had to move there before my senior year in high school and I lived there from August, 1974 to January, 1978. Many, many high tides ago! It is a nice place to visit... very beautiful, but way too expensive. My SIL still lives there, and my MIL is buried at Punchbowl, but we can't afford to go visit! Have a good Wednesday! ~Julie",

DH wants to take a cruise to Alaska! Yeah, we put it on the bucket list! You mentioned you had \"mammory fold incision\". What is that? It sounds like what I have on my left side. I hope it can be corrected with the final surgery. Like someone said, that is when the PS performs his \"art\". Maria: I have friends that live in Chicago and love it and also have relatives in the Seattle area that love it as well. I've never been to either! Your pic is great! I hope I have as nice a chest when all is said and done! I've thought about posting pics of me pre-BMX and post, but both are so hideous! My boobs are so different from each other. The left one is very high and very bulbous and the right one is almost flat and more under my arm. It's hard to imagine normal small boobs from what I currently have! DH and I met with my ONC today. My bone scan, xray and echo all came back normal! Very happy and very blessed. My dad was so funny, he called me three times today to tell me how happy he was to hear my good news! My mom had her PET scan yesterday, so they are anxiously waiting news. She finished chemo in late January and her first PET scan came back all clear, so we are hoping this continues! ONC wants to see me in 4 months. He also said to call my surgeon and let him know I can get my port removed, but that won't happen until after rads. I have an appt. with RAD ONC on July 6 for the CT scan and I think for my tatoos and positioning, etc for rads. I don't know how soon after they will start, but I am very concerned about it. My PS keeps reminding me that there are \"serious\" consequences when rads are given to someone with TE's. Even though the cancer was in both breasts, I am only having rads on the right side. Melanie: do you have TE's? I can't remember. BTW, I asked PS what TE's I have and he said he uses Mentor for TE's and Allergan for the final implants! While talking to my ONC today, I told him I'm having difficulty shaking off this feeling of \"crappiness\", I'm still so tired and my emotions are so close to the surface. I even started to cry talking about it! I felt so stupid. He stood directly in front of me, held my hands and said it was all very normal. He is a great dr. He did say that the main SE of radiation therapy is fatigue! I knew that from reading about it, but he wanted to make sure I was aware that the fatigue is here to stay for a while. He said that cronic pain also causes fatigue and he is so right! I have been taking percocet for a week now, these dang TE's are so painful. I'm glad we (DH and I) made the decision that I will have no more fills! I have difficulty getting up from a chair, I still can't cough fully, or laugh. It's like having surgery without the incision. The pressure on my ribs is so great. I am hoping my chest will learn to accomodate these TE's as I won't be having my exchange surgery until at least sometime between Oct-Dec. I am very tired, very weary and very weepy. It does get better, right? Right?? My two DD's are fighting, which is hard to watch. \"She didn't do what she said she would do.\" \"She yelled at me.\" They are 26 and 21 and I want to say, \"ok, time to sit on the couch and hold hands for 10 minutes.\" but they are past that. They hurt each other's feelings and I, like any mother, give advice, but, like most children, it falls on deaf ears. They both have \"been wronged\" and neither wants to apologize for their part in the fight. I just tell them, \"you are not responsible for her actions or words, you are only resonsible for your own.\" The old adage \"two wrongs don't make a right\". What I really want to tell them is life is so short, do you really want to spend it in anger with one another? Tension doesn't help my state of mind. I am back at work. I work for my sister and I love it. But, things are really slow and she told me they might have to put me on part time. Then, DH came home today and told me he got laid off. He was working a part time job, but $ is $. He got laid off from a full time job in 2009 and it took him almost 18 months just to find a part time job. As much as that is not what we would want, we are very blessed that he gets his military retirement. I can't wait to start walking, I know it will help with the stress. ~Julie",

My PS said that numbness can last up to a year. Not good news, I know, but it is what it is. I had a BMX on 1/5/11 and I still have numbness on both arms. Moreso the right side since they took more from that side. Melanie: I am so glad you are 1/3 done! I am keeping up with your progress since I'm following you soon!

Red: Congratulations!! I am so happy to hear good results of the surgery! It is encouraging for us still on this side. Looking forward to more updates and pics. Also, did you have to have drains again? I hate that you got sick. Like others have mentioned, throwing up or coughing is so scary after surgery. Sleeping in the recliner - many nights I did that! I now am in a hospital bed set up in my room. It helps to be at an incline, the cough is worse when I am laying flat.

Sounds like so much fun! Supersally: I just got Tom's deoderant today. Do you have to apply it throughtout the day, or does it last? I will need something so as not to completely offend my RO techs!! Enjoy your vacation to Florida! I had 2/28 rads today. They are going well. They have to do a lot of marking and shifting my fat butt to make sure everything is lined up correctly. I have 6 different areas with tape over the markings. Tony, my tech, said I can shower, just don't scrub the area, but to let the water just run over the skin. He is so funny and very patient. The nurse, Sandy, also had a shoulder impingement so is understanding about the pain. She ended up with surgery to correct it. Can't think of more surgery, not at this point!! Ya'll have a great weekend! Hopefully I will be able to walk at the park if the weather isn't too hot! ~Julie",

It am using it immediately after rads, then mid-day, then before bed. I did talk to my RO on Monday and she said changing to 4pm is no problem. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to have any lotion on during the day, but she said apply it after my morning shower, and by 4pm, my body will have absorbed it so it won't be a problem. That made making the decision easier! Getting up at 6:30am is hard to do, I'm already so tired. All ladies that have had TE already, your pics look great. I am curious to know how my PS is going to fix my very strange chest. The left side has a large fold of skin near the underarm and the scar \"splits\" the TE so that the top half is very bulbous. The right side is totally different, much flatter and with a huge weird flap of skin at the inside bottom. I would post pictures, but I'm so afraid of hearing \"OMG, what the ********* is that?\" I have looked for other images on the internet to see if anybody has anything even remotely as odd to no avail... I walked for about 5 minutes on my treadmill last night! I know in comparison to you wonderwomen out there, that is a piddly amount, but I'm gonna get there! I want to do a 5k with my sister, she is very encouraging! Well, I've got 5 down and 23 to go. Funny, Melanie, I think you have 5 left!!! What exercises to you all do besides walking/hiking? Swimming is out for me for the time being. I am doing the PT exercises for my arms, but not much else for my body. ~Julie ",

I have a primary care doctor that I don't particularly care for, but am reluctant to change since I've been with him for 10 years. I don't know when I'll make the move! The dr. my ONC referred me to is wonderful, but her staff seems incompetent (she is my daughter's primary care dr.). My daughter has had such difficulty with her staff with return calls and follow up. So... back to the drawing board-aka the internet! My appt. for my CT scan and marking is next Wednesday. I've had a consultation with my RO and love her! I understand the crying part too. I finished chemo on 6/8 and can't seem to stop. I talked with my ONC yesterday and he said it is perfectly normal... another \"new\" normal. I have been reading a lot of blogs and I will start to read portions of them to my DH and can't get through them. How many treatments will you have? I've only been told I will have 6-7 weeks. We will get through this! ~Julie",

The procedures would be a breeze, but I have a shoulder impingement in my right shoulder and that is the side getting rads. It is very difficult to hold that position for even 10 minutes.

Also, if you play cards, that can be an activity that doesn't have to be strenuous. Puzzles, games, etc. But I agree with Sue, one day missing school for the benefit of your health... think big picture. As for people offering to help, sometimes you just have to be direct and straightforward and ask them for specific help! I am so blessed to have all my family here and one sister, currently unemployed, has become the designated driver if my DH or DD's aren't available. I call and directly ask if she can take me here, there and wherever! I'll be praying that someone can step up and give you some assistance. But again, big picture. If point blank asking doesn't make you comfortable, it isn't worth the stress!! Suebee: DH retired in 1996 from Davis-Monthan in Tucson, AZ. We were stationed in Vegas (Nellis), England (RAF Mildenhall), DC (Andrews) and Tucson (Davis-Monthan). Most of my moving was while my dad was in the Navy. Canada, Midway Island, Monterey, CA, San Diego, CA, Brunswick, GA and Barbers Point, Hawaii. We lived at Iroquois Point housing in Ewa Beach. Were you at Hickam? What years were you in Hawaii? I met DH in Sunday School in Hawaii, been married 33 years! I miss the lifestyle of the military, this civilian stuff is so different and it's been 15 years already!! It is so interesting to hear different perspectives on boob size! Having been a 46DDD before BMX, I am sooooo excited to have little tatas and separated cleavage! My boobs were like two extra apendages and also a shelf. Any food that missed the mouth, rested on my shelf for comsumption later. And yes, I do look at everyone's  boobs now!! We were watching TV last night and I said to DH, \"her boobs look like a good size!\" DH, \"yeah, I didn't notice!\" I guess I have a lot to learn before my exchange surgery. I am currently at 450cc filled and an thinking about one more fill of 90cc and one more fill of 60cc. That will put me at 600cc. I told the doctor I wanted to be a C cup since I don't ever remember being that small! I also want to lose about 60-70 more pounds. That's one reason I wanted to hook up with people interested in exercising in the midst of all this. I really need the accountability. However, at this moment, I have absolutely no energy and am still struggling a bit with nausea. We went to my parents house yesterday to celebrate father's day and my mom's birthday and I was so exhausted, I could hardly keep my head up. The thought of doing anything more than walking to the car is just too much! Maria, what class do you teach? My BIL is a personal trainer, but my physical therapist said nothing more than stretching at this time. I can't wait to start walking again! Ya'll have a good day, ~Julie",

I googled BPA and Tupperware as well as BPA and Rubbermaid and have decided I will toss most of my Tupperware.

The Rubbermaid items I have say they are BPA free on the Rubbermaid website. Food... While I want to eat healthier, I have difficulty with my picky taste buds.

One thing I have noticed is that my mastectomy incisions never did itch or cause any problems. Unlike my port incision, it has been driving me crazy itching! With the rads, my right incision is getting patches of red, but nothing uncomfortable yet. I just keep using my Rx cream. My mom had her PET scan today, I'll let you know when we get the results.

I've been a bit depressed with my inability to do things physical. But, thankfully, my radiation burns have really healed well. My ONC's office had a \"New Beginnings\" class last Friday and I got a great med for the missing skin in my armpit! It has almost completely healed. I am sooooo looking forward to beginning walking again and being able to swing my arm! I felt like I should have had it in a sling just to keep it still. It's amazing how missing skin in the armpit can really change the way one walks! The rash on my back and the rash/burn on my chest and clavical are pink and look so much better. I got a rash/yeast infection under my right boob that the dr. gave me some sample meds for. I mix it with cortaid and it has really helped. I also will be able to start wearing clothes again! I've been wearing t-shirts that DH bought at Wal-Mart with a shirt over them. My clothes would be destroyed with all the creams I'm using. It takes about 15 minutes additional time after my shower to get all the med creams applied!  The burns and rashes put a complete halt to the PT exercises. Tooooo painful. But not for long! A good friend is participating in a 1/2 triathalon. She has lost 80 pounds and has been such an encourager to me through all this. I can't wait till I can do that with her.

Melanie: I am so glad that you are on the home stretch. I can't believe you are almost done!!! YEAH! And yeah on the hair too! I looked in the mirror this morning and the one eyebrow hair on the left side that was hanging on was gone! But upon closer examination, I have 3 baby brow hairs coming in!!! I was so inspired that I took my eyebrow pencil and drew on very light brown brows for the day!! I had a very busy day today. Started with pt at 8am, was so glad, cuz radiation was at 10:00am and I was nice and stretched out! On Friday I remembered I had my pt appt. and had to change my rad appt. They were very accommodating. As a matter of fact, my nurse, Sandy, said they had an opening at 4pm daily, if I wanted to moved my slot from 8:15am to 4pm. YES!! So, starting Thursday, I go in at 4pm instead! I need to get some sleep, 6:30am comes awful soon! Have a great Tuesday! ~Julie",

Then I married into the Air Force and moving was very different!!! I wanted to just play in the empty boxes with my girls, not have to empty them!!! Memories... Shannon: I wish I lived close enough to walk to get my errands done. Even though we are only 1 1/2 miles from our grocery store, the road isn't safe to walk. Four lanes, too much traffic! I am impressed with your drive. Keep it up! Barbara: Been thinking about you today and praying everything went well. Melanie: What about the dr. that \"seemed interested\" in employing you? Did you have any SE's from your rads? I can't remember, did you have surgery before your treatments? Red: How are you doing? It's been about a month, right? Sue: How are the ladies doing? Hope the band helps in the long run. Well, I have 5 treatments left and have developed some issues! My back has decided to join my chest and break out in a rash and my underarm is peeling. YUK! Got two Rx's for it. One is silverdene (sp) and the other is a cortisone Rx. My RAD ONC said this was pretty normal, but is surprised that I am having these SE's since my skin was looking sooo good. She was so sympathetic and very encouraging that the meds will help. We also discussed my exchange surgery and she confirmed what I have been reading about reconstruction and radiation. I will probably not have the surgery until February, 6 months after my last rad treatment. She said that she wouldn't recommend it any earlier due to the cell damage that radiation does. I am very glad that the surgeon left as much skin, she said that was also in my favor. I am NOT looking forward to having these deformed tenants until then, but I want to give my skin time to recover from the damage of rads. Final five countdown! ~Julie",

      "Content": "Jun 24, 2011 11:42AM ImJulie wrote: Hello ladies! I had my labs done on Wednesday morning, ANC and white count is back in the normal range, YIPPEE!! Then went and had the echo, xray and bone scan. It was a long day and I took a  3 hour nap when we got home. I'll find out the results when I meet with my ONC next Wednesday. I had quite a day yesterday. I went for my 6th fill at the PS. We discussed my exercising and rads beginning. He reminded me that rads bring different circumstances and potential problems with TE's and wanted to make sure I was completely aware. I AM aware. When he was finishing up, we were having a conversation and my DH, who was standing at my feet, said my eyes rolled back and I started to lean forward. My memory is that as I was watching PS talk, everything started to go white. PS started to shout my name and slap my face. Then I felt water and a wet papertowel on my forehead. I remember thinking, \"why are you yelling at me and what's with the face slap??\" He immediately lowered the bed, so my head was lower than my heart. I knew I was light headed, and I didn't pass out completely, but apparently I wasn't responding fast enough. I remember not being able to speak above a whisper and I told him I was dizzy. My arms, hands and legs started to tingle. PS said he wanted me to go to the ER just to make sure. I kept telling PS I was going to be okay, but DH said \"no, we are going to the ER\". I think it kinda freaked him out see my eyes roll. PS's office is located next door to the hospital, so he called 911 and the paramedics came and got me. It took about 45 minutes waiting at the ER to get a room. By then, the tingling had stopped and I was actually feeling better and I certainly wasn't in a life threatening circumstance. They drew blood, checked my vitals and said I was a bit dehydrated and my BP was a little low. Combined with anxiety (I think from \"rads may very well complicate things\" I know I was anxious, but didn't think I was THAT anxious!) was probably what caused the lightheadedness. They gave me a bag of saline and checked on me throughout the afternoon. We finally left around 6:30pm. Even though I felt better from the incident, at about 1pm, and while the paramedics were still with me, my chest started to hurt from the TE injection. I had decided not to have a double injection (120cc's) and instead opted for a 1 1/2 (90cc's) as I seemed to tolerate that okay the last time I had a 1 1/2. Well, not so much this time... the pain was as intense as the double and I am back on the percocet. Laying in the ER, DH and I decided that was to be my last fill. I am excited to have made the decision, not just to be done with it, but to be small!!! I will be happy with a B cup if that's what I end up being. I was aiming for a C, but I really don't mind if they are not a C. I was so big before, and after looking at a picture of my girls taken the morning of surgery, that small is going to be such a gift. I also have ~60 pounds to lose, so that will make a difference in my final look. I haven't bought a pretty/sexy bra since my oldest was born in 1984 and I think I am way overdue for one! Also, reading about everyone's experiences, I never thought of myself as deserving of not only a sexy bra (mostly because my girls were NOT sexy), but I couldn't justify the cost of an expensive pretty bra. Well, I'm over that!! I am so excited to bra shop! Of course, it won't be till Oct/Nov, but I'll be ready! Today I had an eye appointment. I've been struggling with a drippy left eye for a while. In 2009 I had eye surgery to expand my tear duct and thought that would take care of it. But for the last month, I have had problems. Eye Dr. flushed my tear duct, yet again. Not a pleasant experience, but if it helps... I got another Rx for drops and hopefully this will clear it up. I go through a ton of kleenex with this! Maria: Congratulations on your surgery! I thought about you a lot yesterday and am praying that you heal quickly! I'm so sorry you had some icky sickyness. Looking forward to updates! Supersally: Hahaha! \"Tree rings\" - that is exactly what my nails look like! That's one SE I had never heard of! Shannon: I hope you went ahead and had the US. Like everyone is saying, if only for peace of mind. Gotta take some more drugs and a nap! Hmmm... but I need to check out that website from Renn first! ~Julie :-)",

Maria: I hope you had a good day of rest today! As for boob greed, I am beginning to understand! I come from a very different place than most of the ladies here! Having been so large since high school and my oldest sister is barely an A, I often heard the comment, \"what happened to you?\" I even heard the comment that my breasts were \"freakishly\" large. Many comments were very hurtful. When I was 18, I followed the yoga book, Richard Hittlemans 28 Days of Yoga, or some such title. I lost about 15 pounds and really felt great. A friend (an adult woman in her 30's), actually said, \"You look good, too bad you couldn't have lost it in your breasts.\" I was floored. So I thought, everyone else thinks they are ugly too. I'd heard enough of those type of comments and that's probably why I didn't have a very positive image of myself. I usually would be the first to make a snarky comment about my boobs, mostly to head of anybody else doing so. It was easier to make fun of myself than to hear others do it to me. I think it is also why I didn't really care if I gained weight. I would rather have a large body to match the large boobs, than to have a small body and gigantic boobs. The attention was soooo unwanted and I so desired to have not just men, but women too, look me in the face and not the chest. I honestly thought that women who had breast implants had NO IDEA what they were doing. I remember when we made the decision to have the BMX and implants, I laughed at the idea that it would be ME getting implants!! But, now I get to decide what will be pretty!!! I have a totally different perspective and am not as judgmental. I also am learning from all of you and am very thankful. I love the talk of boob envy! I think I had boob envy all along, but didn't have the courage to make changes. I struggled with augmentation surgery for about 10 years when I finally decided to lose weight and then pursue it. I had lost about 25 pounds. Then... I found a lump and the decision was obvious, and much sooner than expected! In looking at the mirror, I am happy to stop here. I don't know actually what size they will end up, I know they have at least 540cc's each, not to mention whatever was filled during the BMX and TE implant. So, yeah, I'm good! I can't wait to start walking and making some real changes! I have 4 more pounds to lose to get to my first goal! You all are sooo encouraging to hear that you are able to be active. Have a great weekend everyone! ~Julie",

Today was my port removal surgery. It went very well. I absolutely loooove my surgeon. He is the most gentle person. When I got to the Day Surgery department, he came out to the waiting room to speak to another patient. He stopped and asked how I was doing. He is not the kind of doctor that is rushing. He always takes time and speaks softly. When he came in the pre-op room, I reminded him of how close the TE was to the port. He wasn't snarky and \"yeah, I know...\" he said, \"thank you for reminding me, I did see that it was close, but it's always a good thing to remind me.\" The surgery started around 1pm and I was home by 3pm. Slept until 5:30pm, when I woke up I could feel the numbness wearing off, so Percocet was on the menu. At first I was really ambivalent about having the port removed. On the one hand, I was glad and it solidified the end of chemo, but I also am concerned that if I have a recurrence, I shouldn't have had it taken out. But, after talking to my surgeon, he said if you leave it in too long, it can be very difficult to remove, it becomes part of you! I guess I can always have another one put in, if needed. My radiation appt. yesterday was changed to tomorrow, so I have that to look forward to! Then I actually have two days without dr. appts.!! YEAH!! My hair is starting go really show, very fuzzy!

I must have missed the post about the black bean brownies and the meatballs. Can someone message me the recipes? Today was the mold and marking day at RO. About an hour before leaving, I took 2 percocet, cuz I knew my arms would be hurting. Then I started to get anxious, which just isn't like me. I started to get sweaty and nauseous and ended up losing my breakfast. By the time we got there, I was in tears and completely embarrassed. The nurse, Sandy, was so compassionate and sweet. Gave me a hug, which I really needed. Denise did the CT scan. They made the mold, did the CT scan, marked with 3 tattoos and took pictures. I found out I will have 28 treatments. RO said I wouldn't need any boosts because my tumor was so small and the margins were good. Like a minnow in the ocean! Denise said she would call me to schedule my next appt. which will be the \"dry run\". Then I will be put on a schedule to begin treatments. I'm glad to get this started, I think the wait has been causing some of my anxiety. Have a good day, I gotta get back to work! ~Julie",

I no longer will have that problem though! I usually had shirts with shoulder seams 2 inches below where they should go just so the front wouldn't pull between the boobs. I had to buy a 2x just to fit the boobs. I am so excited to be able to buy xlarge, with medium in my future! YIPPEE! I had my appt. with my surgeon today. I am scheduled for pre-op Monday morning for port removal surgery on Tuesday at 1pm. I told him that I had read that some people have their port removed using local anesethia. He confirmed that and I started crying. I told him I didn't think I could do that and would it be possible to sedate me? I don't know why I have become such a wuss. You would think with everything I've gone through, that simple procedure would be a piece of cake, but mentally, I can't wrap my brain around being awake and having them pull that thing out. My anxiety level seems pretty high. I need to look into some anti-anxiety meds. Monday afternoon I have my rad appt. for the \"dry run\". Once that is done, I will be put on their schedule and the rads will begin. Finally... ~Julie",

Suebee: The pictures do look great! At first, I was so happy that there were actual people I could converse with that had \"been there\". But now that I got the go ahead, I am so apprehensive to look very much. I decided I would check out the hair board, and some of the construction threads. I was going to look at the \"burned\" by radiation, but thought I would wait and see if I have the need, a bit reluctant to see what \"might be\". My DH says I will create more anxiety for myself if I am worried about what \"might take place\". He is right, of course! If it happens to me, I'll check out to see what measures are taken to correct it. Maria: Hope you enjoyed/are enjoying Chicago and finding the perfect house! Red: I'm jealous! I have probably 3 more months! UGH! I saw this evening that I now have stretch marks on the left side due to the TE. Any suggestions for getting rid of them??!!! Melanie: You should be almost half way done, right? So excited for you! How is everything holding up? I had my pre-op this morning. All went well. Got a call from my RO office, one of their machines was not working, so my \"dry run\" is moved to Wednesday. More delays... dissappointed that it will be September before rads are done. Oh, well... Gotta keep smiling! Getting very fuzzy wuzzy, my sister said it looks very light, but can't tell if it will be blonde or white!! Was a dark blonde before BC. After all the problems with constipation, I've been struggling with exactly the opposite all weekend. Guess I'll double up on the percocet! I think I ate too much fruit!! Ya'll have a great week! ~Julie",

When things start to get stressful, close your eyes, take some deep breaths and think of the beach! Red: Are you still on vacation? I can't remember! Renn: Thank you too for the pep talk. I have read it about 5 times! I have completed 17/28. My only issue so far is a red spot the size of a nickle on my shoulder/clav area. My rad tech said that radiation likes folds in skin and when I put my arm above my head, it creates a fold... I also have some pinkish color on my chest. I've been diligent with my rx. I am going to have to start thinking about my upcoming exchange surgery, but am more of an ostrich at this point. Don't want to think about being immobile again, on pain meds again... all of that which I know. Wishing I didn't have to go through it doesn't make it less real!! I've been reading on Breast implant 101 with whippetmom, she is so helpful, but it all is so much! I'm just in a funk about it all... Ya'll have a good week! ~Julie",

Over the weekend, I developed a bit of a rash on my chest. She suggested OTC cortisone and said if it doesn't help, she will order an Rx. I asked the pharmacist what is the strongest OTC cortisone that I can purchase. She said 1% is the strongest before a prescription and to get the cheapest! Started it this evening. I'm hoping it will reduce the rash. I asked her about the pain I've been having in my legs, difficulty in standing up. I don't have pain once I get walking, but standing up is unbelievably painful. Of course, I'm thinking the BC has mets to the bones. (Another reason for such weepyness last week.)  I asked if that was an SE of rads. She said no, not from rads, but that chemo can have some lasting effects, what with the steriods and neulasta shots combined with the chemo meds. It was just very good to talk with her. I wish I could meet with her every day instead of just every Monday! Red, you are inspiring! I haven't walked for an hour in almost a year! I am good to get in 10 minutes and I'm so tired I HAVE to stop! And Sue with your bike riding! I love to read about all of your progress, it is very encouraging and I can't wait until I can participate in the discussion with my exercise routine! Renn, do you go to a gym to use an elliptical? Gonna go and do my arm exercises! YEAH! ~Julie ",
