I'm currently at 400 ccs and he feels he may want to stop here. I had both of my breasts irridated almost 19 years ago left and 10 years ago right respectively. The radiated areas are not expanding like the rest of the breast on both sides. Although he was more concerned about wound healing with me, which is not the case at all. I knew these limits I might face prior to surgery since the PS discussed it with me. I was just feeling a bit discouraged and ended up texting him stating \"I hope I'll look ok\". He replied \"We'll take it one step at a time. Try not to worry\". I appreciated his comments and support. I never was \"all about my breasts\" but after my bilateral mastectomy, all of a sudden my breasts became more important! After going through DCIS surgeries 3x in nearly 19 years, 1/3 of my life, i guess my breasts have always been on my mind! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„",
