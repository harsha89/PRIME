I've just noticed the blister on the lower corner of my only boob has opened and gotten sticky and weeping. damn! I use aloe Vera 100% gel, cavilon ( my ro told me to use it) and I've been using prescription silver sulfadiazine 1% as ro directed. grrr what do I do now, any ideas? My rads are left side including axilla and clavicle, and up left side of neck to near ear. Dx 11/22/2010, IBC, 6cm+, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I'm on a shirtless, baking soda mixed with water and glaxol base and silver creme plus antibiotics regimen. no radia or hydrogel seems to be around here ( London, Ontario) and an attempt to get duo derm something I thought similar was nixed by my RO. spent a couple days in hospital:( sadly the mx felt better than this. I'm now done- Friday will be a week since finished but i finally agreed to the percocets for the pain. Ughh this better be over soon. My neck is blistered and peeling, centre of chest raw and open, and clavicle blisters opened... underarm and axilla I am hoping are almost done their worst. never ever again rads! I thought was easy compared to my chemo, but damn I was wrong. Radiatherapists are as helpful as they can be just said \"adverse effects\", and all the baking soda advice. Which stings so. I hope helping.",

Honestly ive seen lots of others doing rads here that dont have it the way i do. Im very fair skinned and maybe thats my problem. Lol well what doesn't kill me makes me stronger. Hugs Diamondgirl- I have some miaderm my friend brought me and I'm trying that. Yes I start my steroids tomorrow for a week. Must be we both had/have the same reactions. I tend to get nausea from steroids so I had to have some iv antibiotics firsT because sores are open and infected. All in all I'm hoping to never see rads again Goldiebelle- so sorry for you! thank god for the pain meds. Hugs",
