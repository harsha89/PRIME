I got married in July and I was the happiest person in the world. I have a wonderful husband, a great family, but since I found out this my life has turned upside down.. I cant sleep, I havent eaten anything in 5 days I've lost 8 pounds in 4 days and I was only 125 all I do is cry. I do have a lot of great friends and family who have been very suportive, but they can't really feel my pain they have never experience anything like this. I dont know what to do, I am so worried, I just wish it was me instead of her. I dont know if I can get thru thi. Is it ever gonna get easier???? Please help me because i can not take this anymore.

We are so much better today, my mom is doing very well she is not as stressed and I actually ate first time in five days. Her situation is not as bad as we taught (you always fear the worst). She is having lumpectomy March 2 and will prob have chemo for some time afterwards, but it did not spread anywhere else.. Her lymph nodes,lungs,bones and heart are clear so that was a relief. All we have to do now just be strong and be there for her and support her in every way. She is very strong and healthy otherwise so I think with Gods help she will be ok. We are just taking one step at the time.. Thank you once again for your support. This is a great place where you can talk to people who understand and wanna help you... Thank you, and I wish you all the best!! <3",
