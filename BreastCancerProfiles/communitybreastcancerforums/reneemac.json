I also used the lip balm and throat losengers that I brought from home. I used my I-Pod to keep myself from hearing the hospital sounds. I also had my robe but only used it to cover myself while in bed. A nurse brought me a care packet with liquid soap, mouthwash, toothpaste and a toothbrush. Although I had the toothbrush and toothpaste with me, I gladly accepted the packet and have used the liquid soap since I have been home, since showering with the drains is an ordeal for me.",

My oncologist suggested that I take it with Vitamin E to help with hot flashes. I don't have the Vitamin E yet as I ordered it throught the mail. I am a little nervous to start it.

I actually slept in my own bed last night and woke up at 5am to use the bathroom, then spent the rest of the time in the recliner. I have an air mattress and I am going to try that tonight. Part of my concern with all of this was that the general surgeon had only disabled me through June 22, when my surgery was June 2. The State of California disability office is difficult to get through to, but today the automated system told me that they are paying me for 17 days - June 22 through July 7, so the GS must have completed the disability paperwork to extend. My company has a supplemental plan that has been wonderful - I am actually making around the same amount as I was when working, so I feel really blessed! I have a list of questions for my PS when I see him on Tuesday. I have read on here that the exchange surgery can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months after the last fill, so I want to know what his standard is so I can prepare. If it's only 2 weeks, I'd prefer to stay disabled until then. If not, I can understand having to go back to work and then out again. My employer follows FMLA and I have used 6 of the 12 weeks thus far, but then again, I am the HR Manager for my area and never received a FMLA letter and doubt that they would hold me to the 12 week limit. I have been achy for a couple of days. I think it's because I went through my 8 year old daughter's room, cleaned and purged the toys that she no longer uses. It looks great but my muscles ache. I also started my exercises this week and that's bound to be part of it. I took my tamoxifen this morning. I am hoping for no side affects but we will see. Thanks again, lovely June ladies. I love you all!",

I spent the rest of the night in my own bed on my left side, so I got a total of 10 hours sleep. My 8 year old daughter wants to sleep on the air mattress with me tonight so we'll see how that goes. It's in the living room with a perfect view of the television, so I am not sure that sleeping is what she wants to do. Day 2 of Tamoxifen and none of the advertised side effects so far. I am keeping my fingers crossed! Body image - well, when I first saw my flat breast in the mirror, I was reminded of a joke that was told to me when I was in 6th grade by a very mean classmate - \"Renee, you are a pirate's dream. You have a sunken chest!\" None of my family, expect for my DH thought it was funny. I thought that the right side was ugly until my DH told me that the ugly part had been taken away in surgery and that my breast was beautiful. I still tear up when I think about that comment. I remember one of the surgeons telling me that this would be a work in progress for 9 months to a year, so I shouldn't worry about what it looks like along the way. My biggest issue right now is keeping the camisole that I wear in the right spot. Because the left breast is bigger than the \"under construction\" right one, the cami slips over to the right and I have to adjust it numerous times throughout the day. On the positive side, it's nice to not wear a bra!",

Laurie - I know what you mean about the expanders sitting high on your chest. That's the way mine was for a while. It is dropping as time goes on, but I can still see a \"bump\" on my chest where it shouldn't be. I saw the GS yesterday and he said that it was looking good and that it should drop even more as time goes on. Regarding the cones, is this for the nipple replacement? I am not sure that I will have that. I am thinking that tattoos may be better as I don't want one of the nipples to always be \"at attention\", if you know what I mean. The \"burning\" sensation is something I get as well if I do too much. My body tells me about it when that happens! A week before I went back to work, I planted seeds in my garden. Boy, did I pay for that for about a week! My green beans, cucumbers, squash, tomatoes and strawberries are doing fine, but what a price to pay for veggies and fruit! I try to be careful now as to how much I do around the house and the garden. I finally got the disability issue taken care of. My PS office sent the information directly to a claims rep and he promptly went on vacation without taking care of it. Since I hadn't been paid in almost 4 weeks, the state had the PS office send the paperwork to another office and a check was cut and I received it on Monday. Thank goodness! I am still not working a full 8 hour day. I feel like a big baby. My GS said not to push myself and that if I was tired after 5 to 6 hours, to go home. He suggested that next week, I increase the work day by an hour or so. Since I'm a salaried employee, I don't get docked pay if I leave early. He did give me 2 more weeks of PT after this week, so I leave early twice a week for that anyway. My boss is in another state and is 2 hours ahead of me and has told me to go when I get tired. If I followed that advice, I'd leave NOW - LOL. I did talk to the GS about an insurance issue I was having. I have a PPO and my insurance denied a claim for an assistant surgeon who was in OR during the surgery. I had no idea that there would be an assistant there and the PPO denied the claim, saying there was no medical need for an assistant. The GS said that they use an assistant for every surgery. I told him that I had filed an appeal of their decision and that the insurance company would probably contact them for backup. He said that if the PPO didn't pay the bill, they would waive the fee. He told me to keep him posted. Come to think of it, neither the GS or the PS have billed me for anything yet.",

I have been back to work since August 9 and I normally do not work a full 8 hours - most days are 6 to 7 hours. I do commute 1 hour each way, to and from work. I get up early to walk 15 minutes - this is not \"power\" walking; just normal walking around the neighborhood. After that, I do my exercises for 10 minutes. When I get home from work, I have a small burst of energy until around 8pm and then I fade away. Bedtime is normally between 8 and 9pm and when I get up at 6am, I am still tired. I am on Tamoxifen and also take a Vitamin E to help with the hot flashes, although I think the Vitamin E is INCREASING them - LOL. When I told the GS that I was getting tired quickly, he said that this would get better with time. When I was not working, I was not as exhausted as now. The only change that I can see is the increased activity of work. I do have physical therapy twice a week but that has been the case for 6 weeks. The weekends are not as exhausting as the weekdays.

I've been on the tamoxifen for 30 days now and he wants to wait another 60 days to see if the side effects ease up before he thinks about changing the prescription.  He told me to cut out the walking in the morning but keep up on the exercises that the PS gave me. He said that I needed to add in my commute time to any working hours and that I needed to make sure to leave work when I was fatigued. He asked how my employer would react if I had to work part time for another month or so and I told him that I didn't think it would be a problem - they've been really good about my schedule thus far. This is the last week of physical therapy and I am hoping that ending this will help with my energy level. I spent the weekend with some friends in the hospital. These folks are in their 70's and like my surrogate parents and we live about 1/4 mile from them. The husband was hospitalized on Saturday for liver and kidney problems and I spent 6 hours with them while he was in ER on Saturday until their youngest daughter arrived. My DH and I went to see them last night and it looks as if he's going to have surgery to remove his gallbladder and gallstones. Being back at the hospital where I had my surgery brought back some memories - not all pleasant. Of course, this is the same hospital where my own mother passed away and my beautiful 8 year old was born, so there are good and bad memories. I'll be back there in December for the exchange surgery. It was not a taxing weekend. My son, who is 24, went with some friends to \"Burning Man\" - it's an art event being held in the desert of Nevada. He'll be gone for the whole week and out of cell phone range, so I am a bit nervous. My DH tells me that I need to calm down and get used to this, since it will be the same when he moves out.",

I had to travel for work this week and was exhausted, but my boss told me to work half days on Wednesday and Friday and I took him up on that. My fatigue is not gone but it is not as bad as it was. Also, GOOD NEWS. The metal in my TE DID NOT set off the security screening at the airport! LOL. I was figuring that it would and it didn't. I had to fly to Phoenix and back in a day and that was an experience, considering that I couldn't lift my suitcase with my computer and projector in it. I was thankful that some kind strangers helped me with that. Tonight, my 8 year old daughter and I went to a \"Mom and Me\" event at her school. We make a Fall craft wall hanging, ate dinner and had a real good time. It's times like that when I don't even think about the BC. I have some friends who were encouraging me to enter the local Breast Cancer walk, which is tomorrow. I am not sure that I am ready to do that. Is that wrong? And happy belated birthday, Getty!",

I won't see him again for 3 months and then he said I will probably have enhancement surgery on the other side in 6 months. Boy, this is a long and drawn out process, isn't it?

I have my next surgery scheduled for April 13. The surgeon is going to reduce the left breast and add an implant to that side to try and make both similar. I'm going to have to take a week off afterwards and since it will only be 7 days, I'll have to use vacation and sick time.  The doctor told me that I will probably be more uncomfortable with this surgery than the exhange surgery. Not looking forward to that. On a happier topic, we took our 5 day cruise last week and it was glorious. We're taking another one at the end of November but this one leaves from Long Beach, CA. which is closer to home. We drove to Galveston to catch last week's cruise and visited DH's brothers in Houston afterward.",

It said that something was found (but it may be nothing) and I should contact my doctor for more information. When I contacted his office, they had not received the report yet. The doctor needs to review the report and he's out until next week, but there is another doctor who they will call to review it and I should hear next steps soon. My implant on the right side is flatter than normal and the doctor thinks it could be leaking, so I am hopeful that is what was found as they did a \"soft\" image of the right side, since there is only the implant there. I remember when discussing the mastectomy with my surgeon, he brought up that some women choose to have both breasts removed for cosmetic reasons, and to ensure that they won't have issues going forward. I have re-though that decision many times because at the time, I figured if it wasn't medically necessary, why do it? Depending on what I hear from the doctor, maybe I should have done it.

My husband is an insurance agent and says that he just needs to make more money and then I can stay home. Pretty simple, huh? I've also had some hiccups with the disability payments. My state (CALIFORNIA) showed that I could go back to work on July 14 and the PS had to re-certify my disability through the 8th. His office sent the paperwork 2 weeks ago and they are \"still processing it\" according to the person I spoke with yesterday. It could be the end of next week before I have a check approved, and by that time, it will be almost a month with no income on my end. Thankfully, all the important bills are paid and my DH got paid on the 1st. My company has a supplemental plan which was quick to re-certify me and I should get something early next week. I had heard horror stories from employees about our state disability plan. The last thing anyone needs is to deal with these problems while they are disabled. I am thankful that this occurred at the tail end of the disability and not the beginning. My PT is over now. I see the GS on the 16th for a follow up but don't go back to the PS until mid-November to discuss the exchange surgery. GETTY: I am jealous that you get your exchange surgery so soon!! Good for you! And where are you sailing? We are going on a 7 day Mexico cruise the week after Thanksgiving, and it looks like the tissue expander gets to go as well, since the PS told me the exchange surgery would be in December. Well, I am going to get myself together and do a little clothes shopping today. I went to the thrift store yesterday to find pants for my 8 year old and was not successful. I usually find really cute things there for my daughter and they have very little wear. Maybe I'll find something for myself as well. Oh, and I got my mastectomy bra but now I need some fake foob stuffing for the right side. I will have to use the sports bras until then. Have a good weekend everyone!",

My stepdaughter did graduate with honors since they took her GPA from the end of her junior year, which didn't take into account any of her senior year classes. She did end up getting a \"D-\" in the class she needed to graduate and it was enough to allow her to graduate. Two weeks after graduation, she moved in with her mom. Our guess is that our rules were too strict for her. Since she moved, she's lost most of her friends and fights with her boyfriend since he didn't support her moving 50 miles away from him/us. She's going to school part time and looking for a job since the one she had with us she quit. On a happier note, my stepson from my first marriage is getting married tomorrow and my son is in the wedding. We are so excited because my stepson is 33 and we didn't think he would ever get married! My 9 year old daughter and I have new dresses and we are taking my son's girlfriend along - they've been dating for 6 months and are pretty serious. We've already met her parents and brother. MIL is doing pretty well. She reads most of the time and just lays in bed. My husband moved his business home so he could make her meals and give her the medications she needs. She used to do geneology on the computer all the time but now she has lost all interest in it and the computer. I don't think that I could live like that but she seems to be okay with it. We have two months until our next vacation, which is a 5 day cruise to Cabo San Lucas. It is the week after Thanksgiving and just my husband and 9 year old daughter are going.

I told her that I'd be having another operation in December and that the foob would start looking like the other one. She looked at both of them for a minute or two and then started talking about something else. I also ordered a mastectomy bra on E-Bay for $9.

It will be so nice to have almost 6 months free of doctor's visits. I have been feeling pretty well these days. The left side is finally feeling normal and I have very little pain. Lots has been going on in my family. We are supposed to be looking forward to my step-daughter's high school graduation next week but since she is getting a \"F\" in a class that she needs to graduate, we don't know if it will happen. It is a day-to-day thing. Our 9 year old is almost done with 3rd grade and is doing well. My oldest just got his hours cut at work but he is being pro-active and looking for another job, in addition to perhaps working another part time job. My MIL has been in the hospital for a broken shoulder and then went to a rehab hospital for 2 months. She is scheduled to come home next week. Since she will have a walker and wheelchair, we moved her into the room where DH and I were as it is \"wheel\" friendly, The room she was in now belongs to DH and I. It's a 1000 square foot addition to the home and has a spectacular view of the valley. We have a loveseat back there and I come home from work to sit and look out the window, which goes the entire length of the back wall. Finally, life seems to be getting back to normal. Or what my PS refers to as my \"new normal\".",

My daughter said \"I want you to keep busy and think of the story so you won't be scared of your surgery.\" She also told me that she'll be packing one of her favorite stuffed animals for me to take to the hospital. She asked if she could come visit me and I told her that I wasn't sure if she was old enough. She said \"well, I was BORN at that hospital. I was old enough then.\" How do you argue with that?",

Finally, they had me pay my co-payment (outpatient surgery - still blows me away.) The nurse explained that with outpatient surgery, they had the option to keep me in the hospital for 23 hours after the surgery is complete without having to get an authorization from my insurance, so this makes sense now. It's also a lower co-pay. Best of luck to everyone. Enjoy your weekend!",

I had a RMX with TE and it was pretty funny the way the day went; I wouldn't have had time to be worried. I spent the first 3 hours in Radiology with the dye being put into my breast (just a stinging for a few minutes) and of course, the dye took the scenic route to my lymph nodes - LOL. I was scheduled for surgery at Noon and got to the outpatient pavillion around 11:45am. After the nurse got me to change into the gown, the anthestesiologist was ready and waiting for me. Unfortunately, he had to wait a while. I met with the PS and the surgeon, who brought along another doctor to observe and help. When they thought I was just about ready, one of the nurses asked me when my last menstural period was; I told her in January, since I am in pre-menopause. Thinking I might be pregnant (with my tubes tied - sure!) they had to do a pregnancy test before the surgery could start. Of course, it was negative and the last thing I remember is looking at the lights in the OR. About 5 hours later, I woke up in recovery and was moved to a room about an hour later. I spent 1 night in the hospital and was anxious to go home so I could get some rest! Preliminary results show no cancer in the lymph nodes. I follow up with the surgeon on Tuesday. I am so thankful to all of you and to those who came before us with all of the advice and good thoughts! The throat losengers were a life saver; having my I-pod with me helped tune out the hospital sounds; the pain is really minimal. It's just more uncomfortable than painful. The drains are a pain but not unbearable. My wonderful husband set up a recliner in our bedroom and I am camped out in it today with television, the computer and a cell phone nearby. My wonderful friend and hairdresser has meals coming to the house every other day for the next MONTH. I am just blown away by how generous people have been and how supportive everyone has been.",

We drove to Las Vegas on Wednesday for a convention that I signed up to attend months before my diagnosis. The drive took us about 5 hours (normally, it would be half that) but we were slow about it and stopped whenever we needed to. Since I have been here, my convention activities have been minimal. I am taking it easy and drinking lots of water! Yesterday was probably the most \"labor intensive\" day. I had a session to attend for 4 hours and then DH and I took our daughters to dinner. Then we had tickets to see Jay Leno and after his show, we went to the Hard Rock Casino to gamble. I have never seen so much cleavage in my life! I suddenly felt very, very old there and I am a young looking 52 year old. We got home around Midnight. It was a long day and the muscle below my right breast is telling me about it. I've managed to keep comfortable with a Vicodin before any activities and am having my DH drive me everywhere. Today is my volunteer shift at a \"Build A Bear\" activity. I was told that this would be a minimal labor job and it is only for 3 hours. After that, my older daughter and her Dad are going to see Phantom of the Opera and my 8 year old and I will be hanging out. I ran into some folks I know from my division (this is a Kiwanis International convention - a service club) and they were shocked that I came to the convention so soon after my surgery. I told them that my surgeon said that it was okay as long as I took it easy. That's the hardest thing to do.",

Right now, I am feeling a hot flash (probably pre-menopause) and a bit tired. He also told me that as long as I was still taking the Vicodin and didn't have a comfortable movement in my right arm, I couldn't drive. This is okay with me! He also indicated that he didn't want me to go back to work until the fills were completed, and that won't be until the end of next month. I have an appointment tomorrow with the Oncologist.

Another bedtime question - when did you start having sex with your partner/husband after surgery, or have you? Mine is afraid that he will hurt me and the surgeon said to wait a few weeks... well, it's been a few weeks but I don't know what we are waiting for now. Forgive me if this question is too personal.

I guess it wasn't that much of a mistake because he determined that I am anemic and is treating me with vitamin shots. He also suggested taking the tamoxifen half in the morning and half in the evening, or the whole thing at night. He says this could help with the side effects. I haven't tried either one yet. He also restricted my work hours to 6 a day and that's been a huge help. I go in at 8am and leave at 2 or 2:30pm, depending on whether I eat lunch there. The commute is really getting to me. The Oncologist said that I should get a job closer to home (right) or move closer to work (sure). Neither of those things are going to happen!

The PS says that it will take a couple of hours and I should be able to go home that day. He also said that I would only need about a week off after, so no disability for me; I'll be taking sick time. He kinda freaked me out at my last appointment; he had me sign the consent form for the nipple reconstruction and when I reminded him that the expander was still in my chest, he said \"really, are you sure?\" Hmmm, YES I am sure. When I discussed all the details with his scheduler today, I made sure that it was for the exchange surgery. Unfortunately, our cruise vacation was cancelled. We were scheduled to sail on the Carnival Splendor and unless you haven't heard the news lately, there was a fire on that ship a week or so ago. The ship will not be ready to sail until mid-January, 2011. We weren't able to find anything that was comparable on the West Coast so we'll be combining a trip to Texas to visit family with a cruise leaving from Galveston. We'll be sailing in late March, 2011 and I'll have a new implant with me! The PS told me that he wanted to put the implant in first, before he did any adjustments to the other side. But he did say that everything is easier from here. I had posted that my Oncologist wanted me to go on Effexor for the hot flashes. I have the prescription but I haven't started to take it. It says not to take with alcohol and I had planned to be drinking a little of that on my November 28 cruise...... now I am not sure that I want to get hooked on an anti-depressant. Other than that, everything is great! I ordered a prepared meal from one of the local grocery stores for Thanksgiving because we were going to be cruising the next week, and when that was cancelled, we decided to keep the plans for the prepared meal. I will be making a couple of additional sides but everything else is included. Hooray!!",

He did take all the tape off and only left the tape on the incision. He took the tape off the drains on the side of my breast but didn't take them out since today, I had 40ml in one of them this morning and when he drained them, they both filled up to capacity. I drained them again when I got home and they had 50ml and 70ml respectfully - ugg! I am now feeling the drains on the side of my body as they were taped down before and it BUGS. He said everything looks good and told me to start exercising the arm. He also said that the PS may take the drains out and that's okay. But he did take out the pain medication drain and I was happy about that, because it was driving me nuts. The PS put it in a fanny pack pouch that kept falling between my legs and there was no way to keep it up, other than stuff it in my pants. I see him again in 2 weeks and the PS next week. I understand about the sex thing. My DH didn't want to have sex after the diagnosis and he has his own issues in that department - he's on meds that keep him from maintaining an erection and he can't take anything for it while he is on these meds. When we tried to have sex the weekend before the surgery, our 8 year old was bugging us to get out of our room. So it's been a while. He didn't even want to touch the breast before surgery. He told me today that it didn't look as bad as he thought it would. He was in the room with me today when the doctor examined me so he saw it. I'll tell you - this recovery thing is far, far better than the before. The surgery will be over before you know it and you will be on the recovery side.",

The surgeon said not to let the water hit the breast directly but it's okay to let the water run off it. I took a shower today (an ordeal, let me tell you) and sat in my recliner under the ceiling fan to completely dry off - quite the visual there! I laundered the medical bra today and now that I have it back on, the drains feel better. I am down to 10ml every 12 hours so we'll see what the PS says tomorrow about removing the drains. One of them has hardly anything so I am pretty sure that one will come out! I took a Vicodin on Friday before I went to the graduation party. My son drove me to the party and I sat for the majority of the time. Last week, my DH and I went to a musical in Los Angeles that I had bought tickets for ages ago. That experience took more out of me than the party and I rested the majority of the day afterward. I haven't taken any Vicodin since Friday but took some Tylenol for a headache. The pain has been minimal since the surgery so I haven't wanted to take the Vicodin unless there is a lot of pain.",

The PS gave my TE some fluid today and it is uncomfortable, to say the least. He suggested that I come home, take a Vicodin and a nap. I did so. I feel okay but it is stiff. The nurse said that the pressure feeling would go away in a few days, if not sooner. I go back in 10 days for more filling - LOL.",

What a difference between surgeries - I was awake in the PS office and talking to him the whole time. He did cover my face so my germs wouldn't get in the cut that he was making. The nipple is HUGE but he did warn me that it would shrink over time, probably to half the size. I had a little bit of stinging when he put the local anesthesia in, but no pain at all since. I unveiled it this morning for my first real shower since Friday (WOO HOO) and now have to bandage it back up until I see him a week from tomorrow. Otherwise, everything has been going well. Still on Evista and no side effects. My mammogram on the left breast in December was all clear. No recurrence of cancer and I am thankful for every day, and for you precious ladies who started this journey with me.",

So what's been happening since I last posted? I am seeing the Oncologist once a year. I still have mammograms on my left breast and now wish that I would have gone for a double mastectomy. At the time, I didn't want to do it since it wasn't medically necessary, but I now understand why people would choose to do it. I never had the nipple tattoo - the PS never followed up with me on when the tattoo artist would be available and I decided that it really wasn't needed. I have no feeling on that side and the breast kind of looks lumpy in places, but it's mine. The left side is bigger (I call it my \"enhanced breast\", due to the implant that the PS put in.) I wear sports bras only and have found that they are more comfortable than anything else. I've had clean reports since the surgery and am now off the meds, so I can almost forget that I had surgery! Until I look at the fake boob.... I did have my gallbladder removed last September. I think the pain of that was worse than the mastectomy! Family is all well. My stepdaughter has broken up with the BF, moved back into town and we see her pretty frequently now. She's working and seems to be happy. My son got married in 2014 and he and his wife have a 16 month old son - my first grandchild! They live with us now due to a job loss and are saving money to move out. The bonus to all of this is that I get to see the grandson every day! My MIL passed away in January of this year. We are still going through her things and dealing with medical bills that are never ending. My daughter is 15 and going to be entering her sophomore year of high school. I am still working full time and moving closer to retirement age. My husband is still working and will be long after I stop, since he's 9 years younger than I am. We are still cruising for vacations and leave at the end of July from New Orleans, where we have never been. We are spending a couple of days before and after to explore the area. If any of you still read this, I wish you the best and give us your updates. Take care!",

When I was not going anywhere, I put the drains in the pockets of the jackets I wore. I bought a few sweatshirt type material light jackets that zipped up the front and both had pockets on the inside. This was really helpful to carry them. I had a fanny pack but found that this was not a convenient way to carry them.",

It surprised me as well that they considered it outpatient surgery, but my GS told me that this was their way of doing it so my insurance would not require a pre-authorization. In addition, the co- pay for outpatient surgery was less than if it had been an inpatient procedure.",
