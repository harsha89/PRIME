      "Content": "thesedays wrote: LONG story made short: I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection on 10/31, and a re-excision on 11/14 because they found a microscopic spot on the margin, along with two micromets in the sentinel node, both of them too small to be classified as a metastasis. Anyway, I don't have the results from the second surgery yet, and I'm wondering if radiation can be done without clear margins. Has anyone done this and what were your results? I haven't had my oncology consultation yet and can't seem to find any information about this elsewhere. I just do not want to have surgery again. I have IDC, 2.9cm at the biggest diameter but most of that was basically a thread. The cancer was found on a mammogram and too small to palpate through my skin. It's also ER+, PR+, HER-, and low grade, so I do have an excellent prognosis as of right now. IDC, DX 10/3/17, 1st excision 10/31/17, 2nd excision 11/14/17, ER+, PR+, HER2-, low grade.
