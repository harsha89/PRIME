I had a period in April, then it was still there after that finished, so I went to my GP.  He said there was definately a pea sized lump, but at my age it's probably nothing, so come back in six weeks time!! SIX WEEKS! I had an appointment for 11th June, but the worry is driving me mad, so I've brought it forward to this Thursday. I've just finished May's period and it is still there, so now I am concerned that it has been there for nearly two months, and through two periods. I know the odds are in my favour, but it isn't impossible and I just want it sorted to save my sanity! With your situation do what I did, be more firm and demand to be listened to. Even if it turns out to be nothing it will put your mind at ease.  Best wishes x",
