I called my Dr's and they wanted me in right away. That was 3 days ago, today the redness is gone but my armpit is all swolen. I went to my Dr's and after having me find lump she was able to find it as well. She sent me over to my hospital for mamogram and ultrasound. She has also refered me to a surgion. Mamigrams don't hurt nearly as bad as I was led to beleave. Mabe because my my breasts are small? They told me I was done twice and called me back in for more pictures. I tried to guess what I was looking at when the pictures came up, my right breast has a lot more white in it then left.  The ultrasound is painless, just a tad embarasing, and it is a little uncomfortable in the tender spots. The Dr at the hospital said she didn't see anything too abnormal, and it was up to me and my Dr how we want to moniter the situation. They did take measurements of what I'm guessing was a lympnode. I think I'm going to call and ask for a copy of the report because the woman was so soft and fast spoken she was hard to follow, that and my head was spinning at the time. I'm 31, and I have a personal history of cancer-not breast. I'm not to concerned(ok, thats a stretch), but I don't understand how I have something to moniter if there is nothing wrong. If I have something wrong I need to fix it ASAP, I have my family depending on me. Log in to post a reply",
