For instance, I am stage 2a but my doctor told me I have a 20-25% chance of recurrence. He based this on MY personal situation:size of tumour, grade of tumour and the fact that I am HER2 positive. It's annoying to me to see these statistics because then people think that if you have \"early\" stage cancer you're going to be perfectly OK. To me a 20-25 percent chance of recurrence is nothing to sneeze at and will be something I worry about for the rest of my life",

Well I'm glad to say that now that I've been diagnosed with BC, my feelings have not changed a bit! But God forbid you should mention in passing how annoying all the pink is. People just don't get it......and \"save second base\"? How utterly offensive!!!",

When they first found the monoclonal protein it was in my urine and so they were preparing me for the worst-- myeloma or amyloidosis. It turned up with neither. Then over the next six years my kidney function declined as a result of the protein. ....I had the whole round of biopsies again and this time they were SURE they would find something-- well they didn't again. Fast forward to last week when I had a follow up ultrasound to my regular mammogram and the radiologist came right out and told me it was cancer. Wow what a surprise! I was so used to going to these appts and them just saying come back in six months. Anyway I had a biopsy and Mri right away. (This makes it a total of SEVEN biopsies I have had). Now waiting to see the surgeon. My first reaction was so much anger! All those years of tests monitoring and worry, only to have this happen! Still getting used to the fact that I have cancer....just not the cancer I was so sure i would get someday.",

(It is the precursor condition to Multiple Myeloma, which if I only get a Stage 1 Breast Cancer diagnosis, would be far worse) When I had my biopsy on Wednesday, it was the 7th one I have had...so of course from prior experience I know that the waiting for results is the worst part. At least they are being very quick which the opposite of all the other biopsies I've had. So glad I have found this discussion board. ",

The radiologist did try to emphasize the positives, there being so many strides in treatment, though I noticed she used the word \"treatable\" not \" curable\" Hoping that's not specifically about my case. I was actually very glad that she was honest and told me what she thought, giving me time to get used to the idea. I've been trying to convince myself it will be a Stage 1 cancer but of course at times heading into panic thinking about the worst case scenarios. Tomorrow I have an appointment with my family doctor, hoping she may have the biopsy results. (Tomorrow is Tuesday and biopsy was last Wednesday.) Friday I see the surgeon. This is all SO much faster than all the other tests and biopsies I've had so that is a blessing",

She read me the radiology report from the ultrasound. There is a smaller mass adjacent to the tumour which is \"highly suspicious\" and also \"debris going up the duct.\" So these two things made me really nervous as I was hoping it would just be a lumpectomy, I'm now worried they will recommend a mastectomy. By the time I see the surgeon on Friday she will have the test results. Also my family doc said the surgeon I am seeing is excellent so that made me feel better. I think it will be a long two days. I've told my two kids but have not told my parents and siblings as I want to know more when I talk to them. Dreading that phone call.",

I'm not as freaked out as most people would be because I have been living with a precancerous blood condition for many years which has been extremely difficult....however still a little freaked out that she said that just based on the ultrasound!!!!

I experienced what is called \"chemo-induced pneumonitis,\" which was basically an allergic reaction to the Taxol which made my lungs become extremely inflamed and made it very difficult to breathe. I think you might want to get checked for this. My main symptoms were fast heart rate and shortness of breath. This condition is very rare (only 1% of chemo patients get it) and difficult to diagnose--can really only be diagnosed by a CT scan, it does not show up so much on an X ray. By the time I showed up at the hospital I could barely breathe. It was a good thing that I went to the ER when I did. There aren't that many chemo drugs that can cause this, but Taxol is one. I had had three out of four chemo treatments and so they cancelled my final treatment. They said in the large scheme of my total treatment (surgery, chemo, radiation, and Herceptin), missing the last chemo was a relatively small part of it. If this is what you have, treatment is mainly oxygen (I was in the hospital on oxygen for four days) and huge doses of steroids, and I bounced back pretty quickly. (Did not enjoy the steroids though.) Good luck!",
