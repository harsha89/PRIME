Even looking at my chemo bag can make me nauseous ðŸ¤¢. I have been using Biotine mouthwash and ACT lozenges for dry mouth. Any type of dry food like cookies and bars are like cardboard to me! Smoothies and salty things have been my go to. And for some reason a good seasoned steak has been so good! I also like fizzy water over plain water. When I drink plain water I add cranberry juice to it. It seems to help. Staying hydrated is key!! Pokeyspider- my head felt so much better once I shaved it. The wig and even the hats were irritating when I had hair and stubble left. Hope everyone has a beautiful Easter weekend!!",

I agree, if 5 is okay then why do 6? At my last appointment my oncologist asked how I was doing and if she needed to lower my chemo dose! (I am doing the AC). If a lower dose is okay then why do the higher dose? I was shocked and just asked if she thought it should be lowered and she said no. It was very strange. I have my final AC chemo tomorrow! I will be glad to be done but dreading days 4-6 which is when I feel the worst. I feel so good the days before treatment. I have AC every other week. Then on to Taxol once a week for 12 weeks. Hope everyone is doing well!! Debbie",

I was up all night and now completely dehydrated. Drinking lots of water today. I was excited about finishing AC as I thought that was the \"bad\" chemo and now I am on to 12x taxol once a week. Reading some of the other boards it does seem like taxol has a lot of side effects as well Has anyone here started and can give me an idea of what to expect. I start next week. I was hoping it would be a little easier. Also, what does everyone tell the friends who text and ask how you are doing? I know they don't want to hear all the real details. Close friends know what is going on and I talk to them more often. But less close friends I usually just tell them where I am in treatment and say it is going pretty good. I really want to say, I am exhausted, tired of dealing with cancer, bald and have half a boob right now so I feel like s**t. But I put on a happy face Thanks for listening. It has been a long weekend. I love that we can come here and be real. Hugs to all and hope you are having a great day!!",

I start this Thursday. @Laurencl - It does seem like it is so long when I think about 12 more weeks and then I will have 5 weeks of radiation! I have good days and bad days with the whole thing. My Gyno said this will all be a blip on the radar this time next year. I am sure she is right Hang in there! I have the socks with cold packs for my feet and ice packs to hold in my hands. I figure it won't hurt to try it. I am also going to ask about some of the supplements others have mentioned on the weekly taxol board ( B6, B12, ALA and l-glutamine). If it won't hurt to try them I am willing to give it a shot! Hope everyone had a Happy Mother's Day and weekend!",

I believe it is from drinking A TON of water before and during treatment. I also forced myself to eat and drink after. I made myself get out of bed Saturday and Sunday and get dressed even if it was just to sit on the couch. I am at work today but did not come in until 11 and will leave at 5. Treatment affects everyone differently and you have to listen to your body and do the best you can. One of us may be able to work throughout the entire process and someone else may have to take a leave. Hang in there!! I have heard Taxol side effects are easier to deal with (fingers crossed). Kanboka - I have not had any problem with low blood pressure. I am sleeping well at night but I take a Phenergan before bed for nausea and that knocks me out. I am halfway done with AC now and trying to stay positive! But there are times I sure would like to curl up and stay in bed all day and feel sorry for myself!! I hope everyone has a good week!!",

Its great to have forum like this for sharing and learning!! I am receiving AC x4 and then Taxol X12. Started AC yesterday. I went ahead and took anti nausea med (ondansetron) as soon as I left to try to head off any problems. Then took phenergan last night and slept great. I had a mild headache yesterday and today. I came into work late today and plan to work about 6 hours unless I get too tired. I feel a little light headed but I wonder if that is from the Claritin I started last night to help with bone pain from the neulasta. I see some people have delayed reactions around day 5-6. I am trying to drink lots of water but it is not my favorite :(. @santabarbarian My dr. did say if I am getting dehydrated and feeling bad just call and they will do the IV Saline. I think that would help a lot. I hope everyone has a good weekend with mild SEs! I plan to get as much rest as possible. ",

Santabarbarian - thank you for your great ideas for getting fluids and other nutrition! I had my first AC chemo Thursday and worked Friday. But Saturday night I started feeling achy and yucky and it lasted through yesterday. I have all day nauseausness. Never actually throw up so I guess that is good. I took yesterday and today off work but hope to go back tomorrow. I was planning to be one of the perky happy feel good chemo patients! That doesn't seem to be the case ðŸ˜³ Instead I am annoyed and still slightly depressed about the whole thing. Normally I am the positive one in mygroup of friends.

I am still working my desk job which has not been bad. SoloBroker - It sounds like you have a great \"wig lady\"!! Today is day 12 post chemo and my hair is starting to come out A LOT! I am supposed to get my wig today or tomorrow but they have not called me back! I am ready to shave it off and not worry about it anymore. I sprayed a ton of hairspray on it this morning so I would not shed so much at work Dreading the second round this Thursday but know that it is what is going to help me in the long run! And once over I will be halfway done with the AC part. I hope everyone has a great day with minimal SEs!",

I saw some of your posts on the weekly taxol board (at least I think that is where it was ) . Congratulations to your daughter on graduating! My daughter is in her 3rd of college. I am hoping to start getting in some more exercise now that I am done with the AC. I work during the day (desk job) and usually just crash when I get home, but I know it will be good for me to get some exercise in. Will be sending positive vibes that your taxol treatment continues to be uneventful!!",
