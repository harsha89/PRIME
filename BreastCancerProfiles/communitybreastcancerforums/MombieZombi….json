You are welcome to start a thread here, but I wanted to also invite you to the thread \"Spring 2015 Radiation Sisters\" thread. There are lots of gals in there in various parts of rads treatment. You might want to come jump in there. Lots to learn and share. I'm 22 of 33 in my sequence. Here's my thoughts on skin care. Take a shower every morning before treatment and use mild soap. No deodorants or creams before treatment. Skin needs to be totally clean. After treatment you can use what they give you or tell you to use. I have friends that love a Naturopathic cream called Epionce. I can't use it because I'm allergic to lanolin. I have made my own cream with coconut oil, almond oil, aloe vera, calendula oil, emu oil. You can use cortizone cream for itchiness, but it can dry you out. Some recommend corn starch, but my doctor says \"no\" because it's powdery nature will be too abrasive. When you shower, don't use super hot water. Only pat yourself dry. Don't scratch the itches. One gal suggested that you scratch your leg when you feel the urge to scratch places you shouldn't. Apparently that can trick your mind. I haven't tried it yet. If you don't like the idea of tattoos on your skin, photos of your naked body, and have modesty issues like me, talk to your doctor right from the start. I wasn't told what I was getting into in that regard and I have struggled emotionally. You should know that they can use invisible ink for the tattoos in some facilities.",

My BS was great about trying to minimize damage. The parts about hand usage and lympedema risks regarding how much weight to lift and such are up for debate. The risks are real, but I have learned that the arm involved can be allowed to do a lot more than we are sometimes led to believe. I am allowed to do heavy lifting, but only after I do exercises to slowly build up to it AND I am adivised to wear a compression sleeve during the exercises and/or heavy lifting. Even hot tub and hot bath can be low risk activities if you follow the water temperature adviseries. However, I would never ask anyone to follow what I am saying here without also getting advice from your lymphedema therapist and doctors. I'm only passing along what my professionals are telling me so that you can ask questions. The professionals will only tell you standard safety precautions unless you ask specific questions, then they will pull up other resources that show you what is safe if you want to pursue a questionable activity. I have a friend that had ALL of her lymph removed from both sides of her chest, even the upper ones around the clavicle. She was stage 3 and her original pronosis was a bad one. However, she is going strong 10 years later. Now she wants to go back to being on a rowing team. Her doctors are giving her the green light. Having said all of that, I agree with Nat. Axillary removal should not be taken lightly and there is evidence out there to support that doctors may be making the decision to remove too often. There are so many decisions to make. It's a lot to take in. I'm at peace with the things I agreed to. Peace to each of you who are still making decisions.",

But I am learning that letting the worry take over is absolute poison. It will take time to wrap your brain around this, but I promise it will get easier to march forward. I'm so sorry for all of the pain and fright you are feeling. Keep hugging that little one all you can. My husband has always had a good philosophy that I never felt the value of until I got hit with this frightening mess. \"Don't worry about what hasn't happened yet.\" I am learning that he is right. I have spent countless hours crying and fretting over the answers I didn't have yet. Was I going to die, what will happen to the kids? Will it hurt? Am I stage 4? Often I would do all of this worrying and then find out that things were better than I thought. Scary, but not the nightmares my imagination was running away with. It's OK to be scared. Go ahead and cry and feel. But try to breathe and don't worry about the worst YET. Wait for more information. OK, to answer your question. First, even the worst breast cancer does not usually progress so fast that you have to act \"tomorrow\". My dx included Grade 3, her2+. VERY Aggressive. They recommended chemo first. This scared me because I was like you--I wanted it OUT. But I learned that the chemo combo they wanted would shrink my tumor, maybe even to nothing. I did my homework and found that they should be trusted. I got dx in Aug 2014. Chemo started Sept 2014. Surgery--lumpectomy--was January this year. I will add that my tumor was gone and my MRI showed ZERO cancer by that time. Surgery removed lymph nodes and a margin of tissue around the tumor site. Biopsy showed ZERO cancer cells. Not even dead cells. I started radiation in February. Things have been hard, but they've gone well. I know many who are having the same experience. I live in Washington, do you live near by chance?",

Here, they do an ultrasound after the mammo. They checked my lymph. The unltrasound showed a questionable node. Then I went for biopsy of the lump and the node. This allowed them to determine the type and grade and a first idea of size of the tumor. Then I had a breast MRI for another type of measuring and to see if there were things not seen in the other tests. Because I had some small lymph indications, I was also sent for PET scan to make sure it hadn't traveled into more of the body. All of these things will help with staging.

Start a journal and keep a binder. My cancer center had a special service with someone called a Breast Cancer Navigator. You might want to see if that service is available to you. Mine helped me know what to do and in what order. She also helped things move along smoothly when something or someone was delayed. I am thinking you need to arrange to see an oncologist first--my primary care physician helped me with that. The oncologist will have a consult with you and help you get moving forward. I am older than you, but considered young for this mess too. I have four kids. I was terrified too. But I will tell you that I have had great results so far. This journey is very hard, but it can be done. Enlist the support and help of all around you--family, friends, church, etc. If you are religious, get close to your Heavenly Father. Be vocal and find someone to share your feelings so you can sort through all of this. My heart goes out to you. Take care.",
