We got the call from the doctors office on Friday that the pathology showed that the margins were clear and everything was fine. This news really made for a wonderful weekend.  She was even able to have a small glass of white wine for the first time in seven months. :)",

She talked again with her oncologist and surgeon on Friday and they calmed her fears about the lumpectomy still being a good decision.  They basically said that if that was our decision originally, there is really nothing that has changed other than the removal area being a little bigger now.  For those that asked about some of the other specifics of the cancer, I appoligize for not knowing the correct terminlogy right now,  but it is considered quite aggressive and is somewhat hormone receptive(hope that makes sense).  So the plan is to have surgery next Wednesday and if all goes well do six weeks of radiation. She has been told that after that she will be taking a hormone surpressant for five years.  She has the attitude that if the pathology report does not come back with very good news or if anything pops up for her, she will just go with the masectomy route right away and not have any regrets.  She did visit with a very good plastic surgeon during our decision making process and was indeed very impressed by his work.  Our oncologist made a comment to us that she thinks he must have spent way too much time as a kid looking at dirty magazines. :)",

I came to this site back in July when my 35 year old wife was originally diagnosed stage two(no lympnodes) and this place was a huge help with helping me become better informed during those crazy/scary first weeks.  Thanks again. We have had a pretty successful treatment so far.  The first round of chemo was doing its job of shrinking the tumor until the very end when it started to grow a little again.  Once we went to round two (5FAC I think is that chemo nomenclature) the shrinkage started and accelerated quite a bit.  During this time we met several times with the various doctors on deciding which surgery and it was basically left up to us. The surgeon did seem very confident that a lumpectomy would work fine.  We talked with other patients we knew and prayed and finally decided on the lumpectomy and a date of Jan. 21st was set for the surgery.  We went with this route mostly because we figure that since she is not a gene carrier the risk of a future return of breast cancer would be low.  We also have two young kids so I was worried about my wife handling things if we went with a masectomy and had a harder recovery. Last week on the MRI another small lump was discovered growing next to the original.  This is not a new tumor, but just an outgrowth of the original according to what the doctors can see from the ultrasound.  Being that the original is now down to approx. .8 centimeter and this new thing is only .6 the surgeon is still confident he can get this out with good coverage by doing a lumpectomy. As of a few minutes ago my wife is crying now and is thinking she should change her mind and go with the Masectomy now.  This new growth has her worried and is making her think we took the easy way out by choosing the lumpectomy.  I guess my only real question is how bad is the recovery on a masectomy assuming all goes well? I am going to support her decision, but I just wanted a little more perspective. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

It was a tough decision getting to the point that she wanted to do the lumpectomy, but now with this new little growth forming, she is def. thinking it is time to just cut it all out.",
