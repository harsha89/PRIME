Good luck with your lumpectomy...have they already done your lymph node biopsy?  Kelley",

Is this normal or is this depression?  I feel confident in my doctors, decisions, etc.  I also feel grateful for the early diagnosis. At what point do you start feeling like you feel less tired? Should I give into the sleepiness or fight it and start getting more active?  Log in to post a reply",
