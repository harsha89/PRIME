    "Content": "Jesustakethewheel wrote: hi! I have posted here last July because of the dimpling or indentation on my left breast at 2 o'clock (when I lean forward/bend & push my arms against something) Did breast sonography but found nothing just fatty tissue 7 months now, I'm worried again. The indentation is still there, and now I'm experiencing on and off slight upper back pain and I just recently notice that my left breast was now smaller than my right. (It used to be bigger) I'm in deep worry, I'm scared, I fear the worst. I'm only 29 and trying to get pregnant I'm going to consult a breast center this coming May when I get back home to my country. I need to know has any of you ever had this experience? Log in to post a reply",
