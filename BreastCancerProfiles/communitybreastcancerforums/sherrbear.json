I was at my chiropractor and he noticed swelling as well and in my clavicle/collar bone area as well.  I have also had an on/off pain in that area and that is the side the mass is present on in the right breast with some pain in the region of the lump.  I just dont know where to go from here with my strong history of Mom dying at in her 40's form BC and Grama dying at 32 of Ovarion I am petrified.  My question is does cancer cells always show up in the mamm Im just besides myself with all thats going on and my Dr. doesnt seem concerned at all.  I do have a gentic cancer testing appt. scheduled for March 15.  Log in to post a reply",

Again my concern is why are we leaving it in there or why arent they doing a biopsy to confirm.  I have also had shoulder pain along with the swelling of upper arm and armpit swelling and a stabbing pain every now in then in the breast area where the lump is however with that being said I am not sure if this is all related or if I have somthing else that could possibly be going on.",

      "Content": "sherrbear wrote: 2 years ago my GP sent me for a mammogram and breast ultrasound as he found a mass in my right breast. It came back that there was no malignancy suspected at that time.  The mammogram was repeated 1 year later results were mass still there still no malignancy suspected at this time. (that was almost 2 months ago)  for the last month and half I have encountered swelling in my upper arm and in my armpit area it actually difficult to put my arm down without feeling there is something there.  I went for a auxilla ultrasound today and am awaiting the results which they indicated could be Friday or the beginning of next week.. GRRRR... anyways my concern being I am 42 years old, my Mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 45 lost her battle at 49.  My grandmother also had cancer diagnosed at 29 lost her battle at 32. (my Family was so very young when my Grama passed they are unclear if it was uterine or ovarion.)  I am going for genetic testing March 15th. My question is, am I being paranoid just wanting the dr. to remove this lump to confirm that is definitly is not cancer or is this somthing they just generally dont do?  Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

I developed infections and my body rejected the implants, I don't regret having the surgery but often they don't go as surgeons planned",
