Especially since I'm going to have radiation as well. I told my Onc nurses about my concern and it took me 1/2 hour to get a reference to a specialist where I am going to have 6 sessions about how to prevent Lymphedema. I also got a sleeve (even a night sleeve) to prevent Lymphedema before a flight.",

It's very easy to get illegal MJ here, sometimes it feels like almost anyone use it. They, who defends the use of MJ often asks; \"Have you ever seen a person smoking pot get angry and start a fight? I think it's some truth in this and  I believe MJ use is much less dangerous than drinking alcohol.
