I certainly don't have a solution, but I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone in this struggle. The good news is we are both probably healthy! And even if we aren't, we are strong and will find a way to get through it. Even though I still struggle with this kind of anxiety, I've found the thing that helps the best is recognizing that the problem isn't the thing I'm afraid of but the anxiety itself. You're already doing this by posting here. Try talking to your loved ones, not about the mammogram or the possibility of breast cancer, but about your struggles with fear. I've found people are more supportive and helpful if they understand the root of my obsessive thoughts. Wishing you strength and happiness.",
