    "Content": "whatRstatsanyway wrote: Had a SND July 2009. Apparently these nodes were deep and hard to get to. Since June of this year, have had subtle swelling under armpit and along chest. Not miserable pain, but an on and off  dull ache. I had a mastectomy and have no feeling along the scar, nor is it swelling. Did 6 rounds of FEC and 8 months of Herceptin before it had to be stopped. I'm currently on Tamoxifen - could this be causing the ache? I feel no lumps, bumps either along my clavicle, neck or underarm, just this on again off again pressure and fullness under the armpit, along chest and up the side of my neck....any ideas? Thanks!  Dx 4/8/2009, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 2/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
