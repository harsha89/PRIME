Good luck to all of you on chemo right now - take it day at a time.   It's been two years since I started chemo and sometimes it seems like 10 years ago and other times it seems like yesterday. stephanie",

Just a tip for those who are having radiation in the lymph node area - under your arm - DO YOUR EXERCISES!!    The radiation will cause the area to tighten up and you will need to keep it stretched.   I'm already seeing that and I'm doing the stretches whenever I think about it.    Also saw a lymphadema specialists who gave me exercises to do to prevent it from happening.    Was fitted for a sleeve to wear when flying then too - I've worn it once - worked great.    Only those who had lymph nodes removed need to worry about this. Everybody have a great weekend - again - I'm so glad all of you are here - it's great to have people to talk to who KNOW what you are going through. Stephanie",

So far so good - 4 treatments and no redness.   Really not suppose to see anything like that for a couple weeks, anyway. 4 down and 31 to go.   YIKES - that sounds like a lot - doesn't it??    If any of you have any questions - since it seems I'm the only one who has started treatment - please ask.    I will wait anxiously to see how all of you are doing - keep us posted. ",

The place that fitted me for a prothesis told me to wait for about a week after radiation to start wearing the \"real\" prothesis - I've been wearing a different kind through radiation - she said the radiation still in the body could break down the prothesis - that is also why they suggested I NOT wear one during radiation.   Gave me a creepy feeling - thinking about the radiation still being IN me - HEY - ha ha - maybe I glow in the dark!!     Can't wait to wear the new prothesis - it is amazing - feels just like my REAL breast.  Still having some problems with my vocal cords - voice sounds really raspy - like I've had a cold - hoping this will clear up soon - started after about 8 treatments and has continued - the techs said the radiation was spraying my esophagus some so that is why the raspy stuff.   Anybody else out there have this problem??",

Will keep everyone updated on progress!!  Stephanie",

I tell you - reading where some of you are having to leave your families for treatment really humbles me - I will never fuss anymore about having to drive my hour there and hour back every day.   Hang in there!!",

I really haven't mentioned my hair on here - but - my chemo was finished the middle of May - surgery on June 9th and about a month ago my hair was long enough that I was comfortable without wearing a hat - so about three months after chemo ended - I guess.   I still look like GI Jane but most people say the \"look\" is good for me - I just laugh and say - well - don't get use to it - cause it's not going to STAY that way.    Everybody have a good week - rest - take care of yourselves!!  Stephanie",
