Today, I went in for a diagnostic and the spot was still there. They immediately sent me for an u/s. During the u/s, they couldn't find the spot that was seen on mamo. She did find two irregular lymph nodes at 3 o'clock. Honestly, I don't even know what that means. She didn't tell me this, I saw it written on the screen. The radiologist came in and explained that they just want to keep watch on these things, but he really couldn't tell me if anything was wrong. He wants me to come back and have them checked in 3 months. I had a breast exam by my gyno in November. He didn't feel anything. I don't feel anything as well. My doctor won't receive my report until tomorrow. I just don't know what to think right now. I would love to hear from anyone with a similar experience. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

The strength, support and attitudes that I've seen here are truly up lifting. As a mom of three young sons, I spent a good part of the morning dwelling on the \"what ifs.\" Since I knew I wouldn't be hearing from my doctor until tomorrow or even Friday, I felt this was a wonderful place to turn for information. Thank you for easing my fears. Your information was very helpful.",
