If I need to have reconstruction after the 6 month mammogram shows the all clear, then I will worry about leveling things up then\"....but I also did everything they told me....radiation (16 visits) and now tamoxifen. Because of the grade, the fact that I am, somewhat recently, single and need to work, and my margins were clear by a lot, we decided chemo was not for me (for the extra 1 or 2% difference I decided I was not going to pump myself full of chemicals and make myself ill for a few months). I may live to regret that decision but it is what I decided at the time and I do not regret it. I am exercising and eating well to keep the weight off with tamoxifen and an singing in a choir to keep my heart full and de-stress. But everyone is different...some want the breasts gone so they do not have to worry about it....I would worry more if I didn't have them because if it came back, what tissue would they have to work with? Weird logic, I know...but I am satisfied with my decision...surgery was in August and I am now 2 months into Tamoxifen. I do not regret my decision",

Barry, you may want to bring in a minitape recorder so that you can play back what the doctors say. I recorded my meetings with my surgeon and radiologist and I found it incredibly helpful. That your surgeon wants to operate pronto is GOOD! They want to get it out of you before it grows or spreads...this is a good thing. Really...even if it feels scary. The first surgeon I met, who was originally to be my dr., was arrogant and said 'sorry. I am the best but I am going on vacation so you will have to have someone else\"..and while I did not like his attitude (another story), his assertion that he was the best made me very nervous about having someone else. I spoke to the breast cancer navigator about waiting until September and she essentially said \"You do not want to wait...get it gone\"..given she has worked in the field with hudreds upon hundreds of women in the same situation, I followed her lead...ended up with a wonderful, shoot from the hip female surgeon and had the cancer removed 2 weeks later. I simply said \"Take MORE THAN enough...make sure there are very clear margins. I will deal with being lopsided later...right now we are focused on getting this out of me\"...She did.... My wote would be 'just get'er gone'",

They factor in age, size, and, in her case, margins. My margins were wide because I said \"Take more than you need to. I have enough to spare!). In my friend's case, one side showed the margins were too close so they decided better chemo and kill it than the possiblity of it returning. I also worked through the whole event...I took the week off after my lumpectomy because it was planned already as my summer vacation and I had not idea if all the ;fatigue' stuff I had read about would affect me ...I worked through rads...would teach in the am, do a session right after lunch, drive across town for rads and then come back to give feedback to the teachers...not ideal but it was better than going home after rads and staring at the ceiling thinking dark thoughts, which was mor emy fear than the rads. I would say 'Get 'er gone' Barry. It is small now so don't wait until it is more of a problem if you can help it.",

I think it really depends on the chemo cocktail....and your own system. As for rads...keep a huge bottle of aloe vera handy and soak yourskin the morning of, as soon as you get out and whenever you pass by the bottle.

I have enough and if you have to fix it later and even up the other one, I would be happy to become a C cup at that time!.I am not coming back on this table\"....she said when she was doing the surgery she was a bit concerned about the amount she was going to take but then remembered my saying' take a big scoop!' and she went for it....My oncologist reassured me in April about the lobular features and the likelihood of my getting cancer again (low) . I did not have to have chemo. If hey need to revisit the site to ensure he margins are clear, that is a good thing for you, not a bad thing...it means hey want to ensure your health.

I went and sat by his side for a bit this afternoon....have been calling but was given the impression that they did not want people in their way....but I sat there and spoke to him and told him we were all sending him love and that I believ ehe can do this...he can survive this... What we are all going through is scary....pushes us to our core....but how much worse it would be if we were in another country going through something medically traumatic and not speaking the language....don't want to imagine it. thanks ladies:0",

Thanks ladies for being iwth me at my oncology appointment today...I waited almost 2 hours but I don't actually mind..I figure if he is spending time where it needs to be spent, with people who need him to spend it, then I am ok waiting..and he spent time with me too. Essentially, he said he has not seen a case like mine inthe 3 years he has been an oncologist...that going on Arimidex only increase my chances of not getting BC again by 4% but my odds are already excellent (in the 85% range)...I reminded him that 1/9 women in Nova Scotia get BC and I happen to be one of the 'one's...random but there you go...and that neither of us, nor the surgeon or radiologist thought I was a heart attack candidate either but to please give me his opinion so I can weight it with mine. In the end, we decided together that I would try it for 4-6 weeks...by then if I was to have side effects, they would have happened. His wonderful nurse will call me in 4-6 weeks to check in on me...he is ordering a bone scan so I will have a base line and he has given me a prescription for calcium since my blue cross insurance will cover 75% of it. He said it was entirely up to me..my chances are already excellent....but it is 4%....and to see if the pros outweigh the cons...I will give it a try...but I didn't bring the prescription up today...enough change this week...will do it tomorrow when i can talk to the pharmacist",

I eat well, exercize, don't smoke, rarely drink, don't eat a lot of crap etc. etc....was the cell tower that was put up practically in my backyard a factor? I have no idea...I have had about 6 mammograms in my life...was that the cause? fillings? birth control I was on in my youth and into my early 40's...(ex- dr. said I could be on it until menopause without ANY problems...really?) I have no idea what caused my breastcancer...it is random and nothing I did as far as I can tell...stress of a partner leaving and grieving? my wire bras to keep my DD's where I would like them to be? no idea....just know I had it, it is gone and I am doing my best to carry on and hope it does not regroup and appear again.
