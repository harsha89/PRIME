I was just diagnosed about 15 minutes ago with IDC, so here I am! As my Radiologist expected, the tumor was positive for cancer. He said that it has invaded (not sure if that was the word he used) some of the breast tissue surrounding it, but he said that's common and does not necessarily mean it has spread any further than that. I asked if it was aggressive, and he said yes which is good and bad. Good in that it's small (1.5cm) which means it hasn't been there long - so I guess it's early. It's a small area and there's a good chance that it's contained. That's how he put it. Nothing about stage or grade or hormone stats that I see everyone on here has. Is that only something they can only find out from the lumpectomy? I feel like I have less information than I should. Anyone? So there it is. And so it begins... the all out assault on the alien inside me. My appointment with the Surgical Oncologist is Friday at the Mayo Clinic, and I will take the first available surgery appointment they can give me. I'm type A, OCD personality and I will have the strength to get through this, but I have to do it fast. I don't want a lot of lag time to sit around and think about how terrible it is, and mostly how defeated and scared I feel. Oh, did I mention that I was also just laid off from my job. Yeah....there's that too. Luckily I have been able to do a ton of freelance work to keep money coming in, and my MIL has been a Saint. She's offered to pay for Cobra to help us through this. Pity party has officially ended.>>> <<<<The fight has started. And, as my Mom used to say (and Coop brought back this memory for me in her video) THIS TOO SHALL PASS...",

So, I'm cancer free at the moment, yay! And now we start talking treatment to keep me that way. So I meet with my oncologist on May 6th, and then it's on to chemo for me. I'm scared, but I have no choice. I want to do everything that I can to keep the chance of recurrence as low as possible . So, it's gonna suck, but it will get through it.

It's been a whirlwind really, I've been moving quickly on this as it's the only way I know how. Get it done, right? UGH... I had a lumpectomy on 4/2 with sentinel node biopsy - 2/3 nodes were positive. Cue the nightmare music...then I heard the words Chemo and I'm pretty sure my whole body went numb and my knees buckled. I also don't think I was breathing. Also, while my margins were clean they did find some pre-cancer cells on one side, so we are going back in to clean that up on 4/16. My Dr brought it to the board to discuss, and they suggested let's just be safe and get that out of there. I'm all for it, get that melonballer ready and scoop that sh$t out!  In the meantime, it seems like hundreds of appointments are being made for me, and I received my itinerary for next week. I had an appointment with a Radiation Oncologist on 4/17, but now that surgery is 4/16 and I'm not going to be going to that. I know it's not major surgery and technically I will be fine, but last time I was in some pain, took pain meds and slept all day. So, I rescheduled it, but then they were going to give me another Dr because they were trying to reschedule it to a day that I was going to be there already. And, I thought uh oh, what if the other Dr was better and that's who my surgeon recommended? Of course a million things went through my head, and I researched both. The new one was not radiology board certified. So, I panicked and rescheduled it again with the original Dr. who is board certified, but I have to wait until 4/28. Sh&t just got real.  Sorry for the long story, but anyone have specific credentials that they look for in a MO? I'm looking for some kind of oncology genius - how do you pick them out? Where's Dr. House when you need him?????? Thanks!

I discovered a lump on Tuesday, saw my Gyno on Thursday and had a 3d diagnostic mammo and ultrasound on Friday. The radiologist basically confirmed its cancer without a biopsy, I mean..I thought they couldn't say for sure without a biopsy, but he's convinced so there it is... My biopsy is scheduled for Wednesday and I will know my fate by Friday. Needless to say I'm a mess.its been 24 hours and I'm on research over load.

I got nervous so I went to my Dr. Who basically confirmed the lump and gave me an order. I went to a place today who only does women procedures for a 3d diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. Scared out of my mind. After the mammo, the Dr. Came in to do the ultrasound and told me right off the bat, it's not a cyst. First, is it normal that the Dr. does the ultrasound?  So, as he looked at it more he described it as a tumor, dense, lobular and 1.5 cm. I asked what he thought it was and he said, it's a cancer. With that, I almost fell off the table. Then he said that I need to have a biopsy. I said ok, is there a chance that it's benign, he said that there's always a chance, but it will most likely come back as malignant. Second, can a doctor just blurt out the \"c\" word with no biopsy? He proceeded to talk about a lumpectomy and radiation. Everything was a blur. He also checked my armpits and my right breast, they were clean as he put it. Not my words. So, the biopsy is set for Wednesday, and I should have results by Friday. Needless to say, I'm in shock and no idea where to start. Should I call the cancer center or md Anderson? Do I start looking for an oncologist? Any advice would be appreciated.

And, I think it's important to mention that I pushed for the tests and arranged it on my own. My Gyno just confirmed it was a lump so she can write the order . I do have another question if anyone has a chance to answer. My Dr. Described it as \"lobular\". Is that a characteristic of texture or does that give an indication to the type of cancer?  Thanks!",

Specifically, I have IDC. He said that it has invaded (not sure if that was the word he used) some of the breast tissue surrounding it, but he said that's common and does not necessarily mean it has spread any further than that. I asked if it was aggressive, and he said yes which is good and bad. Good in that it's small (1.5cm) which means it hasn't been there long - so I guess it's early. It's a small area and there's a good chance that it's contained. That's how he put it. Nothing about stage or grade or hormone stats that I see everyone on here has. Is that only something they can only find out from the lumpectomy? So there it is. And so it begins... the all out assault on the alien inside me. My appointment with the Surgical Oncologist is Friday at the Mayo Clinic, and I will take the first available surgery appointment they can give me. I'm type A, OCD personality and I will have the strength to get through this, but I have to do it fast. I don't want a lot of lag time to sit around and think about how terrible it is, and mostly how defeated and scared I feel.  Oh, did I mention that I was also just laid off from my job. Yeah....there's that too. Luckily I have been able to do a ton of freelance work to keep money coming in, and my MIL has been a Saint. She's offered to pay for Cobra to help us through this.  Pity party officially ended.  The fight has started.",

I breathed a sigh of relief. He said we caught this relatively early, it's small,  and there's nothing that we see in the films or pathology that suggests any lymph node involvement, but we won't know for sure until surgery. We also don't know the full characteristics yet so we will need to wait until after surgery for that, no hormone receptor info on my biopsy report. He asked about my surgery preference lumpectomy vs mastectomy, and I chose lumpectomy. We talked about genetic testing, but since there is virtually no bc in my family, he didn't think we needed to wait for that to do the surgery, but wanted to leave that up to me. He wanted me to understand that in the slight chance that it came back positive I would have more factors to think about regarding my surgery options, I said I want this thing out ASAP. Lol. Not waiting. So my surgery is scheduled for Wednesday! After that we will discuss treatment and radiation. I'm feeling much better about things, and feel like I'm on the road to recovery now that I have a plan. Surgery in T-5 days.  Thank you all for keeping my spirits up and talking me off the ledge the other day. I appreciate you reading my updates. I really do.  Nikkito, did you get any info regarding your biopsy yet??",

You were right about it being so much easier at a multi-disciplinary facility. A few ladies gave that advice and you were all right.  So right now they are discussing whether or not they should go back in to get the rest of the DCIS tissue or leave it to the chemo and radiation. The issue is the tumor was a grade 3 and he's torn between over treating me (not sure I ever had a problem with that) and taking a chance of that DCIS turning into cancer. I'm wondering if I should think about the mastectomy or do they produce the same results?

You've all been through so much, it's just so inspiring to read. I needed a day away from research and the computer yesterday. I'm in a better mind set today and ready to fight this thing with all that I have. My husband has been amazing, and so have our family and friends. I haven't told many people, I'm just not ready for all of that yet, but the people who I have told have been amazing and supportive.  I'm still not sure what the next step will be, I'm waiting for the Dr to get back to us with the recommendations from the board, but I want to treat this aggressively and I would really like for them to go back in and remove these pre-cancer cells. Whether I have a better chance with a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, that remains to be seen. I just don't want to have to worry that after chemo and radiation it's still a ticking time bomb, and at any moment will turn into a lump. I want to know after everything, I'm clean. I'm also kind of freaked out that they were so convinced that there wasn't any lymph node involvement, but then surprise! there it is! Well, what about the right side then? They said it was clean, but should I ask for another kind of test to be sure? Sorry, panicking again....deep breaths.... I have also decided to make some changes in my diet and try to get as healthy as possible before the hard part really starts. I need to get to a point where I feel strong, and right now I feel like a bowl of overcooked noodles. LOL. I'm scared to death of chemo, but I know I'll get through it. Especially now that I've met such wonderful people here on this board! I also appreciate those of you from AZ offering to meet, once I can actually swallow this lump in my throat and get through an hour without crying - I would love to meet. I'm clear across the valley though, on the west side. We can deal with logistics when I'm up to it, but thanks so much for the offer. It means a lot to me. :)",

I think your theory is correct regarding lymph nodes, but the sentinel nodes are different.  Anyway, have a great vacation!!!! Thanks for the reminder to breath, I do forget now and again.   Az85048, thanks for the support. My Dr told me that no matter the results of the lymph nodes, the treatment would be the same. You're right, he said that I would have a 40% chance of developing LE with that surgery and right now I have less than 10%. And when he said that if I weren't having surgery he would suggest I leave them alone, I just thought you know what, I don't want to spend more time recovering I just want to get on with this and if the treatment is the same why put myself through it. As my husband put it, we are ready for this journey,  the car is packed and there's only one more stop to make.  After that, we are on our way and we won't stop until it's over. Let's not wait any longer than we have to.  Holeinone, thanks, that makes me feel better. I'm gonna ask about the patch. That thing worked like a charm at surgery and made me dopey, which was good too. Lol. That must feel so good being done, and at the 9 month mark. Good for you!!!! Kicks, thanks for stopping in and for the info, but the tone is not necessary. She was merely giving me some support on my decision. I'm sorry for your LE, but no need for the 'tude. We all have enough to deal with.  Have a good one ladies!!!!",

      "Content": "May 6, 2014 08:04PM - edited May 6, 2014 08:05PM by Ddkath70 ok, so today was a tough one. As much as I feel like I have it together, to hear the summary of my cancer and then treatments made me fall apart in the office today. Since this was my first meeting with my MO (who I really like, BTW) we went over everything from when I found the lump to the surgeries, and the plan for the next 4 months up to the next 10 years. Wow, I feel like a basket case!   She gave me so much information, it wasn't too much, just scary. She also told me that because my tumor was a grade 3 and I'm young, she would have suggested chemo even if it wasn't in my sentinel nodes. For some reason, this made me feel better. I have no idea why, but in some weird way I felt a little less betrayed by my body. Weird, I know.  She wants to talk to the tumor board about my chemo regimen, The two choices are dose dense, AC-T 8 rounds 16 weeks, and the other option is TC 4 rounds 12 weeks. She said both are good for me, but was leaning toward AC-T. I would obviously rather the 4, but if the 8 are going to get me the lowest % of recurrence , then so be it. I will get thru it. I talked endlessly about my fear of nausea,how prone I am to it and how sensitive I am to meds. I also talked about my migraines, and asked if she would just treat me like the most nauseous patient she ever had right from the get go, and she said she would. I also asked for extra fluids for both the  headaches and nausea. And I've decided to get my medical marijuana card, just in case. Yes, that's how frantic I am about nausea. When I had Lyme disease with meningitis, I spent weeks nauseous and it was hell. I never want to go through that again.  The tentative start date is May 20th, but I still need to get my port, PET scan and heart u/s if I'm going with the red devil. My mother in law is coming next week and will stay to help me so that my husband doesn't have to take as many days off of work.  So, here we go.  scarves, wigs, bathing caps, fake eyelashes, eyebrow stencils, biotene, ginger ale, ginger tea, pretzels,  eye drops , comfy clothes, new thermometer,  I have a ton of preparing to do.  Shit just got real. ",

First, is it normal that the Dr. does the ultrasound?  So, as he looked at it more he described it as a tumor, dense, lobular and 1.5 cm. I asked what he thought it was and he said, it's a cancer. With that, I almost fell off the table. Then he said that I need to have a biopsy. I said ok, is there a chance that it's benign, he said that there's always a chance, but it will most likely come back as malignant. Second, can a doctor just blurt out the \"c\" word with no biopsy? He proceeded to talk about a lumpectomy and radiation. Everything was a blur. He also checked my armpits and my right breast, they were clean as he put it. Not my words. So, the biopsy is set for Wednesday, and I should have results by Friday. Needless to say, I'm in shock and no idea where to start. Should I call the cancer center or md Anderson?

I'm definitely taking it one day at a time, and even though I've been through two surgeries and so much bad news, I still feel like it's been the easy part of this nightmare. The hardest part is ahead of me, and that alone is scary.  The biggest reason that I'm not sharing on FB is because I was laid off in February (boy, do I sound like a barrel of laughs or what? I'm not used to having so many problems - but such is life I guess) and have been doing freelance work for a few people that I'm friends with on FB. I don't want my diagnosis or the fact that I'm doing Chemo deter them from sending me any more work. I'm extremely thankful for having the opportunity to work from home and make my own hours through this, but I do need to work and can't take any chances of it getting cut.  jhodro: I love your list, and am thinking about how much I am going to save over the next few months on cuts/color. I've racking up quite a bill each month. :)  I went out this weekend and bought a bunch of scarves and ordered a few beanie's online. I also ordered one wig, but we'll see what happens with that. I live in Arizona, and quite honestly, I think it will be way too hot for the wig. I like to have it if I need it.  I still have a few tests CT, bone scan, Port, EKG to get through before starting, and my Dr wanted to see what the EKG showed before making the final decision on AC-T, but it sounds like that's where I'm headed. My MIL is flying in on Friday and will be staying with us to help, and so my DH doesn't have to take so many days off. He didn't want to leave me home alone after treatments,  just in case. He works all over, a different place every day.  I was wondering if you all wouldn't mind sharing some of the products (creams, mouthwash, etc.), medications (nausea, headaches, etc.) or home remedies that have been your saving grace through this so far.  That would be so helpful. I know that there is a large list on a thread that the moderators put together, but would love to hear from you as well. Thanks again! dd",

At the start you just feel like there's bad news and more bad news. You have a lump, it's suspicious,You have cancer, it's malignant, you need surgery, you may need a mastectomy ....just feels like it never ends. So when the surgical oncologist sat down and looked me in the eye with some good news, I wanted to hug and kiss him. And, I will wear a big shirt at surgery for all you pushy girls! Lol. Momto3boys, good luck with your appt on Monday. Is this to go over your pathology from surgery?  How are you feeling, any soreness? Did it take you a few days to bounce back after surgery? I'm not crazy about the thought of radiation either, but I am looking forward to putting this behind me. They gave me a choice, once a day for 6 weeks or twice a day for 3. I don't know if I can get there twice a day and I don't want to push myself.  Have a good weekend! ",

I got nervous so I went to my Dr. Who basically confirmed the lump and gave me an order. I went to a place today who only does women procedures for a 3d diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. Scared out of my mind. After the mammo, the Dr. Came in to do the ultrasound and told me right off the bat, it's not a cyst. First, is it normal that the Dr. does the ultrasound?  So, as he looked at it more he described it as a tumor, dense, lobular and 1.5 cm. I asked what he thought it was and he said, it's a cancer. With that, I almost fell off the table. Then he said that I need to have a biopsy. I said ok, is there a chance that it's benign, he said that there's always a chance, but it will most likely come back as malignant. Second, can a doctor just blurt out the \"c\" word with no biopsy? He proceeded to talk about a lumpectomy and radiation. Everything was a blur. He also checked my armpits and my right breast, they were clean as he put it. Not my words. So, the biopsy is set for Wednesday, and I should have results by Friday. Needless to say, I'm in shock and no idea where to start. Should I call the cancer center or md Anderson? Do I start looking for an oncologist? Any advice would be appreciated. As many others here, I would feel better if I were being proactive so that I can put this behind me.  Dx 3/24/2014, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 2/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 4/2/2014 Lumpectomy: Left Surgery 4/16/2014 Lumpectomy: Left Chemotherapy 5/28/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Chemotherapy 6/17/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Chemotherapy 7/8/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Chemotherapy 7/29/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

Then he said that it's a grade 3, and while the margins were clear for cancer they came back with pre-cancer or DCIS on two of the sides. So now he's bringing my case to the board at Mayo to decide if they should go back in or not . Normally they wouldn't, but bc I'm young and the cancer is grade 3 he wanted to consult with the other dr's. So that's the next step. The one good news was that it was positive for estrogen and progesterone, so it will respond to hormone therapy. But I have to have chemo, that was second big hit and a knockout. I'm trying to absorb this and just feel like I'm in a nightmare. I just want to know that I will be ok when this is over.  My follow up is in 2 weeks and then I will also see the MO about the therapies. One day at a time I guess. I think I'm still in shock.",

So they will remove the pre-cancer cells on Wednesday.  When I asked about the sentinel nodes, he explained that the die tracer goes until it hits a node, since some people have one, two or three that's what they remove. I had three and they all hit at the same time so the fact that two of mine had cancer in them means nothing in terms of the third. The SN are not in a chain, so they really don't know if any others are affected. The chances are low, but no guarantees. So because they are going back in for a re-excision, I have the option of them cleaning out all of my lymph nodes on that side. He said if I weren't going in for surgery, he would tell me to leave them alone, as the chemo and rads would take care of it. Studies and research show that in women with 2 or fewer positive sentinel nodes, half had their nodes completely removed and half didn't, the results were the same because either way the treatment is the same.  It's not like removing them would give me a pass on chemo, and after much thought and agony I decided against it. So, I'm trying to hold my head up and accept this hellacious hand I've been given, but as you all know it's not easy. One day at a time.  Next week is surgery, then the week after the appointment with the MO, and the real battle starts. I guess the bright side is, I have less cancer in me now than I did last week. And next week, less pre-cancer. Lol.  Thanks again to all of you for your kind words and support, 70charger, Holeinone, and momto3boysaz you're so right about friends. Friends that I've known my whole life haven't even checked in to see how things are going, and friends I've known for 4 years are so supportive that I can't imagine going through this without them. Whatever.  With regards to chemo, did any of you try the patch behind your ear in addition to other nausea meds? As you can see I'm still freaking out about chemo. Someone on here said, \"don't go there until you get there\", and I REALLY need to start repeating that over and over until it sinks in.  Good night! Hope all is well with everyone.

Anyway, since I stopped, my water retention has dissipated and I feel a little lighter. I will see for sure tomorrow when I see my MO. I don't have a scale in the house. ;) I will ask about the Glutamine as well - they are particular about the supplements that I'm taking while going through Rads. Clarrn - I have hair envy as well!!! Congrats on finishing chemo!! Speaking of hair, I'm 6 weeks PFC and I still have fuzz that looks pretty light except for the back. Then I also have darker \"sprouts\" on the top which never fell out after I shaved my head during chemo. So my hair is all different lengths and colors (although from a far I still look bald), and now it seems that the back and my hair line around my head is growing quicker than the rest. Anyone else in the same situation? Maybe this is the start of the growth - can it hurry up!!! I started Rads this week, so far pretty uneventful just a pain to get there every day. Luckily I feel a difference in my energy level. That started about a week and half ago. I feel a little more energy every day - so that is definitely encouraging. For awhile there I thought it would never get better. But it does. I'm also getting more hot flashes, joy.  Hope everyone is feeling good and recovering well! -Dawn",

I was going to start chemo in April, but they pushed it to May so I never joined in. I have to say what keeps me coming back is the great advice, positive attitude and overall sisterhood that you all have. I love it.   I'm about to start chemo, they are shooting for next Tuesday, but it may turn out to be Thursday because I don't have my Port appt yet. I just got off the phone with my MO, and starting balling as soon as I hung up. I'm a strong person, and have been dealing with this very well (as I'm told from DH), but the more real this step gets in the process, the more scared I get. The tumor board discussed my case to determine the best Chemo regimen - TC/4 rounds - 12 weeks or AC-T/8 rounds - 16 weeks. She's leaning toward AC-T because of my lymph node involvement, but they said both are suitable for me and my cancer. They are just leaning toward more chemo for me. They don't have proof that either one will give me a less chance of recurrence, and at this point I have to forge ahead with one or the other. I need to get this started or I will go insane. I'm very scared (of course), but I'm more scared because I know my body. I'm extremely prone to nausea and when I had Lyme Disease with Meningitis my body reacted violently. The Dr's said that I didn't have a high amount of Lyme according to the test, but my body went ballistic. I was hospitalized for 10 days. I spoke in great length about this with my MO and voiced my concern with nausea and asked that she please treat me like the most nauseous patient she ever had from the get go. Don't wait to throw the real stuff at me - LOL. A few of you have mentioned the fact that it becomes even more real with the changes that take place - hair loss, etc. I can totally relate, and can see that happening. I haven't told my whole family and did not announce it on Facebook. I want to keep this private, but soon I will be a walking neon sign. Not sure how I feel about that yet.  I wish you all relaxing days with no SE's - and thank you for all the advice that you've shared with each other. It's become a fantastic place for us newbies to \"stalk\" and become more comfortable with this next step.  -dd",

Thanks for the hug from Toronto, I needed it :) these are not easy decisions at all. It's like you have to be a cancer expert over night. And, yes the surgery is next Wednesday 4/16. I'm trying to make a conscious effort to enjoy these next few days of no news and no tests, but I can't help myself but read and research. I could possibly be approaching information overload today. If I read anymore about chemo, side effects, meds for side effects or cold caps, I'm going to scream! I hope you can have some fun with your son until Saturday. Keep me updated. ",

Congrats to all of you warriors who have conquered your chemo with determination and perserverance.  I'm just wrapping up the dark place of number three. The swamp water taste and aches are gone, but the fatigue just won't let up. Is everyone else feeling like you have cement shoes and no stamina? It's so depressing. Even if I wanted to go out, I don't think I would last long. And then I look in the mirror and say \"oh yeah, your still here\" . Lol. I really never got over the bald thing. I must have purchased 29 different hats and scarves, and 2 wigs...just can't feel comfortable in my own skin no matter how hard I try.  Anyway, I'm coming up on my last treatment and while I am elated, and psyched,  I'm also worried. I'm worried that maybe I should do 6 treatments , what??? Do I hear myself? I asked the dr when we were deciding which regimen was right for me she said both ( 4 of TC, OR 8 of AC-T) were suitable for my cancer. I said, so should we meet in the middle and do 6? She said that there's no research that oroves one is better in my situation. Will we ever give ourselves a break? Will we be able to breath deeply again without thinking the ground is going to fall out from beneath us?  I'm sorry, I'm so whiney and down, but I read your posts and you get it. No one around me gets it.  Thanks for listening. And I love what Cold said. Doesn't matter what SEs come this time, because there will not be a next time. I WIN!!!!! Dd",

Just wondering, the event in October in California, does it happen to be Dreamforce? If so, I'm trying to time my radiation for that as well and will end 2 weeks prior. I have been freelancing doing Salesforce.com admin work, but just got a call about a job I had been interested in, and it looks like it's gonna happen. This would definitely require my going to Dreamforce so now I'm all excited and motivated, but of course worried. If you've been there before then you know the amount of walking that's necessary.  Not sure that I can keep up. :( Linda- don't beat yourself up, I think we are all worried about everything. How can we NOT be depressed? We are dealing with surgeries, pain, chemo, no hair, no energy, our lives are turned upside down, our friends look at us with pity and sympathy and all we want is to be normal again. I'd say that's the perfect recipe for depression. As you can see,  Im also have been very emotional. Cry at the drop of a dime. I'm just done with this part of my treatments. I want my hair back, I want my eyelashes to stop falling out, I want to be able to walk to my laundry room without having to rest at the dining room, and I want my life back! That said, Im grateful for these treatments and the ability to be cured of this horrible cancer, so I deal with it the best I can. I can mask the struggle pretty well and to be honest, I don't know if that's good or bad. I had a breakdown yesterday and my husband said that he didn't realize my daily struggle because I hide it so well. He said he will do more to help and was happy he knew exactly how I was feeling.  Back to you, it's great that your GP is going to try to help you. I hope he comes up with the perfect solution for you and you start to feel like yourself in no time! ",

So, I had an echocardiogram today, met with the vascular surgeon and went to a chemo class where I had a small breakdown. The nausea just really scares the shit out of me. Excuse my mouth, I'm originally from NJ, I curse like a sailor. Wednesday is bone scan, genetic consult and cat scan, Thursday is a follow up with my MO where I will find out more details.

Anyway, here it is, so very special to me:  I get to pop one balloon every night, each day representing one of the 84 days on my journey. Those 6 little days that I popped have been pretty darn tough. I never imagined that amount if pain from the shot. I can deal with pain, but that was worse then when I broke my leg and reset it. Everyone is different, but whoever doesn't feel anything from that shot, I envy you!! Gnight",

I found a lump a few weeks ago, had a biopsy positive for cancer, then met with my surgical oncologist who did the lumpectomy this past Wednesday and found out on Friday that 2 out of the 3 SN had cancer, my margins were clean but they found pre-cancer cells on 2 sides, and my tumor was a grade 3. The good news in all of that is that it was positive for estrogen and progesterone, so it will respond to hormone therapy. But, I will also need chemotherapy. That was the big hit down to my core.  I'm still waiting to hear if he wants to go back in to remove the precancerous tissue, he wanted to bring it up to the board at the mayo clinic. So, there could be another surgery before chemo. I should hear that answer in a few days, and my follow up is in 2 weeks. I will also meet with my MO that day as well. So that's my story, I'm trying to get prepared for chemo, but I'm really scared. Jc254, thank you for sharing your experience its encouraging to know that you kept a pretty normal routine through it all. And your hair! I will definitely be doing cold caps. ",

Not sure why I picked today to go out to the grocery store, but I did. The fatigue is bad, I know the heat doesn't help, but I feel like I'm 90 years old. At Safeway They must have asked me 1million times if I want help out, which was weird to me having grown up and lived in NJ my whole life, and today I finally said yes. As a matter of fact, I could use some help out! Lol.  Congrats to all of you who are done!!! It must feel so good! My last one is on Tuesday and I'm counting down the days!!! One more meeting with the dementors ( I love that BTW).  Long Island good for you for keeping your hair ! Mine never completely fell out out, don't get me wrong, I'm mostly bald, but I have more like a spotty crew cut and it's growing so I'm not complaining. Lol.  I've been really emotional this treatment, it's either it took this long to catch up to me or, I'm just exhausted and done with every aspect of this nightmare. But, I'm gonna shake it off come Tuesday and celebrate the last and final treatment!!!",

It's 30 min from my house. UGH.  Had some swelling in my ankles yesterday, but it seems to be a bit better today. I'm definitely retaining water. I meet with MO today to go over the end of chemo so I will see what she has to say. I also want to know if I can start taking Biotin for hair/nails.  Can't wait for the weather to cool down so that I can start walking. I'm jealous of all of you who can get out and do a little walking. It's still in triple digits here!",

I half joked about covering up the mirrors in the house until it really starts growing. Good luck in NY. Take it slow.  clarrn, I was right there with you for a few weeks after chemo ended. Cried and cried at the drop of a hat. Just feeling weak and helpless, worried, and just overall unhappy with the way I look. Bald and fat. It started to subside around week 4, I still feel that way but I don't break down nearly as much.  Rosebud, I totally feel the same. I'm on my 6th radiation and I get waves of just being sick of being sick. It is cruel and rude to lose your eyebrows and lashes 6 weeks PFC. I just lost one whole side of my bottom lashes. It looks ridiculous, but I still wear mascara. Lol I have an interview on Thursday, and am nervous. Wondering if they are just going to be distracted by my wig and half lashes. I'm still so bald, seems like mine is going much slower than the rest of you. I'm still looking at white fuzz :(. ",

I'm officially halfway done! I wanted to share a few things about my second round. if you remember, I'm the one who was terrified by the thought of nausea. I had asked my MO for a patch- the kind that they gave me for the surgery behind my ear. She told me that it was a different kind of nausea and it wouldn't work, but the first round was a disaster as far as nausea. I took so much ativan I don't even remember it. So with the second one I demanded to try, I mean really, what's the harm? Well it as was night and day difference. It was NOTHING like the first. However, some of the other side effects were worse like fatigue and the bone pain from that god awful shot. But I'm like 11 days out now and feeling pretty close to normal. I'm thankful for that. I have my third round on 7/8 and then fourth around 7/29 and then I'm done! Can't wait to get back to my life.  Question for y'all. My hair is growing back in at the moment, I'm guessing by day 14 or so it will fall out again - did that happen to anyone? It all fell out after day 14 of the first treatment.  Here are some pics....   ",

I was nauseous, fatigued, couldn't eat, stand, walk, and I had a fever of over 103 that lasted for 5 days which is what ultimately put me in the hospital because I couldn't hold down any medications. No bulls eye, but I did have red rash. The doctor thought it was everything but Lyme, until I demanded a Lyme test. No surprise to me that it was positive since I had every symptom and lived behind a wooded area. I never saw a tick on me. Hmmm.... rads effecting hair growth? I sure hope not!! it seems that plenty of people have hair growth while going through rads.",
