I went to look at buying a recliner this weekend, but like you I don't really have a need for a recliner long term and so paying $300+ for a recliner seemed silly. After shopping, I learned that Lazy Boy is the brand I like best and then I checked facebook marketplace and Craiglist for used ones. I found a clean, barely used one (from a lady currently undergoing radiation for DCIS, incidentally) for $140. I figure when I am done, I will try to sell if for $100 or give it to someone on our local BC group who needs it for her mastectomy recovery. Anyway, used is another option. Good luck in any event!",

My surgeon prescribed the Patricia bra by Amoena and the Hugger Bra by Prairie Wear. When one of them starts to irritate me, it is nice to have a different bra I can put on. If her doctor wants an ace instead of a bra, maybe alternating between a couple of slightly different widths of ace bandages would help a bit. Still, I have to admit that I have gone braless for a few hours here and there just to keep myself sane. Good luck--I am counting the days until I can stop doing the 24/7 compression.",
