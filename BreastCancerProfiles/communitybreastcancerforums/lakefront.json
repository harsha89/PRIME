I cannot wait to exchange them for implants although now with the rads I dont think it will be for quite some time. I went ahead and had a double mast...I finished chemo 3 wks ago and have had 3 rad treatments and I the bolus is used every other time. I have been told to use aloe and aquaphor, it sounds like alot of others use the same.",

I am wondering if this area of trouble for you is because of the metal. I am only on #11 so I have not yet had a problem like yours. I  am so sorry this is happening to you.
