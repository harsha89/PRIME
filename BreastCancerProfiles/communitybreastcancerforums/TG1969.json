I had total clear labs after BMX but I am triple - and brca2+. I am meeting with an oncologist Wednesday and I am so afraid of chemo if it is recommended.",

I had a nipple-sparing double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on October 7th after a biopsy revealed a 2.2cm lump in my right breast. I also tested + for brca2. I received CLEAR labs in a pathology report a few days after surgery. The report said I was triple -. I am seeing an oncologist next week..is that when I will get the test?",
