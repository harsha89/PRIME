    "Content": "Jan 4, 2011 11:32AM CaroHi wrote: Hi Tammy,  I was diagnosed this June with what appeared to be a small lump and turned out to be a Grade 3 cancer (11 nodes out of 21). I was 4 month pregnant at that time so they could not do any testing to see if it had spread anywhere else. I was started on AC and then delivered my baby, she is a perfectly healthy and happy baby!  I then started on Taxol+Herceptin and finished T last Monday and will continue Herceptin for a year and also start Tamoxifen.  I was in the hospital yesterday for an MRI (the first test I ever had, except for a mammogram that did not even showed the lump!) and my oncologist will give me the results tomorrow!  I will meet with the radiation doctor tomorrow also to plan next steps. I also found I am BCRA + so a lot going on in the last couple of months and still a lot to go...I am happy I found this forum, It might make things easier sharing with people that are going through the same scary things.   ",
