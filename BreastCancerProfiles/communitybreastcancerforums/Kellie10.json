I decided to go radical because they are becoming more sensitive the older I get. The thing that has me worried is since I started this process I have some very new symptoms. I got a breast infection in September and about 5 weeks ago I got some \"tugging or dimpling\" in my left breast this is totally different from my \"normal\" breast and my plastic surgeon found a swollen lymph node under the left armpit. I went back to my doctor and shared my concerns everyone just keeps chalking it up to my cysts. I know it has nothing to do with my cyst but I am afraid that cancer may be hiding behind them, the Doctors keep saying that cancer doesn't hurt and because I hurt it is a good sign. They are trying to accommodate my concerns but I have had to try to change the mind set of my doctors and keep them from looking at my old symptoms and look at this with new eyes. I got another ultrasound and of course it didn't show anything I can not do mammograms due to the intense pain. Insurance has denied the script for the MRI and I now await them putting that back through. I am going to do the genetic testing next week and in the mean time hopefully the MRI will go through. I have read that if it is cancer that the treatment is totally different. I'm freaking out a little but trying not to over react. So I guess I'm just venting I have to be my own advocate I know that but, man it is frustrating I guess I should consider myself lucky to be going through this because if it is cancer I will hopefully be catching it early and if it is not then I wont have to deal with my forever nagging and painful breast cyst anymore. Any words of wisdom from anyone out there would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
