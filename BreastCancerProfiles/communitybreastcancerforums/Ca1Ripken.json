DH got a job.  It's a \"tween\" job... not great, but something... and he will continue to look for something better.  I guess it's a blessing that he got a job, but I am going to MISS him soooo much at home, and now I have to care for our 8 and 3 year old by myself every day.... seems overwhelming to think about!!  ",

I'm trying but not a fan of asparagus.. if anyone has suggestions for making it more palatable, please share!!  :)  I hope you had an awesome day in NYC!  IrishTess - Praying for you starting Taxol.  If you tolerate it well, your future infusions should be quick.  Mine today, with herceptin, was 2 1/2 hours chair to door.  NJbhwgirl - ((HUGS)) I know its hard thinking of your baby joining the Army, but it sounds like he is responsible and knows what he wants.  I'm biased, having been in the military and still in the AF Reserve, but serving is just something that is in you - and he will get GREAT benefits for college, not to mention the comradare (sp?).  I know it will be hard while he is gone... and they probably will not let him contact you much while he is in training.. that is the hardest part!  What is his specialty/job?  I hope your breathing gets better!  Sacphotomom - sorry, I can't speak to the taxotere question.  :)  Day - I thought of you today when I was watching Dr. Oz and he spoke of some herbs and natural remedies.  Wish I had your knowledge!  Patricia - Great book!   GL with Taxol!  I can't remember, are you weekly?  The steroid high/crash, and GI are my biggest complaints... overall not too bad... you can do this!!  Lots o' water to get the stuff they mix the taxol in out of your system!  Once again, I've made a marathon post (what's new, right?).  My treatment today was uneventful - I brought cookies for everyone, and we ate at 5 Guys Burgers & Fries when we were done!  Love them!  And, my MRI of my head and neck (specifically a hot spot on my hyoid bone) was NEGATIVE!  I'm so relieved!  Labs were good - a little low on the WBC, RBC, but nothing awful.  Everyone moving on to taxol, at least you shouldn't have to do neulesta!  Woot!  ((((HUGS)))) to everyone!  Love you guys!",

I felt like she came to 'visit' only, and to tell all of her friends that she was here, you know??  The pre-req visit.  We've talked about what she can do to help when she's here for the surgery, but she's already said stuff like - Bill can take the kids out of the house the first weekend after the surgery if you are not feeling well............duh.  She is not really able to help much with the kids as it is too hard for her to get around on her own.... she cannot get down on the ground, or climb the stairs (she only did it twice this past 6 day visit to shower).  But, I can't tell her not to come.  I just need to have the strength.  :)  Hope everyone is having a great day.  I have a GF coming to visit this weekend - should be fun!  And, I went to dinner with a bunch of friends Sunday and had my first beer since April, and it was really good!!  Ahhh!  ;)",

I think that is an oxymoron... LOL (now, you can all jump me if your's do).  Mine is like a soggy rag too... not someone I would hang out with... but, I think you should feel comfortable that she is informed - she should be in close contact with your onc over treatment!!  Jersey - You have your hands full.  I pray your mom is recovering!!  I didn't catch; where are you going to sleep during all of the room switching??  Remember, that your comfort, as much as possible, is important too!!  My mom just sent me an email because I didn't answer the phone when she called yesterday.... she called at 6 pm.... and she was just here, and saw that we had something every night (between karate and football) unless we were rained out... and why is she wondering where I was??????  Ugh.  Give me the patience while she is here, or let her really be helpful and not irritate the crap out of me... oh man, that was so negative; than goodness you guys understand!!  :) (((HUGS))) all!! ",

I meet with both of them next week, so will get a definitive answer... I know they are doing a fill - my appt was changed to Monday for that.  He also said I needed to start thinking about my size... so my husband said a solid \"C\".... I think I was about a big B, small C, before!  He said he'll fill and we'll see when I want him to stop, which cracks me up for some reason!!  Of course, he'll just make my other match during recon, but I'll definitely be lopsided and up more on one side for a few months!  And, that's a heck of a schedule you've got going on!  I got tired for you just reading it! Denise -  T N M is how they stage cancer.... T represents the tumor size, N the node involvement (how many) and M is mets.  So T3 means I started with a tumor greater than 4 or 6 cm (I can't remember right now), and N1, 1 node and not mets.  Post surgery path T1 (tumor under 2 cm) and no nodes and no mets.  Thank you, chemo!!!  And, all they got during surgery (yes, mastectomy) was DCIS... so, actually, Stage 0 pathology.  My breast surgeon did feel the need to remind me of my original diagnosis.... debbie downer!!  :)  haha!!  Magda - CONGRATS on being done with chemo!  There's not a feeling like it in the world... indescribeable!!!  So happy!  Hope your scans are easy and you don't stress over them!!  Denise - It might have been easier that they didn't give you a choice between surgery and chemo... it was one of the hardest decisions I have EVER had to make and was constsantly second guessing myself!!  In the end, I don't think it changes outcomes either way, at least that's what I've heard and read!! Jersey - I think all of this has been a reminder (especially for those of us with younger children) to enjoy every moment.... I am not looking forward to returning to work because I just don't want to miss anything!!  I think it will ge a little easier to work next year when my youngest starts kindergarten, but in the meantime; I'm really going to miss him everyday... even though I am lucky; I will just put him in daycare 3 days a week and get 4 full days with him... that's still pretty good. My pain is getting better everyday.... even 9 days out... I drove today; even though I'm not \"allowed\" to... but I had to get my son to football practice... they play for the championship tomorrow morning!!  OMG... laughing my butt off.... I wear sunglasses everywhere and keep them on until it's way to dark to have them on... I know people think I'm crazy... but dang, no eyebrows or eyelashes suck!!  (Ok, I exaggerate.. I have 3 eyelashes total).  Laura - Dang, even smaller world... my BIL majored in physical therapy... what did you guys major in (that's probably the only way your paths may have crossed there!!).  Day - you give me great hope being pain free (or pain-less) so soon after surgery... I'm still very sore and limited.  I do not know how the ladies did bilaterals... I don't know what I would have done, or be doing without one good arm... God bless them; I don't think I could have done it!!  Hope you get over your cold soon... we have surely missed your wisdom here!! I am still up waiting for my 17 (almost 18) year old to get home... my husband is not happy about me allowing her such a late curfew tonight... but I know where she is, what she's doing, and who she is with and I am OK with it.... still worried, but can't hang on forever!!  :) ((HUGS)) all... sorry, so long!!!  :)",

I went to bed really early and woke up very early and went out at 5 am!  I'm glad there were no critters out.... deer have crossed right in front of me while running, and alligators have been seen on occasion...

I think my exchange surgery is going to be scheduled for May 4th.  They are going to call with the definitive time, but said there should be no problem.  That will give me time off work, and then we are going to PA and DC 6 weeks after surgery before I go back.  Doc said he would write me out of work for 6 weeks with the DIEP... so, the plan is DIEP on the right and a small implant and lift on the left.  Unfortunately, I don't have enough fat to make 2 boobs....  And, my rad onc really pissed me off.  I met with her last week and explained my disappointment in getting only an annual mammo... blah, blah, same ol' complaint from me... mammo missed this so how can I feel comfortable with it???? And, my onc doesn't even do blood tests.... blah, blah.  She goes on to make some joke about PSA standing for \"prostate stress\" something... and I said, yeah, but you still do the test.... they won't even do any tests on me!!  She went on to say that also ultrasounds and MRIs would not be done because it was not feasible.  She said that with the radiologists malpractice, they would have to biopsy every little thing..... and I left feeling pretty crappy about the whole meeting.  Granted, she has the compassion of a scorpion, but I felt like a 'bad' patient.  So, that afternoon I was meeting with my plastic surgeon and decided to be a better patient.  So, in light of my morning meeting... when he mentioned a prophylactic mastectomy again, I started to consider it... I mean if the only screening I am going to get is mammos, I don't trust it.  So, now, I'm really considering having my boob removed for just that reason, and I tell him that they won't do any other tests, and he (is very compassionate) asks me who my BS is, and tells me that he will talk to her about them doing more testing on me.  I love him.  OK... so, that is my rant.  Do all of you have at least blood work done???  Anyone else not get tumor markers checked??

I've been on the tamoxifen for almost 4 months now and wonder if any of this may have to do with that.  I'm not taking any other meds other than vitamins... although I did start a daily baby aspirin today because I read a study that it may reduce recurrence, so I thought, why not, I don't have any contraindications, so WTH?!!  I think I want to ask my onc to see if I metabolize tamoxifen... because if I don't, I could have an ooph when I have my exchange surgery.  I don't want to do that, but if I'm not a metabolizer... then I think I would have to make that decision.  I'm concerned because my hot flashes are almost non existent anymore... don't get me wrong, I'm happy, but it makes me wonder if I'm metabolizing.. :) ((HUGS)) all!!",

I want to slap her!!!!  I said that I just cannot risk 5%... what if there are complications, that can add up to a lot of money.  Long story short (which mine never are)... the soonest I can have my surgery is May 20th.  I'm holding out hope, but pretty much know that our vacation will be ruined by this.  We will still go because we already have reservations and Thomas tickets and Thomas is only in Strasburg at certain times, but I may very well have to use a wheelchair to keep up with the family.  I'm so pissed about her doing this.... I hope she feels bad about this because she had time to work this shit out last month and she f-ing didn't.  So, that's my rant! ",

I wish having a drink would have a double-negative effect, and actually make me feel good, but I don't think it works that way... Boo!!  Enjoy every minute of your good week! My stomach is so bloated ALL the time, it's just uncomfortable.  Nothing I am taking helps with it.  Any ideas?  I've tried pepcid and some nausea meds.  Onc gave me a script for nexium; think that will help?  My headaches got better when we realized they were coming from the zofran, so we cut that pill out and the headaches have gotten better.  On a lighter note - we're having a good time - took the kids to T-Rex in downtown disney for lunch, and enjoyed a caramel peanut apple from the candy store.  My youngest got to build a dinosaur and he was so excited (my goodness, 3 is just such a great age!!).  Tomorrow is SeaWorld.  It's really hot - but I have sunscreen, water, an umbrella, and we'll stop in the AC buildings often!  We head to Kennedy Space Center Wednesday, then home for Thursday infusion.  After my taxol and herceptin, we'll do AC dose dense... my onc didn't care if we did it every 3 or every 2, so DD gets it done quicker, and I think the research may lead toward the DD being a bit more effective, so couldn't hurt.   HUGS to everyone - and here's hoping for a SE free week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",

Just can't do that to DH in a house that is not kid-proof and not ours!  I hope you can get your taxol too so your dates work out right.  I did not want to go out yet, but metioned before that if I don't go out before July 1, I will only get 3 months of coverage.  Sooo, mine will be close to be finished and ready to work at the end.  JennyB - LOL!  All these moms that drive us nuts!  Funny, because I loved having DH's mom come to visit before they moved here (now, they live a mile down the road)... she doesn't drive me nuts, but my mom does!  I couldn't imagine my mom being a mile away; 6 hours is a little far, but it's ok!  That's all I got!!  I'll just close it out with DIE, CANCER, DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Jul 5, 2010 11:00PM - edited Jul 5, 2010 11:04PM by Ca1Ripken Hi all!  I've been away for a bit.. had a great 4th weekend, family, friends and fireworks!  I have a blister on my thumb from lighting sparklers... but there were no other injuries!  LOL.  I've read everyone's post... I've just been bummed lately.  My appt Thursday with onc showed that she doesn't feel any change in my tumor (I've had 8 infusions of taxol and herceptin), so I'm bummed about that.  Also, I've had headaches constantly for the last month (or longer), so she's scheduled an MRI for the 13th.  Boo.  I also haven't been able to shave my head since I finished on the base Wednesday.. I think because I'm being wimpy.  I can still pull it back into a ponytail so that when I wrap a scarf or bandana around the front, I have hair showing through in the back, but I just look pathetic without the scarf on!  And, the big reality is now both DH and I are unemployed.  I have to mail my disability paperwork (some of you may remember, I had to go out before July 1 to get 6 months because our new policy that started July 1 was only a 3 month policy).  Then the place I went to get my wig last week was disappointing... not the wig, but the lady's attitude.  The FIRST question she asked after I made a joke about my hair coming out with my hair holder was \"have you thought of shaving your head?\"  I know that's an honest question - but I don't even know her, and we JUST met, and she just wasn't sensitive about asking!  Then she rushed me through the appt - maybe spent 20 minutes trying on wigs... said she would have to order on for me, and that it would be in Thurdsay or Friday, and then had me sign paperwork that said if I didn't buy a wig from them, I would have to pay them $45.  Now, it's Monday, and the wig was suppose to be in last week, and they haven't even called me.  Oh, and don't even get me started on my sex life.  DH has been great, but I have not wanted to for like 2 weeks now.  I'm sorry to be a downer, but I know you guys understand, and that I can come here and tell you all of this!  I'm trying to be so upbeat and not the oh, poor me has cancer... but geez, I'm getting tired!  I still have another month of this regimen, and then 2-3 months of the AC.  (my onc keeps forgetting she agreed to dose dense AC, and keeps referring to 'every 3 weeks' when she talks about it - and that's what she put on all my disability paperwork).  There are a TON of projects I would love to get done around the house now, but without DH working, we just shouldn't spend the money because in this economy, lord knows when he will find work!  We never thought he would be out of work for this long... On a positive note, we did go to Barnes & Noble today, and get out summer project started.  We got a Pre-K book for my youngest to start getting him ready for kindergarten (not for another year), and books for my oldest son to work on.  He's very gifted in math; going into the 3rd grade, and we're working on 6th grade math with him, and honestly, from what I've seen - he's going to breeze through it with little teaching!!  Congrats to everyone finsihing up!!   And, HUGS to everyone moving on... I know the thought of different chemo is scary and we will get through it!  The taxol has not been awful for those of you moving on to it!  I have not gained much weight, just a couple of pounds, and the SE have definitely been managable, except taste... and I just really have wanted a lot of salty.  Thank you for listening!!  HUGS,  Leanna  ",

OMG... pick up the effing phone and tell me you aren't coming.  When I have arrangements for my kids, I don't make back up arrangements.  On top of everything else, I was exhausted because we had to get up at 5:30 to be at the hosp this morning for an MRI.  The techs there tried to kill me.  I took them 8 tries to access my port, and finally when they left the room to get some heparin, I pushed on the needle, pulled back, and got blood return!  I really hope it doesn't get infected from all the \"exposure\" of being stuck so much.  Then.. the MRI broke while I was in it.... she unhooked my IV from the contrast dye, and the tip hit the floor.  The tech wiped it with an alcohol swab, which is totally unacceptable.... and I made her get new tubing, which she did.... but then she tried to hook the tubing up to my port without priming the tubing..... can you say air embolis and death????  I will have to contact Risk Management about non-nursing personnel accessing central lines... that is so dangerous, I'm shocked they even do it!!  I just want to sleep tonight and feel better tomorrow.  When did you guys start feeling better after the AC????  ((HUGS)) , Leanna",

I felt them all!!  DAY - YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Great, great news!!!  Jen - Loved your story... sounds great.  You know, I've only seen 1 bald woman during my treatment, and I saw her about 3 days before I shaved my head.  BTW... when do you lost all your hair on the AC?  My head is still the fuzz I shaved it down to about a month or so ago. The AC and Neulasta are hitting me pretty hard.  I spent most of the time I could on the computer this past week just making sure all my online banking was in order, and all the bills were paid.  You know chemo brain... have to go back and check and then check again!  I have been a bit bummed by the lack of help during my 'bad' days the last 2 weeks... all the people who said let me know if I can do anything.... just don't seem to be around to do anything.... mmmm... had one GF that took my son on my awful day, Friday after treatment.  Another GF and her husband wanted to \"hang out' with me on Saturday... so, I did, but it just wore me out trying to stay awake!  My WBC is fine, but I'm very anemic... and not able to eat/drink much, so that's not helping.  I started taking some iron pills in the hopes of at least avoiding a transfusion... I just don't want one.   But, I know I'm not taking in enough to sustain myself.  I'm keeping gatorade down this week, but I think my body is using most of it, because I'm not peeing most of it back out.  Then, my husband's sister asked what she could do... and I said Thursday, Friday and Monday, Tuesday after treatment are reallly bad days for me.... and she said back, 'oh, I don't have my work schedule.\"  Then, when I bumped into her on Thursday at DH's parent's house... she was talking about her 'day off....'  and I was thinking, you didn't even try to call me to see if I needed anything?? WTH??   So, yes, I am mad at her!  I think I am most frustrated at all the people who have said and continue to say, let me know if there is anything I can do for you, and then they just can't help, or don't respond to your messages.  My one GF that stood me up never answered my message when I told her I was upset she didn't call me instead of just telling me on facebook she wasn't coming.... what, so now she is mad at me???  Really?  Oh, and I turned down her offer to have someone come put a garden in for \"people who are ill\" (her words).  My husband said that everyone has brought me dinner once, and that is their 'quota' for what they need to do to help me.  He said that I am being unreasonable in thinking people should help more.  Maybe I am... but dangit... I would help my friends more if they needed it, so I don't understand....  I feel so bad that I cannot do more with my 4 year old everyday.... I just hate that I am so tired, and if I was able to drag myself out of the house to so something fun, I would have to take a nap... and I can't!!  Ugh!!   My DH does so much... he works all day, and then comes home to either take Ryan to football practice, or clean the house, or bathe the little one.....  he's a saint, and he doesn't complain, and I can't even do anything for him!  Now, I'm on here.... Debbie downer!  What is wrong with me!?  I am trying so hard to stay strong, but I just want this chemo to be over... it has beat me down!  2 more.... 2 more... I can do 2 more!!!  DH starts his new job on Monday, and he can't go to my last 2 chemos with me... :(  So, go alone, or take a friend???  Alright ladies, that's all the nagging and complaining I have in me for today!!  I hope and pray that I will start to feel better tomorrow (day 9 past treatment)!!  :) ((HUGS)) to everyone And, anyone else who did refuse tattoos on rads.... I'm feeling very strongly about the fact that I am going to refuse!!  Leanna",

I don't think I am going to be able to go back to that lifestyle!!  Even if it means I will work 2 nights a week when there is nothing going on, or at least I'm missing minimal memories.  I'm sorry about your pain... that sucks, plain and simple.  I hope it eases up for you!!  Magda - Amen, sister!!  I finished chemo last Tuesday!!!  Today is the FIRST day that I woke up and did not take 5-6 pills to get started!!  Today, I woke up and took Nexium, stool softener and 1 tylenol!!!!  HOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG, I'm starting to feel better!   And, regarding your post to someone else.... I could do 55 push ups (yes, at once :), and run a 5K feeling fine pre-diagnosis, and do you know that the last thing I got in the mail (package-wise) before my diagnosis was the P-90X that I was going to start doing!!  The pull up bar right in front of me is a reminder that I will get back in shape when all is done... but I worry about what I will be able to do with my mastectomy arm... re: lymphadema and all.... boo!!   Latte - Good for you.  It sounds like you are at peace with your decision.  I did not want to sway you one way or the other because it's a very personal decision.  When I was first diagnosed and found out that I needed chemo, I told my husband that I would participate in ANY clinical trial because I have a daughter that I don't want to have to go through \"maybe this chemo will work....\" and for all the men and women that will come behind us with this terrible disease.... but when I brought home the clinical trial paperwork and actually read some of the side effects were (and I quote)... a:   Shortness of breath;  b:  Sudden death............  I could NOT do it!  I felt bad for a mini-second, and then thought of my children and MY life, and moved on!  Please do the same!! So, guess what I found at Harris Teeter yesterday.... YES, strawberry gatorade!!  Love it!!!!  And, the pharmacist was a jerk over me getting my Ativan... I tried to 'thank' him very loudly too because he was so mean, and he ignored me!!  How can you be mean to someone with cancer, with no hair, toting a little child around knowing her insurance will only allow her to take 1 1/2 Ativan's a day when they are ordered every 6 hours for nausea from chemo....  he's a turd.  :) (((((HUGS)))) all!!!! ",

Magda - Awesome on the BRCA!!!!  my eyelashes are all growing in now too... about 1/2 the size, and funny my eyebrows too, but lower than I have been drawing them on... my natural eyebrows really do give me a 'mean' look because they are so low and straight.... boo.  Laura - his name is Ken Loud... not sure if he was in a frat or clubs...  He has a practice in Chesapeake now.  Ditah - They filled me with 180 ML during surgery, and just put in another 120 ML.  I go in again on Monday for another fill... and yes, you have to be fully expaned, plus about 30% for extra skin for the recon... so my right boob will be significantly bigger before recon, which is cracking me up for some strange reason!!!  I meet with rad onc tomorrow, so we'll see when and how long on rads.  And, if I didn't say it before; great job on the cold cap story!!   Denise - I am starting to feel the same way... I actually 'run' up the stairs again, and can \"zoom\" my youngest up the stairs (he loves to do this before bedtime, and I haven't been able to do it for months because I was too weak, and I can at least do it now with my strong arm!).  :) Feels so good to know we are getting back to normal because it really felt to me like I never would... I'm starting to have the urge to start running again... but, need to have my pain a little better controlled first; but it's coming soon!! Daiva - If you want; you can pass on my email or facebook for your friend... I know for me it was helpful to know people \"in my boat\" to talk to!!  :)  YAY, again on BRCA neg! Jersey - Actually, my daughter really impressed me that night... told me they would be out at least until 1:00, but she got home at 12:30!!  :)  She's a good girl; I know... but there are bound to be disagreements when she is mine and not my husband's, you know?!  Jenn - Sorry, I can't help there, but can tell you that even with my drain in, I was able to put a bra on about 3 days after surgery.... maybe you can cut one of your older bras so that it doesn't bother the surgery side, but holds up your other gal.  Denise - You aren't odd... I love my \"me\" time, and think a trip alone sounds heavenly... you've given me ideas now!!!!  What kind of lotion are you using for rads??  I still haven't purchased any and can't find my old notes on what to get!!  Now for my question of the day... anyone have lingering nausea/vomiting after surgery?  I have thrown up more since surgery then during all of chemo... it was usually at night which I contributed to taking more pills at night than at any other time... or maybe it was the keflex (which I'm off now) or lingering anesthesia SE???  Any ideas??  And, everyone give me your best ideas for lotions for rads!!!  :) Love all,  Leanna",

I think herceptin has been my security blanket!  I'm hoping to get into the Neratinab (sp?) clinical trial... it's 50/50 drug/placebo, but preliminary studies are looking good for this drug for us Her2+ gals.  Just grappling now with what to do about my ovaries...

Cleob - I remember you saying before you were not having an SE.  You and I (I believe) are the only 2 on the taxol now.  I just finished #3.  I have NO taste buds... water tastes like dirt, and I have to add loads of salt and dressing to stuff to taste it, which is fine because my serum sodium levels are low because I have been drinking so much water.  I also have frequent heartburn.  I'm also on herceptin so those maybe causing some SE.  My hair is not wanting to stay in my head when I pull on it, but it's not coming out on its own (if that makes sense).  My taste buds seem to return on Tuesday or Wednesday before Thursday infusion... maybe you'll feel something this week- or maybe not - no SE does not mean it isn't working (wow, that was a lot of negatives).  :)  And, as Day said - you should see changes in your blood work.  Summer - that's an awesome story!  It made me tear up too!!  You are lucky to have such wonderful people surrounding you!  Packjen - LOVE the shave - you have an awesome shape head... hope I am so lucky!!!

I have found my eyes more sensitive to light like I feel like I don't have on sunglasses when I do!    Nanaof2 - thanks!  You have your next treatment on Monday?  Day - sorry about your nail.  Nail changes can happen on Taxol, but you are on taxotere, aren't you?  Maybe it has some same SE.  For taxol they suggest keeping on clear nail polish.  Kim - That is very scary.  I'm glad they were so quick to react and take care of it and you were still able to get your infusion.  Yes, the steroids do keep you up; sometimes its a nice burst of energy depening on the time of day it hits you.  I usually do my house cleaning on Friday!!  Everyone just gets out of my way, because it's crazy when I get going!!  I love that they gave you a quilt!  That is so sweet - incredible there are so many nice people.  Laura - CONGRATS!!  I know you will find taxol much easier!!  I hope your feet start to feel better soon.  It's tough when your feet are sore!  Boo.  JennyB - I agree... tired of being tired.  I just want to feel like a person.  Usually I have 2-3 day/week where i feel pretty good, but they were plaqued with headaches this week and I'm so bummed about it.  1 more to go for you.... ONE!!!  We can do this! Paxton - Next week sounds good - try to relax as much as you can.  Do you have any friends or family that want to do something (you know, the \"let me know if I can do anythinng\" friends??).  I would ask someone or several people if they could help come watch the baby while you nap or relax in your room, or go somewhere and do something light if you feel up to it.  Use all the help that you can get right now!!  (((HUGS))) I'm getting ready to go out on disability.. was going to work a while longer, but just found our my carrier changed, and if I go out on disability BEFORE July 1, I get 6 months of coverage... but starting July 1, it reduces to 3 months of coverage.... so.... submitted all my paperwork this afternoon to start the end of June.  Oh, and with 6 minutes to go in the BB game tonight... I changed my facebook status to \"If the Celtics win, I will shave my head!!!\"  I was reallllllllly hoping the Celtics would win.... but they didn't!!  And, I'm still going to have to shave my head.. it would've been so much funnier if they had won and I did it.  Most of my \"friends\" on FB do not know that I have cancer.  I have just not publicly advertised it there.  Treatment 6 today.  Uneventful.  1/2 way through the first round of chemo.  Feeling reasonably good today.  Hating all this friggin' water.  No big plans for the weekend.  My DD is going to the beach... but I can't go :(.   (((HUGS))) to everyone. ",

DH and I figure that must be 319 + 9% tax... I dunno... are you suppose to tax medical prescriptions... they don't at the pharmacy and I have a script for this???  I told her to forget it, I didn't want a wig.  (I'll wait to see if I get a $45 bill from them for their \"time.\").  And, I will go to MUSC's place this week to get the other wig I ordered.  LibraryJenn - I was with you ending chemo in October, but onc agreed to do AC DD, which should have me ending sometime in September, so I'll be around for a while too!  And, wow, I wish I could have come back with the \"you first!\"  I bet you are soooo excited to see your son!!  You miss them so much when they aren't around!  Daiva - (how do you pronounce your name? It sounds beautiful the way I am saying it, and wonder if it's right).  Yes, I have had the runs.  It came at a time when my white count was low.. but I also take softeners.  This is TMI, (but I'm over feeling funny about sharing TMI with my sisters here) but the chemo pellets that happen if I don't take just enough softeners have tore up my rear, and it's painful.  I had the runs once for about 2 days.. was fearful of taking imodium and it went away on its own.  My GI track has been totally out of whack since chemo!  Wishing you safe travels back home!!  My treatment today was at the center closer to my house... and it was incredible!  I think everyone there was being treated for breast cancer (only 6 treatment chairs total), and my heart went out to a lady who was there... 24 years old, with a 6 week old baby and she has been in treatment since January :(.  The nurses were great - and it was so fast... started around 12:15 and was done with everything by 3:00.  That's much better than the other place where I would get there at noon, and maybe be leaving at 5 or 5:30.  HUGS to all!!!!! <3",

Patricia - thanks for the info on the AC.  I am starting to get nervous... changing regimens.  Do they do steroids??  Are you able to drive yourself for the neulesta injections?  As for mortality... yes, my feelings are hurt!  When I was getting my diagnostic mammogram and waiting for the results (of course, 80% are benign.... so I was not worried), I watched as the woman across from me was very anxious... outwardly anxious... and they came and told her that her results were fine (I imagine she HAD breast cancer, and this was a follow-up/annual scan)... she was so relieved, and I remember being happy for her, and continued sitting there carefree.... and then things changed within an hour when the ultrasound doctor got finished with me, and pretty much told me she would be surprised if this was benign, and she also saw an abnormal lymph node... I cried and cried after I got the news that my lymph node had tested positive.  I had 2 biopsies that day, one on the other breast (for a suspicious spot on MRI), and remember thinking that I would rather have BC in the other breast than have a positive node... I have been forced to have conversations about life insurance, retirement accounts, social security, and changing our wills.... etc.  Anywho... enough on that! Paxton - GI and hot flashes... no fun!  ((HUGS)).  And, do not be nervous about telling your onc you are done with Avastin.. I think you are imagining the reaction being worse than it will be... he will probably just be like, \"well, OK.\"  But, don't worry about it, it IS your body!  Jersey - I love those little manual cars too... they use them for a long time - such fun!  Glad you are feeling better on the Taxol!  Kim - that is so sweet and funny!!  YAY for last chemo on Thursday!  My last taxol is Wednesday, and I start AC the following Tuesday!  YIKES... just 6 days later! Drim - Your day in Central Park sounds wonderful.  Glad your hairs are hanging in there (except the chin ones).  You will have to let us know how rads go, so we'll know what to expect!! Daiva - Sorry about your UTI.  I hope it gets better quick. I don't take probiotics, so I don't know... Jenn - Hey.  I don't think the taxol has really shut down my ovaries like the AC will... I don't get hot flashes, and still just have almost a constant discharge of menstrual stuff...  annoying!  I hope you have less nausea with the taxotere, throwing up stinks!  I think I had a delayed steroid crashd yesterday... I slept almost all day, and then all night, with a few crying bouts in between when I was awake!  A little depression, maybe?!!  Feeling sorry for myself.  Not wanting my DH to go to work and leave me!  Really hoping that these awful headaches go away when I'm done with taxol... really nervous about starting AC next week....  going for a bike ride yesterday evening was all I did!!  I just want to feel better, and can't imagine another 2+ months of chemo... but, it is what it is!  ((HUGS)) everyone! ",

I think I got that in place of Zofran because we blamed Zofran for headaches I got early on with my chemo, so they weren't giving it to me.  But, the headaches have continued, so I think we can rule out zofran... I had some at home, but wasn't taking it because the nurses said I could take it having gotten the aloxy...  my onc said not so, only true for the same day of treatment.  I'm still not feeling great, but much better!  I probably feel bad now just from having spent the last 7 days in a ball on the couch, literally turning myself every 2 hours.  And, I lost 7 pounds.... blah....  finally, I was able to eat real food today, and I am so relieved.  GL to those of you doing rads...

I am so looking forward to that also!  I can honestly say, that I am really going to miss my Oncologist when I don't have to see her every few weeks!!!  We've really gotten to be pretty good friends, in a professional way, you know?  We are really like souls with the same sense of humor!   Paxton - More hugs and prayers to you!  I know this has been especially hard on you, and it sounds like you are starting to see that there is an end too!  That's great!  This will be over, and you will be better, and you will be like your old self, and you will get your strength back, and be happy, and cancer free!!!!!!  OK, I have to cut this off!  Sorry, I didn't reach everyone!  My mom is here visiting, and she needs the couch to go to bed... she sleeps downstairs because she has to use oxygen and her CPAP, and she doesn't do stairs very easily (we have a spare bedroom, but it is upstairs).... so, I'm probably keeping her up now!

I am running out of things that doesn't make my body ill!  I wish I could try some alcohol... or maybe I'm afraid I'll be sick of it if I try it now where my taste buds ruin everything!!  Anywho.... Cheers to you!!  Jenn - YAY!!!!!!!!!!!   I am sooo excited for you!  I know that feeling to know that it IS really working!  And, don't get me started on insurance companies!!  Ugh!  That takes me to a dark place, and I'm not going to dark places today!!  :)  Thanks for the Epsom Salt tip... I've put it in my book with all my other rockin' tips from everyone on here!!  Jen - 20%  hoot!!  I also try to open another window and type posts... but sometimes I forget!!  :)   Great tip about the miles... and look at all that hair!!!!!!!!!!   It is coming in so good!!  Day - That is beautiful... so tiny!  You are very talented!  Hi Magda - Thanks! Theresa - HI again!  A BIG congrats on being finished with chemo!!!!!  I'm glad you have decisions made for rads too; time seems to be flying!!  I'm feeling better than any other AC infusion which is a good thing.  But, I can't eat much, which is tough because I'm so hungry... but if I overeat, I feel terrible!  But, I'll take this over the ball of a person I was the last 2 times.  I cannot believe I only have one more to go. Now, I have a surgery question for you guys.  I haven't had a chance to call my onc...  so at surgery... the BS will take out the cancer, and lymph nodes.... then who puts in the tissue expanders??  I ask because I am trying to see Dr. Massey, but she cannot see me until December (my surgery is to be scheduled sometime in October)... so, is it fine that anyone puts in my tissue expanders, and the PS just gets involved later for the reconstruction???  I feel like maybe I'm getting close to surgery, and I forgot to do something I was suppose to do to be sure all the people are there that need to be.... but I have a 'coordinator' and feel like she should have prodded me if I were missing something???  Another high note... on my Komen fund raising... a friend of mine apparently saw that I had not reached my \"goal\" (which was $1,000)... which is fine because we still have 30 some odd days for donations.... but my friend donated $385 to put me exactly at $1,000.   I am so touched, I don't even have words.  Amazing the support that you get from people who have been somewhat distant over the years.  Do you think it's right that I made a new goal since I reached that one??  :) ((HUGS)) and LOVE to alll!!!!! ",

DH and I are dealing with that come Oct 1st... because our health care 'year' runs Oct 1 - Sep 30.  So, a lot of money out of pocket again!  BC didn't conveniently confine itself to one fiscal year, darnit!!!  :)  Well, that's my health care rant... no one has been able to fix it... so, all I can do is complain a little, because I don't have the solution either!  :)  You know, I didn't even mean to address all of that to you!!  Sorry.  I'll be praying for your ovaries and eggs to be safe, I can only imagine having to go through all of this, and praying that you will be able to have more children when you are done... I think most of us don't have to think about that side of it, and that must cause you extra worry every day.  ((HUGS)) Daiva... let me preface my story by saying that I have many dear friends that are from Jersey.... but, like some others... I, um, enjoy the occassional mock on the State... like \"Why do seagulls fly upside down in New Jersey?\".....  \"Because there is nothing worth $hitting on....\".   But, I digress (sp?)... anyway.. the point of my store... Your subconscience didn't want to actually admit that your daughter was going to school in Jersey!!  LOL..  JK - I'm joking guys... I know it doesn't come over in print well sometimes... so please don't be offended if you are from Jersey or live in Jersey - I'M JOKING!!!!!  :)   Pedis and manicures sound fun!!  I think I've heard other ladies talk about their throats too!  I can only take one pill at a time and use to be able to throw down a handful.. mine is smaller too!   And, if you didn't see it on the YKYACPW thread... I told DH the other night - hey, we got our EOB for prescriptions, and it was $3,500 for the month of October.... he just slowly and quietly said, \"Do you mean, August.\"  WHEN will I stop being chemotarded!!!??  I have to go meet my Nurse Manager for the first time next week (she was hired right after I went out on leave) and she is going to think I am a flaming idiot!!  Really... when I go back to work, she'll probably put me on a new grad full-out orientation!!  :)  LOL Well, that probably WOULD be for the best!!  :) Magda - I read your post, and in my head, imagined doing the cabbage patch for you....  Glad treatment is agreeing with you so well!!  Did you say you were wearing nail polish?  I don't know how much it helps, but I continue to have problems with my fingernails from the taxol.... I still am afraid I will lose one or two if I hit them too hard, they are discolored and separated a bit.  ikes... Do you guys ever wonder what happened to all the ladies who signed up for chemo for our month, and then posted only once or twice??  There are a lot of ladies on that list up there!!  I'm glad for our little-big group, and I pray for you guys daily... sometimes, I can't remember your name... but I know what I'm praying for!!  :) ((HUGS)) all.  PS - feeling a little better everyday... confined to eating fruit, and salad, but that's good!  My mom will be here Sunday to stay for a week while DH is in Pittsburgh with his job.... and I have bunches of appointments next week, so she will be a big help!  I also finally decided to put Nolan in 1/2 day preschool... I was grappling with putting him back into \"daycare\" where he didn't really enjoy it, and didn't always like to go (would just rather be home), and I found this Church like 4 miles away, that has a program 9-12:30, which is academic based, and really what he needs to get ready for kindergarten (he's on the 'young' side with a July bday).  And, it takes care of my worry of how I was going to go through radiation without putting him in that other daycare which I didn't want to do!  I'm excited about him going here now!!  :)  Oh - STUPID QUESTION - Anyone know, when they say \"daily\" radiation for 5-6 weeks; is it really daily, or just Mon-Fri daily\"??  OK, Bye!!",

So, I have numb areas under my arm and on my chest... may or may not get feeling back but really, the least of my worries!  They called me with pathology today, and I had 10 of 10 clear nodes, and a residual amount of DCIS that measured 0.9 x 0.7 cm.... which is awesome!!  I wish that meant I could say that I was Stage 0 or 1... but alas.... it isn't, but it speaks volumes for the decision to do chemo before surgery!!!!  We are thrilled with the results... oh, and she got clear margins.  :)  I will get an official copy of the pathology tomorrow - so am really curious how that will read.  Thank you ALL for your thoughts and prayers; I really believe in it and appreciate everyone doing that for me!!  Denise - I sent you a PM!!  :)  (((HUGS))) everyone.  And, have I said lately how thankful I am to have all of you to help get me through this each and every day!!  :) Love,  Leanna",

I meant to tell you all also... I started on Tamoxifen on Nov 10 (my son's 9th birthday - so, I'll be done when he's 14!!), and as far as I've noticied... very few side effects.  Then again, compared to chemo, you could do pretty serious stuff to my body without me complaining!!  I still have hot flashes, but I had those on chemo, and I may be a little stiff... but it's been totally fine.  I'm not on any other meds other than vitamins and the occasional tylenol, so it's all good.  Like, many of you, still dealing with the bouts of crying at times, but nothing that keeps me from functioning, and I have the military to deal with soon, so I don't want to be on any other meds.  Also, returning to work Dec 26 (yep, while on rads too... yeah!! NOT!!). ((HUGS)) everyone!!  I'll try not to leave for so long again!  Love you all!! :)",

I guess they make me feel like I'm doing something to help fend off the beast.... I take a multivitamin everyday (a breast health one... :), and a Calcium-Vit D combo... then an aspirin 81 mg, tamoxifen and recently added melatonin.  The aspirin and melatonin are off-label uses for fending off breast cancer, but the aspirin studies are quite compelling toward just taking them if you don't have any contraindications, which I don't.  But, I find that doing that everyday gives me a boost that I am doing something... you know??",

Daiva - (((HUGS))) Hope you are feeling like your old self soon.  You still sound great, but I know what you mean!  I am back home... had the DIEP on Friday and was just a bit bummed, because he was suppose to make my right breast from my belly flaps and I knew he was going to have to stack them to make the boob big enough... and then I was suppose to get a small implant in the left to match... well, when I woke up, I found out he had only done one side.  I guess I only had enough tissue to make one average (about the same size as my old) boob, so he didn't do the other side because even a small implant would have made it larger than the other side.  But, he didn't lift it either... so I have to live with staggered boobs again for at least another 3 months when everything settles and he can go in and clean up.  I will say that this is much, much, much more comfortable than the TE...even with all the pain I am still having.  I still cannot stand upright, and I must be swollen because the scale says I gained about 6 pounds since the day before my surgery!  But, so glad to be home and with my boys... 4 days in the hospital was pretty hard on them, especially my older son.  He did well in his track meet Saturday... 1st in shot and 2nd in high jump.  :)  We're very proud of him!  (((HUGS))) to all you wonderful women!! ",

R MX with TEs, and ALND.  Slept with pillows... lots of them, and help every night to get comfortable (a recliner would have been better... will use one when I have my recon next year).  But path was pretty good... showed resiudal tumor of 0.9 x 0.7 cm DCIS.  0/10 nodes positive (pre-chemo I had one positive node).  But, path also showed LVI.... I just don't really know how that plays into everything... any insight is welcome; my onc just doesn't say much about it when I ask!!  My drain was in for 12 days, and doing the stretching exercises shows daily minor improvement!  Another question to those who have had ALND and have that gaping 'hole' under arm.... how the heck do you safely shave it or get rid of the hair??? I'm still in for one more TE fill on Monday; then CT and see when I start Rads and tamoxifen.  Echo today...  ticker is still doing pretty well!  :) HUGS to all for speedy recoveries!!  One day at a time.... take the pills, and remember it has to get better every day!!  :)",

I bet you are right!  Sacphotomom - Aloe is a great idea and something not in my chemo bag YET!  My LGFB class is not until mid-July.  I'm starting to get antsy about it!  I went to Claire's with my DD yesterday and bought some cute big dangly earrings... I think they will go great with my bald head!  Also, had DH get some sherbert yesterday - and not only was it soothing, but it tasted great, not blah like everything else!  Finally, something YUMMY!!   MNLinda - Thank you for the tips.  I was thinking the other day, that I really do love the advantage we have on this board of not having to suffer through trial & error on treating SE.  I feel so very well prepared for chemo...and especially me because I have done it backwards, and seen most go through AC ahead of me.  Drim - We missed you!!  Also thinking, have not seen Cleob in a while. Glad the caps are working for you.  Of all the hair I am losing (its about 60% gone now) - its the darker and gray hairs that are coming out faster than the rest.  I have also had some recent issues with my eyes.  Just a reminder that I still refuse to think I need reading glasses also.  Kim - Relax!!  You deserve a rest!  :)  I know what you mean... that draining feeling is so hard to deal with.  I have that with a headache to boot.  Boo.  ((HUGS)) NJgirl -  I would try a light covering of cortison cream for the itching; I don't know about benadryl though.  I thought my rashes were from the chemo, which I guess ultimately they were.. but they were more a reaction of sun and chemo.  I've been sure to stay out of the sun this past week, and no more rashes or itching.  But the cortisone cream 2-3 times a day helped a lot!  I hope you had a blessed time at the Christening today!  Paxton - Big (((HUGS))) for you!  Wishing you some energy soon!  LauraM - Lucky for your DD!  It's so hard to watch your kids play sports... if my son goes much further with football, I don't think I will be able to go to the games!  Patricia48 - I will be praying for a clean scan on your thyroid also!  I am so impressed with your walking and yoga.  Keep it up!!  You give me a great idea though.. I never have time for crocheting anymore... maybe now is the time to pick it up again!  To all moving on to Taxol... I think (IMHO) that we have had similar SE... but yours have seemed more drastic than mine; and adding the injections with the pain... until the other day when I had shooting pain in my left hip (for some unknown reason), pain has not been a SE I have had.  But, we have all shared in the nausea, fatigue and taste changes.  My infusions were Thursdays, and my somewhat normal feeling days started somewhere around monday night - tuesday and lasted until Friday.  Lately, however, seems to be dwindling... I guess this is the cumulative effect.  Happy Father's day again to everyone!! ",

Stupid toxic drugs to kill cancer.  Boo!  That's good about your blood work!  I got a copy of my labs today, and all I could do was stare at them.  Everything is within normal limits... What??  I said to the nurse, you cannot even tell I'm on chemo!  My WBC normal... ANC normal.  I'm shocked!  I have been exercising more the past week, and DH and I did a 2.5 mile brisk walk last night, so maybe that's helped??  Oh, and I know what you mean about your mom!  I have been putting mine off for a while, because we do well for about a day or two, and then I just get so short with her... then I feel guilty for not cherishing her more, and I feel bad.... so, it's easier for me right now just to keep in touch with her by phone.  Plus, my mom is needy when she comes... like, she really wants just \"MY\" time and isn't really interested in the kids, so then I feel like I have to entertain her as well, and just not up to that.  I hope you have a good visit; you can come here and vent!!  Summer - Hey!!  I'm actually 'ready' for the deed!  But, I can't.  Military regs do not allow a woman to shave her head.  And, the only reason I'm still on the base is to finish my time for this year (as a reservist you have to do so many days to have a good year) - and they \"buried\" my paperwork to allow me to have a good year.  My next step with them, is NED, and then meet a military medical board for them to decide if I can get back in.  On a lighter note, I found a wig I like, and DH and I are going to 'shop' tomorrow to make sure it's the 'one' I want.  It's $500 less than my insurance allows, so I thought there might be something nice for more money still covered by insurance somehwere.  if not, they have it on hold for me.  it's blonder than my hair, but, what the hell, I'll be blond again for a while!!  :)  Packjen - sending you hugs while you go through this tough time!  Have you tried cool baths soaking in a solution... like.... (my brain is not working)... ugh.. can't think - but you know what I mean?  As for the Reflux.. I really like the Pepcid complete chewables (they are expensive and you can only have 2 a day, but are wonderful) and the rolaids.  (Tums actually upset my belly so I stay away from them).  I hope it gets better for you.  Stomach malaise is awful... just makes you feel stinky all over.  Mel - good luck with your last T.  I know what you mean about the known versus the unknown!!  Sunflower - Let us know how your Rad consult goes.  I'll be doing rads too - curious what they will go over with you!  Day - I love your story about the wrap!  I'm so glad you are feeling well too!!  I hope it lasts as long as possible!  I am finding I am getting a little too use to my 'cycle' of feeling bad!  I just had treatment#7 today, and I actually feel like a person... but now starts the downslide!   Blah!  I have girl night out dinner to look forward to on Tuesday night - at one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Charleston, and I am sooo looking forward to getting out and seeing everyone!  Can't decide if I want to go wig or wrap??  Drim - I hope the neulesta doesn't give you any SE.  I think its great the cold caps are working for you too. Do you have to wear it other than during treatment, and are you normal with your hair otherwise?  Just curious?  And, time is passing... started in May, and it's almost July!!   Amazing!  RedBarb - Thinking about you today and hoping your infusion went well.  I'm glad your heart checked out ok, but sorry you were so scared!  Every 'friggin' ache.. my goodness.  I started with a new symptom of bone pain last week, and it's pretty common with the taxol, but of course is scaring the begees out of me!  I'm praying for you! Kim - congrats on shaving!  My day is Thursday next week... I finish work on Wednesday.  We keep saying my 8 year old gets to do it, but I think he will be scared and emotional, so I'm not sure how it will go - we will make it as positive as possible, but I'm apprehensive.  I don't look good with the hair that's left either, but it is presentable when I pull it back in a ponytail, so it's working, but I know what you mean about how it looks... so thin!  So glad it was positive, and love your hairdresser story.  GolferGirl - Glad you are feeling better!  I love that you are using the caps too and they are working!  And, you made me LOL about your chinnies... stubborn lil' suckers!!  NJbhwgirl - YAY for treatment 4.  Boo for feeling bad over the weekend.  Saturday is when my SE kick in full effect also!  We'll be bumbing together!  I'm sorry this is so long girls!  And, I still didn't get everyone - I went back on this page - but I read everyone's posts!  Thank you all for being here, and so positive and supporitve.  I love how everyone jumps in and supports whatever decisions we make, and encourage us to be the best we can!  I love that I can come here, and go through this journey with you all!!   ((HUGS)) Leanna",

I usually start them the day before treatment and continue until I am going well, usually 2-3 days after treatment).  Somewhere around this same time my taste buds seem to change also.  Day 3, usually pretty tired, day 5-6 starting to feel normal again.  I've had fleeting problems with neuropathy... minor... so I've been taking Vit B-12 about every other day, iron and multivit every day.  My blood counts went down for about the first month, and my last 2 or 3 labs have been pretty much within normal limits.  I have had fleeting bone pain in my hips, and also headaches that started around week 3 or 4.  I have not had any nail changes, and I keep polish on them.  I think that's about it, other than the occasional bloody noses.  Usually have 1 every to every other day and they stop easy with pressure.  I feel pretty crappy if I try to go out in the heat - and have had random rashes that my onc say are not 'normal' taxol rashes (elbows, finger and side of my hand).  Not much nausea, and a little more tired than pre-treatment.  Overall, nothing major!  Hope that helps.  Let us know how you do!  Daiva - Welcome!  Thanks for the words of encouragement - I will look up Louise Hay.  You sound so upbeat - you are my hero today!!  Yesterday my hero was fotopet for going all nude!!!  Fotopet - GL with visit from your mom!  And, I totally understand... just tired of being tired!  :)  HUGS!!!  Summer - Thank you for being so kind.  I'm worried about my 8 year old... he has 3 baseball games this week, and I'm afraid he will be embarrassed if I am bald... :(  It's such a tough age, I don't want to scar him anymore than this is already, you know?  Drim - Puerto Rico sounds awesome - a mini vacation in between treatment!!   RebBarb - ALMOST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Library Jenn - YAY for the port!!  Much more practical than a PICC (what were they thinking??). And, I have to tell you that I LOL about your MIL and her paper route!  :)  WellSey66 - Welcome and thanks for the reminders about organic!  JennyB - That's awesome about the pool.  Water exercise is the best!  Patricia48 - Hope you are feeling better after the transfusion!  Sounds like you needed a good rest afterwards!!  Well, DH is out... think I might go shave my head.....  we'll see....

I'm just so uncomfortable... my TE was 'rapid expansion' 0-480 mLs in 2 1/2 weeks.  So sore if I try to sleep on my side, which is the way I love to sleep... it must pull on the muscle.  And, apparently I like to form scar tissue, because the tendons in my right arm are so tight that if I reach out to the side, you can see 2 tendons under my arm and one of them is visible all the way down my bicep almost to the elbow!  The PS said he would 'release' them when he does the recon next year... probably sometime in the summer... I told him I had to wait and could not have recon as soon as he wants.  He was ok with that.  Those that had ALND... what are you doing to shave under that arm?  I don't dare take a razor to it for fear of cutting myself; a man's electric razor is too big to get in there.... and it's starting to look prettttty bad!!!!!!  I too, finally have full eyebrows and eyelashes, and I think I made out... got more eyelashes than I had prechemo!!  My hair is coming in black and gray (at least that's what it looks like) and I had light-dark brown hair before...hmmphffff.  Funny to see the way the hair 'leans' naturally and the cowlicks (is that how that's spelled).  Sorry, I haven't been on more.. it's just uncomfortable to use the computer right now.... so mostly I just get on and make sure I pay all my bills and check my emails!!  :) HUGS and Prayers to everyone!!!!!!",

I know it would be tough to pick betweeen your children/grandchildren, but I was her ONLY child with children, so it should have been easy.  Listened to her for years talk about her friends that were moving to California and Arizona to be near their grandkids, and we could barely get a 6-hour visit out of them because of their dogs.... and now you want to come up here, and take over tradition.... no.  My youngest started preschool last week, and I know it's the best for him, but gosh I miss him like crazy not being at home!!!!!!  Love you guys!!  <3",

I think it is just when you couple that with the other stuff that I get upset at the totality of it all.  I mean what is the big deal with a breast ultrasound or MRI once a year?  Jenn - That's so great about work.  I think I kind of felt the same way too, and still do sometimes.  It really does make everything seem so normal and it feels good to get back to normal.  Your puppy story made me laugh... also reminded me why we still don't have a puppy, LOL!!  And, yes, I do go for my herceptin every 3 weeks.... until July.  That's the other thing... there is question (I mean, I know we are always at risk) but, it may seem for Her2+ that there is a greater risk in the first 8 months to 3 years for recurrence, and after that it decreases.  Maybe I just need to hurry along to my 3 year mark so I can cool my jets.  Magda - Was that you that said \"bratitude?\"  Because, I soooo read that \"brat - i - tude\" as in I was being a brat with my docs... which I am!!!  :)  I don't think I am going to go back to my rad onc anymore.  I seriously think that is one doc I am done with.  I didn't like her from the moment I met her.... I don't know what she does for me... and I am pissed that she never told me that getting tissue expanders would interfere with the amount of rads I would be able to get.  I believe you should give people ALL of their options and allow them to make their own treatment choices... and she didn't do that.  Good job on your problem solving at work (to get off my soap box once again).  They are so lucky to have you!!  :) Denise - Sorry about the fleas... like I said to Jenn... another reason no dog for me (and our cat is strictly indoor).  Yes, your brain acuity will heighten... it has taken a while for mine to kick back in... someone will bring up a medical question, and it will actually take a minute for me to figure it out.... like norepinephrine... it clamps you down... brings your pressure up... had to actually think about that for a minute the other day!!  Glad it wasn't during an emergency.  :)  Oh, and btw, there is a national shortage of norepinephrine.  Have fun visiting your daughter!! Hi Laura.  Yes, me too, darlin'!!  I'm so sorry for your friend!!  I think it's sad that for the most part whenever I run into someone who says my mom or grandma had breast cancer x number of years ago and is still around... and I ask what stage... they ALWAYS say oh, very early, Stage 1.  That kind of makes my heart sink.  The only person I know who had a relative with Stage 4 buried her 2 years ago.  I know we are all differnt and there are long term survivors, and the playing field is getting better with new drugs and herceptin, but the stats alone are enough to drive you insane!  Even the woman at my job who was just diagnosed and someone told me she was stage 3... I talked to her the other day, and she didn't mention stage, just that the only chemo she had to do was 4 rounds of AC and that's it, because her onc told her that her BC was \"lazy\" a very non-aggressive tumor.  Deep down, I found myself jealous and feeling awful for that.   Congrats on a great check up and all the birthdays!!!  :)  They are all so special now, aren't they?!  :) Daiva - that's a great story about your daughter's friend.  I believe open adoption is the way to go and better for everyone (I was adopted, btw).  I hope your energy comes back soon... I know mine dropped but anymore have trouble figuring out what is normal fatigue just from working and taking care of the house and family!  At least Ryan only has one sport going on for right now!  Patricia - Glad you had a great trip!  Happy Birthday!!  Hope the yoga helps with the tightness.  I do have to say that I am very fortunate that I have not had that problem.  I began stretching very early and doing shoulder rolls from the beginning and was fortunate to not have any limited ROM.  I have minor discomfort with certain movements and loss of strength, but I think that's expected when you can't do any strength training so to speak.  Hope you get all your energy back soon!! Drim - Like I said before, my big issue is not the fact that I won't get blood tests... it's that I am being offered ONLY a yearly mammogram when my 7 cm tumor was MISSED on mammogram just last year... AND they were looking for it because I felt it.  It was only seen by follow up ultrasound, and then of course, biopsy.  So WHY am I ONLY getting an annual mammo when it missed Stage 3 BC.  Obviously, I have dense boobs, and I didn't evey feel the tumor until it was very large and I was doing SBE!  My onc even thought that I would have ILC because my tumor did not act like IDC nor 'feel' like IDC on physical exam... it did not present as a 'lump' but rather as a hardening, which would explain how I had missed it for a long time.... didn't know I was looking for a texture change and not a pea!!!  As my husband says, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over even though it doesn't work.  That sounds awfully familiar to me right now!!!!!  :)  Have fun with your renovations; that is so exciting!!!  And, please let us know about the cold cap segments!  We had a good time in Myrtle Beach for the long weekend... the kids really enjoyed Medieval Times and Magi-Quest.  It was just nice to get away for a bit!  Back to the grind now... have to work for the next 3 nights in a row and have infusion tomorrow morning when I get off work.  I already warned them that I would be in the middle of 3 days of work, so it would need to be a quick one and they agreed!!  I don't usually work 3 in a row but scheduled this so we could take a trip with the kids not realizing it was infusion week!  Sorry this was so long!!!!  (((HUGS))) to all!!",

Spininfool - Hope your neulesta shot goes well, easy and SE free!  Summer, RedBarb - I love hershey too; you are reminding me that I have not taken the 2 youngest... we're hoping to get up to PA to see Thomas, and Hershey would be nice too.  How close are those 2 things?  IrishTess - that sounds like an awesome celebration when you are done and NED!!!  DH and I have not decided on our NED celebration. Summer - beautiful picture - you are both gorgeous!!  LOVE all the pictures!!  Drim - so, I have runny noses for a year to look forward to (eye roll here).  Super!!  ;)  Herceptin does seem to be uneventful.  The big worry factor is the cardiotoxicity.  Staying active, and praying.  My onc said she will repeat EKG at the end of the 12 weeks (I wonder if that is usual, it says you should monitor cardiac function frequently; is that frequently, or is that normal for someone with a good ejection fraction?)  Will you remain on herceptin for 1 year?  Patricia!!  I am losing my hairs down there... have not had to shave my legs, still have to shave my underarms, but not growing chin hairs anymore (whoot!).  Strange!!  Meeting in a year would be great!!!  I'm in S. Carolina.  Good job keeping up your walking and yoga, I am so impressed.  I haven't been running since I was diagnosed... I think I'm afraid to jiggle the cancer, but it's ok to run, right??    RedBarb - sorry sweetie!  Sigh...  It's part of the healing and killing the cancer, and it's temporary!  It sucks - your kids will be great!  :)  LibraryJenn - Welcome!!  Sorry you are here, but we're all in this together (insert music here).  Your diagnosis is similar to mine, except estrogen neg.  Where is your BC??  I have a 3 year old son (and 8 and 17 year old daughter) - how's your son doing with you being bald?  Our 3 year old is pretty oblivious to all of it - but VERY good when he has to go to grandma's or have a sitter because I have to go to the \"doctor\" AKA weekly treatment.  I am doing taxol and herceptin weekly x 12 first - then AC DD x 4, surgery, rads, tamoxifen, continue herceptin every 3 weeks for a year.  I'm sorry you have to wait so long for test results.  That stinks.  When I had my bone scan, the radiology tech showed me that everything was clear except 2 hot spots; one on the back of my head and one on my hyoid bone (strange).  My onc considered the bone scan clear and said those are not normal spots for metastasis... but didn't gander at what they might be.  I'm working now (RN) but will stop once I start on the AC.. well, I think... my WBC is dropping and my ANC (the important infection indicator) has dropped below 2... so not good.  Hi KimLovesDachshunds - I'm sorry!!  When will your wig be here??  I haven't ordered mine.  Just got a script last week and was on vacation... project for next week!  I signed up for the Look Good Feel Better, and the lady I talked to made it sound like they would prefer that I not bring anyone.  Those of you that have been - were you comfortable if you brought a friend, or those that went alone, comfortable alone??  The next class is not for another 5 weeks, yikes!!  I still have about 60% of my hair, and my hair was so thick to start that I realize I still have as much hair as the average woman.  I have to admit I have a bad (BAD) habit of picking a couple of spots on my head when I am nervous or stressed... I am scared of what they will look like when I am bald... obviously the stress of all this and losing my hair has caused me to be picking at those spots lately... need to stop!  Someone slap my hand, please!!!  Who will be on here later - I'll be jacked up on steroids tonight!  We're headed to Myrtle Beach tomorrow for the State track meet with out 8 year old - coming back on Saturday.  Thanks for the info on period.  If it gets any heavier, I will call onc early... next appt is not for 4 or 5 weeks.  Hope everyone has a blessed - SE free weekend!!  (((HUGS))) Leanna",

I know my onc is usually amenable to doing whatever helps ease my mind!  And, yes, Nolan loves his \"motorcycle!!\"  I love that he calls it a motorcycle!!  Haha.  And, Daiva, yes, you need to be very careful on your nadir days... the days your counts are most likely to tank... it is safer to not work or be around people on those days... cook food completely... do not eat fresh fruit... do not be around fresh flowers.  Sacphotomom - YAY for no nausea... boo for bad pain!  And.... I'll be here!  I have 2 more weeks of taxol and then start AC!!!!!  :)  Summer - I got bone pain only one week so far from the taxol and it was in my hips... and it was 'stop everything' pain... no sleep, no rest, awful... awful!  You need something stronger if that's what you are feeling!  I took oxycodone and ativan (I know ativan is not for pain, but helps you relax!!).  Tess - I will have a right mast with AND, and TE placement.  Originally, I was going to have a bilateral... especially as the news of the cancer kept getting worse and worse... you know the story... first call... IDC... then more tests and it's a big tumor, plus lymph nodes... by my BRCA tests were negative, and I think my Ki67 is not terribly high (I don't know, I just figured it out today).  I think probably if pathology shows any lobular, I will probably have the other side taken later too.  My reason for the single mast now, is to not run into any more problems than necessary to get rid of the cancer now.  I'll be really curious to see post-surgery pathology!   Sorry about the neuropathy; mine was 'light' and fleeting.  Patricia - the Taxol made me feel very 'hang-overish' on my bad days... just tired, tired, tired of feeling crappy, and having crappy butt!  (chemo pellets....)  Lots of water... get it out!!!!   I don't know about the steroids... I remained on them the entire time despite no reactions.  ?  Curious.. keep us posted!!  Kim - That's awesome!!!!  My husband asked me about the weather the other day, and I said, I don't know... the only reason I ever checked the weather was to see whether or not to wear my hair down... I wouldn't if it was going to rain (because rain comes with humidity and the frizzes)... and now, well... duh, it doesn't matter.  I love the freedom of no hair!  I bet it felt great to dance in the rain!  Jenn- Funny!  Daddy, kiss my bum!!  I hope you get great news from the onc.  How does it feel to you; any smaller?  Fotopet - YES on the last treatment tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!! And, what is Norco??  More fun tomorrow!  Get to go buy a new calendar for the fridge to put all the school stuff on it... do I need to do it now?  No, but I need to do something!!  The house is getting so incredibly organized little by little!  And, I finally got all the pictures up on the upstairs hallway!  We painted more than a year ago and the frames have been sitting around... finally did it and it looks great!!  Pat pat!! :)  Wish I could get outside and work on the landscaping... boo.  ((HUGS)) everyone!! ",

I was hoping to get into that clinical trial, but was HER2+.  I thought I wanted that drug.  Did they say why?  Daiva - Yes, if your blood counts are low enough (neutrophils), only canned fruits should be consumed.  :(  Sucks, I know.  You know what though.... I was thinking of Day too, and thinking she should be in cancer research and find a cure for this!!!  And, speaking to the mortality subject... yes (see further down in my post also).  Reading the stats on BC are so incredibly sobering... it's hard to explain to other people, but I think you have to be honest.  My friend asked me about it today, and I just told him that BC is a nasty beast with high recurrence rates (most people do not know), so we hope for the best!  I'm sorry if it's not appropriate, but yeah, I think about it alot and just hope and pray that I see my children grow up, and hope that the memories we make are great ones.  I want to be a grandmother.   Our kids are close in age... I have a 17 year old daughter, senior in high school, my almost 9 year old.. playing tackle football for the first time this fall, and my 4 year old who is destined to be class clown... he's adorable with his blond hair and blue eyes, and he knows it!  Rotten to the core!  LOL... just like his mom!  :)  Mel - Hi!  Good to see you.  So glad for no reactions!!  Summer - YES!  Have one for me!  Day - Thanks for the info on brocolli sprouts... I'm going to look into that too!  And, my onc. insists on an AND... I had one node test positive, so she said they all have to go.  I am very upset about this, and even asked her, can't you test them during surgery, and not do a full dissection if they come back neg... she said no... boo.  And, I have to ask, if you don't mind... how old are you?  I understand if you don't want to answer... you are very wise, but I have a feeling you are younger than I think.  Sacphotomom - How have I never hear hydrocodone called Norco???   Yes, that's good stuff!  As for the flowers... I would leave them in the garden.  Also, you should not have direct contact with any soil.  If you have to, wear gloves and wash well after.  I'm sorry about your pain.  That stinks.  I hope they get you something QUICK that works!!!  I've been pretty emotional too...  but it's actually from a letter I got from the Susan Komen Foundation... I have donated previously, and I got my annual address labels and stickers.. and all the 'stats' on breast cancer just really hit home, and I have been a bit down from it.  Patricia - I'm am so inspired by all you do, I had my husband 'ready' my bike for some cycling.  I don't think running is a good idea right now, in this heat, so I'm going to start cycling again.  And, this time I bought a helmet... for the first time, to set the example for my kids!!  :)  Such a nice story about the applesauce... people are just awesome!  Hi Laura!  :)  I'm sorry about bone pain - it really is unbearable!  Ugh.  As for the alcohol, I don't think my onc specifically spoke about drinking, but I think I read it in the info sheets on the medications.  I don't, but not because I'm being super-healthy... mostly it's because I feel like I have a hangover most days anyways, and could not fathom adding alcohol to that!  I'm looking forward to having a beer or 5 when I'm done with chemo!  LOL Jenn - sorry about your onc fill-in.  Doctors can be so insensitive, but I usually chalk it up to the fact that they had their heads in books for so many years, it doesn't leave time to develop bedside manner.  Especially true for oncologists!  But, even though your tumor doesn't 'feel' smaller... it definitely isn't bigger, so something is happening!   And, like you, I talk about my online friends all the time too!  Truly, a blessing.  And, cappucinos that I use to love don't taste the same either... just as well, I guess, ok, I know I don't need the sugar!  Jersey - Sorry you had to be hospitalized, but that's so great that you were able to get out and be with your son!  And, wow, 70 people!!  I only know 70 people if I include you guys... JK!  :)  Sounds like it was a good time with others taking care of everything!  I still have my eyebrows, but most other hair is gone; I think they are about the last to go.  Also heard that when they come back... your eyelashes will tend to cycle off at the same time for a while as well; until they get out of sync to where you don't notice you are losing a few at a time as is natural.  So, today (Wednesday), is our anniversary... DH took the day off (after being at his job for all of 2 days... luckily, he went to work with a man who knows him well, and understands the situation and supports him fully), and we have treatment, and then are going to try and eat Japanese after.  I was at a loss of what to buy him, so I bought a yard game we can all play, and dropped off his wedding band to be resized bigger so he can wear it.  He gained a much needed 20-25 pounds since he's been out of work.. up to a whopping 180!  :)  Question - Anyone else getting pimples??  Really, no hair... random rashes... bloated steroid belly... and zits to boot!  Does it get any better than this??  I know we have ladies finishing up... but I hope we can still come here to connect even when we are done with chemo and on to different things.  On this board.. you ARE my gals; the ones I know the best and feel bonded with!  Hugs, love you guys!",

I might need it!!  Jersey - glad you are feeling better on the taxol!  As for the ants.... if you use listerine mouthwash - it also gets rid of mosquitos (not sure if they are a problem, but we have them here in the south).  And, ants hate baby powder too... if you know where they are going in.   Sacphotomom - I finally drug out the crock pot because I wasn't always feeling like cooking dinner when I was suppose to, especially now after taking care of the kids all day... so, this way, I can start something in the morning or afternoon - just set it at high or low depending, and let it be!  We had pork tenderloin with potatoes and carrots tonight.... with gravy from the drippings.  My 4 year old is a picky eater, and tenderloin and some chicken are all the meat he will eat, and he is little for his age.  So, he liked the tenderloin and that's a good thing!  GG - Again, GL with rads!  HUGs all, Leanna",

I don't have a common name... just send me a little message (because I don't know any of your last names!!).  I posted some cute pics today... some more bald ones, and don't worry, I'm not one of those gamers that will post that stuff on your wall!!!  :) (((HUGS)))  Leanna",

It gets worse when I eat.  Food just makes me feel terrible.  I want to eat; I am hungry, and it seems to go down fine (I did throw up 2 nights ago out of the blue hours after eating).... is it a GI lining issue?  Normally, I feel like my old self by this time after chemo, but not this time.  usually my morning is good (I eat just a banana in the am), and then after lunch I feel like crud and don't want to eat for the rest of the day. ",

I didn't know about waiting for rads until they are fully expanded... how long does that take??  And, then the exchange 6 months after rads.  Hopefully, my PS can plan on scheduling that now, which will put me around June next year.  I'm amazed at all the waiting!!  Seems to me we should be pushed ahead of cosmetic surgeries... but those are probably more lucrative!'   Oh, and I am still having neuropathy issues.  Stubbing my toes, falling up stairs, fingernails hurting, discolored... I hope it goes away!  I don't know what the hosp stay is for the DIEP, it's one night for the mx, I'm guessing 2 nights after DIEP... maybe 3 if you're having any difficulties.  Jenn - that's awesome that your son loves his sitter!  Sometimes, I know it's hard when they want to go... but it really is just that is seems more fun to play with all the other children!  And, the chemo... I'm not bouncing back from this last AC either.  I woke up this morning and felt like I had a hangover... headache, stomach rot, nausea, just felt bad... took a bunch of pills and felt better!!  It's just so frustrating to feel bad for so long; I just want normal again!!!  Don't we all?  Sorry about your freezer!    My brother tried to tell me I was 'lucky' the other day... and I said, no, \"blessed\" I am, but lucky no!  Hope your cold clears up soon!  Daiva - Yes, surgery in October is MX and ALND.  I'm still very fatigued too, and was very anemic this round...not eating much is not helping either.  I can't even imagine when I'm going to be able to go for a run again... my butt looks like cottage cheese.... :) Latte - I think all your questions were answered, but the rads would damage the tissue, that's the reason for the TEs and the wait.  And, I believe the TEs hold the skin ready for the exchange from the abdomen area.  Patricia - A Grand Piano!!  You go girl!!!  That's awesome... can I assume that you already play?  That's something I always wished I had done! Magda - Hope it stays bearable... bareable?? for you!!  :)  Theresa - ((HUGS))  I hope you feel better soon too!!!  Taking Ryan (and Nolan) to football practice in a little bit, then looking forward to a good night's sleep.  These night sweats wake me, then I'm freezing, then some of the meds give me weird dreams.... I don't think it's possible to get a good night's sleep taking pills, but I think it's better than without!!  :).  Tomorrow is Thursday... usually the day I start to feel recovered from AC... here's hoping that hold's true!!",
