You just can't imagine how comforting a hug and \"I LOVE YOU\" can be.  you can't get enough of those words. There have been many positive things in my life that have come from being diagnosed with cancer.  I appreciate every day, nature, flowers, my family. my husband and I have become very close (after 30 years of marriage) You need to be at appointments because we can not remember easily everything that was said. Write some things down. Come back to the board and talk whenever. Losing your breasts can be very traumatic.  If she does need to go this route, make sure she still knows and can feel SEXY to you. Research, but don't get obsessed with it, it can overwhelm you and scare you unnecessarily. Good luck to a special person",
