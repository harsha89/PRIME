Fifteen long months and a total of 44 doctor visits between the surgery and follow ups, blood work, and of course chemo. I'm here to tell you that as much as I resented how the ill effects of the chemo and all the medical care disrupted my life and crushed my vitality for 2 years, I'm here today, cancer free, just finished my last 3 month breast exam and will now go to every 6 months. I never thought I would get my life back and it isn't the same, it's better because I lived through this and came out stronger on the other side. And I'm close to my full pre-breast cancer vitality.  It will happen, you will survive, and you will be stronger for having lived through it. Baby yourself in every way possible, remind yourself of how brave you are for facing the chemo dragon(-; and winning. Is it certain that 4 rounds works any better than 3? Probably not, but I think we'd probably agree that its probably best to follow the treatment plan as prescribed until they figure out a more effective one which by the way, DOES happen! LOL! I did manage to convince my oncologist that 15 months of chemo was enough, I didn't need radiation to follow!!!!! She agreed especially since during that 15 months, new research came out indicating that both weren't necessary or found to be any more effective than chemo alone with my 2 cm ductal carcinoma mastectomy. So I think you should feel okay about  questioning the treatments with your oncologist. Hang in there girlfriend. Let people love and spoil you and have faith you'll come through. Things look and feel really good from here, 2 years later(-: Best, Genell",

Most days, I find I no longer want to hang on to the only breast I have left and it gives me back pain, shoulder pain, trouble balancing when braless, and prosthesis works well, but hate wearing it anyway. I do know that my medical insurance will cover the removal of the other breast as a reconstructive surgery. I've considered it more than one, maybe I will do it someday. Can't bear the idea of reconstructive options, surgeries, weekly doctor visits again and potential reconstructive issues. I had so much trouble with drain tubes and healing after my mastectomy, I never want to go through that by choice... You've never really seen yourself naked until you are bald (-;  Genell",
