I never imagined in my worst nightmares that I would one day walk into my own bathroom to find my husband unconscious on the floor after trying three different methods of suicide at one time! First he slashed his wrists, then when that didn't seem to work fast enough, he took a whole new packet of Effexor, then tied a rope around his neck three times with some fancy knot and pulled it tight. With help from an ambulance dispatcher, I somehow revived him within the 3-4 minutes before two ambulances arrived. Living with my dx for three years has stressed him out so badly that he was in a major depression before I knew of it a week ago.  He told me on the previous Monday that he thought he was depressed so I got him in to see a psychologist the next day.  She rang DH's GP who prescribed Effexor for him and he had only had three days of the medication by Friday, too soon for it to work effectively. After three days in the ICU with heart problems due to the drug and tying a rope around his neck, he is now in a mental health unit until this Friday while they find another medication that suits him. This man is/was an Alpha male, strong and silent, and I would never have dreamt he was capable of such actions.  Now I feel as if I didn't really know him at all.  I didn't want to put this out there but, after long consideration, I feel that I should warn others that maybe not all the Dear husbands out there are coping as well as we think they are.  He has been a very positive support to me over the last three years and I didn't realise that maybe he needed someone to talk to who would be an objective and positive support for him.  I think that we were so busy protecting each other from the truth of the future, we didn't talk about our feelings/fears up front to each other.  If he had had a brother/father/best friend to talk to, he may not have tried what he did last week.  He now has that friend in a counsellor who can listen to him and support him through his fears without censure, for as long as he feels the need. I hope that this might help others who are not aware of the awful toll this takes on our menfolk. Sheila.
