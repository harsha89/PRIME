I was a little blown away with the limitations and effects of having just one lymph node removed from under my arm.I had a Matectomy of my right breast done on Nov 22nd 2010. They took one lymph node from under my right arm. My surgeon told me that I would possibly suffer some swelling after the surgery. I was not aware that it would be a lifetime possibility of swelling occuring from this procedure. It is taking a little getting use to since my job is housekeeping and pushing my somewhat heavy cart and what my job consists of,I may need to rethink my job potition. As I am going to apparently put myself at risk of getting lymphedema or swelling of the arm or hand.I am on a sick leave at the moment and plan on returning to work soon.I did not opt to get reconstructive surgery of my right breast and am also about to get a protisis.I was going to wait to get a glove,but now that I saw the reality of what can happen if precations are not taken I think it may be wize for me to rethink this too. What is your opinion on the compression bandage  if I have no swelling yet?Thanks very much for taking the time to post your pictures. You to me were more informative with those pictures than any doctor visit.I am true testimony to that. thnx again Angel1960",
