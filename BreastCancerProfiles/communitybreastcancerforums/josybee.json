I had  the same problem ad far as being raw under the breast, I was actually bleeding in that area. They gave me a spray cleanser called Allegiance Wound Cleanser and gauze pads to just pat dry that area, do not rub it. A Happy New Year to everyone!!!  We certainly deserve it!!!",

When I asked my onc nurse about Taxol she if I didn't have any problems with AC the Taxol should be easier. Actually this last AC took me a little longer to recoup than the first three. As far as the Taxol and bone/joint pain, I had a lot of bone pain every time I had the Neulasta shot ( which was the day after AC 4X)  It mainly bothered me at the reconstruction site the most, had to take pain meds.

The chemo nurse said I would probably hit a wall by the weekend, hope it's not to bad. Said by second treatment would lose hair, has anyone lost their eyelashes or eyebrows with this treatment??? Don't mind the hair but would hate to lose eyelashes too. I have also emailed Laurie Erickson @ Franceluxe.com regarding the free wrap but have not received a response. Is it better to call??? Thanks!!!! ",

The first chemo & shot were the worst for me, 3 days after neulasta shot I was in bed all day with headaches and my breast hurt the most. 2nd chemo & shot was not as bad,no headaches only a lot of pain with the breast & breast bone. Has anyone had reconstruction with tram flap??  If so, do you have a lot of pain at the site after your neaulasta shot. It seems since I started the chemo & neulasta it hurts a lot more. ",

I have had a good appetite, but I do get a lot of heartburn for about a week after the treatment so I usually have to take pepcid after I eat. I have been getting the most problems from the Neulasta shot which I have to have after the first 4 treatments. It seems to really affect my reconstruction sight the most.

I just had my 2nd Taxol on Wednesday, I have a good appetite and mostly everything tastes pretty good. Not so when I had AC, also I had a lot of swallowing problems with AC, felt like my throat was sore, nothing tasted good, had a lot of mucus. My first Taxol I only had the body aches, legs, back, breast area, otherwise I felt pretty good. So far after the 2nd I feel good, my breast area is starting to hurt more (where I had reconstruction) but I also had to have a Neulasta shot this time (they only give it after my 2nd Taxol) and that always bothered that area when I had the shots after AC. I guess I will see how I feel tomorrow. I just think so far that this seems to be better than the AC. Good luck on Tuesday, I'm sure you will do fine. ",
