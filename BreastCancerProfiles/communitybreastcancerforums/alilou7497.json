Mary - I know how you feel about chemo and work.  I'm also working, I'm a single parent with a 16 year old I really didn't have a choice.  I am lucky that my employer has been supportive about this entire situation and understands my chemo day or my mental health day.  He doesn't even dock my pay.  I took off a month and when I got back he told me \"this is a forever situation and we are here with you forever, don't play hero.  If you don't feel well you go home and you tell us so we can send you in a cab\"  Only once did not a need that offer but I'm glad it was made.  Two days ago he just came and hugged me without saying anything.   At first it was hard  because I live Bronx, New York and my job is by Ground Zero in Manhattan which is about 1 1/2 hours by train.  Its tiring to get here and back home but while you are breathing life goes on and things have to get done.  I just thank God that he has given me the strength to do it.  Plus being at work is much easier than being at home....home makes me feel sorry for myself and then depressed and then morbidity sets in.  The I'm going to die syndrome.  So I rather just try and keep busy.  Plus it makes my son feel better, like I'm going to make it. The bone mets have me nervous.  I have superficial bone mets on my femur and tibia and when I walk that leg becomes stiff and tired and I tend to drag it.  do you guys think that's from the Mets? I am on taxol and carbo.  The side effects are minimal except for that one day after the second infusion (3 weeks and 1 week off) when I get depressed and tired and I cry over anything. I haven't had a scan since I started the chemo session #6 will be next Wednesday.  How long does it take before they scan you after you start?  I feel like its working because my urine (sorry) is back to normal color. (although I don't know if that means anything) and my breathing is basically back to normal so I am assuming the lung mets have resolved somehow but I don't know anything for sure. In any event thanks for being here and I am here for anyone that needs to talk.",

So second opinions are okay. I have bone mets the report said superficial. I see my onc about it tomorrow but I believe that they are not large or embedded deep in the bone. At least that's what I believe but I will find out more tomorrow. My onc is planning to give me Xgeva. She says its a shot that I will get every 28 days. Look it up and question your onc about it. I lost my hair too and it had grown back so nicely. But you know that is secondary to everything else we are going through even though it depressed me and sometimes still does. I think is great that you have the option to work from home. My office manager says that she can work that out for me, but I don't really think so.

With little to no side effects except maybe a little of fatigue and down feeling the second session of the month. But I am so grateful. I three lesions. Not too big but one is pressing on my left arm nerve causing slight weakness. I also have little ones scattered about that they are not concerned about but might as well get rid of them. Their concern is about one lesion that is close to a brain ventricle which carries the central nervous fluid from the brain to the spinal cord. Because of that one is that they want to radiate and then do spinal tap and spine MRIs to make sure fluid is clean. There are pills you can get now too for TNBC brain mets, I'm just not a candidate for it. But God and time will tell. The radiation to the brain will be whole brain. They can't give me chemo pills and the Taxol and Carbo at the same time and since the chemo has also helped with my bone mets, which I think they are planning to give me Xgeva for that as well they rather do the radiation. They are hoping that maybe the brain radiation will put little holes in the barrier of the brain so as to try and get some Taxol and Carbo in there because they feel it will do me good considering my response to it. I just grateful that my oncs are always on point with me. Welcome freedomchild. Despite the fact that it is not the greatest club to be in these group of ladies are very informative and supportive. I too was misdiagnosed and led around by physicians. I was told by many doctors that since the lump in my breast hurt I was fine because pain was good it meant no cancer. I have since learned that cancer is not painless. Believe the best thing for you now is that you know. Learn everything you can from real people that quack jobs on the internet. Speak to your oncologist like she/he is your friend and ask all the questions. Right them down so you don't forget. Once you have the answers and the treatment you will feel more and control and more yourself. Take time to mediate and hurt. Hurting is a healing process. Mothers and wives tend to want to be strong for everyone else. I don't want them to see me like this, I want them to know I can handle this.....I am woman, hear me roar. That attitude almost killed me. I have since learned that my time to pray, mediate, cry, be angry, etc., is important. I have bone mets as well. So far thank God not too much issues with them although sometimes there is ache around my rib cage when I breathe deeply but always speak to your doctor if there is pain or pressure and believe they will come to the rescue. Mary: Hope the chemo gets better. Lord I hate when my weeks get short but you are in my prayers and I know that you'll come out of it. Hugs and kisses all.",
