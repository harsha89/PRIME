I was having crying panic attacks as week 3 accessing port was super painful and was totally bruised afterwards. I was super worried for #4 and tried to explain my issues, requested smaller needle and it was just about painless this week. Slept during day after benedryl, I'm awake this evening, I sometimes take a sleeping pill, but it's rather late now. I'll sleep tomorrow afternoon, I guess. I never look forward to fridays anymore, it's my day 3 which has never been good. Hope Saturday is good, a friends girl is softball tournament, fun to watch 12yr old fast pitch.",

Still have few hairs on top, more on sides and back by neck, could wear baseball cap but got folliculitis this last week, rubs on sores, little red pimple marks on head, Dr prescribed Mupirocin ointment today, should clear it up. Use nothing at home, have a thin tye-dyed beanie that is soft that I use when I go out. For me, first 3 weeks were harder, probably learning how to get along, nap or rest in afternoon and eat blander foods both helped. Now less intense, sure happy about that, more consistent and tolerable side effects...day or 2 of muscle aches, thank God no constipation but have most meals run thru me, less stomach pain since taking Omeprazole, nose runs, usually have 1 day that I am out of it and feels better to rest more. Even though RBC running below normal, energy levels good most days. Last week, I got to switch benedryl infusion to lower dose pill. Doesn't knock me out so much, more enjoyable infusion day. I agree, concentration is more difficult and get little bouts of light headedness or dizzy, but doesn't last long. I think my eyesight is changing but probably just age. I think it's about time for yearly eye check up. Only 5 more weekly Taxol + Herceptin infusions, then DD Herceptin every 3 weeks for 9 months with no pre drugs. It will be 30 minute infusion versus 3.5 to 4.5 hours for blood work, pre drugs, Taxol and Herceptin each week. Crazy what puts a smile on my face. This is infusion day or what I call my steroid night, even my sleeping pill doesn't help me much on this day. I still have lots of energy evening of steroid night and next morning. Hope everyone has a good week.",

Week 7 and 8, SE aches, pains, stomach/gut issues and less energy were a bummer. Usually have a good day or 2 before returning for next infusion, not so much last couple weeks, best is nite of infusion and next morning for me. My WBC have been mostly good except week 2, my RBC counts have been low and moving lower each week for last few weeks, more tired and weak on few days. Have had ugly head sores for last weeks, Dr prescribed ointment, didn't heal but no infection, now trying hydrocortisone, helps itch, no more new ones showing up, still not going away. They are telling me, when Taxol done. 3 more, so close yet seems so far. If I could sleep thru fri thru tues without dealing with SE, i would be so happy. End of Taxol in sight. Herceptin lasts till next May/June, less or little side effects they tell me. I commend you all that had to do AC, I hear it's tough stuff to go thru. Cheers to everyone having a good week",

I had port placed May 22, first week after infusions were tough, very sore throat, now think associated to oxygen given during port placement messed with sinuses and dripping in throat. I use Biotene faithfully now and throat and mouth much better. Usual side effects as others, not much sleep first couple nights, taking naps in afternoons, sleeping more by 3rd day. 3rd day has been my worst so far, achy, flu like, nauseous. Some headaches at night. Today my white and red counts dropped below, still was able to receive.my infusion. I worry about how week 3 will treat me. I get anxious before infusion day.",

I didn't think I would have to go thru chemo, with ER+, PR+, until months later got a HER2+. I had multiple equivocal results for HER2 until one came back positive. I completed my 3rd and 4th is in the morning. Some of my friends and family are very understanding, while some think it should be no problem and why do I say I'm not feeling well or need to sleep during the day, like I'm making it up. We all going thru this totally understand, as we are experiencing it. My 3rd week was real tough, in first couple weeks had days felt almost normal mixed with not so good days. This week, in bed all one day, mixed with marginal days. I am learning as i go to eat right and sleep enough to have more good days",

My 3rd day, I was in bed most of day with stomach pain. When feeling good, I'm making bad food choices and paying for it. I now will be way more careful. I am learning as I go, If i eat bland, I do much bettter. Similar paying attention to how I feel, when tired, sleep or nap, else I get over tired and headaches. I always been carefree, happy and enjoy doing everything. Now it's hard to reign in and slow down, nap and eat small bland bites. As a happy go lucky person, I am shocked finding myself cry at drop of hat. I always been sensitive, cry at those happy romance movies and novels. Now I just seem to come to tears at anything, maybe it's a release for all this. Hoping to feel good next couple days before next infusion. I'm scared about port access this week. They gave me cream which I used for first time last week, that didn't work for whatever they did accessing port. Cheers to start of 4th week",
