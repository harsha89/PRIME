She is on Xanax right now to control the anxiety of waiting nearly 8 weeks since the first bad test result and is sort of out of it.  Are antidepressents a good idea as a substitute?  All ideas are welcome!  Please keep my family in your thoughts... we just cannot believe that this horrible monster has (likely) returned after so long of a time.
