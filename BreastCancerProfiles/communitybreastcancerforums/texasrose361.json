Recently my sister in law did the whole BS drama thing on facebook and in real life and its been an emotional roller coaster. I mean i feel better now, but there are still times when i am all alone and get to thinking.... There are so many survivors with stage 4 that live long and healthy lives, and on the flip side there are many that just didn't get a dx in time. Because i had this lump for over a year before a dr took my concerns serious and then was ultimately DX i think maybe i could be one of those ppl that just didnt catch it in time :( With my follow up scans (to check up on the mets) looming ahead i am back to the thinking about it all the time phase. (sorta like when i was first dx)  I dont know why i have stayed away, maybe me staying away from this board makes me feel like i am not really dealing with cancer. Some one said it best when they said \"Cancer Sucks!\" it truly does and then again it has a plus side- like meeting all these wonderful people on the boards that are so loving and giving that share things that they would have never thought they would in a million years!

Well back story our eldest sister is our half sister, she really resents our childhood and just cant cope- she basically isnt in our lives at all. Lots of bad blood between us.... the 26 year old is a heroine addict, currently she is in jail, she had gotten sober, went through a rehab and was doing amazingly well, she lived with my 28 yr old sister, took care of her kids and all that, she relapsed about a year ago and they (26 and 28) no longer speak. the 28 yr old doesnt want to enable my 26yr old sister so had given her an ultimatum- \"either your friends and drugs, or me and my kids\"- she picked drugs.... Me I am the glue LOL- well my 28 yr old sister said that if the other 2 sisters dont get their lives straightened out that once i die she will not see nor talk to either of them at all..... Her reasons as she puts it are \"i have one sister who want to live a great life, but she was dealt a hand out of her control that is going to take her early from life, whereas the other one chose to kill herself by sticking needles in her arm, while the other one get her life on track enough to keep her children safe. (very long back story which could be made into a book!) We live in totally different states (them being in WA and me in TX) My delima is that i dont know what to say or do... I am not a come cry on my shoulder for comfort type of person LOL i will say suck it up. I am a laugh til it stops hurting kind of person. I will joke or kid about the situation to make ppl forget about the bad stuff...I dont want whatever time i have left with her to be shadowed by grief. Shoot i am living my life to the fullest, but i know she isnt. SHe is totally thinking this might be the last time i see my sister, or last time we do this or that.... Any progression or bad news i feel guilty sharing with her, but aside from my husband is is my best friend. I've written a few goodbye letters to others (mostly my kids and husband and a few special friends) but i cannot being myself to write her anything...... Funny what set off my thinking was i bought this random vase full of jewlery and was going through it- inside was a rubber bracelet that says \"Imagine life without breast cancer\", i have a care package for her and her kids so i thought i'd throw that in there for her...  Any ideas or tips on what i should do?

My right lung showed what appeared to be bronchitis but it didnt respond to antibiotics so my onc ordered a bronchoscopy and biopsy. Besides the fact that the biopsy punctured my lung and i had to be hospitalized for a pnemothorax, it also confirmed breast cancer was in my lung. Dr said it was presenting weird in the fact that is basically is a thin film of breast cancer coating my lung.... Going to start xeloda and tykerb as soon as inssurance approaval comes in. Oh and something else strange he (my onc) said it was no longer er+????? that could explain why i had progression in the first place (they did not biopsy those areas just started on treatment) i just cant wait to be able to breath again! thanks for listening!
