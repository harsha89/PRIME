She had her lumpectomy and SNB about 3 weeks ago and had another surgery last Monday because one of her margins were too close. Now the pathology report is back and it's still saying only 1mm clear margin. Her doctors have told her that she would not need another surgery if her margins were not better and would just recommend to go on and do radiation. I really don't feel comfortable with that. We are in the process of trying to get a second opinion. Has anyone gone on to do radiation without great margins? We haven't spoken with her doctors yet. Rad onc and surgeon are on vacation.",

We are in the process of getting all her sides, films and records sent to The Kirklin Clinic at Birmingham AL. I too thought margins were important with DCIS and reason why we need second opinion. Thanks",
