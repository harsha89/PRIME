To cut a long story short she was diagnosed last week with cancer in her right breast and on her spine . I never went to the appointment with her but am I right in thinking this will be classed as Stage 4 ? . So many emotions running round at the moment , she started on femera yesterday , does anyone else have a similar story ? We know it's going to be a long and tough battle but any advice and stories of hope would be great at this time . Log in to post a reply",
