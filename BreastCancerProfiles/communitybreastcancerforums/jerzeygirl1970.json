I have been having itching under my arms, not my armpit but rather higher and closer to my breast along with itchy breasts particularly around the nipple in my left breast. I did the worst thing depending on how you look at it and googled reasons why. My thoughts were could it be my deodorant even if it wasn't my armpit? So I read possible reasons and one being breast cancer which never occurred to me. It also made me realize I haven't done a self breast exam in a long time. So, I did the self exam and found above my left nipple a flat, kinda square maybe hard area. I'm a B cup so it wasn't hard to feel it. I had a scheduled doctor's appt with my doctor so I asked for a script for a mammogram, not telling him my concerns. I went Monday for the mammogram which they have signs stating they have the 3D mammograms. So I thought that's great, if there's something to be concerned about that should find it. I was told if there's an issue I will get a call and if not I will get a letter in the mail. Today is Thursday and I received a call that the radiologist wants more images on my left breast. The wind just got knocked out of me. I should also mention they have my last mammogram on file 2 years ago to compare it to. When I was told to stop breathing I stopped breathing and froze. Its painful as you are well aware of and I didn't want to have to come back for fuzzy images. I received a call the day before from my gastro doc that I have to come in for the doctor to go over the results of my scope and now this. I'm trying not to feel overwhelmed but it's kinda hard not to. My husband battled cancer 3 times and living with the after affects. I'm not really asking for advice. I'm doing what I know I need to do. I just need to know if anyone else had the itching and mass feeling. When I hear lump I think a circle but that's not what I feel. I don't think dense would be an issue either since my breasts are so small. Could I be misinformed on that? Log in to post a reply",
