We all have our moments that we breakdown and we all have our moments where we feel strength. Some of us take prescriptions to help us through the tough times, some of us don't. It all depends on what YOU feel is right for you which none of us can tell. Personally I take Ativan to slow my mind from the constant anxiety. As far as the car crash my opinion is NOT to rely on the insurance company. I was in a wreck and ended up with a neck fusion and a year later shoulder surgery for pain that wouldn't go away. There are attorneys available who you don't have to pay unless you get a settlement (aside from the fees for filing documents in court) that can help you immensely. I used to work in a law office and not all of these attorneys fall under the slimy descriptions they are given. One of the tough things about our diagnosis is that it takes time to heal from the news. Like anything else i.e., broken heart, loss of a loved one, it does get better over time. It is definitely a roller coaster with the tests, results, and treatments but it is doable. I always remember all the reasons why I want to live and that makes it easier to deal with the rest.  Hoping you feel better soon but until then cry your tears as much as you need to. ",

Had bone scan, more mets so today I started chemo again.  Taxol/Avastin with Aredia.  It was a bizarre day! First I'll back up one day.  I had a PETscan yesterday and didn't get out of there until 3:00.  After not eating all day I thought I would treat myself to a Wendy's hamburger.  I might eat fast food 3 times a year and usually those times are after tests where I can't eat.  Within 15-20 minutes I had the worst diarrhea and vomiting until 2:30 this morning. What a crappy night....literally!! Woke up today and thought I might not have chemo.  I called the on-call doc in the evening when I was supposed to take my Roids.  He said not to take them because I would just throw them up. Ended up having chemo today and actually feel better now than when I went in.  Got my hydration back!  Then about an hour before I was done the strangest thing happened. A woman on Taxol (my chemo) had a SEVERE allergic reaction.  She almost died.  The nurses and onc were doing CPR on her and called 911 to get the medics there to take her to emergency. Scary stuff!  But I'll tell you what those nurses and doc were quick and worked like a well oiled machine.  When it was all over they kept coming over to see if I (and the others around her) was ok and giving hugs.  There were many tears.  They were so caring.  I just got a call from the nurse to see how I am doing now that I'm home.  People who work in oncology are a pretty incredible breed!! It has been a Freaky Friday and now I'm ready to just chill and go to bed early!!  Women are like teabags....the more hot water they get into the stronger they become!

STABLE.  I have met the stable boy for the first time and I'm not turning him loose.  I do have some abandonement issues but I am hoping they will pass. On another note (and I believe I'm not the only one in this scenario) I do have some progression in a new area.  There are some tumors in the nodes around my lungs.  We are keeping an eye on them to make sure they don't get much bigger or we will have to change chemo. It's interesting to have \"diffuse sclerotic metastatic disease throughout the bones\" appear stable. It seems like an oxymoron to me.  I want them just to be gone (as in disappear) and if I am understanding correctly they are still there but have now suddenly stopped growth, even though they are still all over the place.  Am I asking too much??  Looks like I also have a paratracheal node growth. Guess that could be why I have this whisky and cigar voice that causes me to keep telling my onc I could moonlight as a phone sex person.  One of my friends calls me Demi Moore. Dang, if only I looked like her too!! So I guess we take the good with the bad and just hope to buy more time.  Since my tiredness got better I asked for a break from chemo but it is not the right time for that right now since I have progression.  Dang.  Sometimes I just want a month or two off but my bugger is too aggressive whenever I'm breaking.  I just try to hold onto the good part of this and hope the bad follows the same pattern. The fight sometimes gets old when you have nothing but chemo to rely on.  The AI's never worked for me even though I'm estrogen positive.  Have been a fluke my whole life that way.  Been on 7 chemos so far.  Hope Halaven hangs for awhile.  I had a good 6 months on Abraxane before this.  How do our bodies, minds, and spirits keep doing this over and over?  We are some sort of strong women around here!!!  Give yourself a big HOOYA for that! ",

She left instructions on how to log in to this message board and asked me to post that she is an angel now. What I want to say is that she has always been an angel to us.... the most loving, giving person we have known. I was blessed to have her as my sister and best friend for 52 years. Lorelei fought long and hard during her battle with breast cancer. She never gave up, never took off those pink boxing gloves, even during her last weeks. She was an inspiration to so many of us for her courage, strength, and determination. Thank you all for giving her support during her battle. I know you were able to help her in ways that only you understand. It devastated us to watch everything Lorelei has had to endure these past 2 years, but she never gave up hope. She fought her cancer with grace and never lost her sense of humor. I admire my sister more than I can say. We will all miss her and love her forever. Thank you to all her survivor sisters, Lindy",

You are so young and it is so unfair that your life will change at such a young age. None of us know why we have to go through this and I'm sure we all deal with it in our own unique ways. My mom and my sister have had breast cancer. My first diagnosis came at the age of 44, second at 47 and third (Stage 4) at 50.  When I feel my lowest I try and spend time with people who bring me happiness like my sister or my niece and her family. I have friends I go to lunch with or meet for a movie. Recently I have been having more pain than usual so I have to do things that don't involve being very active. Even a visit and a cup of tea is sometimes helpful. I think it is hard to deal with such a sudden life change. Believe it or not as time passes it gets a little easier to accept. I didn't believe that when somebody here mentioned that to me but it is true. If you search through some of this discussion board here you will see many women have survived for many years with cancer in their bones. Your hope may come and go but hold onto it.

So every time I think I don't want chemo as I'm driving to chemo I come up with all the reasons of why I want to be alive.  Since chemo is the only thing that works for me for getting rid of the cancer that is my solution to my problem.  It is not fair, it is not fun and it is not what I dreamt my life would be but it is what it is.  I have absolutely no control of the situation except to say yes to treatment or no.  Since I want to keep on living I say yes.  But I can say no whenever I want and I know it. Maybe not a very good way of handling this fate but it works for me right now.  I always live in the right now and not the yesterdays or tomorrows.  I'm a realist to the core.  It took me some time to get to this point (I was diagnosed Stage IV Nov 09) and it works to more good days than bad ones.  I try and do something fun every day and whenever I feel really bummed I think so what would I be doing differently if I knew I was dying tonight?  Just some thoughts and things that work for me.  I wish the best for you!!  When I'm doing my Friday chemo I'll be thinking of my new GA friend doing her Friday chemo too. ",

Our plans so far are a carriage ride through the park, see The Jersey Boys, catch a taping of The View on Thursday, take a tour bus through the town and stop wherever we want and have dinner out every night.  It is definitely an expensive trip but isn't that what accelerated benefits are for? A bit of enjoyment while it is available!! Got a great short wig to wear that is actually comfortable (Raquel Welch) and people in chemo thought it was real last week when I wore it for the \"wig test\".  The trips I have been taking keep me going.  As long as I keep planning fun stuff I have something to look forward to no matter how crappy I feel.  I figure whatever gets me through this is alright!  Women are like teabags....the more hot water they get into the stronger they become!

None of them worked for me.  I took tamoxifan for a year and a half (after my first diagnosis of Stage 1) and the others for a few months. It was a hard pill to swallow only being able to have chemo but I figured the alternative was worse.  So far for chemo I have tried Taxol/Avastin, Taxotere/Cytoxan and will begin Gemzar tomorrow.  I have only had one bone marrow.  I asked about having another but there really isn't a point in putting myself through that pain since my tumor marker is up (547), my blood counts screwy, and scan showing progression my little chemo break is over.  I initially lost 20 pounds and my appetite is low but I MAKE myself eat. I figure it helps keep my body in fight mode.  I have some sort of thickness in my colon too and do feel nauseous and like I could vomit so the onc thinks there is some progression there (taking Immodium AD regularly is another clue).  I do still have an arsenal of chemos to try since I can't do hormonal therapy. I hope your liver is ok too!!!  It all just sucks but if I keep my mind planning trips and fun things to do while I am still able to it keeps me going.  I have lots of good friends who come to visit from out of town and lots of local family members so I am very lucky.  Do you have good support around you?  I'm happy to answer anything you ask and feel a kinship with you.  I haven't found anybody else with bone marrow mets.  My onc says it is VERY unusual.  Oh boy, lucky us.  Lets keep in touch!  I'll be thinking of you, sending positive vibes and hoping the best for you!!!!!

I have a lot of family support and many friends that love me but I have to communicate to them what I need because they are thinking I am feeling sick and should just leave me alone.  Although I don't like to ask for things, I am learning that it isn't so bad and the time spent with the people I chose to be around has been a positive, sometimes uplifting experience. If you don't have a lot of support of family and friends there is always the, \"Treat Yourself LIke a Queen\" quote my sister gave me when this all started.  I have passed that quote onto many fighting cancer.  It just means do something nice for yourself when you are feeling down.  Something you wouldn't normall treat yourself to like a foot massage, facial, lunch somewhere delicious....whatever you like to do.  I've been doing the Queen thing for about a year and a half now and it helps whenever I feel really down.  I just say, \"That's it, I'm a Queen today.\" And then I spoil myself somehow. Hope you are feeling better about all of this soon.  We are always here for rants or assistance. You can always take a little of this and leave a little of that of our words of advice and do whatever helps you out and with luck the funk won't last long.",

Skigirl: yes I found the lump myself. I got a massage and the masseuse asked me if I was having bad headaches while she was rubbing the top of my head. Later that night I started feeling my head to see how she would know that I've been having headaches and found the lump much lower between the top of my right ear and neck. My doc knew by feeling it, my tumor marker rising, and symptoms I guess. I am glad I pointed it out to him! My first thought was that it was nothing.

I was meeting an old flame I hadn't seen in many, many years.  We were engaged once 30 years ago.  My sister, her husband and I went to dinner with him our first night in town.  I hooked up with him the next day and did the tourist thing.  Then we went to dinner with my sister and her husband and off to see the play Wicked. He got us tickets in the 3rd row center stage.  It was awesome and the highlight of the trip. The next day he and I had breakfast then we all went to a Giants game.  That evening he had to pack for a trip and I met up with an old girlfriend I hadn't seen in over 10 years.  I had so much fun on this trip and forgot about cancer for 3 days.  It was nice to reconnect with some old friends and feel so comfortable with both of them after all of these years. Now that I'm home everyone wants to know if there was a romance.  There was much fun, laughs, good conversation but he did seem a little shocked about my diagnosis.  He hadn't understood what it entailed until we talked about it on this trip.  He thought I would have chemo and be done with this cancer like his dad had been with his cancer. It is a little depressing because before the trip his emails were kind of spiced with hints of romance.  I'm not sure anyone will ever be able to accept this horrible disease and want to be in a relationship too.  Kinda sad about that but I have such a great life I'm not going to complain.  It is just not always easy to be single, deal with losing your hair over and over, and not have someone to just hold you once in awhile when you feel down and make you feel better about yourself. Anyone else go through this?? Women are like teabags....the more hot water they get into the stronger they become!

Last weekend my nieces and nephews were all in town and I took them out to dinner, threw on a long wig, got dressed up and after dinner we went to a karaoke bar.  We laughed and stayed out till midnight.  ALL of us had a grand time.  It was on my bucket list to just hang out with all of them since we had not done that before.  Since I don't have kids of my own they have always felt like they were my kids.  What a tremendous memory I have of that evening. In April 13 of us are heading for Maui for 10 days.  It will be another grand time.  In May my sister, her husband, my mom and I will be in New York for 4 days.  In June my nephew is getting married in California and in October another nephew is getting married in Portland.  I am planning to be at ALL of these events with bells on.  Nothing is stopping me from planning and attending.  Even when I feel like crap I talk to my onc about these trips and he says he doesn't highly recommenso much travelling but will have me feeling better when the time comes that I need to go.  He gets it.  . If I don't have something to look forward to I'm in a rut feeling like I'm just hanging out waiting to die.  If I make plans I feel more like I'm spending every day living, not dying.  So off I go.  If I get tired I'll rest.  If I\"m in pain I have a pill.  If there is an emergency there are hospitals everywhere.  I'm spending my last year or two having fun!!!  Sometimes I wish I had some matie to spend the fun with but don't think there is any time for that right now. Just working through the bucket list thanks to cashing out my life insurance policy.  I'm not married and my family members do not want me to leave them anything, they just want me to have fun so I am!!  Even when I feel my worst I know I have a plan out there awaiting me to get better.  I'm bound and determined to make all these trips. I had one more planned that didn't quite work out.  My birthday is in March and I wanted to take my sister to see Ellen.  It was IMPOSSIBLE to get tickets (even though they are free).  I tried everything I knew...writing...calling....emailing.  Guess some things are just out of reach.  Maybe we can go another time. Go out and do something fun today!!!  Something that will make you laugh or feel like a kid again. :)   Lorelei  Women are like teabags....the more hot water they get into the stronger they become!

I'm sorry for your diagnosis but know there is hope for years of life. Not too encouraging when you have kids. Too many things not to be missed. This crappy disease will have you up, down and sideways with all the emotions you will go through. Come to the boards and share if it helps. We will cry with you, hold your hand and totally get how you feel. You are welcome here but we wish you didn't have to be here!",
