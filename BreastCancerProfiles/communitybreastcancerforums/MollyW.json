I had to take a leave of absence from work during chemo (AC followed by Taxol has done a number on me). I had hoped to be able to return to work during radiation, but after reading some of these posts, I am beginning to wonder. I must wear business attire so a bra and nice clothes is a must. I also have very fair and sensitive skin. Any advice? Is this doable? I also noticed people discussing fatigue. How does this compare to chemo fatigue? I may qualify for a clinical trial of stereotacticablative radiation for the one met in the lumbar portion of my spine (radiation to my breast would still be traditional radiation). Anyone have experience with this type of radiation? From everything I have read online it seems like something worth considering. I have a follow up appointment with the RO to discuss further, but it sure would be nice to have feedback from people with firsthand experience.",
