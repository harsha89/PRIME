The tech told me she didn't see any lump on the mammogram and the sonogram was negative too, so I guess all is good. I am still having pain in the nipple, and I figure that is from Estradiol. My intention is still there, but I guess its ok.",

Did you indentation look like it was changing colors. The middle of my indentation looks like skin and the aerola has been erased. It almost looks like someone did surgery on my breast. Thanks for answering my question and hopefully I will find out something soon. I am sure my doctors will just tell me no worries. This poor breast is just my demon child and it has a couple non-cancerous lumps and microcalifications. Thanks again!",
