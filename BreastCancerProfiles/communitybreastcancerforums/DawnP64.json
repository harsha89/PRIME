From others I've heard from, I thought this was standard practice. It would seem like they would need to have your markings in place for the whole treatment time, so I wonder why they're not concerned that the lotions would remove them after 2 weeks. I hope you get clearer instructions, we don't need conflicting information on top of everything else.",

My eye doctor prescribed it because there are glands along the inner eye lid & mine were clogged (assumed from the taxotere).

I got pretty frustrated this week when my RO told me that the 25-28 treatments that I was scheduled for did not include the additional 5 days of boost. We started out planning for 4 weeks, then 5-5.5 weeks, now it's 6.5 weeks. As frustrating as that is, I have to tell myself those additional treatments might be the ones that end up saving my life. I'm 5 weeks post-chemo & have been feeling pretty good. I've been tired this week, but during chemo I reduced my work schedule to 6 hours/day & have gone back to about 9 hours/day, so it may be more related to that than the radiation. I'm using both Aquafor and Remedy skin repairing cream. I've noticed itchiness during the day, but it resolves itself by the following morning. Dawn  ",

They offered a port, but said they don't usually do ports for just 4 treatments. My veins are small and not that easy to find. The hospital that I treat at has a vein finder. It's like a flashlight that when they shine it on your arm, they can see your veins. I've had to request that they use it each time. It's apparently a very expensive piece of equipment and it sounds like they only have one for the whole infusion unit. I treat at University of Colorado Hospital and they're pretty progressive. It's worth asking if your hospital has the same. I've found that I bruise a little more at the site after each infusion, but I think that's just my changing blood levels causing that. I did my second infusion on the underside of my arm & didn't really like that, mostly because it was uncomfortable turning my arm up during the infusion. Those bruises also longer to disappear.

Is anyone else experiencing this and have you found any effective remedies? Thanks, Dawn",

I'm doing the DigniCap with my treatment & have kept most of my hair so far, but I have a growing triangular bald spot at the top of my head. I've bought a variety of scarves/do rags and may be starting to use those soon. The wig that I have has so much hair it feels strange. The woman who gave it to me told me they are made with extra hair and I could take it to my hairdresser to have it trimmed up. I hope to get it trimmed up this week.",

I think the main thing is that in Round 1 I only took the Claritin on the day of the Neulasta shot. This time I continued it for 4 days after. I had a lot of pain in the first round and virtually none in the 2nd. I also had vision issues (mostly sensitivity to fluorescent light) in Round 1 and my eye doctor prescribed eye drops and an eye mask & I haven't had any problems this time. In round 1 I woke up sick to my stomach most every day for the first 10 days, this time only 3. I'm also taking L-Glutamine (approved by my oncologist) to prevent neuropathy. I didn't find out about this until after Round 1. I was able to get on the treadmill (just walking) most days last week and that didn't happen at all after my first treatment. I did not have mouth sores with the first treatment & hope to avoid them this time as well. So far, so good. Hoping rounds 3 & 4 will be like this one.",
