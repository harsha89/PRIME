She insisted on taxotere so I am trying to be resigned to maybe permanent hair loss. Last week I was horrified by the thought but now I just want to get it over with. They also don't want me to use cold caps or ice my hands or feet because they think it defeats the purpose so I will probably be losing fingernails and toenails. Cancer is not a battle it's an endurance marathon. Three months and this will be over.",

Nausea and vomiting all night and thru this morning. If you did well with the anesthesia the first time ask if you can have the same stuff again. Really hard to throw up when you've just had a chunk of your boob cut out! They said I didn't need to be as deep this time because I wasn't having lymph nodes taken out.",
