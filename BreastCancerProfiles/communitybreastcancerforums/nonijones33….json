I'm sure the doctor felt that the results of the MRI were enough, however you need to call her again so you can end this once and for all otherwise it's going to drive you crazy.",

I also had it many years ago as a young girl. I woke up one morning with blood all over my night gown. I thought I was a goner. My best friend worked for a surgeon and I was able to go in that afternoon. Well that had to be 30 years ago. He pressed and pushed and said he feels nothing and to just go home, well I did, back then it was so different no further testing, just don't worry and i didn't and I was just fine. I think you will be too, sounds like a little infection of some kind. Unfortuneately you will have to have it checked out BUT, you have alot going for you because they are on top of it and many women have breast issues sometime in their life which 80% are BENIGN.",
