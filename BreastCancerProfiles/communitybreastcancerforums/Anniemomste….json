All ovarian cysts worked out and gone. I apparently am very prone to cysts.  Since that appt though, since I have a history of lumps I want to a breast specialist for a 2nd opinion and she thought it looked like I should biopsie it right away. Now it's going away since starting amoxicillin last week. All I'd like to know is if was possibly antibiotics? Does anyone know of this is possible  If anyone has some input, it's very appreciated.",

I CAN still feel it but it's not as firm as it was and smaller. Anyway, so much so that they couldn't find it in the I/s. After I felt around hinking... but?? You can still feel it. So I found the lump way further down then O remembred and it freaked me out... Seemed BIGGER! So, I waited to see he Dr and showed her.  Thought it could be a soft lymph node.. couldn't find the original lump and said this one is different. A new lumpðŸ˜–ðŸ˜© We are watching it and the big kicker is I found he other lump when I got home.... so now I have 2! Can't sleep over it... the 2nd is slippery and round, moves ALOT! Smooth borders... but I can't help but think it's seeding (read that term).  Please help put my mind at ease!!  ",
