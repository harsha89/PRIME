I welcome encouragement.",

I do have worries (although I'm trying not to go there) if you can indulge me a little \"whine\".  Can't seem to muster enough faith to put them aside.  I'm 18 days out from my first surgery (lumpectomy and 3 sentinel nodes) 4 days out from my second surgery to increase margin and have worrisome symptoms in my affected right arm.   To give you a little background, I have been a practitioner of Tai Chi for a number of years and after a five year break (due to a move), have gotten back into it.  This is a passion for me,Tai Chi is meditation, exercise and energy medicine.  It's especially important because of a long difficult transition from ending career as a nurse practitioner and moving from a beloved home and community in Fairbanks AK.  I've struggled with finding my way this past five years reading the likes of Elizabeth Lesser's \"Broken Open\", \"Eat, Pray, Love\", and any number of \"finding yourself\" books.  Long story short, some kind of vessel (blood?lymph?) was shortened due to surgery, which is palpable from my armpit to my wrist and this makes reaching or stretching difficult and painful.  Anyone have something similar?  I'm wondering if it will stretch out or will I have to live with it.  My surgeon is a sweetheart (there's an oxymoron) but he hasn't given me a straight answer. At the risk of alienation, I have one more worry to put on the table.  I was diagnosed with osteoporosis a few years back and went on attack with everything I could; bioidentical HRT, nutrition, consistent exercise and Forteo injections.  I reversed the condition to normal range and now I'm facing anti-estrogen drugs. (insert big wailing cry) Several posts ask about Oncotype and I don't know.  I've yet to meet with an oncologist. Thank you for your indulgence.  All hugs received and sent back.  ",
