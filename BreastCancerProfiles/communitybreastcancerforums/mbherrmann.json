I take the neupogen 2 or 3 times a week - just depending on my labs.  I will just take it everyday. I went to my PCP today and got a inj. of toredol and it has helped some today.  Going tomorrow to oncologists PA in the morning. Sometimes I feel like they don't tell me things I need to know about side effects.",
