My youngest child, my daughter is really struggling. She is very bright, very grounded, a very responsible kid. She has always done everything I've asked of her and she lives her life filled with love and helping others. She loves so deeply and is very sensitive. I feel like my diagnosis is destroying her. My husband and my other children (2 boys) are doing as well as can be and are coping like me. We are trying to keep life normal but I am very worried about my daughter. She does extremely well academically, is an athlete and has many friends, activities, volunteering, music, basically everything under the sun. She has always been very happy but she has had trouble with stress and anxiety throughout her life.  In the past she has suffered from anorexia and bulimia that almost could have taken her life. Being in control is a big part of that disease and I know that at the moment she is feeling completely out of control. We are very close as she is my only daughter and we have been trying to talk through my diagnosis but nothing i am saying seems to be helping. i can just tell she thinks i am going to die. i sure hope she is wrong but i don't know what i can say or do to try to make this fear go away. She keeps telling me she is trying to be strong but that she doesn't know how to live her life thinking that I could die any day (her words). She feels like mine is a disease which we can never forget or be free of. It can come back at any day of any year. I have fears about this too but i do have a belief that things will turn out okay. My ODX came back at 15 so I have been trying to assure her that we will be okay, but she is so scared and i don't know how to help her. I feel like my family has been through so much and that the diagnosis has taken over their lives and bodies as well. My daughter is at an age where life is particularly difficult because there are so many changes and decisions to be made about the future. She is very stuck at the moment because she does not know how to move on with her own life with this diagnosis. I can tell she is spending all of her time worrying about me and it is affecting her studies, she is isolating herself from her friends, crying all the time and really having such a hard time coping. I am just wondering your thoughts on how our families can cope with such an awful illness that can return 1 year from now or 20 years from now or 30 years from now. It is one thing for the patient. We have our own fears, it is our own body, but i have to think it is equally or even more horrible on loved ones. I have joined a support group and our family has been seeing a support specialist, but there is less support for young people with parents that have cancer.  I can tell my daughter is carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders at the moment. I want her to be a normal, happy 19 year old and not a 60 year old. I don't want her to miss out on her life and the joys of youth. I don't want her to relapse into her eating disorder or hurt herself in anyway. She has seen someone for her eating disorder, but really none of that can prevent all the pressures of stress from causing a relapse. I have been trying to help in every way i can and keep things positive but the disease is what it is and there is all this information on the internet for kids to find and get scared by. i guess i am just at a loss at what to do. I just wish i had a crystal ball to give my daughter to show her things will be okay and for myself. it is awful women can recur 10 years, 20 years and more later. it is just so unfair. i guess it is just learning to live with fear but i feel this is something a young person should never have to experience.
