Frozen showed no cancer in nodes, path showed cancer cluster in 1st node-but no micro invasion found in breast tissue path. Onc is sending me to Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY. She said \"we have never seen this before.\"  So, long story short-she ordered tests. Today I had CT of chest, abdomen & pelvis & a bone scan. I know the scan showed something because the tech took additional shots of L2-L5. I turned to look at the screen and could see my lower spine all lit up. I am so nervous and of course, tomorrow is Friday, so I will have to wait all weekend and then some for results...I guess I am just looking for encouragement from my sistas.

My next treatment in July 6th. I am on day 11 and have yet to lose any hair. I am feeling really really really good. I had neulasta shot on the day after my chemo. Day one-I certainly felt weird after...and tired, but the actual treatment isn't hard-so try not to be nervous. Day 2 & 3, I was tired, still worked a few hours, but was overwhelmed with all the drugs I had to take for nausea, steroids, etc-but didn't ever feel \"bad\" those 2 days. Days 4, 5 & 6, bone pain was pretty harsh...I took the claritin & aleve only on the actual day of my neulasta-I will take the next 2 days this next time- I learned that my pain could not be controlled by tylenol or the tylenol w/codeine I was prescribed-so I broke down & took an aleve Sat 3am-it worked to relieve my pain. Since then, I have been like the energizer bunny-no nausea meds, only the cipro from day 5-14 because I work with a lot of kids. I was warned not to overdo the aleve due to stomach problems & blood thinning-oh, I did have BAD heartburn days 2 & 3, relieved with Maalox. sorry to butt in on your thread-I just hope I have helped a little as I am still new here too and still have tons of questions myself. I also hope I continue to feel this good and you all feel as great as I do.",
