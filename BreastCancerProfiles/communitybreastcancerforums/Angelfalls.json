My advice is to keep breathing and putting one foot in front of the other while you wait to find out more; the time spent waiting for test results and a treatment plan is probably the most difficult and most people start to feel better, or at least less anxious, once their treatment gets underway. As the previous posters have said, keep on using this site to get the information and support you need. Stay away from Google, which will just send you spinning in the direction of out-of-date stats and scary stories with no basis in reality. If you have any question, don't be embarrassed to ask it here - we've all been where you are now and know how overwhelming it can be, not just because of the diagnosis, but also because of the whole new language that will come with the treatment options. And while it's perfectly normal to want to try and protect your loved ones, try and put yourself first at this time and make sure your family are supporting you. Take care and good luck with your next appointment.",

For me, my current status would be Confidence: 50%; Hope: 95%. Although my confidence level varies wildly, depending on whether or not my treatment is working at the time: If you'd asked me 18 months ago, when I'd been NED for 4 years after a regional recurrence / mets to my sternum and internal mammary nodes, my confidence would have been right up there, too. But if you'd asked me 2 months ago, when I found out that Xeloda hadn't worked for me at all, my confidence took a real hit. But cancer has taken enough from me (breast, hair, ovaries, chance to have kids,...), so I'm not going to let it take my hope, too. I hope my tx will get me back to NED. I hope I'll have a \"normal\" life span, even if I die of BC at 80 (only another 40 years to go!!!). I hope my parents don't have to bury their only child. I hope my husband doesn't lose his 2nd wife to cancer (his 1st died of cervical cancer in her 30s). I hope my step-daughter doesn't have to walk that path again... And the advances we see give reason for hope all the time: When I was first diagnosed, Herceptin was just being trialled and look at the huge difference that has made to so many. The announcement only yesterday of the identification of 10 BC sub-types will mean we may all be able to access targeted drugs in the future, effectively giving us a cure for each type. What do stats mean, anyway? The odds were against me getting BC, but I got it. The odds were against it coming back, but it came back. The odds were against it spreading further, but it spread. The odds are against me dying from anything other than BC, so why the h*ll wouldn't I?!! Sorry for the long post, but I just had to share. My final hope is that our teams can just keep us all going for long enough to benefit from the advances that are surely coming. Take care, Angelfalls xx",

She and her mum lived on the other side of the world, so we didn't see her often and contact was mainly limited to phone calls, letters and cards. My husband was thankfully able to be there for his daughter when his ex passed, which was a real relief for everyone. She has a huge extended family and was staying with one of her mum's cousins and his large family who offered to give her a home so that she could stay in a familiar environment, with friends and family and stay at the same school, etc. But that little 12 year old chose to cross the Atlantic and come to a country where we speak a different language and where she only knew her dad and me. That was 11 years ago now and she has turned into a young woman her mum would be very proud of. Although the situation is not at all the same, the point I'm trying to make is that kids are far more resilient than we think. They also may feel the pull of family ties over the familiar, so if the very worst happens and you and your husband are gone, they may feel that living with your sister keeps that family connection to you, regardless of having to move to Scotland. I hope it never comes to this and that your children will be grown before they lose you both. I also hope you can come to an \"in case\" arrangement you're all happy with.",

Make sure the medical team know exactly what problems the rads are causing, so that they can help treat the symptoms. Perhaps more importantly, the rads got me to NED and I stayed there for nearly 5 years. I hope that your mother and Obaney will get great results, too.",

I was diagnosed with mets to the sternum nearly 7 years ago. It wasn't biopsied because of the risky position. I was treated with rads and an oopherectomy (my primary was ER+), before switching from Tamoxifen to Arimidex (an AI). This got me to NED quickly and kept me there for nearly 5 years, during which time I had very few SEs and carried on with my life as normal. Over the last 2 years, I've had further progression, but mostly within the chest area, and have tried a couple of chemos. I am now taking Aromasin with Afinitor. If you only have a single met in the sternum, you may be a candidate for a partial sternectomy, where they remove and replace the affected section of bone. Just another treatment option for you to be aware of. Good luck and keep us posted.",

This would mean you were in menopause anyway, even if it was only a temporary measure, and would also mean you could use an AI. Maybe this will be an option for you once the chemo has worked its magic. I'm also doing chemo now, since Tamoxifen and then Arimidex stopped working. Good luck with the chemo. xx",
