I used to wear it just below my shoulders and when I began chemo I cut it to chin length. After the 2nd tx of Taxotere and Cytoxan I noticed a bit of thinning so I cut it to my ears. Then it really began falling out by the handfuls in the shower and I realized it was time to shave it unless I wanted to walk around looking like I had a 'hair stole' around my shoulders all the time. I also could not take the AC because of high blood pressure and the risk of damaging my heart--my family has a long history of heart problems. So...my hair--or stubbies--seem to be thickening up and I just had my 5th tx yesterday. One more on Feb. 9th and we'll see what happens. Baby steps were a very good way for me to deal, and I hope they work for you, too.",

Well, my hair is very, very thick, and even after a daily shower and shedding handfuls of hair, I was still getting covered with hair on a daily basis.

I really appreciate it as I am NOT comfortable with my looks at all right now!! 3teacher: I'm certain that there are a few shades of blonde in Clairol's root touch-up line. I chose that because there's so little hair to work with. I figured if I made a mistake it wouldn't make too much difference with that stuff. Good luck to you if you try it. ;-)",

He said that they don't know enough about how plant estrogen effects the body and if he had breast cancer, he just wouldn't risk it. So I'm with him. I don't risk it. Of course, I still got BC anyway...",

I can see me struggling to make my hair a perfect 'mess'. lol saralmom, your hair looks great! Right now my hair is poker straight but maybe it will start to curl when it gets a bit longer. When you put the wax on to texture it, do you smear it all over your head like you would with mousse? Or do you just sort of pull at different sections with it. (I told you I'm really not good at this. I've always had long hair that did pretty much what it wanted.)",

Here I am at 14 weeks: And about 17 weeks:  And about 20 weeks:  And this week at 22 weeks:   My hair was always straight, but now it's wavy on the sides, curls under in front and is straight in the back. Very strange, but I'm not complaining. It's hair! Oh, and I've colored it about 4 times so far. I've discovered L'Oreal Healthy Look temporary color and it works pretty darned good. Nothing else lasted very long.",
