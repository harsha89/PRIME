      "Content": "Oct 28, 2009 05:52PM - edited Oct 28, 2009 05:59PM by Suzanne3131 Today was 8/35 and then an appt with my onc.  I told him I was feeling run down, and that I thought it seemed kind of early for that.  He said that it is common....but then he said that the most common reason for tiredness is dehydration!  He said that we need even more water than usual because, not only do the rads dry our cells like crazy, but also because our bodies are dealing with so many more dead cells than is normal (or natural, for that matter) and we need lots of water to help flush that waste so it doesn't build up and make our organs work too hard.  That makes a lot of sense!  So every time I hear myself thinking I feel run down, I am going to chug another 8 oz! Also interesting is the whole thyroid thing.  For a few days, I have been noticing a subtle sensation in the area of my adam's apple (where the thyroid gland lives)...it's kind of like I have a bit of a lump in my throat.  I was thinking of mentioning it to my onc, but I figured it was probably just an emotional response to the craziness that has become my life!  Now I think maybe I just need a supplement to support my thyroid.  I can't wait to try it out!  I have always had incredibly low BP ~ I have had nurses say to me \"Geez, I'm surprised you can stand up!\".  I never knew my thyroid may have been suffering! Thanks for all of the brilliant information!  Blessings to all. Liz ~ I am sorry that you had an animal run out in front of your car.  That has happened to me, too, and it is the worst feeling.  I'm sorry...that is mental anguish you didn't need today.  Try to keep breathing and try to keep some perspective.",

I have missed seeing you all here, and I, too, hope that you all will keep checking in from time to time.  We have been through an awful lot together.   Wishing you all great joy and great health in the new year!  I, for one,  am kind of happy to be bidding '09 goodbye!  :-)  ",
