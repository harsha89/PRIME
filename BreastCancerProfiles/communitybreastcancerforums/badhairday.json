My husband filed for divorce 4 days after my bilateral mastectomy. I have had many moments where I didn't think I would be able to do this, especially as a single mom. I would ask friends for help, my bc support group is an amazing source of strength, as are the friends you have here. Some days, all that kept me going was my son. I would look at him, and even if I didn't know how I was going to do it, I knew I had to, for him. I dug deep, and found strength I didn't know I had. And some days I lived life 10 minutes at a time. I can't offer you sage advice about your specific chemo but I understand how you feel, and I will pray for you.Â ",
