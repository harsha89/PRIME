I worry about relapse especially given that i am under 40, grade 3, multifocal, LVI and high oncotype score. Has anyone requested more chemo? Is there any point? I am wonder if a couple more rounds of a different protocol would help. My oncologist laughed when I asked and said she wouldnt discuss this until the end. Maybe my last few rounds will be more difficult? I just want to feel I did everything possible to prevent spread. My tumors grew so quickly, so I never had to be told it was aggressive. I knew. I just wonder if the existing length of protocols take into account people like me.

I was convinced I had some super aggressive, chemo resistant cancer growing. Thats good the radiologist says cancer the lump does not look like cancer. I hope it shrinks on its own so you can avoid biopsy. Please update once you know. I will keep my fingers crossed for you.",
