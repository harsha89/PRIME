The hair itself actually did hurt when I would touch it, having a ponytail in too long describes it best. So when I shaved it, I felt so much better!

It's coming back. As for what to use on your bald head when cleaning, I wash my face with Dove and then just keeping rubbing all of head! No shampoo. Same with my facial moisturizer, I do all of my head. Good luck! But remember whatever you decide to do, it's ok.

I have stubble. Not enough to go without a hat yet but I see it. Looks all gray to me. It's very fine kinda like a feather. I read a few times on earlier post in this forum that some ladies shaved off their hair when it became about an inch long. From what I think remember they did that because they said the regrowth comes in very coarse, looks dry and unhealthy. After shaving it comes back better and healthier. Did any of you shave it off when it started coming back? Not sure if this even makes sense to me. Please advise.",

I'm surprised you are done and just getting to this point. I'm sure you are eagerly waiting for it to come back as am I. It will return! I hope it comes back the color you want. Mine was dark brown but I'm seeing more gray in the regrowth. Good thing that is in style these days! You and I have been on this journey together, almost same diagnosis dates and chemo dates, now we will be recovering together!

That test came back positive for invasive ductal carcinoma. The nurse said I was ER+, PR+ and Her2-. Therefore my tumor was sent out for Oncotyping. Here's where it gets tricky. My BS says she considers me triple negative because they were both \"weak positives\". The Oncotyping score actually confirmed her diagnosis labeling my specimen a triple negative with a score of 44. When I asked how they got a positive in the first place she said the biopsies are dropped in a blue dye and it's read by a human. There is room for error. She said I'm a triple negative and that's what I should go by.",

So this Friday i will have my 2nd treatment. I know it's easier on my body this way but I want it over quicker! Lost a lot of hair today and can definitely see the difference. After showering it looked like a kitten was trapped in the drain! I didn't cry as much as yesterday. Instead I looked at it and said goodbye cancer! Question: since I get my chemo on Friday they have me coming back on Mondays for the neulasta. They said it has to be administered 24 to 72 hours after chemo. I asked the nurse about the auto injected one but she said I couldn't have it because my right arm had lymph nodes removed and my left arm has port. I'm going to ask again if it can be applied to my stomach. I thought I saw somewhere that someone had done that. I hate the thought of going back on monday. Last time what Should of taken a few minutes took over an hour waiting my turn. 2nd question: as all of you probably have experienced, once someone finds out you have cancer they tell you all their horror stories they know. Just like when you're pregnant everyone shares their stories whether you care or not. Well here's my point a older gentleman said he was told while on chemo he was not to eat at buffets or salad bars. I guess it kind of makes sense but i wasnt told this and guess what...yep I already ate from a salad bar. Any of you know about this? There really should be a standard of care book when you start chemo. Everyone needs the same information instead of learning things the hard way. Last thing, I find myself be coming a germ freak. I even took my Purell antibacterial hand wash to church today. I thought it would be rude not to greet others but at the same time what a way to spread germs! Husband started calling me Howie Mandel!

Therefore i started drinking coffee to keep me awake. The only thing I can think of is she doesn't want me to get dehydrated. Do Any of you drink on occasion?

I went out and bought the Nail Envy nail strengthener($19.99) and noticed it had wheat in the ingredients. I have celiac disease. Im not one to go overboard about gluten but I am on a gluten free diet. I guess since Im not going to be eating this it should not be a problem. But curious if it will help or hurt to use. Im not going to ask my doctor because he told me at my last visit that some celiac patients can eat gluten while on chemo and not get sick. Well I'm not worried about getting sick I'm worried about my increased chance of lymphoma by eating gluten, something you won't see within hours of digesting gluten. My 3rd AC was a rough one. I missed 2 days of work after it. I just can't seem to drink enough. I love Coke/Pepsi and now it tastes like motor oil. Same with sweet tea, just can't do it. I finally found crystal light seems to make water go down more smoothly. Yesterday I managed to get a 2 mile walk in after work, feeling good too. I've gained 8 pounds since chemo began. I can't say it's all chemo's fault because I haven't been to the gym since I started. And I'm eating anything and everything! I find myself in the kitchen at 2a.m eating Lucky Charms, I have never ate in the middle of the night before! My husband said he's trying to sleep while his wife is up and down going to the bathroom or chasing a leprechaun around the kitchen! Smells! Smells! Smells! Is it just me or can you smell everything! I hate the smells of cleaning chemicals! I just gag when I smell rubbing alcohol. A musty basement is my enemy. Hoping this fades away! I still have my eyebrows and eyelashes but have noticed some thinning. Mostly loose lashes on my cheeks when I wake up. My biggest fear when all this began was losing my hair, and now I walk around bald without even remembering to put on a hat. Even in public! Yea people will look but honestly no one will ever say anything unless it's to give their support and prayers! Why hide it? I have cancer and I don't want cancer to have me! (I read this daily, may not post, but you are all in my prayers! Hoping all of you are enjoying the day! I'm off to clean my house and car!)",

I finished at 3p.m. The doctor was running behind on his schedule, then My port was acting up and not getting a blood return. I was nauseous and started vomiting. I'm not sure if it was the saline push that i could taste or the hashbrown. Im pretty sure they are gluten free but i could be wrong. I got the premed steroid and benadryl but felt no different. Taxol went in fine as well. I would have to say it was easy but very time consuming. Afterwards we went out to eat and that stayed down, no vomiting. Then off to ikea for some shopping. I got home around 7pm. Went to bed at 10 and up at 5. I feel fine so far. Oh i hope it stays this way! I see some of you are posting about joint pain and take Aleve. Does the claritin help with that? I took that when I got the neulasta shot and never had pain. What vitamins are you taking? My doctor says I can take whatever I want but I have no idea what helps with our side effects. I'm guessing I should take b12 and biotin. What do you take? Glad to see we are all pushing on and getting closer to the end. Stay strong ladies!!",

I finished rads on February 1. Skin is intact and wasn't that bad. My body now feels very stiff in the morning, hands swell during the night, every bone in my feet hurt as I walk to shower in the morning. But once I get moving it all goes away. Im still working daily, but once I get in my car after being on My feet for 8-9 hours my body stiffens up again. I feel like a 90 year old lady who can't climb steps and waddles when I walk! I started tamoxifen today. And I see surgeon next Monday to set my hysterectomy date. At first my MO wanted to just take out the ovaries but he said a side effect of Tamoxifen is uterine cancer. So he wants it all removed. Oh what joy! On a positive note my hair is coming back. It was gray but I couldn't take it anymore so I dyed it! It's a little over an inch all over. And very thick! I was diagnosed on March 24 of last year. It's been a long year but the light at the end of the tunnel is finally here with the treatments. Now I just wonder how long before these side effects go away! Take care ladies!! Thinking of all of you often!",

First the nurse couldn't get a blood return from my port. First time that happened, I was scared. She got another nurse who had me lay on my side with my arm straight up in the air(port is in my left arm) and it worked! She pushed the chemo very slowly and I got the extra bag of saline so hopefully no trip to the hospital again for dehydration. My arm is a little sore, I was there 4.5 hours. The MO said #4 is always worse so be prepared. I gained 4 pounds in 3 weeks(my last infusion) I knew I was eating a lot! He said it's good to eat now because later I may not be able to. I'll trust him. Looks like it's going to rain tonight so I'm skipping the game and the concert. Not sure I would be up for it anyway. My legs are feeling heavy, fatigue is setting in. Good news is my husband gave the tickets to a coworker and he was thrilled, so glad someone could use them! HapB my heart aches for you. Even though I'm not alone I feel like you at times. We just have to remember not to fall too deep in that dark lonely place. Even though you just see our words we are here for you! Like I said if I lived closer i would meet you for lunch/dinner/drinks just to get our minds off this damn cancer.",

Well last year on 8-8-16 I decided I would follow the diet. I will say since I made the change I cannot tolerate gluten anymore. I tried to have a cheat day and I vomited all night.

Kim love the socks! You have been so encouraging in all of your posts. Your chemo is a little further along than mine so I always check in to see how you are doing with it. Taxol is my next step in three weeks. I too have restless leg syndrome so I guess that will be a bother in my future too. You look awesome!! On Tuesday we had a pretty bad storm here in Pittsburgh. It was 4:30 and I was driving home from work. I stopped and played the lottery, hey the jackpot was 750million! On the road people were pulling over with hazard lights but I have driven in worse storms so I kept going as many others did too. I was driving 35mph and a tree fell on my car! I have a moon roof so the bang was very loud as it shattered, windshield shattered, headlights busted, you name it. But since I had foot on gas the tree kind of bounced and my car pulled out from under it. I felt the roof touch my head but nothing painful. As I sat along the road with rain pouring in I remembered I had a golf umbrella in my back seat, I poked it right out the roof! Hey I had to keep my lottery tickets dry! I'm sure it was quite the sight! My car was towed and I got the call it is a total loss. So now I need to go buy a new car. I may not have hit the lottery but I am rich in so many other ways. I survived without a scratch and I have my family that loves me. Even with this cancer I feel blessed. I know God is watching over me. I have all I need in life.",

So I'm going to try to get it right! Peachy.... I'm glad your fever subsided and how frustrating not knowing exactly what caused it. Hopefully things are back on track. Julia....the pic of the head wrap looks awesome. I don't think I could ever pull that look off. Hap..I laughed at your punk statement! Kudos to you! If some of you remember when I started losing my hair I thought I was having a meltdown. I thought there was no way I would ever go out in public with my bald head. I bought 3 wigs, hats, you name it! But honestly I'm the most comfortable bald. I wear my surgery cap at work but it's part of the uniform and patients don't know the difference. I take it off my head as soon as I punch off the clock, get in my car and don't care who sees this bald head! Wigs are uncomfortable and the hair actually bothers me if it gets on my face. Hats are hot and i was never much of a hat person. Yesterday I stopped for gas and totally forgot I was standing in public bald until I saw the reflection of myself in my car window. It gave me a chuckle. I've come a long way! AC #4 completed one week ago. And it wasn't that bad. I worked a half day on monday due to fatigue but I did it. I hope the worst is behind me. I've only missed one day of work during all this chemo so far. On September 15 I start weekly Taxol for 12 weeks. No more neulasta! Woot woot! My MO said as soon as I start having any neuropathy he wants notified and possibly stop the Taxol. His explanation was Taxol was an a accumulative drug and once nueropathy starts there is no reversing it. He said chemo in my case since I had the lumpectomy and removed the cancer, it's a preventive measure for reccurence. He wouldnt want me to be crippled/no use of hands or feet for a possibility of cancer coming back. My car that was in the tree accident was officially pronounced dead by the insurance company on monday. Therefore I went out and bought a new 2018 Jeep! Jeanne...no I wasn't a girl scout but I was desperate to stay dry! Didn't work, I was soaked! I hope all of you are side effect free and trying to get back to normal! I'm spending this holiday weekend camping. We have a RV that sleeps about 10. My husband, my 3 dogs, My son, his wife and 3 kids are spending quality time together!  ",

Last week I had a patient, he is 46 and the only symptom he was having was he lost his appetite and when he did eat he got full fast. So after some scans they noticed something and ordered a colonoscopy. Results are he has liver cancer and it has spread through his abdominal cavity and colon. He probably won't make it til the end of the year. He's married with 2 kids under the age of 5. My take away is life is not guaranteed and yea I got screwed with breast cancer but someone always has it worse. Look for the rainbows and if you don't have God in your life please please find him!",

I started questioning why I was about to do this to myself. I'm stage 1 and had lumpectomy and my nodes were clear. I thought radiation would be enough and even began questioning if that was needed. Your explanation of why I need to throw everything I have available at it was like a light opening my eyes. I did not know that as a triple negative it could spread through my bloodstream.

Will this be done right before chemo or should I call and see if it needs to be done a few days before? I read some of you are getting the Neulesta shot the day after chemo, since mine is on a Friday how will that work? Pretty sure they are closed on Saturdays. Will I give it to myself? I could. As for port and sleeping issues. I have to say since I got mine in my left arm, I was sleeping on that side within a week and I'm even able to lay on my chest. Today I had the pet scan and they used the port, I was scared to death since it would be the first time used. I used the emla cream, the nurse said I would feel a big pinch, I felt nothing! What a relief! What should I take medication wise before chemo? What should I take with me for chemo, a blanket, etc.? Are there any vitamins I should be taking? I read conflicting info regarding this subject. ",

I had CT Tuesday and not all of the veins were visualized. So today they sent me for Venogram. Dr said it appears normal but cannot determine why its swollen. So I'm now on a blood thinner, Xarelto. Not going to make up todays taxol but will resume next week with #8. I'm disappointed I didn't get to do chemo today because I feel fine. But Dr assures me the most benefit I will get from Taxol is in the first 6 doses and I got those. Hoping you all are faring better than me this week!!",

Teeth always feel like they're sticking to your cheeks. Everything is dry. And I'm celiac so I have to eat gluten free, which makes everything 10 times harder.

Yes it's difficult at times but it's doable. I do not have a sit down job. Im on my feet from 6a.m. til 4p.m doing surgical procedures. My bosses have been extremely accomadating and caring to me. They are surprised I'm able to do what I do. I'm hoping the Taxol will be easier, because if it has same side effects I won't have the extra 2 weeks to get back to normal! As for the comments about the hair loss. I'm sure if you look over my previous posts you can see where that was my biggest fear and concern. But I can tell you after all the other side effects I've had, I would lose the hair everyday over any of those! I'm actually very secure bald. You eventually realize it's just hair. When I told my boss(a doctor) I lost my hair he said good that means the chemo is working! Made me feel better! I'm eating everything in sight, not good. I'm afraid I may be the first patient to gain weight! Not having hot flashes yet, hopefully it's not coming in the near future! But I am due for my period the first week of August. Wondering if it will show up! Oh be kind to me mother nature! Prayers to all!!!",

I had my preop testing and on the EKG it showed abnormal results. They could not rule out Anterior Infarct(heart attack), my guess is it's just damage from the chemo.

It comes with a whole new set of complications and possible risks such as blood clots. I didn't consider myself an anxious person but now with every chest pressure I think I'm getting an embolism. I am dreading the first time they stick the port, how much will it hurt and will that cause more bruising? I feel like we removed the cancer with the lumpectomy and this chemo is to prevent it from recurring but i feel I'm losing who i am now. Since my port is in my arm I feel it anytime it rubs against my clothes or sides. So there's that discomfort along with the other arms pain from the SNB, so the cancer in the breast is removed but let's beat up the arms! Ugh I just want it over. ",

I must say I wasn't fond of the lack of privacy. Since I got my cancer diagnosis I have been very upbeat and trying to help my husband realize this is just a speed bump not a road block for me. He worries more than I do, he has cried more than I have. Well as we walked through yesterday there were patients laying in the fetal position, very pale, looking like death to be honest. Luckily the lady(same chemo plan as me for BC but on her last treatment) across from me was in her 70's and she was very positive and helpful. There were curtains that divided the areas but those were only pulled when giving meds. Every time they would ask for your name and date of birth, I think that's a HIPAA violation since everyone could hear. So that really was my only complaint! The chemo went without a hitch. I felt fine when leaving. No dizziness. My husband had to run errands so we did that and went wig shopping, ate some lunch then I came home and took a 2 hour nap. After the nap I felt a little nauseous so I took Zofran. Today I'm going to try to drink lots of water but I'm really sick of water I feel bogged down by it. Do you think sweet tea would be Ok? And I'm going to try to snack more throughout the day. I should've ate like a pig before starting this because I weigh 121 and they fear I'm going to lose a lot. HOPE that doesn't happen. I must share the funniest part of the orientation yesterday. The nurse was going over the side effects and what to do and what not to do. First 24 hours I would urinate red. Ok I can deal with that. Then she said I must contain all my bodily secretions and no one else is. Well I don't usually have other people helping me with that area. And the nurse says \" I mean if you have sex he must wear a condom, he cannot come into any contact with your secretions due to possibility of chemo meds being in them.\" My husband's face was priceless! We have 4 kids, 5 grandkids and he had vasectomy so he thought those days were over! So off to Wal-Mart we went to buy Boost for me to get my daily nutrition and condoms for him. He couldn't look at the cashier!",

I was supposed to start this friday but couldnt get echo done in time.",

My only issue is my mouth. It's not really sores but my gums are hurting. Still dry as a rock. Using my Biotene. I did notice one white patch this morning could be the start of thrush. Gargling with salt water is a temporary relief and hope to ward of any infection. I can't remember who asked about intimacy but I will share my input. My nurse told me if you have sex make sure he wears condoms. Keep all of your bodily secretions to yourself. I read online that chemo usually metabolizes through your body 3 to 7 days afterwards. So I'm guessing after day 7 you could go without. Acne. Yes I started to notice I have a few pimples coming out too. Not sure why or how I remember this but I believe you are not supposed to pop them. Happy 4th to all of you!",

I painted the finger and toe nails with OPI. Curious if any of you got sick afterwards. I have a cold. Cough sounds horrible in my chest but Dr said no antibiotics unless I had fever. I'm going to call again on Monday. My mucinex has acetaminophen in it so how would I know if I'm fevered! I sweat all night in bed and go from hot to cold nonstop. I thought those were the beginning of menopause since I haven't had a period in awhile. Oh the joy of chemo. ",

I lost my eyelashes and I don't like it. My eyes got pink and eyelids swollen. Dr put me on meds to clear it up. Also got Zpack for my cough/cold. Have any of you lost eyelashes and what do you do....falsies? I feel like I look like very pale now. Nervous for tomorrow but one step closer to finishing this chemo! Good luck Paulette!",

I didnt want my life to be defined by cancer, so i tried staying off more than on. Today was my last chemo, yay i finished chemo! !! A long journey but I'm finally done! I only missed 1 day of work, which is a huge accomplishment! One of my Taxols was cancelled due to a possible blood clot. After numerous tests and scans they put me on Xarelto, which I continue to take. I have neuropathy in my left foot only in my heel. Strange but it is what it is. It comes and goes. Hopefully gone soon! My MO is giving me a month off before we start radiation. However, I'm having a mammo, endoscopy and colonoscopy in 2 weeks, not looking forward to that. It will be my new baseline. Woohoo chemo done!!!!! Oh and my hair is coming back! Gray but I'll take it!! Too many of you to list but if you are reading this please know that I have been thinking about you and praying for you! I'll check back soon as I start reading up on radiation pages!",

When I did water I had to use Crystal Lite. I know what you mean about the metallic taste and I found nothing to get rid of it except brushing my teeth before and after I ate. Chew lots of gum! By the time u have it all figured out it will be over! Hang in there. It does get easier! Hugs!!",
