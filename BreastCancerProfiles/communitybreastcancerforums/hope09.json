They are do this biopsy because my sister was DX breast cancer and like my tests her mammo and us came back negative until they did her biopsy ont he thickening in her breast which is what I have so this surgeon is making sure I dont have the same. He said it would be a waste of time to do an MRI of my breast because they are so dense and we should just go ahead with the biopsy to make sure what we are dealing wit. thank you so much for the info. It always helps when you can talk to someone that has already had this done. Prayers for you and everyone here going through this.",

I told them I was a waitress and I had to work 12 hours on that Friday the day after surgery. They said Yes. I thought they were nuts. They said we dont use our breasts for any lifting they just sit there. Wel Fidays are the busiest day of the week fro us Fish Day, and the waitresses to everything , including coffee , orders, taking meals out , dishes, putting away stacks of dishes. I cant imagine going back that quick . Iam afraid I would rip something open. That an dthey said I would not be in any pain and only need OTC Motrin, which is fine but I dont know how my body is going to react to this. I am taking that Friday off anyways just for the sake of making sure I am ready to go back Saturday. Docs office also said get a good fitting sports bra so it would compress the area and keep the bandages on tight. ialso have my followup appt made for March 11 to get the path report results. Its just a waiting game now. We all know what that is like. Thank you all for the support.",
