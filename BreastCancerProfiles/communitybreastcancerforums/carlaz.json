    "Content": "carlaz wrote: I am 30 years old. For about a year and a half I have noticed that only sometimes when I remove my bra, my left nipple is inverted but comes out on its own. I have had several breast examinations (by doctors and nurses, by hand) and they have been told that there is nothing there. Last year I asked to be referred for this, which I was and the doc there again did another hand examination and told me there was nothing there. However I have severe anxiety in general and am always worrying about heath issues.So I'm wondering why does this happen then? Would the nipple be inverted all time if there was a problem? Would there be anything to feel too? Thanks for your help. Log in to post a reply",
