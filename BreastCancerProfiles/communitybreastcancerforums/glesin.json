I can only suggest that you can get a copy of your reports, and personally take them to a Dr. that you trust and have faith in. Having a good Dr. that listens and doesn't treat you like just a number can be difficult to find. (I'm so thankful for my family Dr. she saved my life by listening to me when others would not)  I was having constant right shoulder and chest pains for 6 months, test after test on my bones, spin, back, cortisone shots didn't help, test showed nothing to be the cause. The Orthopedic Dr. gave up said he had no clue, and sent me to a pain management Dr. who wanted to give me more cortisone shots in my neck. But I knew it was not right. I decided to start from scratch and go back to my family Dr.- explain everything to her again that they had done, what the results were. That is when she ordered a mammogram. I must say, I was not happy with having to go for yet another test that seemed useless for my pain. But she had already set me up with a follow up appointment for 2 weeks for the results.  A week later Sept 29th, I went for the mammogram (this is the only one i have ever had), it was not as painful as I had anticipated, and I even left the hospital feeling good because they only took 2 pictures and let me go right away. An hour later, there was a message on my machine from my family Dr. to call her back - this I knew was not good. I called her and she had already faxed the results from my mammo to a surgical oncologist and set me up for a biopsy consultation.  I had the core needle biopsy (i think this is also what you had) I was awake, and it was horribly painful. The surgical oncologist took 10 cores out to be examined, and even showed me the x-rays of them after the biopsy was over. But I could tell right away from his dimenor bed side mannor that he was not exspecting good results, even though he was very positive with me durring the consultation and said that pain was a good sign it wasnt cancer. He said in a week he would have the results and for me to make a follow up appointment with his office.  The very next day he called back with the results, I had DCIS, and he wanted to set up surgery for Nov 1st.  I understand how frustrating constant pain is! And when you have Dr. after Dr. not able to help its even more painful. In my case, I knew something was wrong, I advocated for myself, and keep copies of all my records (yes I even have my MRI's and Mammo digital copies, they are yours you have every right to have them yourself)  It sounds like you have had all the right tests. Have you had any gene screenings done? Or someone in your family because of the history?  I feel my Dr.s have been very pro-active and if anything has been wrong, I have been notified very soon, even sooner than I thought I would. ",

Maybe this was the cause of my pain! Another site I read says that adenosis can cause breast pain. I hope you find an answer and some relief ",
