I went in with the thought of I had surgery, am going to start radiation and I'm going to take a pill. He started right down the chemo road and unfortunately he is the first doctor to get me upset, so all of my questions about tamoxifen, ovarian suppression, etc never really happened because I was done with him. I could get him saying we should run this test, there is a chance if it comes back high that you would benefit from chemo and left it at that. But he was like there are 4 treatments, 3 weeks apart, you will lose your hair, etc. I found out later that he treats a lot of blood cancer and leukemia so he does a lot of chemo. Needless to say today I talked to my RO and said I really would like an MO more focused on breast cancer and he was like I have the perfect person, all she does is BC. In fact they are speaking together at a conference next week about their collaborative work on BC. He is arranging and appointment, the first one was more the office my BS sent me too, I think more for location convenience, which it is only another 15 minutes to go to the main location and see someone more specialized. On the other note my Oncotype came back with a 9, so no chemo for me and all that time chatting about chemo for not. Keeshondmom you need to say something. I'm doing the breath hold and it is 2 at the beginning to make sure we are good and then 3 for my treatment. I would bring it directly up to the tech but if you don't feel comfortable then talk with your doctor or a nurse. You are your best advocate. I finished week one today, 5 down, 10 to go...so far so good. A little swelling in my armpit yesterday but it was gone this morning. See some of you on the February board.",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2019 07:10PM - edited Jan 17, 2019 07:11PM by Mymomsgirl I believe I'm joining the radiation train in January, wrapping up in February. I will have 15 sessions since I had Intraoperative Radiation during my surgery. I went for my simulation yesterday, I had to do CTs for regular breathing and then I got to learn how to breathe with a nose plug and little snorkel apparatus. Since I my cancer was on the left my RO wants to do DIBH to reduce the amount of radiation exposure to your heart. The idea is that my heart should fall away from my chest wall when I take a deep breathe. Even though I don't like the idea of having to hold my breathe if it is safer for my heart I'm all for it. I'm not sure if anyone else here is doing this, but I will say I'm glad I watched a few videos before hand otherwise I may have freaked out, I'm not a fan of having my nose plugged to begin with (probably something happened in my childhood and I'm suppressing it...lol). I know some people have posted about their markings, well I got all 3 - lines, tattoos and marker markings. I didn't mind the tattoos too much, I have a lot of dark freckles so they will just become part of my new normal. One of the techs actually had done one on her hand so she can show her patients what it looks like down the road, now that is getting into your job. The whole thing wasn't too bad, but after laying there with my arms above my head for 45 minutes I had to have the tech help me bring my left arm down, it was numb, heavy and I had no strength to bring it down myself. Next week I have my image verification on Wednesday where I will find out which technique we are using and things will be finalized. I'm not sure if I'll start on Thursday or if it will be the following Monday, we will see. Good luck to everyone and thanks for all the advice you are all sharing.",

I've been told that at most it should take 15 minutes to get setup, do the treatment and be out of there. I'm ready to start this chapter and check it off the list. On another note has anyone who is Stage 1 met with their MO and have them start talking about chemo even before their Oncotype score is back? I was a little thrown since everyone I've talked with has been - surgery/radiation/tamoxifen, but this guy kept going the direction of chemo and I wanted to chat about the tamoxifen side effects. I think I need a new MO since whomever I'm looking for someone to have a 10 year relationship with.",

Depending on the results your BS might suggest that you meet with a plastic surgeon, radiation oncologist and/or medical oncologist before finalizing the surgery part. My BS was so good, the best advise she gave me is that my BC was an emotional emergency not a medical emergency. I took some time to meet with the doctors she suggested, had some other tests to get a clear picture and from there worked with my team to come up with a plan that would be good for me. When you meet tomorrow get a copy of your test results so you have all that information. As for a second opinion, it doesn't hurt, I did that even though I like my first BS and ended up going with her. If you have the ability to got to a place that has a breast center then that is a great place to go because they deal with this all the time. Sorry you are hear, but this site has a lot of great advise and experiences. Good luck with you appointment tomorrow and remember to breathe.",

Does she have another family member or close friend to go with her, it is always good to have another set of ears, the face time idea is a good one too. My assumption it that your cousin was premenopausal and that is a totally different situation than your mom. Do you know if your cousin had genetic testing done? If so it might be good to see the results. Good luck, it is tough to watch your mom deal with something like this, I had to do the same 25 years ago.",
