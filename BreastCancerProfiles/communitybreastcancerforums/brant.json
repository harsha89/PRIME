Yet my family doctor an the surgeon both feel a lump close to my upper ribcage of my breast area(honestly I'm a DDD and have Very lumpy breast ..I personally don't feel anything out of  the ordinary). i'm scared shi***less at this point because my grandmother had a mastectomy at my age and never emotionally recovered from it.There are actually 3 generations in my family so far with BC..Great-grand-ma ...Grand-ma and Mum. I'm 38 BTW...  I have no idea why the surgeon isn't just doing a needle biopsy instead of cutting me open.....Also I have very severe asthma and don't do well coming out of anesthetic(last time I almost died). And compared to what most people on here are going threw my worries seem very insignificant...so I am sorry for grumbling! I also have no idea how long i'll need off from work after my lumpectomy ..I guess it depends upon how big the lump is ...... Log in to post a reply",
