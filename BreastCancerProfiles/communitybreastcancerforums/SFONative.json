I am the primary breadwinner, so was very worried about being able to continue to function and work and interact. I lost all of my hair before the 2nd treatment (c'est la vie). The week after treatment was always the hardest; I got constipated, fatigued but also had insomnia, had some nausea, and a bit foggy-brained. To help with the constipation, I drank LOTS of water before, during, and after every treatment. I started using a juicer, too, to get fruit and vegetables into my system without always having to eat a meal (sometimes you may not feel like eating, but you need the nutrition). My oncologist prescribed Compazine to help with the nausea and it made all the difference. Walking at least 20 minutes a day is also important and helps a lot. I also had dry mouth, which I hated, but I used Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash for that, and then switched to Orajel mouthwash when I started getting some mouth sores. In the two weeks between each treatment, I felt pretty good. My biggest battle was actually with the Neulasta as the white blood-cell booster, which caused a lot of bone pain for me. I would get my shot on Friday, and the pain would usually kick into high gear on Saturday night and then fade to flashes of pain on Monday. To deal with that, I used painkillers prescribed by my oncologist. I'm not a big fan of pills and medication, but those painkillers were my savior. The magic combo for me was a light breakfast, a painkiller, and then a cup of coffee (terrible, I know). That really helped me. And I was able to continue working, volunteering in my daughter's classroom once a week, running errands, etc. My oncologist also prescribed anti-anxiety medication to help with the sleeplessness, but I didn't take it very often. I usually used it over the weekend, but not during the week unless I was desperate. I had a second round of chemo (different type) after my surgery (actually, I had to have a surgery after my surgery because my abdominal wound didn't want to close). The chemo type was a lot stronger and threw me for a loop, but I had pretty much the same experience. There were a couple of days where I just wanted to rest, and then I could go about my business. Everyone experiences chemo differently, but you're young and you've got your kids to give you a reason to fight. I won't say that chemo will be easy, and I don't know how it will be for you, but now you know how I did. I hope it gives you some relief. Listen to your body and give it what it needs, don't give in to the fear, cry when you want to, be mad at the world when you want to, and remember how many other women have been through what you have and that we're all pulling for you. And I bet you'll be functional.",
