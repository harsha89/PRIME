Additionally there will be another lab studying your cells for proteins that feed the Cancer.  Each person in the trial after both reports are in will be put on the drug or drugs that the reports indicate will work with your tumors.  For more information on the  trial check out our website side-out.org.  I am in the trial and presently awaiting the results of my testing.  The metastatic cells are very smart and they find ways of averting the chemo.  We are hoping through this trial the scientists will better understand how these cells work plus giving the patient more options to manage their disease.
