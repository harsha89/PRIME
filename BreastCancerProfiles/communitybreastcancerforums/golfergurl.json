History...had my yearly mammogram last week, got a callback for an abnormality and had digital mammogram and ultrasound today. I noticed during the u/s that there were two black areas on the screen. The u/s was very painful in the area the technician kept taking pictures in. Met with radiologist right after, they have me scheduled for ultrasound guided biopsy next week. They are not sure if it is fluid filled or a nodule they stated until they do biopsy. Is the black area on the u/s common in this situation? Any ideas on whether that reflects a cancer diagnosis? I am 51 years old, never was able to get pregnant. We adopted a baby from South Korea and he is now 20 years old. Any advice for the biopsy? Thanks so much everyone! Log in to post a reply",
