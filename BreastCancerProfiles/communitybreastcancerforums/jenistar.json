Had a stereotactic breast bx last Thursday to look at suspicious microcalcifications found on my screening mammo/add views mammo. The radiologist told me it would be 3-6 days for the results, and that either he or my PCP would be in touch once they were ready. I love my PCP but hate his office (they lose messages, don't follow up on things, etc). Because I haven't heard from him at all since my mammogram, even after I left a message for him last week before the bx, my husband called his office today to make sure he was on the lookout for the results and knew that we were anxiously waiting to hear from him. The phone secretary told him that it looked like the report was in his electronic inbox, but he hadn't reviewed it yet, and she would have him call us back. The husband asked if it was odd that I hadn't heard from the radiologist first. My feeling is that if the results were simple (i.e. benign), it might be a call from the radiologist to report that things were fine, but that since it appears that my PCP will be the one to follow up, the chances are higher that it's a complicated answer (not a straight-out benign). I wondered what other people's experience with that might have been--did anyone here get a call from their radiologist, and if so, was it because the answer was a simple one? The longer we wait, the more convinced I become that it's not good news, and my brain is going in circles. The waiting truly is the hardest part. Reading through the posts on here has been helpful--both the people who got good news and the people who got not-so-good news but have handled it and are here to talk about it! So thanks for having come before me, all of you. It really does help to see your stories! Log in to post a reply",
