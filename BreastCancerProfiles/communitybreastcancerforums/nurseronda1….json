Even had two mammograms in 2009.  Did self breast exams religiously.  My maternal grandmother passed away at the age of 48 in 1960.  She battled breast cancer for 10 years.  I have sisters, cousins, aunts, and great aunts and no one else has had breast cancer but me and my grandmother.  I exercised, ate healthy, never took birth control pills and only used a hormone cream for one year.  I showed the lump to my gynecologist 3-4 years before it became painful and she said it was normal breast tissue.  Never really thought it could be cancer because mammograms were negative.  In March of 2010, I started to have sharp pains in my left breast, but waited until August when my annual mammogram was due and then it finally showed up.  I was angry for a long time that it wasn't caught sooner, so I know exactly how you are feeling right now.  I was so scared, but as time has passed things have gotten better and I don't think about it as often.  My daughter was only 15 when I was diagnosed and I wondered if I would be around to see her graduate.  My how time flies......she will be 18 in 2 months and graduate in 3 months.  I sure don't feel as energetic as I used to, but I attribute part of it to my age and the rest to chemo.  I guess the neuropathy has been the worst part, but thank God for Neurontin.  It has worked wonders.  Chemo went by fast and was tolerable.  You have come to a great place for support and info.  God bless. ",
