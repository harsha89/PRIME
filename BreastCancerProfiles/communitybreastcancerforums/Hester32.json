Good sign, but doesn't prove that lymph nodes are clear. Guess I'll need a sentinel node biopsy, will ask to have it done at same time as lumpectomy. Wish to heck doc would see me sooner - dunno if she's waiting for follow-up tests (\"reflex to HERMARK\" was written in clinical data box on the biopsy report - does that mean the HERMARK test was requested? Hope so). But maybe doc is just busy (breast cancer surgery dept at large hospital) . Couldn't be more irritating to have a 14 day wait from diagnosis to seeing the doc on April 5th. Is that a normal wait, after biopsy lab has told GP that the report is \"urgent\". I'm due to leave April 9th for a 3-week overseas vacation! To pack or not to pack... difficult to do packing and preparations for a three weeks absence in three days! Found item on WHO Guidelines from 2012 saying they decided micropapillary form is not necessarily a worse prognosis after all. Unless the microcalcifications have a \"tram track\" pattern. I know there are scattered microcalcifications, previous mammos have mentioned, but nothing said so far about any microcalcifications in the tumor area.",

Long time to wait - already 3 weeks since \"suspicious assymetry\" was seen on routine mammo. Report says \"infiltrating carcinoma with features of micropapillary carcinoma\". Looked that up - it's a rare and very aggressive form, with very high risk of spread to lymph system. Report also says \"Lymphovascular invasion is not identified\". Apart from size (5mm) they didnt give any more info - like grade or stage - it says \"prognostic test results pending\". . Key question: what's \"not identified\" mean. That the biopsy sample didn't include any lymph nodes, so they couldn't identify if mine are cancerous? Or that they did test one/some nodes, and they did not identify any cancerous cells? Only 4 cores were sent - that doesn't sound like a lymph sample was included? Log in to post a reply",
