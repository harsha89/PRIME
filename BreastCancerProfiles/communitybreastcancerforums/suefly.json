I am having a double masectomy with sentinal node biopsy. This is probably my chance to kick the habit for good.

I had to go out and get anything that I wouldnt want anyone to have to get for me, and tried to organize the house (but didnt really have enough time). Now after surgery , on Feb 8, I am happy that I can do much more than I expected. However, my head seems to be a bit fuzzy. I wont lie, the pain that I had was the worst I could imagine, and I still have constant pain and pressure, with intermittent sharp jabs, but I am functioning with it. I cant wait to get rid of the drains.And the other thing I have been dealing with is severe abdominal bloating. My bowels are functioning fine though, so from what i can get from \"googling\" it, it is rather common to have this fluid shift after surgery. Its not painful, just annoying. It could be much worse. Still waiting for pathology though. I had bmx and sentinal node biopsy.",

I am ready to rip the last two out of four drains out.but I should be able to have them out tomorrow. What makes it all better is that the patholgy came back good...negative node, and no cancer at the margins ect... this will be over once I heal from this!!!

We had some beautiful spring-like wx a week and a half ago and I got new sneakers and was out walking my old route outside..just slower. But that only lasted two days. I kept up with inside exercise , using my treadmill on a steep incline..but it just doesnt energize me the same way. This past weekend I spent two days walking around Boston with friends and felt great..I  think maybe I am just paying for it after. I guess I just wanted to be reassured that I am not the only one who isnt back to 100%. I have never been throught anything so intense before, so its strange to get used to not keeping up the same pace. Thanks, glad you are doing well. Maybe I should take a trip to somewhere warm!",
