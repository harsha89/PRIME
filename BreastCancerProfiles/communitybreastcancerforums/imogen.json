    "Content": "imogen wrote: Hello, I'm 16 years old who is quite healthy, sporty who doesnt drink or smoke. I was wondering about if everyone's nipples do this. It's come to my awareness recently that my right nipple is a little itchy, dry, soft and inverted however my left is again dry, but more itchy and it goes hard at the tip. I know both of them can happen when your cold and everything but im notbthat cold and why wouldn't the other one do it? Recently I have lost about one or two breast sizes which I think is due to how much sport I do but thinking about it, could it be linked? I've checked by doing a circle with my hand on my breast but no lumps thankfully. I'm just a little worried as my untie in her 50's had pasted away from it a couple of years ago. I know I'm young and the chances of it appearing at this age is rare, but should I get checked out? Log in to post a reply",
