    "Content": "jordiegggg wrote: i'm 21, and i started birth control about a year ago. my left breast got significantly bigger than the other, but i thought it was just something about my birth control. really didn't check for lumps - i was 20. about four months ago, i moved to Japan for a semester to study, and about a month in i started to get chest pains on my left side, but they felt like they were coming from below my sternum and my muscle tissue below my breast. then, i started getting shoulder pains and pains down my arm. they're just a dull ache, but very annoying. i also experience a numbness or pain in my left leg - i just noticed a general weakening on the left side of my body. i went to the doctor multiple times for this, but never considered it was my boob. i was never checked there for my breasts, but rather checked for cardiac conditions and muscoskeletal things. they did run a few blood tests, and did a chest x-ray, neck and hip x-ray, and an ultrasound of my heart. then, i thought, what about my breast? i noticed its actually gotten smaller than before - but its not tight or puckered or anything. i havent been able to feel a lump, but i felt a lot of pain and discomfort. there's also a strange pull when i move my arm sometimes, but not always, as how i would think with a pulled muscle. i checked the lymph nodes under my left armpit, and there seem to be dozens of them and they're all swollen. this is really alarming. now, my breast is constantly on fire. my lymph nodes are swollen under my left arm, which hurts along with my shoulder and leg. i also have a lump underneath my collarbone, too. the area beneath my sternum also hurts, like shooting nerve pain but also a dull aching. i'm starting to get some back pain and pains in my right leg, too. im freaked out - i have anxiety (obviously) and there's just a lot of pain happening.
