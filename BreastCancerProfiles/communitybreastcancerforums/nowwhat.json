Now I feel some on my chest above the mastectomy scar. That tingle burn feeling. It sure helps to share and talk about this.",

I am just kind of crying here and there, and feeling sad. I think it's the stress of knowing that chemo is getting closer, and I have no control. I am trying to be prepared. I got Biotene toothpast and mouth wash to help prevent sores in the mouth. I stocked up on popcicles, potatoes, crackers, etc. I have even started packing a small chemo bag to take with life savers, chapstick, MP3 player, flavored water, a book, etc. I KNOW God will see me through. I just have to keep saying to myself \"Fear NOT, for I am with you\".   I really dislike feeling so low. ",

Nolana, That's so good that you have company with your mom and DH for infusion. My daughter has said she'll go with me.

He is putting me on an estrogen inhibitor for 5 years, with NO Chemo, and NO radiation!! He feels that the surgeon got all the cancer, and with no node involvement, he is confident to just go with this. I will see him every 3 months and be watched closely. I could have side effects from the meds, but nothing like chemo!  I guess I can be a cheerleader for the Fabulous feb fighters! You ladies are all so wonderful. If you don't mind, I'd still like to stay here and share with you all. I am numb with his diagnoisis. The surgeon had told me chemo and radiation. That he had NOT gotten clean margins. Oncologist looked a second time in front of me, reading the pathology report, and said, that's why HE is a surgeon, and I am an oncologist. LOL!  I am stunned.  I have my wigs ready, my chemo bag packed, and dinners frozen. I just keep pinching myself.............",
