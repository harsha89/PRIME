I wanted to let you all know how much I appreciate you being here.I have no one in my life who I can turn to so I found your messages comforting. Some of your stories were identical to mine which made me feel not alone in this. I have had 20 years of mammograms that ALWAYS came back \u201cno abnormalities\u201d so you just take for granted that it will be the same each year\u2026 but not this time. I had my annual test last week and two days later I find a message on my phone to \u201ccall the imaging center\u201d, which of course I didn\u2019t see until Friday night\u2026so had a weekend of imagining the worse until I could call on Monday.So of course for the next 12 hours, after listening to this message I had already in my mind chosen my NEW breast size for my reconstructive surgery. Then I thought NO, it couldn\u2019t be that, the computers must have went down the day I had my mammogram taken and everyone has to come back and have retakes because the originals were lost. Or, I forgot to complete some paperwork, I don't remember them asking me to sign anything when I came in\u2026. I came up with all sorts of reasons why they wanted me to call. If there was something wrong a Dr. would have called, not some receptionist. But Monday came, I called, and I was told \u201cwe need you to come in for further tests\u201d. When I asked why I was told \u201cthere was a change from last year\u2019s test\u201d. So there go my theories. The wait certainly makes you think about what\u2019s important or not, how in just one day your life can change forever. I decided to take the attitude that whatever the result this was my path and I would deal with it. Fortunately I only had to wait 4 days to be retested and of course before then scoured the internet on what to expect, so I felt prepared whatever the outcome. That\u2019s how I found this site which was so helpful. Yesterday was the day of the retest. I sat in my car not wanting to go in, but decided to put my big girl panties on and just get it over with, because no matter how long I sat in the car nothing was going to change. I walked into the exam room and the tech had my original images up on the computer. She showed me the questionable area, one large spot, looked to be about the side of a dime, behind my nipple. I don\u2019t know if my mind was just blocking out reality, but my first thought was, well I wonder what that could be? It\u2019s not the calcium deposits I read about? It\u2019s not just a bad image from overlapping tissue, my mind just didn\u2019t go \u201cthere\u201d. So\u2026. had the second mammogram, went to the waiting room while the Dr. looked at it. And of course the tech comes back and says you\u2019re going to need an ultrasound, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Had the ultrasound immediately and while the tech went to get the Dr. I looked at the computer screen and that same big dark spot is glaring at me and my brain is still not going there\u2026 I\u2019m thinking to myself \u201cwhat could that be\u201d? Dr. comes in looks at the screen and says \u201cit\u2019s a cyst\u201d. Obviously relief, but it could have so easily been the other and how fortunate I am. For those of you that are in this limbo of waiting\u2026take deep breaths\u2026draw on whatever sources of comfort work for you, and realize that there is a higher probability that it\u2019s nothing versus something. For those of you that it does turn out to be something, I will think of you each day and send only positive thoughts. Please do the same for me since we never know what each year will bring.
