Like Lago, I'm already wearing the smallest size for the Mediven sleeve...sigh. Lago, what compression level do you wear for Mediven sleeves and the Juzo sleeves? Which model do you get for Juzo? I looked through the Juzo website, seems like I can't just order it myself? Can't seem to locate the measurement guide as well...",

I will be going for radiotherapy on Thursday and not having a sleeve to wear worries me a lot. You may want to refer to http://www.stepup-speakout.org/sleeves_gauntlets_for_lymphedema.htm if you have not for more information on LE sleeves/gloves. There is also a class 0 (15-20mmHg) sleeves if you want lower compression. Just curious, how is the fitting of the Medivan Harmony sleeve for you? Are you wearing CCL 1 for this? CCL 1 is pretty low compression. Hope we find some relief soon..",

The therapist had only two types for me to choose, either this or another customized but not much compression sleeves. I have mild LE btw.. Here's the problem..the mediven sleeves is abit loose on me at the forearm, especially at the wrist. The distance of the top of the sleeve to the axilla is close to 2 inches. Am I right to say that the fitting is wrong??? I suspected I have lymphedema in my fingers as well because it's painful when I brush through my fingers when washing hands, however therapist said it could be chemo SE and not LE. What do you girls think? :( As my current sleeves is a one-piece sleeve/gauntlet, I'm afraid it will cause fluid to pool at the fingers. Will it be better if I get gloves instead? Is there one-piece sleeves with gloves, or are they normally separated? I'm thinking to purchase customized sleeves online, what is a good brand with normally no sizing problem? From what I gathered here, Juzo seems good just don't get the black one which tends to be smaller? Need help from you girls again for advice T_T I seriously trust the forum more than what my therapist said....",

I just completed my radiotherapy treatments, and my lymphedema did worsen a little further (again) in my hand. It swells a little at the back of my palm and hurts a little when i stretch the skin there... That aside...I have tried finding medi95 (both sleeve and glove) online but apparently the glove is out of stock everywhere. Also, I had very bad experience with the company Biohorizonmedical. They took a month to process my order and finally realized that my medi95 glove was discontinued. They then took almost another month to process my refund. I do have the medi95 sleeve with me that fitted pretty well but no glove to match with... After lots of disappointments with purchasing garments online, I decided to go with the only brand available in my country that makes custom compression garments - Bauerfeind. I thought I should give a short review since the brand is likely unheard of here. They do not have any readymade garments, only custom made ones that come in flat knit. I got my set of glove and arm sleeve for SGD596 (~USD 476.80) - not too sure is that expensive? It's made in Germany and took only two weeks to be ready for collection. Comfort wise for armsleeve - its rather thick, but quite comfortable to wear, elbow area is angled, not restrictive when you bend your elbow. However, i chose without silicone band and have problem trying to keep the sleeve up! For the glove, I'm not sure whether it's too tight, but it felt like my ring finger and little finger are bursting. Thinking to get the glove changed.. May I ask will having a lymphpad at the back of my palm be helpful? My fitter and LE therapist didn't suggest that to me when i custom made the glove.....",

And that's frustrating when it comes to LE garments, I can't fit even the smallest size of the ready-made ones. I understand your pain but at least you have several brands to choose from unlike here in Singapore! Just wondering what is your wrist size?",
