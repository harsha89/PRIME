Round two was much worse than round one but now I know what to expect and we will be using Neulasta from now on (didn't use it #2 and got an infection!!).  I am so much more encouraged to come here and read all of your posts, they really make this so much more manageable. I will be half way done after #3 and while chemo hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be, I'm definitely ready to leave it behind.   Lots of uncomfortable reflux/acid indigestion even two weeks after treatment, is anyone else experiencing this? I am on 30mg of Prilosec a day until treatment is done! Maybe the meds are burning up my stomach (ugh), I guess they are derivatives of mustard gas. :)  I'm so thankful for this message board, even if I don't post as often as I would like to, I really appreciate having it.

I'm definitely feeling a bit tired but I think most of it is from staying up too late and maybe the anti-nausea drug they infused. I am hopeful that the SEs will be minimal. I already shaved my head last weekend so that is one less thing I have to worry about, I thought doing it at a time when I was feeling good would be better for my spirits. I really love it and even though I have hats, I am most comfortable with no hair! I love the time it takes for me to get ready now. :)  The only bummer is I have been dealing with cellulitis in my left breast and then an infected seroma (staph), well, yesterday it was all gone and then today my breast was pink all over again! Ugh. I see Kym61 seems to have the same thing, is anyone else going through this? I'm back on antibiotics just in case it is the staph and was a little anxious when my Oncologist almost postponed today's treatment (again). But he seemed hopeful that the meds would work and this is also the reason I am getting Nulasta. I had a lumpectomy and will be going ahead with a bi-lateral mastectomy once chemo is done, now I wish I would've just gone ahead from the get go. Oh well. :) Is a heating pad a good solution? All in all, today was great as I just didn't know what to expect, the nurses were wonderful as well as very encouraging, especially when speaking of the side effects. One also told me that Claritin helps with bone pain when taking Nulasta. Good to know! I really hope everyone is feeling good (as good as can be expected), it is so nice to have this board to turn to for support.  Allison ",

I am also 36 and am doing chemo before my mastectomy but only because my surgeon didn't get clean margins and there was just too much of a spread. I am opting to have my other breast removed at the same time so I don't have to worry about recurrence. I checked out Susan Love's Breast Book and that helped me get through the first few weeks of my diagnosis/surgery, I had so many questions and while finding some answers on the internet were helpful, I would find some discouraging information and it would kind of \"set me back.\" This is the only discussion board I am part of and I love it! Things will settle down and you will find your own \"groove\". Chemo is not that bad at all, granted we all have different bodies that will respond in their own way but so far I have found that worst part was the unknown. You will be okay, we all will. Half a year of not feeling so great, losing my hair, and having another surgery are worth being able to stay alive for many, many years. I have two little girls so I will do anything I can to be able to watch them grow old.  You can do this!!! And...I heard your hair might grow back a different texture/color. I am excited for that, I had long blonde, straight hair and I am ready for some curls and a darker color. :) Allison ",

I'm sure the infection is cleared but my breast is all pink and I am on another round of antibiotics. My Onc seemed to think it was okay to start and so far, I feel fine (day three post-infusion). Hopefully it will stay this way. Good luck to you!  I'm on day three and am feeling pretty good. I definitely had some nausea last night and a bit today but this evening I am feeling good. I got out both yesterday and today for some walking and that also helped. I'm feeling some neck and head pain and a friend who also had BC said it is from the Neulasta, she said it hurt to lay her head down on a pillow. :( Anyone else feeling this? I am taking Claritin and have no other pain so I'm assuming this too shall pass.  This is worth it, this is worth it, this is worth it!!!

I would finish the last two rounds, but at this point it doesn't look that way. I would say the difference between you and I though is that I am HER2- so maybe this is the deciding factor in going all six (but won't you have Herceptin too?).  Hoping to be moving forward.... :) Hang in there everyone.  ",

My taste buds are shot though so things still taste very strange, especially water and I love water!! I haven't had too hard of a time with side effects but I have definitely experienced some nausea, restless leg feeling, headaches, and just plain flu-like symptoms. I was given Neulasta and this seems to have given me the most trouble with my hips and neck aching a lot. I'm curious to see what my blood counts are on Monday and to ask if this shot is worth trying every single treatment. Do other women get Neulasta shots on and off? I had a lot of weird head pain, almost like my head was being squeezed and was told this might have been from the Dexamethasone. Anyone else get this? It is gone but I'm not looking forward to this the next five treatments. I hope everyone is doing well. I love being able to come to this board for encouragement when my spirits are low.

It is now Sunday so I am officially two days post-op and feeling really good. I had a lumpectomy and axillary node dissection back in December and this is not nearly as painful as that was. I was anxious and worried for nothing! I was a little more nauseous after surgery and couldn't really eat until the following morning, but otherwise felt fantastic.  I also slept in my own bed last night as I thought the recliner would offer little sleep. Good choice! I propped myself up a little more and slept the entire night.   Encouragement to those going in for surgery this week and after...you can do it!!!  Allison ",
