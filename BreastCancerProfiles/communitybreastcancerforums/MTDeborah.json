About 3:00, where the curvature of the breast meets the armpit. Flat, kind of bumpy feeling (not smooth or squishy like a water balloon). An MRI right before surgery discovered a LCIS near the nipple that all the ultra sounds had failed to identify. &^%*(ion Between chemotherapy and radiation (break), I traveled to Seattle to visit with a breast surgeon. My focus was reconstruction of my left breast. The surgeon did an ultra sound on my RIGHT breast and didn't like what he saw. Another biopsy (inconclusive) and then a lumpectomy on that side. My girls are very sad... Both look like they've been beat up. Boooo..., but I am ALIVE. Three months (4 rounds) of CT (Cyclophosphamide and Taxotere) followed by the usual 30 some radiation treatments (a total vacation after chemotherapy). With no family history of cancer that I can find in my family (paternal or paternal) I was told no genetic testing needed to be done. My 31 year old daughter lives in a different state. Her primary care physician thought it was wise to do genetic testing on her. A week and a half ago, she received the results. She is POSITIVE for CHEK2 mutation. THE QUESTION: Did my daughter inherit the CHEK2 mutation from my side or her fathers side (maternal or paternal)? My father in law had colon cancer diagnosed at 49. My mother in law was diagnosed with breast cancer at about 68 and passed at 70. Last week my oncologist agreed that I should be tested for the CHEK2 and other mutations as a result of my daughter testing positive. Last Friday I had blood drawn which was mailed off to a genetic laboratory. I have no idea how long I will have to wait to receive a response. I am very curious as to what the results will show. If I don't test positive for any mutations (could happen), then I believe my husband should have genetic testing. That could get really messy, as both of his parents had cancer. Which side did he inherit it from? If I test positive for any mutations connected to BC, I will thoughtfully approach a \"nipple and skin saving mastectomy,\" oophorectomy (ovary removal) and hysterectomy. That's a lot of surgery and I've already had 2 surgeries. I'm thinking it's time for the tissue to go away. QUERY: There don't seem to be many posts regarding the CHEK2 mutation(s). I'm not sure if it's \"rare,\" or if only a small group of the population have been tested. Maybe it's truly rare or maybe it's not. I think all women with breast, ovarian or uterine cancer should receive full genetic testing. Please update us on your results. :-)  ",
