About the whole wig debate--I've been on both sides.  At first I thought that losing my hair would be horrible and so I was sure that I would wear wigs.  But it turns out that I have went bald most of the summer.  I did have a week or so where I wore wigs every day and that was fine too.  Since surgery I have been feeling so disfigured and ugly so I am strongly considering doing more about my appearance which means wearing a wig and putting on makeup.  I had a lady approach me at a Starbucks to encourage me--which means that it is obvious that I have breast cancer and I'm not sure that I like that.  I am still only 3 weeks post-BMX so I'm sure that is some of it, but it really hit me.  So, I am going to give my wigs another try and do a bit more about how I look.  I do not want to look like the pathetic cancer patient! I have about 6 wigs--3 in blonde since that is my normal color, then pink, black, and red. The pink and black are cheap costume wigs, I got the red one for about $30 on wigs.com, and then I got 2 of the blonde ones for free (one from the ACS wig bank and the other from Crickett's program) and the other I bought (and haven't worn!).  It is amazing how different I feel in each of these. I chose to try to have fun with it and will see if that works over the coming weeks.  I have pictures but I don't know how to post them on here :(   Here's a blog post I wrote about going bald back in June. http://blonde_lawyer.blogspot.com/2011/06/going-bald.html  If I can figure out how to post the other pictures I will, or if you want to become friends with me on facebook you can see them (www.facebook.com/lisawb just say that you are from this site so I know who you are!). ",

My chest looks horrendous, so I am really trying not to focus on that.  Part of it is the staples (I hope).   Someone made a comment to me about surgery giving me a lot of energy--it wasn't the surgery, it is not being on chemo!  Man, does it feel nice.  I'll probably get a new chemo recommendation today, so it might be short-lived.

I am thinking about prosthesis before reconstruction since my BS said I would have to wait a year before reconstruction.  I don't know though.  I was a DD before, so this is all so different. How are your incision sites looking?  Mine looks absolutely horrible!  The BS ended up having to take all of my skin on the cancerous breast so he had to pull up my skin from the stomach and down on the chest, so I think that is part of it, but man do I look awful.  He saw me on Monday, so it isn't an infection or anything.  I am worried about how these are going to scar and all of the weird lumps that I have.  I'm not sure why I care, but I just feel so disfigured. In good news...one of my drains is definitely coming out tomorrow.  It could have come out today but I decided to hold off in case my right drain decided to cooperate.  So far no lucky, I'm getting about 50 cc out of that one.  I'm bummed that I will probably have to keep that one over the long weekend. The BS said that most surgeons would put 2 drains in where I have the 1 because of taking the whole breast and the lymph nodes, so maybe a little more drainage on that side is acceptable...wishful thinking :) ",

She also taught me how to do the lymph drainage massage.  I have a little fluid retention on the left side, so we are hoping that will dissipate without having to have it aspirated. I got my MRI results today and the weird spot is still on my rib :(  The oncologist said that we could have a surgeon go in and get it out (or at least do a biopsy) or could just watch it and see.  He recommended the waiting and watching because the treatment would be the same. So, that is the current plan.  I'll talk to him more about it on the 19th when I see him again. He also said that he is going to recommend more chemo after radiation.  Ugh...I'm starting to feel like this cancer treatment is never going to end.  As it stands, I will be doing active treatment through the rest of the year and likely into the new year.  And then there is reconstruction... I'm trying not to stress about this and just relax this weekend (I got out of town to the beach). What do you wear for \"compression\"?  The PT suggested that I get a sports bra and said that it didn't have to compress too much.  So, I'm wondering if those camis with the shelf bra in them would be enough.  I'll ask her on Monday, but just wondering if anyone has thoughts :) Have a good weekend! ",

Find the indentation above your collarbones.  In that space, make slow, light stationary circles. (Crossing your hands gives the correct angle of massage and allows you to do both sides as once.) 3. Stroke from behind your ears to the collar bone. 4. Perform stationary circles in the central part of each underarm. 5. Perform stationary circles in your abdomen--5 each in a) your upper left, b) your lower left, c) your lower right, d) your upper right. (For steps 6 through 8, you can do both sides at the same time, or you can do one side at a time.) 6. Perform stationary circles in the groin, at the hip crease. 7. Stroke from waist to groin.  Think of yourself applying a coat of paint to the region, always stroking downwards. 8. Stoke as in step 7, but now from armpit down to groin. 9. Stroke from the top of your shoulder up an across to the indentation behind your collarbone. 10. If you have a helper, have that person stroke your back, from your waist to your buttocks, and then from the top of the shoulder area down to your wait in stripes as if applying paint. Massage treatment for both arms 11. Stroke from your elbow up to your shoulder. Cover the entire surface of your arm, as if applying a coat of paint. Stroke to the back or top of your shoulder. 12. Stroke from your wrist up to your elbow as if painting. 13. Stroke your fingers and the back of your hand and travel all the way up your arm to the back of your shoulder. ",

To all of you ladies that are worried about chemo, try to not think about it now.  There is nothing you can do about it now and worrying doesn't help.  I know that is easier said than done, but it is something I tell myself every day because I am worried about having to do more chemo after surgery.  I won't lie, chemo did suck, but it is manageable.  So if you do have to do it after surgery  you will be okay.  You will take it one day at a time and manage the side effects one day at time.  I thought that I would freak out about the hair loss, but that has actually been a lot easier to handle than I anticipated.  I still get a bit sad when I look at pictures of me with my beautiful hair, but mostly it is okay.  I actually enjoy the ease of not having to take care of it.  I have several wigs for variety and lots of cute hats/scarves from friends.   Hang in there everyone, we can beat this beast!  Have a good weekend!

Because I was so frazzled when I got to the infusion chair I asked for Ativan, which really did help.  Of course I was tired, but it mellowed me just enough to not break down crying.  I went to this treatment alone and I really think that is my preferred situation.  During the last treatment my best friend came with me but she was so nervous and my caretaker personality makes that hard and I focus on the other people.  Even when people aren't nervous, I find myself feeling like I should be entertaining them.  So today is was nice to just be able to sit there and zone out.  I had my iPad and watched a movie. I got home around 6:30 pm and took a nap.  Then got up, took my big 10 minute walk and ate cereal for dinner (I know, not a great choice, but all I could muster tonight).   ",

I just don't DO it...so I need to figure out what is holding me back and go for it.  I think that my art and writing can really help me through this rough time.  I hope that everyone is having a better Sunday.  I'm in the chair tomorrow--it's going to be a LONG day.  I start at 7:50 am with an echo and then PT, then oncologist and finally infusion.  If I'm home before 7:00 I'll be amazed! ",

Does anyone know if they ever do both neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemo?  I'm doing neoadjuvant to shrink the tumor--with no luck so far. I still have 3 or 5 AC treatments left, so there might be shrinkage, I don't know yet.  But will that chemo be sufficient to kill any other stray cells?  I'm going to ask my MO on Monday, I'm just worrying about it right now. Also, still worrying about the surgery and reconstruction decisions that I have to make.  I know that I want a BMX.  I know that it might seem extreme to some people, but considering the aggressiveness of my tumor (the darn thing grew during 3 weeks of Taxol) (it's also grade 3 and I have felt it grow since I found it at the end of March--it was also documented as growing between MRIs 1 and 2 and then more between 2 and 3), my TN status, my age (I'm 33), and my anxious personality, BMX is what I want.  I've also found a some research that shows that lump + rad has much higher recurrence rates in women under 40 than MX and also research that shows that there could be a survival benefit for women under 50 who are ER- to have prophalactic BMX.   So, my gut is telling me that BMX is for me.  Is that totally unreasonable?  Right now my tumor is about 6 cm and is in the upper quadrant of the breast.  I have pretty large breasts (DD), so there is more to work with.  But a lumpectomy just does not feel right to me--I literally feel sick to my stomach when I think about that.  I have that research, but the rest is just my intuition.  I know that the recovery will be harder and that reconstruction will be even worse, but I'm willing to go through that for peace of mind.    I'm anxious to discuss with surgeons because I do not want to have to \"fight\" to get what I want.  I have no indication that the breast surgeon I saw will fight with me, but I am so used to having to fight with doctors from my experience with my husband.  I know that if I get resistance from the surgeon I can just find another one, but I just don't want the stress.  So, of course I am having anticipatory stress over this! And then there is the reconstruction issues--I don't even know where to begin.   I'm supposed to be on \"vacation\" not stressing about BC, but I can't seem to help myself! ",

My update:  Finished rads at the end of November and promptly got sick.  I felt horrible for about 2 weeks.  I'm in Florida right now for a much needed vacation.  I will be here until the 4th and then will go home for one day and then off to Colorado for a week. After that I start back on chemo for 3 months.  I still don't know anything about the spot on my rib. I'll be rescanned in mid-January, so will probably know more then. Then I have to figure out  about reconstruction. I finally applied for disability, but haven't heard anything yet and don't expect to for awhile. I guess that's about it.  I'm sorry I've been MIA, but I do think about you ladies often! P.S.  My hair is coming back and I love it!  I'll update my profie pic :) ",

Original plan was 12 Taxol and then 4 DD AC--giving me about 5 months of chemo.  Since the taxol didn't work, the new plan is to do either 4 or 6 DD AC and then surgery, which means that my surgery is going to be coming up much sooner than I had anticipated and means I need to start figuring out what I am going to do about it all.  The nurse said that we should know in about a week or two whether there is going to be significant reduction and so I guess that will be able the time when I know if a lumpectomy is even on the table.  My gut is still telling me mastectomy (and bilateral at that), but I don't feel like I have any hard \"evidence\" or \"proof\" to justify it except that there is a higher local recurrence rate with lump and there is one study that suggests that bilateral mast has some advantages in younger women (with TNBC I think--I have to find the info again).   ",

I have a lot of friends that live far away and one day I was feeling particularly lonely and so I sent out a facebook message saying that I would love to get mail from people if they wanted to help and also for my crafty friends that they could make me hats.  It felt so lame, but I've gotten care packages and cards and it does make me feel better.  My virtual support has been so much better than my real life support, which does make me sad, but at least there is some. I think that people are oblivious, rude, or sometimes just don't know how to handle it. I think that with my friends they don't know how to handle me being sick, especially so soon after my husband's death.  But it is still hard.

All in all, I'm doing well.  I am up and moving around and the pain hasn't been too bad.  I slept through the night without needing more pain meds and am taking 1 pill at at time now instead of 2.  I've been warned that the pain could get worse as all of the anesthesia is out of my system, etc., so I am just playing it by ear.   I'll be honest and say that my chest looks like a bumpy, ugly mess right now, so hopefully things will even out and not look so freakish when the staples come out, etc. They did SNB on the left (non-cancer side) and the preliminary report showed no involvement, so that is good news too.  I meet with my MO on Monday and BS on Wednesday.  Hopefully pathology will be back on Monday.

The bonus was I got most of my staples out--I have 8 left.  But, the nurse mentioned that I have a \"little\" dog-ear from the surgery.  It isn't little by any means, so I am upset about that.  I seriously look like someone took a hacksaw to me.  And my surgeon is supposed to be one of the best in town.  Ugh...I hate looking like this.  I was able to handle the hair, but this incision thing is really throwing me for a loop. I still have both drains in, but one is only putting out a little fluid, so I'll get that one removed on Friday.  I am hoping that the other one slows down too so I can get both out. I am having some trouble with range of motion on the Gertrude side and that is annoying me.  I am doing my exercises but everything feels so tight and it hurts.   Anyway...apparently my doctors presented my case to the tumor board, which is the center's multi-disciplinary board where a bunch of doctors get together and talk about patients.  Everyone was in agreement that radiation plus oral chemo was the appropriate next step.  There were differing opinions, however, as to what to do after rads. Some think that I should do more chemo because my cancer is so aggressive.   Others think that there is no evidence to support more chemo.  My onco suggests seeing how I respond to rads and the oral chemo and then go from there. I go for my rads planning appointment next week and should start rads on Sept. 12th.  I'll start the oral chemo (one week one, one week off) on Sept. 19th. I have to say that I am hating cancer right now. The onco-pysch is uping my anxiety medication a bit, so maybe that will help, I don't know.  I am also seeing the exercise doctor tomorrow.  He is just always so darn upbeat that I might feel like punching him :)  I am hoping that he can help with this stiffness and tightness though.   I was also told I'd have to wait for about a year for reconstruction and I find that frustrating, especially because I am will eventually need to find a job, etc. and then I don't know if I will be able to take off a bunch of time for reconstruction recovery.  I'm guessing the DIEP will be my best option (I'm fat and the docs say that the rads will make implants not an option), and so I may end up going out of state for the procedure. I really just want all of this over with so I can move on with my life.   Okay, enough whining from me! ",

I think that I just need to hear that I am not being unreasonable in wanting BMX.    I do not know yet if I will need rads.  I am going to talk to my MO about it on Monday.  My tumor is rather close to my chest wall, so if they can't shrink it much, I imagine that I will need to because of that.  We don't know about any nodes.  There was one node that they looked at via ultrasound, but it looked okay.  So, my understanding is that they are considering node-negative right now, but they don't know for sure since they haven't cut me yet.  I'll be asking about all of this on Monday as well.   Do they not do reconstruction at Swedish?  I saw the brochures for the Polyclinic in the cancer education center.  As much as reconstruction scares me, I don't think that I am prepared to go through the rest of my life with no boobs.  I can deal with a temporary no boob situation if necessary, but I don't think that I want that for my whole life. I'm only 33 and have had huge boobs my whole life.  Damn cancer!  I hate it!!!",

My onc also confirmed that I am going to have to do more chemo after rads--another 3 months.  I thought that I would be okay with all of this, but for some reason this radation thing just hit me today.  I think that it is because I had to cancel my thanksgiving plans.  I am SO tired of cancer ruling my life.  And it looks like it will be this way until at least the end of February and that doesn't even include reconstruction! The rib issue is still up in the air and that stresses me out because I'll be stage 4 if it is a tumor.  The plan is to zap it with radiation and then rescan when I'm done.  If it is gone, then they will call it a tumor.  I don't know if I can accept a stage 4 dx after all of this.  I may just completely lose it. In good news...my hair is growing back and it seems to be growing quickly.  There is a spot in the front/middle that isn't growing in as well, but the rest of it is.  I told my MO that I was going to be mad at him if I had a bald spot :) ",
