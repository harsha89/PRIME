In that case you can have an area with healthy and cancerous cells.From your description it sounds like they didn't obtain a sample from the spiculated part of your mass. I'm sorry you have to go through another biopsy.",

As a former Social Worker, I definitely encourage you to contact your referring Physicians office and ask to speak to the clinic social worker, or patient care coordinator. You can then request assistance from them to aid in your being seen elsewhere in a more timely fashion.
