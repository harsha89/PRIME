I am also having issues accepting the recovery.  Can any of you provide your experiences?  I've heard liposuction is The Worst and people who've had it say they wouldn't do it again but this is one benefit of having reconstruction!  And what about the numbness in your abdomen?  How long did that last? Today I am contemplating switching from the reconstruction/tummy tuck (I'm not exactly sure which procedure I'll have, I think it's a flap) to implants and just working out and dieting extra hard to lose my stomach!  Maybe it's just nerves.",
