I see the nurse practioner there and I really like her.  When I first went in she seemed very concerned and said that if the mammo and u/s didn't give her DEFINITE answers, she would send me on to a breast surgeon because she didn't want to play around with it.  I got no definite answers and now she's changing her tune.  I am wondering if she feels like because the radiologist says it's ok (even though he said he could feel the lump, but not see it on anything) that she should go along with him?  I don't know.  I don't understand why she won't call me back.  I don't understand why, if I'm still concerned, she won't just refer me to  a breast surgeon.  If I can't ever get back in touch with her, or if when I do she doesn't want to refer me on to someone else, what can I do?  Can I request a copy of my report and try to find a doctor myself?  My insurance doesn't require a referral for a specialist, but would a breast surgeon want one before they would see me?  I'm sorry I'm rambling!  I am just so frustrated!  I thought this would all be quick and easy, and that one way or another I would know what I was dealing with.  I never expected to have to fight just to get someone to tell me what this lump is! Brandie-McAdams:  Good luck on your biopsy! Alicia-Rae:  I'm so sorry you're being ignored too!  Keep fighting and don't give up until you get some answers.  I figure if we just worry them to death, they will give us what we want to shut us up!  LOL",

You ladies know a lot more about this than me.  Doesn't that wording sound like I have very dense breasts which would just help to hide any abnormalities that might be there?  I am so tired of having to fight with doctors.  I went through some major fertility and pregnancy issues over the last two years, and I had done my research.  There were times I knew what my doctor was telling me was completely wrong.  It was so frustrating and I really don't want to have to go down that road again.  I just want someone to tell with 100% certainty whether or not this lump is anything to worry about.  Is that too much to ask?",
