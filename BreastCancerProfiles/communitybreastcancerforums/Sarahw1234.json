I went to a walk in clinic and was told its an infection of the milk glands, i had taken antibiotics but nothing went away. About 1 month or 2 ago i noticed my right breast became larger than my left out of nowwhere. Up toward my collarbone area I noticed shooting pain, not much later did the whole area turn deep red and toward my underarm on the end of my breast is a think area that goes all the way to my nipple. Fast foward to now, I have really bad fatigue, my under eyes are extremely grey, my breast is still same size, the redness around my whole breast comes and goes, and im getting a small bumpy rash. Private messge me if curious to see what I am talking about. Log in to post a reply",
