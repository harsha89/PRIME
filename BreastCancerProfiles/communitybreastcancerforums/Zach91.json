      "Content": "Zach91 wrote: Hello Everyone, My mother went in for a mammogram last week and got her results back today. The doctor told her she had microcalcifications in her left breast that were forming into a circle. I've done quite a bit of research on microcalcifications and I am aware that it's very normal for a woman over 50 to have these (My mom is 54). The doctor told her that a biopsy would be needed in order to see if they are cancerous, he also said that in his professional opinion he thinks they ARE cancerous. My question is: If they turn out to be cancerous, what are the usual treatments? I have read that microcalcifications are the first stages of breast cancer (I believe stage 0) and usually are linked to DCIS. I'd like to know what else these may be linked to. Other than the microcalcifications that were found, nothing else is present and she seems to be in good health. She does not have a history of breast cancer in her family and she doesn't smoke etc. I'm 17 years old and my mom and I are very close. I am just here to find more information so I can share with her what to expect and that we can face this problem together. Thanks again, Zach EDIT: She also asked the doctor about her lymph nodes and he said they were fine. I remember reading that cancer usually spreads to those first. Log in to post a reply",

I just hope if this biopsy does turn out to be cancerous that it isn't invasive. Either way, thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question.",

I will quote below in hopes that you may be familiar with what he has said. \"There are scattered fibroglandular densities (Which I understand to be simple tissues that aren't threatening, but may make the mammogram more difficult to read - Zach) Multiple pleomorphic microcalcifications extend in a segmental distribution from the outer posterior to anterior left breast.\" I've done a lot of research on microcalcifications but I have never come across the word \"pleomorphic\" what does this mean? Her microcalcifications appear to be abundant and close together (I saw her X-rays today) does this have anything to do with the word \"pleomorphic\"? Again, thank you all so much for your support and answers, I'm sorry for all the questions, but I really need answers. Thanks, Zach",
