In 1998 I had AC and it took about 6 or 7 months for my hair to look as beautiful as juneaubugg's. My oncologist was starting to worry. I didn't mind showing my bald head, it just didn't seem all that important. Does having chemo twice make it more likely that I will be the 6%? Iago, I did 4 rounds of taxotere. I hope my hair looks as great as yours soon!! I can handle the baldness, I just want to be prepared! If anyone has any info, please let me know. I'm finished with chemo so now hair and getting back in shape are my new obsessions!",
