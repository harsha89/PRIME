I am very concerned about the numbness under my arm where the lymph node was removed.  My surgeon said that feeling may (or may not) come back.  Can anyone tell me how long it will take before I know if the numbness will go away and normal feeling will return to my arm?  I would also like to ask anyone that has had \"balloon\" radiation what to expect?  Thank you for any words of encouragement.
