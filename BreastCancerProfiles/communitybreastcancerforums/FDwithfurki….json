Mom is doing well after her knee surgery. No more irrigation troubles. My MO called me with scan results. He told me that the breast mass is smaller (which I knew because I can barely feel it anymore) also the lymph nodes are smaller and not as 'hot'. The exciting news is that the barnacles (aka bone lesions) are almost gone! I can't wait to see the pictures and compare to the scary pre-treatment pics. I have the final tx (from the original plan) on the 7th. MO and I will discuss what next. I'm guessing more chemo (or different cocktail). I need to take notes to remember who's who. I read and want to respond but then lose track of who wrote what. So I'm gonna be a bit general. Sorry. Headaches-I'm not sure if it's the taxol (I haven't had it) but I wonder if you need more water? Dehydration has always been an issue for me and I find the headache will last for days even after I start to rehydrate. Eyebrow/lashes- I haven't lost mine really (just most head hair, leg hair, arm hair and 'other' hair). But I am certain I would also struggle. I can't believe how well I handled losing my head hair. But my neighborhood (including my work) commonly see women in head wraps and scarves so I feel like I still fit in. But losing the eyebrows would be tough. You ladies are super tough and I know you'll get through I wish we also had 'like' and 'love' buttons. I wonder if it can be added to the site. Or does FB have ownership",

All the bone Mets, lymph nodes, sternum and breast mass. Being as dark on the photo means it\u2019s heavy with cancer. The second pic shows that while it\u2019s not all gone the darker gray is where the cancer still is. But it\u2019s not as intense as it was. Still some on the pelvis, femurs, shoulder (most likely lymph) and vertebrae. But the breast mass is barely viewable and all the lymph nodes are clear in the trunk of my body. The chemo is definitely working. I have 2 more treatments added. MO reduced the Taxotere due to the neuropathy. After that another scan. Then most likely continue tx with Herceptin and perjeta only. Not sure how long though. The breast mass shrunk from 3cm to 1.6cm. I\u2019m so excited. My MO told me he has been telling his colleagues about it and how exciting it is to see how well I\u2019ve done. My Neulasta just kicked in tonight. Within 40 minutes of the injection I started feeling crappy. Luckily it tends to only last the night. The Claritin takes care of the rest by the morning. Thank you all for the support and cheers. Hope you\u2019re all doing well. Glad to read about babies and friends and being down to final tx with minimal SEs.",

The nurse navigator said she doesn\u2019t really know why it works but she said every patient that had big bad C swears by it. Di- I agree with a previous statement that it depend on the tx plan and your MO. I receive mine at the beginning of infusion pushed thru my med port. Well, I had 4 of 6 today. Doc is scheduling my pet scan to take place after #5 on the 17th. He believes that it will be loads better. I had my hands and feet iced during the taxotere. The neuropathy is so annoying. Thanks for the info on what you guys are doing with diet. My MO reminded me to not worry about it right now. If I want to make a change it\u2019s good but not to force myself to change as it\u2019s too stressful.",

But I have a mixture of coconut, castor and vitamin E oil for my head (although nothing growing yet) Before the big C I used it on my eyebrows and lashes. It worked wonderfully. Thank you all for the great words of support and encouragement. Back to the oils... I\u2019ll see if I can find my recipe book and post the recipe.",
