That was very helpful to know that the shape was different than I imagined (sounds like yours was a stack of three slightly oval hamburger patties). It's also great to know that your surgery went well and all is expected to rearrange itself after six or more months. Wishing you the best. Thanks again for your help. Leslie",

The surgeon said the tissue removed would be about the size of an apricot or a peach! Wow, that really surprised me that so much tissue would be removed for ADH in one area (single focal, microscopic lesion in the duct, no lump). I then measured and that could be 30mm (3cm) for an apricot and 50mm or more for a peach. I have large breasts (38DD or larger) and that would be at least a quarter to a third of my breast in the inner, upper, right quadrant. I calculated that my lesion is less than 5mm and if you wanted margins of 10mm of more than we're talking about 25mm (2.5cm) or smaller than an apricot.  My questions are: Are there any standards for the amount of tissue that should be removed in an open surgerical biopsy? (margins beyond size of lesion) What size of tissue did they remove on your open surgery? (in mm, cm, or inches) What was the amount of margin around your lesion? Was your breast deformed afterward? What was the general shape of the mass removed? A sphere/ball? An oval?  I'm not that attached to my breasts, if they have to go, then they have to go. However, it just seems like a big operation for a potentially benign outcome (85% are benign). My surgeon seem to indicate that she'll know when she's in there, but that doesn't make sense to me because she'll be flying blind mostly because the area in not visible and will be identified by the needle/wire placed in my breast prior to the surgery by using mammography. It seems to me that we now have over a dozen mammo slides to determine the exact place of the lesion (which has mostly or completely removed during the streeotactic/core biopsy). We should be able to determine the appropriate margin before going in. I realize that it may be off by a little bit--a few mm here and there, but not by a huge amount). So, ladies, can you give me any guidance here? What would be a reasonable amount of tissue to remove in this biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
