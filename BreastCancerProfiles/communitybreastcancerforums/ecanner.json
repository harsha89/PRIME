    "Content": "ecanner wrote: I feel like I'm going through the worst case of Deja vu ever. I was diagnoses with DCIS in November of last year, went through 2 lumpectomies, and 20 sessions of radiation. I'm on Tamoxifen. Then, went for my follow-up MRI last week. The doctor saw \"something\" on my MRI and ordered a mammogram. The mammogram shows a non mass-like enhancement on the same breast just to the left of where my DCIS was. When I went for my second lumpectomy, my surgeon said my margins were clear. This 18mm non mass-like enhancement was not on my previous MRI. Had a biopsy on Friday, and now I'm waiting on the results...again. If I have to go through all of this again, I'm going to go insane. Has anyone else experienced this? Log in to post a reply",
