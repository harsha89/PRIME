I didnt have to have any radiation. my onc said the way I had my treatment was new ie:- chemo then surgery  it worked in my case. my cancer was also stage 3, so had been there a while,  I have a false boob but never wear it as I am more at ease walking around with one missing  when I wear the false boob  I think people are stareing at me and saying she has a false boob.  so talk to your onc ask why they are going one way  and not another ask as many questions as you can.",

I have my brothers stareing at me when I look in the mirrors.  I ended up with every hair on my body gone and boy was that cold (live in Newfoundland ) this was right over winter.  my partner woke up one night and saw me sleeping there with a wooly hat on, she woke me up laughing I said well I was cold and this kept me warm. the hair started growing back about a month after the last chemo, and curly  had straight hair before.",
