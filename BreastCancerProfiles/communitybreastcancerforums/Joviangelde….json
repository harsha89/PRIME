After the initial trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer, I felt I had some power in knowledge of how its treated and what to expect because there is so much information on breast cancer.  I had alot of support from others with people who'd been diagnosed before me,  and I gained strength in their knowledge. But with these conditions like you and I have been diagnosed with, I had nobody to ask.  No one had ever heard of it before.  .  If I'd known that the pacemaker wasn't as affective as it was presented to me, I don't know if I'd have gone ahead with the surgery.  It does help some people but not everyone.  But it did give me 8 months of normalcy, so I'm thankful for that.

Weeza, my doctors will not say it was chemo for sure, they just tell me its possible. Apparently you can get it from a neurological problem, diabetes, (I'm not a diabetic-so I have Idiopathic Gastroparesis, which means unknown cause), a virus, or former abdominal surgery, chemo, and some medications. I've had all of the above except the diabetes. All of these things can damage or clip the vagus nerve to your stomach, which has caused this. I know in my heart it was the chemo, because I never had any problems with digestion until I went through it. I had the Gastric pacemaker inserted in august of 2010.  it took about a month for my body to get used to it, and then I had about 7 or 8 months of feeling great. I was able to eat most anything without any trouble accept occasional bouts of vomiting and nausea. Then this past April, the nausea/vomiting and epigastric/chest pain started up again. I ended up being admitted from the ER, and they readjusted my paceamker. It was originally set to fire 1 time a second, with a 5 second break. set at 2.0 voltage if I'm not mistaken. They can increase voltage slowly up to an i8 or 9, I believe. They did another EGD and found the gastritis, duodenitis,hiatus hernia and esophagitis. my symptoms of nausea/vomting persisted, so I kept going back to my doctor;s office and he kept raising the voltage and times it fires. currently its set at 4.1 voltage and it fires 3 times in 3 seconds, and then has a 5 second rest. I normally don't feel it fire, but occasionally i do. It's not really painful, just wierd feeling. I'm waiting to get my disability approved so I can go back to see him. I'm trying to hold off until then, because I'm really struggling financially and I have a 30.00 dollar copay for specialist office visits. I owe them for the past 2 times I saw them still, and I cannot pay  anything on all the medical bills that have piled up since all this began in 2008.  I've gone through all my savings.  My credit is ruined. So I've cut back to the bare essentials, which isn't easy.  i can't afford to hire an attorney to file bankrupcy but I did hire one for my disability appeal because they only get paid if you get on disabilty. they get a percentage of your first check. I just take one day at a time. That's all any of us can do. Thanks for ya'lls kind words. It brightened my mood. Take care, deb",

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2011 07:37AM Joviangeldeb wrote: Hi, ya'll. I've already posted on this thread a few days ago, but my thoughts have been on this subject alot lately and wondering to myself why I like Pink October and think its a good thing, when so many of you do not. I've done some soul searching and wanted to put another point of view out here in cyberspace.  First of all, I can understand why so many can't stand it.  I really do. And I do not mind calling myself a breast cancer survivor, because I look at the word survivor as meaning that you survived the treatment and am in remission. That's it.   Not that you fought any harder than anybody else did.  It think the word survivor has developed into something else more powerful to mean you fought harder. I don't think that. As for pink october, i agree with breast cancer awareness. I know it has problems and that most of the money goes to awareness and not research.  But I look at it like this:  Awareness equals more research and education.  Even if billions of pink october goes back into the pockets of retailers and such, still some of it goes to research. Any amount of money that goes to research is a good thing.   This is the important factor to me because I also suffer with a horrible disease that doesn't have 'awareness': which is gastroparesis.  IT's destroying my life and it doesn't get alot of funding for research, because there is not alot of public awareness of it. I never had heard of it until I was diagnosed. I don't know anybody personally that's ever had it until I started searching on line and found a yahoo group.  No awareness - no research. My GI specialist told me that the treatments for this disease are not as effective as it should be and patients have a very mixed response to the treatment.  And yes, my doctor deals with this disease because we just happen to be in a city that has one doctor that performs gastric pacemaker surgery for gastroparesis, so he gets alot of patients from out of state. I had this pacemaker inserted last year, and it worked for about 8 months, until my body stopped responding to it.  It still functions, they've increased the voltage and frequency several times, and I've had so releif.  i'm disabled, I'm appealing disability with an attorney. I can only work while fasting from the ngiht before. Through trial and error, I only can hold down food with phenergan, prilosec adn then lie down for a few hours after I eat. I only can eat a very limited variety of foods, mainly chicken, tuna, white bread, mayo and hard cheeses.If I stray from what few items I that are 'safe' I get really sick.  I can't tolerate most veggies unless its canned peas or carrot, no fruits. no beef, pork, nothing to drink except coffee and orange soda. I live on orange soda.  that's awful but nothing else stays down. they have tried alot of other medications that are supposed to help with nausea and vomiting. Nothing works except for phenergan and prilosec. I've developed chronic duodenitis, esophagitis, gastritis and a hiatal hernia from frequent vomiting and having the gastric pacemaker. We keep it in even tho' its not very affective in case it helps me keep down these few safe foods. My life sucks.  It's ruining me financially, physically, I stay malnourished, I'm homebound after I eat for hours and hours. I am existing, I'm not living.  I sure wish more awareness and research went into this disease because I made it through breast cancer treatment only to be hit with this. And I beleive it was the cancer treatment that caused damage to the vagus nerve that supplies nerves to my stomach.  My stomach is literally paralysed now. I stayed nauseated and vomiting throughout my whole chemotherapy no matter what drugs they gave me. Then it persisted ever since. it took my doctors 2 years to diagnose me because this disease isn't readily recognised at first. I checked Gi recommendations on frequent nausea and vomiting. Doctor's are taught to go through a series of tests and guess what. Gastric emptying test is the LAST one they are taught to order when they can't find answers with all the other tests.  This needs awareness in the future or there will continue to be very little research for this. Incidently, the gastric pacemaker I had inserted, is still in the experimental state. And its been that way for years.  I'm sorry this is so long, but I just wanted to express what I've been feeling and thinking about this subject.  Sometimes I think I'm made to feel bad because I like Pink October.  I have respect for other's who do not like Pink October, and I can see why.  I just happen to have a different opinion on that matter. Take care everyone, Deb  ",

When I had the pacemaker inserted, I woke up from anesthesia with a numb left arm and hand. Had no feeling, like it was asleep and it gradually took 2 days for it to go away. While I was in the hospital, my surgeon was going to start running tests if it didn't go away, but it did. To this day, I have no idea why that happened, I never got any answers and the surgeon didn't know why it happened. As for the GP, my Gi doc said that in his experience with the patients he sees with it, that the symptoms tend to be cyclic, but he told me no cases he has are the same. Alot of his patients come from Alabama since Biloxi, MS is the closest place that has a surgeon that does the pacemakers. My GI doc told me its permanent and chronic.  But none of my doctor's: Gi doc, internist and oncologist will investigate what caused it in the first place. Since I've had most of the risk factors other than diabetes, they tell me it could be any one of those and that it doesn't really matter what caused it because it wouldn't change the fact that I have it and the outcome. when I had my gastric emptying test done at the hospital, I knew it had not been normal, because the monitor is placed where I could see it, and the radioactive egg sandwich they give you too eat, I could see on the monitor sitting in my stomach. I told the tech I could tell it was hardly moving and she didn't tell me yes or no, cuz they are not allowed, but i knew. When I got the results from my Gi Doc, he told me normal finding are usually T45. Which means it takes about 45 minutes for the food to pass from the stomach into the duodenum & intestines. That's the ideal time a healthy person should have. Mine was T20hours. They told me the test showed it takes my stomach 20 hours to pass food into the small intestines.  I tend to have nausea and vomiting that begins about an hour or two after eating.  on a day to day basis, the only time I have hunger pains is usually from about 9am to 10am after I've fasted from night before. Most mornings I wake up queesy, but I just dry heave if I'm having a really bad day. I bring a heart shaped bucket and washcloth in my car and at work, because throughout the past 3 years, I've dryheaved or vomited numerous times while driving. That is scary when it happens while driving. I just grab my bucket and do my business while I'm driving. And my work has become used to it happening because its been going on for so long. My goal is to work 4 hours per day from about 7:30am to 11:30am while I fast from night before. Than I come home, take my meds and eat It's usually an egg, chicken or tuna sandwich on white bread, plain chips and mixed nuts. same thing day in and day out. .  I then lie down until 4 or 5pm and force myself to get up. I'm not hungry and its difficult to eat dinner, but I graze for several hours after taking another dose of medicine throughout the evening.  I'll force down perhaps a cup of dry cereal, than wait an hour or two, maybe a pudding cup, then an hour or two I'll have a kit kat. Kit kats are the only candy I'm able to keep down. Don't know why, none of the foods I can tolerate with the phenergan makes any sense to me either. My internest suggested I try the pudding cups to get alittle calcium in my diet. I also take bites of babyfood.  And I've just started getting  brave enough to try the whipped yoplait. I had to talk myself into trying it, because the last time I had regular yogurt, it wasn't a pretty picture. and this is all on a 'good' day.  Occasionally I have such a bad day that I can only do liquids, which is coffee and orange soda and ensure. the ensure I have to take sips from, but I can most of the time hold down a sip once an hour or two on bad days. I keep an ensure at work and sip on it once an hour or two so my blood sugar doesn't drop. I find if I don't do that, around 10:30 or 11am, I get the shakes and weakness from sugar dropping.. All this has been through a few years of trial and error on my part. Occasionally I'll not take phenergan to see if I can hold down my safe foods without it, but I get so nauseated and can't. zofran doesn't work, neither does REglan, and i had such bad side affects with the Reglan, they had to take me off of it. I have medication controlled hypertension because of a benign mass on my left adrenal gland, (that's another story) have had it for 20 years or so, but Reglan made my blood pressure in the 190's/over 100's and I became tachycardic, so they took me right off of it. anyhoos, thanks for listening. and I wish you well.  If you are on facebook, or anyone of ya'll who reads this, You can find me under the name Deborah J Panger.  I tend to live there. And am addicted to the games. lol take care, deb",

I didn't have any reconstruction.  LIke others have said, the drains were uncomfortable while they were in. I had one of them removed a week after surgery and the other 2 weeks after surgery.

All during this time, the gall bladder surgery did not clear up my gi symptoms. I kept having fever, diarrhea, frequent nausea/vomitng and lower left flank and lower left abdominal pain.  My regular doctor referred me to a Gi specialist but I couldn't get into the office for an appointment in a timely manner.  They're closest appointment was a month off.  So my regular physician kept putting me on flagyl which would clear up the symptoms until I completed the course of the prescriptions. All my symptoms would return about a week later.  The happened over and over, so my regular physician admitted me to the hospital for 1 week.  I went thru tests and a colonscopy with this new Gi Doctor, and they could only find chronic diverticulosis with no active infection.  So I had no answers when they discharged me.  I was instructed to see the Gi Doctor after discharge, but when I went, he didn't really listen that my symptoms were no better. He rushed in and out.  I became sick again and called them.  They couldn't get me in until the next week but ordered a barium enema & gave me the prep instructions of nothing to eat or drink after midnight the night before the test.  I was so weak and sick but I managed to drive myself to the hospital for the test but I couldn't make it from my car, so the hospital wheelchaired me to radiology for the test.  Radiology told me I was too sick to have the test done, and that the dr's office gave me the wrong prep instructions. I was not supposed to be npo after midnight. It was supposed to be clear liquids. They wheeled me to the Emergency Rooma and I was admitted to the telemitry unit due to being so dehydrated and such a low potassium level, they were worried my heart would stop.  The Gi Doctor on call saw me cuz my regular Gi Doctor wasn't on call.  This other doctor is the same practice called me in my room and asked if I minded having another colonoscopy before they did any prep and I said yes. They came and got me and the Gi Doctor's partner was able to diagnose me with C Diff infection.  This nearly killed me.  I fired my Gi Doctor and got another one after I told the office I wanted to stay with the one that was able to diagnose me. They gave me a hard time about it so I cancelled my appointment with them and told them I would not be back. My regular doctor referred me to another gi doctor in the next town, who I've been happy with.  He told me that I've probably had the c diff for several months and they use flagyl to treat it, so whenever I was on flagyl, it would kill most of it, but not all of it, cuz the dosage wasn't long enough.  It would grown right back. I couldn't believe the negligence of the other Gi Doctor. And to make matters worse, the endocrinologist's office called me to tell me that I didn't have Primary Aldosteronism and dropped me as a patient.  I took my blood work to another Endocrinologist who specializes in this rare disorder, gave him a copy of my records and he stated that I DO have Primary Aldosteronism. He said as long as I stay on a medication called Spironolactone, it can control those symtoms (high blood pressure, leg edema)  I'm so sorry this has been so long, but I've been so frustrated for the past couple of years with all the no answers to why my health was failing. It affected my home life, my work, everything. I'd work one week, then too sick to go in the next. Plus my work didn't want me there cuz C Diff can be contagious to people with a suppressed immune system or people on antibiotics. Since we do surgeries at work and alot of our patient's are on antibiotics, I couldn't work. Anyways, it just helps to know that I'm not alone, and I wish ya'll all the best. Take care, Deb",

I'd swell up to my knees.  For one of the diagnostic tests, I had to be off of it for 6 weeks and I began having severe fluid buildup in my legs again. I kept calling the office complaining about my legs and that my blood pressure was high, but they kept telling me to hang on, that I couldn't go back on the medicine til after the last test.  When I called to get my results after I'd had the test done, to get back on spironolactone, this was when they told me that I didn't have it, due to the results of that last test,  and dropped me as a patient.  I told them I needed the spironolactone again and that my blood pressure so high and I that my legs were so swollen and they told me that it was now my medical doctor's problem.  I couldn't believe it. I called my primary care, explained what was going on and they got me in right away. My blood pressure was 170 over 90 something.  They put me back on the spironolactone and all my symptoms cleared right up.  He's going to keep me on the medication for life.   The specialist who finally diagnosed the adrenal gland problem told me that the condition is relatively new and not widely understood yet.  They call it Conn's Disease and he used to work with the Dr. Conn who the condition is named after.  Since he lives clear across the country, he told me that as long as I stay on the medication, that it will control it.  I just happened to be on the drug that they treat it with already, my primary doctor had just stumbled upon it after we had tried, maxide, prinzide and other duieretics. Apparently, when the endo doctors are in medical school, this condition is touched upon breifly and told you might see one or two patients in your whole lifetime practice.  So they are not that educated on it.  The test I had done was supposed to measure the range between my renin level and my aldosterone level.  The test showed my aldosterone level was within normal limits, so he thought I didn't have it.   But what I learned from the new doctor, My renin was at the lowest normal figure and my aldosterone was at the highest level within normal limits.  The ratio was like 32 points.  THAT's what the disease is.  Not the fact that my aldosterone level was not elevated beyone normal limits.  I shake my head at this but I can see if the local endo doctor wasn't educated properly in med school, than he wouldn't have known what to look for. He knew about the condition, cuz he suspected it, but he didn't know enough about it. I'm just blessed I stumbled upon this specialist online. They have a site that is trying to get more public understanding on the condition so hopefully in the future, this won't happen.  I opted not to persue surgery to have my adrenal gland removed because this specialist told me that the condition could be caused from the mass and if they remove it I wouldn't have high blood pressure or leg swelling anymore. But it also could be caused from the glands themselves and I was born with it. if that was the case, my symptoms would not go away if I have one removed and not the other. Since you can't survive with no adrenal glands, I opted to just stay on the medication. IT's been so nice to meet someone who has been going through alot of the same issues with the C diff.  I hope your son never gets it again. They tell me that the spores stay in your body and cannot be destroyed, but normally, if a few hatch, they become a normal part of your digestive flora. Take care, deb",

I feel blessed for every day God gives me. My sign has opened communication for alot of patients that come into my office.  They will open up about if they've or a loved one has been diagnosed.  A few patients have recently been diagnosed and they will come to me for information or to aid them in some way.  I really feel this is one reason I was supposed to go through this horrible disease. My younger sister was diagnosed 1 year after me and I believe it eased her fears, seeing me go through the treatment.  I hope to one day walk in our local breast cancer walk, but I haven't been able to the past 2 years because of illness.  I strive to next year, with several of my coworkers.  We're going to call our group the Barbara-ettes because I've nicknamed my prosthesis Barbara and we call her our new employee. her job title is 'Employee support'.  I find humor has been a Godsend for me.  I found something humerous in every aspect of my treatment which helped me through the horror of the treatment and diagnosis.

Once I began chemo, from the get go, I had severe nausea and vomiting despite all the medications they gave me to combat it. Nothing worked for me. My appetite went to zero.  I ended up taking the week of my chemo off, then I'd go into work part-time the next two weeks before my next chemo, and the cycle would repeat itself.  AFter carefull consideration, I declined radiation. Thankfully I had a very understanding boss and group of coworkers. They were very supportive during my treatment.  After chemo I gradually resumed working full time but would have bouts of nausea and vomiting that would last for weeks at a time, and my coworkers got used to me vomiting in front of them.  I had a rough couple years with hospital stays, gall-bladder surgery, C Diff infection. They finally were able to pinpoint the reason for my chronic nausea and vomiting. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis. Either the chemo or the mastectomy damaged my vagus nerve and paralysed my stomach. They inserted a gastric pacemaker last year and I was able to resume work full-time until this past April.  I ended up back in the hospital with nausea/vomiting and my body stopped responding to the pacemaker, so I'm down to only working in the morning hours while I fast from the night prior.  I've been forced to file for disability.  However, I don't think that my experience is the norm.   A year after my diagnosis, one of my sisters was diagnosed and while going through her chemo, she was able to work full-time with no problems and very little side affects.   It just goes to show you that all of us are different.  It's hard to pinpoint whether you'll be able to work full-time or not, during your cancer treatment. Many do work full-time.  And then I hear of a few that can't.  I wish you the best.

You and her family are in my thoughts and prayers.  Cancer is so unpredictable.  My hubby and I had a friend who was going through chemo the same time I was for lung cancer, and he passed away about 6 months after we both were finished.  I remember we both were in the same hospital at the same time for a week, with complications with our cancer treatments. he was my husband's fishing buddy and I know he misses him.   ",

I'll be checking out those threads about the Arimidex.  You know?  I had a total abdominal hysterectomy about 5 months prior to being diagnosed with breast cancer and was put on hormones. As soon as my doctors learned I had cancer, they took me off the hormones and I was forced through menopause.  as I look back, the pain began about a month and a half after that.  Thank you so much for the insight.  Nobody has ever put those two things together for me.  As I'm on Arimidex, the pain has gotten alittle worse.  I do take 1000 mg of Vitamin D per day thinking that may help.",

My doctor did a skin sparing left mastectomy in case I ever decided on implant.  I'm like you. I didn't want anymore surgery, my husband is very supportive and I do not regret not having any reconstruction or implant.  The only thing I wish I'd had, was a bilateral mastectomy, but at the time of my diagnosis, I didn't know enough about breast cancer to ask for it.  I know that each of us is different about this and there is no right or wrong decision. One of my sister's was diagnosed 1 year after me and she chose bilateral mammo, expanders and implants. Take care, Deb",

I was diagnosed on 10/1/07 at age 44 with breast cancer, and recently my youngest sister, age 40, has been diagnosed, too.  She had a double mastectomy yesterday.  (Recovering good, thank the lord. ). My other 2 sisters are now going to breast specialists, also, and so far do not have breast cancer.  Our maternal grandmother had breast cancer but we didn't know her.  My mom was adopted. we're tested negative for the brca gene 1 and 2, but our doctors are telling us that we probably carry another gene that hasn't been identified yet.  They're even telling us that it could stem from a mutated prostate cancer gene on my dad's side of the family. I'm so thankful that they are doing tests to identify more genes.  Family members need to know there chances of developing breast cancer in the future.  Perhaps it will not affect our generation, but perhaps our children's generation will benefit from more knowledge. ",

So there is no way for a doctor to diagnose a mass or density on the way a mass or density feels.  I had a biopsy and it confirmed it was breast cancer.  Keep us posted and I wish you the best.",

I had my sister and one of my good friends go with me and it really helped not being alone.  And they also aided in asking alot of questions and writing them down for me.  In hindsight, i found power in knowledge. After diagnosis, I studied up on cancer and it really benefited me in making decisions about treatment.  you'll find these boards very beneficial and informative.  Wish you didn't have to join but glad you found this place.  Deb ",
