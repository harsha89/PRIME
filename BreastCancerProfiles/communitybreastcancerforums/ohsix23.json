The base of my nipple papilla was accidently cut through needing stitches. I got to remove the dressings 48 hrs later and was horrified to see the bottom half of my nipple turning black. It looks necrosed and its still seeping blood from the injury site. His NP saw me post op day#4 (Friday)and she thought it was too dark to be a bruise too. She called my sugeon, who admited it may be dying tissue but its too late to save it. We need to wait and see how it \"declares itself\". I also can't feel that portion of my nipple and noticed Saturday I can't feel the bottom half of my areola either. He assured me at my pre op consultation that my nipple/areola complex would be fully preserved. Has anyone suffered loss of their nipple due to necrosis after this particular surgery? I'm freaking out about losing my nipple! Thanks for any encouragement and I appreciate everyone's support. Log in to post a reply",

I am going to lose the bottom half of my nipple,as it became necrosed within 48 hours of surgery. I tried to get right in to see if the blood supply could somehow be repaired but my surgeon said there was nothing he could do about it. I'm still draining serosanguinous fluid from a small part of the circumareolar incision, but mainly from the side base of my nipple where it was attempted to be repaired. I have adhered strictly to the no push, pull or lifting >5-10 lbs restrictions but yesterday I completely soaked through a 4 x 4 dressing pad and soaked most of the front of my sports bra over a span of approximately 3 hours. Did anyone else still have fluid draining from incisions almost 2 weeks out of surgery? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
