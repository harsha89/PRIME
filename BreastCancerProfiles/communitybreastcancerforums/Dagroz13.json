I just went through a stertotactic (mammogram) core needle suction assisted biopsy on clustered microcalcifications yesterday afternoon, an ultrasound core needle suction assisted biopsy on a mass on June 28th, and an ultrasound needle aspiration of a cyst on June 15th - all in the left breast.  Each person experiences these things differently both physically and psychologically. For each of these procedures I drove myself and after the procedure I continued on with my normal activities, which entails some lifting but nothing more than 20/30lbs and only about 3/4 times.  I too was instructed not to do any heavy lifting.  I am a little bruised and a little tender.  I wasn't given anything other than a local anesthetic, lidocaine injection(s) for both biopsies (those stung a little and had a wee bit of a burning sensation).  For the needle aspiration nothing was given (stung a little).  I would think if you need to have a surgical biopsy then you wouldn't be able to drive yourself and the aftercare (home) instructions would be different.  This site is full of great info and caring people.  What has helped me to cope is to slow down and take baby steps jumping one hurdle at a time.  Please keep in mind each doctor is different as well as each patient.  For me the worst is the mental anguish (anxiety) versus the actual procedures.  My thoughts are with you.  Hoping we both catch the B9 train!  Juanita  ",
