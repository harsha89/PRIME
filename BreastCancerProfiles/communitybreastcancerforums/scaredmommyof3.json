I am not pregnant and not lactating, last child born over 3 years ago. About 4 months ago I noticed a bump or bug bite type spot in my right areola. I actually thought it was maybe a boil or something. At times I thought it would come to a head but it never really did. Then one morning I woke up and about half of my breast was tender, pink/red and swollen. I seen my PCP who immediately referred me to a breast specialist because he thought it was an abscess and also put my in a high dose of antibiotic. Made an appt with the specialist did Not do an ultrasound, mammogram or anything. She said you have a breast abscess and to continue taking the antibiotic and that I would probably need to have an irrigation and debridment of the abscess. So I continued taking the meds and the pain subsided and redness and swelling seem to all but go away. The spot on my areolanever went away in fact it never changed at all. About a week after I finished the medication I woke up to a worse than ever swollen (about a cup larger) hot, red with steaks breast. I went to the ER and they did an ultrasound. No abscess. I followed up with the specialist the next day who said it was a skin infection and prescribed another round of antibiotics. So I took the second round and the redness has faded to pink, swelling has gone down a little spot in the areola Still no change, and still no mammogram or biopsy ordered. I again completed the antibiotics and went back and toldf her that Iwas concerned it could be IBC she said infatically that it was not IBC but would order s mammogram and then scheduled me for a major duct excision because without any diagnostic radiology studies she says it's periductal mastitis. This was the first time she said that to me. First appt she said it was an abscess, second appt s skin infection and now it's periductal mastitis, all this she can tell by just staring at my breast? I'm concerned and frustrated! Help! Log in to post a reply",
