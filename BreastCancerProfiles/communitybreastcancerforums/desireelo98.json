I stopped taking my medication in February and within the next month i ended up becoming a full blown hypochondriac. I'm Hispanic. I\u2019ve had a history with eczema but only on certain parts of my body. I have no history of breast cancer in my family. This month i started having a itchy nipple and I itch hard so i don\u2019t know if this is what caused the rash in the first place but i discovered that I have a rash on my left nipple. my left nipple is dry with a rash around or over it I can\u2019t tell but Ever since the rash happened I've haven't really been getting itchy but when I do I don't itch I just put some Vaseline on it. I've also used two different creams on my nipple before the rash started so that also may be the cause. I Googled rash on nipple. All the results said Breast cancer or Paget's disease of the nipple which is a rare form of breast cancer.so I think to myself. I have breast cancer. I had a full blown panic attack and woke my mom and sister up at midnight. They said \"oh it's nothing\" \"you don't have breast cancer you\u2019re way too young\" \"the rash will go away\" my sister even has had a rash in the same place herself and she said it will go away. I know it\u2019s rare for teenagers and young women to develop Breast cancer and also extremely rare for them to develop pagets but what if I'm that rare 7% that has it? the anxiety of this has been driving me insane and I don\u2019t know if I should rush to see a doctor or wait a few days or weeks to see if it will go away.

I might have to see a dermatologist if this doesn\u2019t go away on it\u2019s own completely. My doctor said no to getting a mammogram. And also ever since I started using those three creams now my left nipple is prone to chafing. I went back to using the creams on the 15th",
