I have large, 8\" x 11\" flexipaks (gel-based cooler paks) from when I was a \"team mom\" for my boys' athletics. I bring 5-6 of them in an insulated bag, each in a ziplock. My husband wraps them around my feet using hand towels and secures them with heavy duty plastic clothes pins. I switch from having my feet on top of the pak and putting the paks on top of my feet because they get my feet very cold. For my hands, I make a \"sandwich\" by layering my hands and the packs. Then I switch off when the cold is too much. I think the general idea is to keep the overall temperature low so the taxotere doesn't flow to the tips. My PA also recommended taking two supplements to counter nerve/cell damage in general. They are alpha-lipoic acid and acetyl-l-carnitine. I have been using them since my 3rd cycle and I think my hands and feet feel much less painful. My PA said to keep taking them after chemo as well, because the neuropathy can take a while to go away (some women have it years later) and the supplements help build back the nerves. The idea of permanent neuropathy freaks me out so I'm trying everything. Another thing to consider: my neuropathy was VERY painful at the start and my MO dropped my taxotere concentration by 10% after my 2nd cycle. When I asked, he said that they calculate dosages based on factors like age, weight and general health (I was in pretty good shape when DX). Then they give the highest dose that doesn't give the \"average\" person unacceptable side effects. So, I guess they maxed me out and only dialed it back because of the neuropathy. They assured me that my dose was still high enough to kill everything. Good luck. Maybe during icing, you'll have to trade off iPad for some podcasts? Mindy",

And as you pointed out, 2014 could be considered old when it comes to BC research. That's one of the things my MO made clear to me when he laid out my plan and prognosis. I am on Herceptin which is considered somewhat \"new\" in that it's only been in use for about a decade, so the data from everyone using it is only now starting to show up in meaningful studies. He pointed out that outcomes and statistics could improve in as little as five years. So the statistics from 2014 have almost certainly changed. I'm going to stay on plan and keep watching the research and keep challenging my docs. (They probably see me more as a PIA than a challenge!) Mindy",

And now a question for you all about mind over matter:  my PA and at least one of my infusion nurses reminded me that just because they want to prepare me for SE does NOT necessarily mean the SE will hit.  I have to admit that I spent much of the first 7 days after my first infusion, tip-toeing around waiting for every nasty SE to hit me.  Days 3-6 I felt tired and fluish and had a couple bouts of D.  But by Day 8 when I went in for my weekly Herceptin, I was feeling pretty normal and felt fine after the infusion.  So fine that the next day I went to my regular 75 minute yoga class and the following day I swam 2400 yards (I swim in a Masters program).   My WBC was high so I decided I would take advantage of the opportunity.  Today I commuted downtown for my job for the first time (I worked from home Week 1).  I didn't get tired and was able to function on most of my cylinders.  So I'm counting myself exceedingly grateful.  And I'm beginning to consider that before chemo started I may have been borrowing trouble with all my reading and agonizing over SE and being totaled by each cycle.  I know that each cycle accumulates and by Cycle 6 (in April, arrgh!) I may be singing another tune.  But, as shown by these boards, mental attitude makes a difference.  And I think I'm going to reorient my thinking from \"when is the next SE going to hit?\" to \"well, I haven't experienced (insert SE here) yet, so I'm going to assume I escaped.\"  Because I was exhausting myself waiting for the other shoe to drop. All by way of saying, I'm grateful for all the positive energy on this board/thread.  You truly are all warriors. Mindy ",

Last week my cell phone rang showing my OBGYN number, which I took even though I was in the middle of a one-on-one with a colleague. It was my OBGYN who delivered my BC diagnosis and referred me to my BS and cancer team, so I still break out in a sweat when I see her number. Turns out it was an office tech who apparently calls with patient reminders to get their yearly mammos. I had mine in February 2017, where they did NOT catch my tumor (I say with still not quite resolved anger). So the tech wanted to know if I had scheduled this year's mammo or had already had one since February. Trying not to make my colleague uncomfortable, I told the tech \"yes, I have had a mammo since then and she should review my file so she would understand (meaning: how could you have missed a breast cancer diagnosis in my file?).\" She said she did review the file and didn't see the results and could I tell her what they were? I just told her to check with the doc, read the file and get back to me if she had questions. But she kept asking so I finally had to brush her off saying I was in a meeting and had to go. I am blessed by having good insurance and so many resources in my metropolitan area. But for about 15 minutes I was stunned by (once again) observing how many times the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing and how hard we must all work to be our own health advocates/consumers. I know of many examples where individuals are not particularly aggressive with their doctors and treatment plans, or they struggle to understand their medications and instructions and I pray that their health teams take the extra time needed and give a little more consideration to them. Like this journey isn't hard enough that someone should be adversely affected by their paperwork. Off the soap box now. Mindy",

Dark, I wish I could say I exhaustively researched my supplement choices but on my PA's recommendations, I chose based on customer ratings and price.  For the L-acetyl carnitine, I got 1,000 mg capsules from Mental Refreshment Nutrition and take 2/day (PA suggested between 1,500 and 3,000 mg daily).  For the alpha-lipoic acid, I got 600 mg capsules from Doctor's Best, Inc. and take 1/day.  I've been taking them now for about 5 weeks and I think I have noticed an improvement.  But starting Cycle 3, they reduced my Taxotere by 10%, so I can't be sure what the source of any improvement is.  I am going to ice my hands and feet again on Friday for Cycle 4 and I will keep taking the supplements because the PA said they will help rebuild the nerves after chemo is over.  Sometimes I think we're all (MO, PA, nurses, me) just flying by the seat of our pants.  I quizzed my MO the other day about why, if Herceptin is such a \"silver bullet\" drug for HER2+ tumors, they still blast me with 6 full chemo rounds of taxotere and carboplatin.  Then I answered my own question:  it's because Herceptin is so new (approximately 10 years) and there isn't much 5-years out or 10-years out data to go on.  So the docs hedge their bets and treat with full chemo as well because they know it has given good outcomes.  At this point, if they're not sure enough to prescribe Herceptin only, then I'm in for the full Monty, too.  When I'm 10 years NED, I'll look at what the \"new\" studies show with no regrets. Question:  does anyone on this thread take Lasix for fluid retention?  Just days before Cycle 3, my ankles, legs and hands became very swollen so my MO gave me an infusion of Lasix and it helped.  He also prescribed a Lasix pill to be taken as needed and I'm taking it in these last days of Week 3.  It's more discomfort than pain, so I guess I'll live with it.  The Lasix definitely makes me pee a lot, so I'm slamming more water than usual and also taking a potassium supplement the MO prescribed to keep electrolytes balanced.  Sometimes I feel like a chemistry experiment. Hang in there everyone.  Shout out to Ejean, who has been pretty quiet lately.  Hoping your treatments are going well and you're busy being \"normal.\" Mindy",

I feel the same way about neuropathy and want to do everything I can to keep any from becoming permanent. You haven't screwed up because we're all so different in how we react to chemo. You can only choose to do what you believe is the next right thing in front of you. That said, remember that we would expect SE to peak during and just after treatment. Then, as the chemicals get cleared out, hopefully the SE will diminish. So, you may be experiencing the worst now and will find that what you are doing now will help in the long term. You're probably not going to know until after the taxol is done and now that you're in the middle of treatment, you may not want to trade additional \"insurance\" against recurrence for ending the short-term neuropathy. In a post a couple spots above this, I list two supplements that my PA recommended which support health and rebuilding of the nerves damaged by neuropathy. As with many vitamins and supplements, they may not reach their full protection until they build up in your body. I'm struggling to be patient and wait for the end of my chemo to see what happens. The supplements you're taking now also should support nerve health. I hope you can take a deep breath and choose your next right step. \"You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.\" Mindy",

My hair, nails, eyelashes, etc, are only slowly coming back.  I'm grateful that I was able to keep doing my strength conditioning, swimming and yoga throughout treatment.  I'm sure it helped me get through treatment better, but there's no denying that my body has had a beatdown.  I still experience fatigue and am struggling to find an AI that doesn't make me feel like I'm 30 years older than I am.  About 2 weeks ago, I developed blood clots in my left leg and now I'm on blood thinners for about 1 month (and maybe longer term, depending on the results of the next scans.  Blood clots!   Just another of those SEs that your doc says are pretty common with cancer treatment (it messes with the proteins in your blood) but you've NEVER heard or read about them in your books/research until after you get them.  I'm frustrated because I had scheduled a scuba diving trip next month that I have to cancel because diving and blood thinners don't mix.  So much for going on to \"live my life.\" I hope you all had a warm Thanksgiving weekend (if you celebrate it).  Looking forward to hearing from you all.   ",

So I'm optimistic for you with your Herceptin only treatments.   Feeling better each day, what a concept.  Today was full cycle #4/6 for me and I was happy to see that although my red blood cells may be going down a little, so far not enough to put the treatment schedule into question.   Love seeing good news in this group.

I was always a tomboy and never really sat down with my mom to do girly stuff like makeup. So envious of you finished with your chemo and sending you lots of positive thoughts for your surgery. Just one more \"full round\" for me and I'm literally hanging on by my fingernails. As in, the dark lines have started showing up but so far no lifting of the nail. My taste buds gave up too and I don't think they're going to come back in between rounds as in the past. JVP: thanks for the ideas on the food. When I read your post, it reminded me that citrus IS one of the flavors that I can taste. I paid attention the other day while eating a salad and it seems that citrus, sour (pickles) and other savory (onions and garlic) tastes still come through. So I'm going to work with that.

I was personally psyched that I seemed to have escaped bone pain from Neulasta.  My WBC was high and I've felt pretty normal all week and today's WBC came back in the upper range too.  I know this is just Cycle 1/6 but I'm feeling optimistic as I sit in this nurse's chair for my infusion.  When the nurse asks where I am in my treatments, she goes off on how I'm just beginning and the fatigue will probably hit after my next full cycle and by then my hair will be gone, blah, blah.  But she says it in what I'm sure she thinks is an empathetic tone (that's how my husband heard it), and all I can hear is doom and gloom with no consideration for the fact that everyone experiences chemo differently and maybe I WON'T have debilitating fatigue.  She's probably been there for decades and just spews the same patter to most patients and really doesn't think about it.  But for someone like me who is just starting and is trying to do everything I can so that 16 weeks from now I'm not a wreck, that talk doesn't help me.  I guess it's a fine line they walk between keeping patients expectations real and still trying to encourage, but it did feel a little cookie cutter to me.  I'd like to think if it were me, I'd do a lot more listening to the patient and less pontificating.  Off my soapbox now. Today is Day 15 after first full chemo and my hair is hanging in there.  I canceled tomorrow's \"shave party\" with my best friend because the PA said that 2 weeks is an average and she has seen (not scientifically) that brownish-red haired women \"may keep their hair a little longer\".  Now I'm worried it'll start to jump off in the middle of a work day next week and I'll regret not having just made a clean break to a wig this weekend.  Like SSWP, I'd rather not have lots of gossip and misinformation going around, so I got a wig that looks a lot like my hair does now, although a little blonder.   Two more days until a \"warm up\" to 30 degrees!  Flip flops all around!  Mindy",

I remember the uncertainty was crushing and I was just on the edge of tears most of the day before. But I had the best BS, very kind and reassuring. After the pathology came back and we learned I needed the full-Monty (chemo, radiation, 1 year of Herceptin and 5-10 years of AI), I remember coming here and finding this great group. It was a long, hard winter of chemo, every Friday for 18 weeks with every 3rd Friday a full cocktail. I was surprised by my reaction the other day as the weather got cold and I dropped my infinity scarf around my shoulders. I wore it constantly last winter and my whole body shook as I was reminded of how rotten I usually felt when I was wearing it. Now I'm looking at just 2 more Herceptin infusions and then port removal. I hope to get it done before New Years when my deductible resets and I have to pay health bills again. Thank goodness for insurance. I'm having my first post TX mammo tomorrow and also getting some dental work done before I go on a bone strengthening drug. I have only slight osteopenia, but the research is so strong for prevention of bone mets that my MO agreed to put me on it. A rare side effect of the bone drug is osteonecrosis of the jaw; that's why I'm getting the teeth up-to-code before I start. I also started Anastrozole (AI) in June and may have to have that swapped out for another AI because of the bone pain side effect. I'm on a 2-week \"vacation\" from the AI to see if the SE disappear and if they do, the MO will find a different AI for me. We're all so different in how these SE affect us. Mjb, is the drug you're referring to Nerlynx? I would be a candidate for it too, but my MO hasn't started prescribing it yet because of the SE and because he's conservative about jumping on new drugs. I will be anxious to hear what your doc says. I follow the Nerlynx thread on this board. Hariry: love your hair. I think it compliments you very well. I hope we hear from some of our group that has gone quiet. How are you all doing?",

Swewing, my PA recommended the Acetyl L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid as well.  She said they would boost my nerve cells' ability to rebuild after the Taxotere damage and to keep taking them after chemo ends because their full effect would take 30-60 days.  I have to admit that I'm petrified the neuropathy might not go away.  Starting with Cycle 3, I began \"icing\" my hands and feet during the Taxotere infusion because I'd read on these boards that several women have used it and didn't have neuropathy.  It follows the same principles as cold capping: keeping the taxotere from reaching the hands and feet.  I'm not going to know for months if it's going to work, I guess. Hoping to pull on my boots tomorrow and slog through the snow to go to work.  I'm going quite stir crazy with the cold and snow! Hugs everyone, Mindy ",

I have large, 8\" x 11\" flexipaks (gel-based cooler paks) from when I was a \"team mom\" for my boys' athletics. I bring 5-6 of them in an insulated bag, each in a ziplock. My husband wraps them around my feet using hand towels and secures them with heavy duty plastic clothes pins. I switch from having my feet on top of the pak and putting the paks on top of my feet because they get my feet very cold. For my hands, I make a \"sandwich\" by layering my hands and the packs. Then I switch off when the cold is too much. I think the general idea is to keep the overall temperature low so the taxotere doesn't flow to the tips. My PA also recommended taking two supplements to counter nerve/cell damage in general. They are alpha-lipoic acid and acetyl-l-carnitine. I have been using them since my 3rd cycle and I think my hands and feet feel much less painful. My PA said to keep taking them after chemo as well, because the neuropathy can take a while to go away (some women have it years later) and the supplements help build back the nerves. The idea of permanent neuropathy freaks me out so I'm trying everything. Another thing to consider: my neuropathy was VERY painful at the start and my MO dropped my taxotere concentration by 10% after my 2nd cycle. When I asked, he said that they calculate dosages based on factors like age, weight and general health (I was in pretty good shape when DX). Then they give the highest dose that doesn't give the \"average\" person unacceptable side effects. So, I guess they maxed me out and only dialed it back because of the neuropathy. They assured me that my dose was still high enough to kill everything. ******************************** Hope this helps. Mindy",

Second, she said that \"we've tricked your white blood cells into a pattern and they'll still function that way for a while longer until your body figures out that we're not giving you a beat down every 3 weeks.\" So side effects may continue to come in waves. My WBC never got too low, but they're only now coming back into the normal range. They've been checking my blood before the herceptin infusions. So I've been experiencing waves of neuropathy, fatigue and a bunch of the little, annoying SEs like, runny nose and my eyelashes/brows slightly growing back and then dropping out again. So you're not alone. I exercised (weights, swimming, yoga) a lot prior to DX and now I've become convinced that regular exercise, keeping lean muscle and a reasonable weight simply HAS to be part of my prescription for preventing a recurrence (not there yet; it's a journey). I've read that women who make it 2-5 years out can start to feel less anxious about recurrence, but personally, I'm still in the fear mode where every lump, ache or pain has me on alert. At least when I'm exercising or just walking out in nature, I can sometimes put the fear aside a little. I started my daily AI (Anastrozole) and so far have encountered diarrhea as the primary SE. I've read that bone and joint pain can sometimes occur, but I'm just going to keep lifting weights, swimming and doing yoga so I'll probably never be able to differentiate pain from those activities, from the AI side effects. Some mornings I get really angry that I can't just have ONE DAY free of feeling less than normal. But I'm never going to be the same physically. If I'm going to live to 95, I'm just going have to come to grips with that. I'm curious if anyone has spoken with their doctors about the latest \"breakthroughs\" that came out of last month's ASCO meeting. There were \"headlines\" here on BCO.org about 1) Herceptin for 6 or 12 months affords the same outcome, and 2) chemo for many early stage BC patients may not be necessary. My MO said \"no\" to stopping the Herceptin. He's more conservative about jumping on to the latest study results, plus, I haven't had any heart side effects, so he's keeping me going. And I'm HER2 positive and have already had chemo, so I won't benefit from the new chemo studies. I was just wondering if anyone is having their treatment plan changed because of this new information. Dark, thanks as always for the uplift. Especially in spite of your problems with the Taxol. Taxanes in general seem to cause a lot of the hardest SEs to deal with. What was the outcome of the xrays for the cough? Good news, I hope. Daniz, you've been in my prayers and I hope things have improved for you. What did you learn about your tumor after the surgery? Were there additional tests (Oncotype). Did they re-grade it? You had so many questions about the change in the tumor; I hope you got good answers (and maybe a second opinion?) Hope you can all see some positive light these days. Mindy",

Today was a Herceptin only infusion which seems to be the best tolerated of all my drugs.  Next week, I'm dreading Cycle #3 because I'm starting to see accumulation of SE.  This week I reached my limit for neuropathy and talked it through with the PA.  She's going to throttle back by 10% my taxotere to see if that helps the neuropathy.  I thought 10% sounded kind of random and she explained that the dosage calculation is based on (among other things like age, weight) the highest dosage that an AVERAGE person can take without debilitating SE.  Neuropathy is a big deal for them because if not treated, it could become permanent after chemo ends.  So she was glad I mentioned it early.  I was surprised that she accurately described the burning/sensitivity you can also feel in your lips, which I hadn't associated with neuropathy.  So, lesson is: don't suffer in silence. (I'M LOOKING AT YOU LAMINDERS) She also recommended I start these supplements:  alpha lipoic acid and acetyl-L-carnitine which support the rebuilding of the nerves that are damaged by the taxotere.  She warned me it would take at least 30 days before the supplements would be fully effective, but fortunately my next cycle will have reduced taxotere.   My energy (and WBC) have been high enough that I've been able to keep exercising.   Tomorrow I'm going to join my old Masters swimming group for one of their workouts.  I'm sure I won't be able to keep up with them, but it'll be good to get in the water again.  For me, it's both physical and mental therapy. Daniz, my port today wouldn't give blood back either.  It seems that some of us develop a protein \"flap\" between the port and the vein, according to my onc nurse.  She had no trouble getting the Herceptin in, but the flap would be pulled closed when she tried to pull blood.  She used an injection of a drug whose name I don't remember, but she called it \"Draino\" and after a few minutes, the blood came back.  I'm glad I didn't have to make an extra visit for a draw before my next cycle; they need to know the WBC before they can start.  Fortunately, my body must be fighting back in general, because my WBC has been at the top of the charts every week.  I'm going to credit exercise and TONS of water.  I'm soooo paranoid about leaving ANY of those toxins in my body longer than they have to be.  Drink up, everyone! Kayakmom, what an incredible story of insensitivity from that woman.  With all this time to think about it, I have now prepared my response should I ever find myself in a similar situation.  It would start with something like: \" I'm going to speak quietly because you're going to be so embarrassed and ashamed when I tell you that I'm a cancer patient and you've jumped to a very rude and wrong conclusion...\"  At least I hope I'd have the presence of mind to pull that off. To leave you with a powerful thought, I'm going to repeat a wonderful \"mantra\" I copied from GenevaC (where have you been, girl?) on this thread a few pages back.  I'm thinking of making a little poster of it for over my desk.   ************ This is winter.

If they say \"it can't hurt\", then I consider it.  I added a note about a book by a doctor who seems to have integrated the two approaches and lived 17 years after a brain cancer diagnosis.   I'm Day 2 after \"full cycle\" #3 and facing down a crappy Week 1.  But having this group as support really helps.  Hugs to all. Mindy  ************************************************************************* Hello ladies.  I'm actually in the December chemo group but lurk here to get an idea of what's to come.  I am so inspired by your mutual support and information.  I am on Day 2 of \"full\" Cycle 3, (weekly Herceptin) with 3 more cycles to go.  Here's some things I've learned: Dry fingers, toes and heels:  they could be from mild neuropathy.  I started with dryness and it has progressed to warm/hot pain, tingling and even phantom tingling in my lips and around my mouth.  My MO dialed back my taxotere by 10% this cycle, hoping that it will lessen the neuropathy.  As with most side effects, he said that it will reduce after chemo stops.  But he would not guarantee that there might not be some permanent impact.  A little research (Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation, among them) shows that could be true.  So I took ice packs to this cycle and used them on my hands and feet while the taxotere was going in.  MO was neutral on this because there are no definitive clinical trials, but many on this board have used icing (like cold capping) and have not gotten neuropathy.  I am Type 2 diabetic, so this was worth my time.   Books on holistic treatment:  I have been inspired by \"Anti-cancer:  A New Way of Life\" by David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD.  A fellow BC survivor recommended it to me and I found it to be a very conversational way of transmitting some of the latest research into things each of us can do to counter the \"cancer environment\" we live with.  Not preachy or \"all or nothing\".  He lived for something like 17 years after a brain cancer diagnosis embracing both conventional and alternative approaches.  So there's little things in there I am using now, and may use for the rest of my life. Thank you for all your positive energy and most notably, your support for Blair.  I have you all in my prayers. Mindy  ",

It also included acetyl-l-creatine and alpha lipoic acid which my nurse practitioner recommended and which I found on Amazon less expensive than a vitamin store. She noted that their full effectiveness is reached after 30 to 60 days, so don't stop taking them even if you don't feel an immediate change. I hope I'm not deluding myself, but I do notice that my neuropathy seems to lessen during and after my strength and conditioning workouts. It may be about circulation, or I focus on other complaining muscles, but I relish these momentary respites. Nevertheless, I'm gearing up to ice my hands and feet again for my next full cycle of TCH. My hands and fingertips hurt all the time and twisting anything with ridges like a bottle of water or a lamp switch, is really daunting. I'm queued up for Cycle 4 of 6 this Friday and I'm DREADING the days 3-7 after (the bad effects seem to be stretching longer each time).

I think you're amazing to continue to see things to be grateful for (no crazy growth on taxol).  I can only imagine how it feels to look back and question your treatment.  These boards are full of women who've been whipsawed by changes in pathology and diagnoses.  My pathology changed from HER2- to HER2+ in the time from first biopsy to post-surgical. And then because of Herceptin, I'm told that what was once one of the MOST aggressive types of breast cancer, is now one of the most curable (not even sure what that means).  However, I pressed my MO about why the need for carboplatin and taxotere, and it's \"because we just don't know how your type of cancer will respond.\"   Uncertainty is the name of the game, for sure. I'm now 3 weeks PFC and I'm starting to see a few SE improvements.  I swear my body is still confused about not having gotten another chemo beat down (I had 6 rounds, every 3 weeks).  I still have tingly fingertips and toes, messed up nails and taste buds, fatigue and twitchy eyes but it's almost become my standard operating mode.     On Friday I started my every-3-weeks Herceptin and met with my oncologist who was quite celebratory and smiley with me about finishing chemo.  I'm afraid my reaction didn't meet his expectations, since I've got rads starting May 15 and the Herceptin until December.  I find that it takes too much to try to explain the difference to friends and family between chemo and Herceptin since they're both infusions through my port.  So I usually resort to \"it's a different kind of chemo with much fewer side effects.\"  My husband commented that although he thinks oncologists acknowledge that we will spend the rest of our lives waiting and watching for recurrence, in their minds, they put us ALL in the \" 95% cured\" category (or whatever our individual statistic is) once chemo is done.  Thank goodness for the physician's assistants (mine is a woman) and the chemo nurses; some of the most empathetic people I've met. They are second only to the people I've met here at BC.org! Finally getting warm spring/summer weather here, so I think I'll deploy my mental solar panels and soak up the energy.  It's been a pretty tough winter for our bunch.  ",

I will keep you in my thoughts tomorrow as you start your regimen.  I believe you and I are on the same one:  TCH, with the Herceptin every week in between the 3-week cycles?  (then Herceptin for like 12 more 3-week cycles?)  It's daunting, but as you say, we feel better once we know what we're dealing with. Right now I'm stressing the whole hair thing.  I watched the breastcancer.org YouTube video on coping with hair loss and I don't think I want to spend 1-2 days watching my hair fall out.  I'm planning on shaving my head but don't know when.  I'm going to assume that it will go around 2 weeks after chemo starts, so maybe I'll get it shaved on New Year's Day or the next.  Then I can go to work with my new wig.  It looks a lot like my current hair. It's been very quiet here for a few days.  I hope those who have started their chemo aren't having such bad SE as to keep them from posting.  Maybe you're all busy with the holidays and running on fumes, and if so, I wish you strength and rest and loved ones surrounding you.  ",

I started chemo in December 2017 and benefitted greatly from lurking here and learning how you all dealt with your chemo and SEs. So thanks. I am also on AI for the next 5 (10?) years and just wanted to add a note about the bone density shot. I also had a touch of osteopenia but was persuaded to take bone strengtheners (currently, the alendronate pill, once a week) because my MO believes the data is showing that bone strengtheners can reduce the risk of recurrence in the bones. Below is a link to a recent \"meta-study\" from the UK that supports the approach. Also, if you search the main BCO.org site for bisphosphonates and recurrence, you can find (among others) the link below. It's a little dated and I think there are more recent studies, (I wish BCO would display search results with clearly shown dates.) I just started taking the alendronate and I'm not scheduled for a Dexa scan for 2 years, so my little data point won't be available for a long while. But I first stumbled onto this information on BCO and I'm for most anything with science behind it that might improve my chances of avoiding recurrence. Just my $ 0.02.

I started in December but have been lurking here and love hearing all the positive news about finishing and diminishing SE. You have a very supportive bunch here. From the beginning of chemo, I had very painful neuropathy in my hands, feet and legs due to the taxotere (a taxane, like taxol). My MO and PA recommended two supplements: acetyl-l-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid. I started taking them right after cycle 2/6 and have found some relief (took about 30 days to really kick in). More importantly, my PA explained that I should keep taking them after chemo ends because they are essential to the rebuilding of the nerves that the taxotere was affecting and this would help avoid permanent neuropathy. I'd read about women who were still experiencing neuropathy and pain over a year after the end of chemo and that freaks me out. So supplements for me. Also, they dropped my taxotere concentration by 10% in the rest of my treatments since I was getting the max dose. Might be something to ask your MO. Mindy",

Thank you for all your positive energy and most notably, your support for Blair.  I have you all in my prayers. Mindy ",
