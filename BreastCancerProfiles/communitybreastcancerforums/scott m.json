She has seen another doctor for the mamogram and the biopsy and is supose to go for the PET scan on Monday but we are going to wait till we move to MD Anderson.  I understand that there will probally not be just one doctor that is the best but im looking for recomendations. With those recomendations I will be looking for consistency to see if certain names keep coming up. We also have a friend that works there that is trying to find out for us. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Scott McCormick Log in to post a reply",
