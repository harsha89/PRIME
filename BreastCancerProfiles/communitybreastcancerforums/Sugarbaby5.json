I always know I am not alone in this, but sometimes I am just not bold enough to put these questions out there. I hope this Gem/Carb protocol kicks back in. I was on Tax 6 months ago...had progression, then switched to Gem/Carb and it seemed to work for 3 months, then I had a few times when I couldn't get treatment, or could only get partial treatment due to blood counts (but I felt great)...then had a transfusion...again, I felt great...they kept saying \"we don't even know how you are standing up right now as your counts are so bad\". My PET scan yesterday revealed slow progression again....you know the feeling, your phone rings at 5:35 pm and you look and see it's your onc and your heart sinks and your stomach turns. I've been on this particular roller coaster for over 3 years, every 3 months, good scan, then not so good, then good, then not, so on and so on. I am a person of consistency and control (yes, I am a control freak on every aspect) so as you can imagine this makes me nuts. I'm sure in that I am not alone. I am fortunate to have a wonderful family and four amazing, young children, but it breaks my heart to have to tell them when news isn't good. I always say \"it could be worse, don't worry, I'm strong\" then I hang up the phone and cry not knowing what I will have to tell them next. I put myself in my parents shoes, my oldest brother had cancer many years ago (he is fine now) and then there's me, will I ever be able to honestly tell them I am fine? Why do they have to go through this again? I can't imagine the pain you must have when your child calls and tells you they have cancer, let alone TN Stage IV. OK, OK....sorry got off on a rant there. .... At any rate, I am hoping that if I can get more consecutive treatments without breaks I can continue on this regimen. My onc did mention she is going to see if these areas can be radiated...does anyone know about that? She said it's every day, but didn't seem to know the duration. My oncs office is over an hour away, so not exactly the most convenient, but I'd give anything to get these nodes clear. I have never been NED. I pray to someday be there with you! These nodes have waxed and waned for years. Kaayborg....funny (or not so funny story about phlebitis). I was playing with a hoola hoop with my kids and swung it around my arm...the next day my arm swelled up like a balloon full of huge marbles. I called my onc and they thought I had lost my mind, so I called a national cancer institute and they said \"sounds like phlebitis, take some ibuprophen\", but it took almost 2 months to go down. No more hoola hooping on my arms. I ended up with a port before my 3rd treatment. At my second they tried to do an IV for 7 pokes, that pretty much did me in, then the burning sensation up my arm was enough. I set up the port as soon as possible. Rosieo my onc currently has me getting PET/CT scans every 3 months. It is very controversial, but from what I read pretty normal. My previous onc didn't do any, nor blood work which was not to my benefit as it was only by luck during a fertilty examination (we were transferring embryos) that we found out I had met bc to an ovary. Characteristics were completely opposite of my original dx. Lots of losses all the way around. I am so, so grateful for your replies.",

I can not give you advice because every child and every family is different I think you really need to gage your children, but I can certainly tell you what has worked (at least I think for now) for us. Our children are young 6,8,10,12 and I believe some of them could probably process things better than others, but the truth is I don't talk to them about the \"d\" word\u2026I talk to them about living. I talk to them about hope and believing in ourselves, our faith and treatments to come. I don't want to burden them with the \"what ifs\" before need be. Maybe that is not what would work for you, but I don't think anything I have said to them is dishonest. Being a control freak, this works well\u2026I can control if and when that conversation happens and what the content will be. Now, if they asked me directly, I would have to be as honest as their emotions can comprehend. In our case, my children have gone through the first time with us, losses of embryos, postponed adoptions, more cancer, it has been a never ending rollercoaster, so for now, I can get my treatments, keep it somewhat under control (though I wish that were better), make them meals, treat them well and love them to the moon and back\u2026\u2026that's what I will do and that is what they need to know. Regardless of everything, I love them and they need to have faith beyond measure. I hope this helps. I know someone wrote this above about pity parties\u2026.go there to visit, just don't live there\u2026.that's how I feel about the \"d\" word. I can stress myself out about it, but not for long. On a separate note, I think I will post this elsewhere under a different topic possibly, but I wanted to ask you all a couple things. I had my treatments yesterday, and my oncologist discussed a couple things with me as the last Pet said \"slow progression\" . In the past when I have had nodes waxing and waning, it was a problem with the characteristics with the \"c\", so I was asking her about getting a biopsy. She mentioned to me that once you are dx with Triple Negative, the characteristics never change, they can never go back to positive. Have you ever heard of that? Also she mentioned radiation\u2026has anyone ever had radiation on nodes and how long does it last? She also mentioned about rather than getting Gem/Carb on day 1 and Gem alone on day 8, she is considering giving me gem/carb day 1 (a split dose) and the same gem/carb on day 8\u2026..she thinks this might help with my counts\u2026even my neutrophil count was only 1.0 barely made it yesterday as that is the cut off for treatment. Argh!!! Just curious to see if anyone has any suggestions. Many thanks. PS, Texasrose53. Having just received a not great scan myself, I know your frustration. I wish you great success with your new chemo. ",

My first round of treatment didn't work...so I was put on Gemzar/Carbo. After the first 3 months the scan showed I was responding and some of the areas were gone or getting smaller with less uptake. (Yippee) Now, 3 months after that scan, it showed slow progression, nodes are bigger and showing more uptake. I've been through this before with nodes that were \"waxing and waning\". I know that we are \"living with this disease\" and rest assured I am grateful for every day, but I feel like I am on an emotional rollercoaster and I am dragging my poor family along for this ride. Part of me wants to just not tell them because I know it hurts them so deeply that they can't fix this for me. I had a pity party for about 3 minutes (with myself), then decided that maybe this is the new normal. Can any of you tell me if this infact is the new normal? Has anyone else had a treatment only work for a short period of time? Has anyone not had Gemzar/Carbo not work? What did they do for you after that? I'm scared as I know this is a good drug regimen and I have tolerated it well...physically well, now my counts are a whole other story...there have been many days I could not get treatment due to counts being off and having to get a transfusion, but I felt fine. I also thought that the fact that I wasn't able to get many of my treatments over the past 3 months could have contributed to \"progression\", but how scary is that....this disease is that destructive that a few missed treatments could cause such havoc. I don't know what is coming next, what my oncologist will suggest...she didn't even know when I spoke to her today. Any advice would be so appreciated.",
