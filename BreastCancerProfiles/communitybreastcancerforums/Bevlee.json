It's the elusive Bevlee... sending love and healing vibes to all.   RE: the link I posted above - my sister posted it on my facebook page, I cry every time I watch it.  It is a girl called Megan Kozlowski (think I spelt surname wrong), made her own music video about chemo.. AWESOME!  RE: deoderants.. I have used a natural salt stick for the last 2 years - ironically, I stopped using the aluminium based ones for fear of breast cancer!  Must try the baking soda too...  RE: terrible things people say about our BC..  A friend (or not) of 30 years who I would have put in my top 5 and I see regularly - well, until the day before DX has avoided me for the 3 months since.  My daughter saw him and told him to go and see me and his reply was.. \"I don't cope well with people who are dying!!!\"  I cannot believe it!!!  and yes.. he is off my Christmas list. RE:  what may have caused my BC.. I believe it may have been the Royal Jelly capsules I have taken for the past 23 years.. it is a bee product and very great for you - BUT it elevates estrogen levels.  So, no more of that!  Dam it, I loved that!  and if it wasn't that, my hippy friends believe I haven't nurtured myself enough in the past few years (surrounded by needy men) and could have been happier.  There is a great book by Louise Hay called, 'You Can Heal Your Life'.. it's amazing! Has anyone heard of vitamin B17 (laetrile) .. some say it is bogus, but many with credentials say it is an amazing preventative and cure for cancer and pain reliever.  Found in apricot kernals.  The doctor who developed 'cyclophosphamide' (one of my chemo drugs) who is a well respected specialist of many years, investigated 'laetrile' and he says that it works better than chemo!  I found this news very frustrating, as I am having chemo - but thought, well, I can include this in my diet afterwards...  The powers that be in the multi million dollar cancer industry discredit anyone who agrees, hmmmmm..    anywayz.. I could go on and describe how it actually works if anyone is interested....? I know I do not post very often.. I do however read what you ladies are talking about and want to respond, but then my internet connection drops out after about 10 - 15 minutes.  That really sucks cos it takes me at least that long to catch up on what you guys are saying.. Gotta get that fixed. Hey, how's this for awesome..  my wonderful friends in my local community had a fund raiser and have raised over $500 for me to help pay for petrol to get to rads for 6 weeks (as I have to travel 100km each way)..  I am so overwhelmed by their love and support...  and about 20 of them have shaved their heads!!!  HA! HA! Well, I better get off of here, it's 2.20am and I gotta screen print 70 t-shirts tomorrow, before chemo Thursday.  Sending lots of love to all of you wonderful warrior women.  Stay strong ladies XXX Bevlee",
