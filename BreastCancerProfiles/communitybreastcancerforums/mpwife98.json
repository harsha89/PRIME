My mammogram was useless to me because of my level of density and I have under the muscle implants so on ultrasound the radiologist & tech couldn't pick up my lump in my right breast (left hasn't been attempted yet - long story) because of my tissue being compressed between the muscle and skin. Perhaps some of the other women can shed some light on why your's wouldn't pick up on ultrasound.  ",
