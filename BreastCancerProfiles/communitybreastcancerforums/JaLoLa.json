She asked me to find my lump (it's on my R breast, 10:00) and she was able to feel it too, she asked if I thought it was around the size of a pea. And she wrote \"ARAD 10:00-11:00\" on my ultrasound. She used 2 different transducers. Has anyone had the same thing? I think they might be comparing this scan to my last to see if its a cyst? Any input would be appreciated.",

I applaud your message because to them we might be just another ultrasound, mammogram or biopsy but to us it is a life changing, terrifying test and simple human decency and a little empathy would be appreciated.  I wish you luck with everything in the future. ",

I had an U/S and it came back normal. Then for some reason, shortly after I had a second U/S, which came back with a fibroglandular ridge of tissue.  I recently had a pelvic exam and the doctor did a breast exam, found a lump in the opposite breast. She ordered a bi-lateral ultrasound. She told me I had dense breasts and was not a candidate for mammography (I'm 27 btw). Today I got the results and it says all is normal. So my question is, did the fibraglandular ridge somehow disappear or do radiologists not have to mention that on an ultrasound report?  I hate doctor vague-ness. I am so grateful things appear fine, but these last US results just seem like laziness.  Please weigh in. I'd truly appreciate it.  Log in to post a reply",

I have seen some posts where women with dense breast tissue find out years later they had cancer all along that was difficult to diagnose. I am not looking for the cancer to be there. I would just hate to know I didn't explore all my options when I first found it. I would love LOVE to hear from other women with fibroglandular tissue.  Thanks ",
