I had CT scan and heart scan (both normal thankfully!) tomorrow I am getting a fill-up in my expander and I am getting my hair cut. It's quite long so will take it up past my shoulders so I can get fitted for a wig next week. Happy to read that first time treatments are going well so far! Fingers crossed that it continues! Everything is info overload from the prescriptions to the side effects and to the prescreening tests and scans. Exhausted but finally feeling ready to do this. We can do this! Xo",

I'm also thinking of having my \"good breast\" removed. My surgeon does not believe it is necessary and I have some time to decide but would love to hear others reasonings on the decision. I just feel mentally it will be difficult to go for mammograms etc and the constant fear and possible regret. Before radiation we have decided to do an axillary node removal. When I had my mastectomy they only removed my 3 sentinel nodes and 2 had cancer so we feel it is best to go in and get the rest. So more surgery and drain at the end of April and then radiation after that! I was really hoping to be done by the summer! Summer I hope you have recovered from your port removal. So sorry you had to go through that! Congrats Hopefull",

I can't wait to get some hair back. Thanks for the heads up on the numbness Gingko. That is a SE I have not yet heard about but glad it seems to be resolving. Regarding anxiety and sleep, I was prescribed Ativan when I was initially diagnosed. That has gotten me through many anxious nights and helps me sleep. Another name for it is Lorazepam. I would be open to edibles too and I know some people rely on it during chemo for pain and anxiety. I feel like I am managing ok for now. I have smoked before and I remember feeling dizzy and I don't want to feel dizzy or dopey. I find the chemo does that well enough! But I would loveto hear about anyone's experience.",

I'm like you and I have never been really anxious or needed a lot of support but these are extraordinary circumstances. I really find speaking to others like you guys the best support.

I have been forcing myself to not do any reading or research on bc at night before bed since it was making me anxious and I was having trouble sleeping. Seems to be working better for me :) My next 3 treatments will be Taxol starting Feb 15. I have been chatting with others and trying to prepare. I'm encouraged with some of your posts. The general impression I have is that it is tougher than the other chemo in terms of aches and pains and neuropathy. I'll be soaking my fingers and toes in ice. Apparently it is easier with cotton gloves and socks as a barrier between the ice. Hope that helps! My last nurse also said I wouldn't need to suck on ice chips for mouth sores but it sounds like it might help? I have developed a serious aversion to ice since I have been sucking on ice for each treatment. It makes me gag and want to throw up! I can't even have ice in my drinks at the moment. But if it will help I will try for my next treatments. (Out of all the things to make me feel sick, imagine ice cubes!!!). I have had no mouth sores to date, just the terrible taste in my mouth that eventually fades before the next treatment. I'm still confused about the dark polish for nails. My nails won't be exposed to the sun either way so I think I will try skipping the polish. I'm mosturizing my hands, nails and cuticles a lot and maybe that is more helpful? I find my skin had been getting more and more dry! Jezikah did you soak your fingers and toes in ice??",

My husband, son and family plus friends are heading to Mexico for vacation. There will be 15 people and I can't go. We booked it before I was diagnosed.

Jezikah sorry you are feeling crummier for longer but yay for Vegas! That will be a nice break before #6 - your final treatment? My last is #6 on March 29. Bring it. Summer - green mucus could be an infection. Best to get it checked out! You might not be feeling the other typical symptoms with other drugs you are on.

I have heard different opinions in that it doesn't matter which side but I have also heard lymphedema can be a risk no matter how many nodes etc. Hopefully yours resolves. Are you also doing radiation? Welcome CCNC. Hope things improve for you. It's so hard to weigh the benefit vs the risks of all these drugs. We literally have our lives in the hands of our MOs. Weight gain ugh! It seems so unfair. My appetite has been crazy about 3-4 days after chemo and eating helps with nausea. I'm afraid to watch the scale.Trying to continue with healthy fruits, vegetables and protein but carbs are my friend during chemo. I have given in to them as I feel better and will do my best to exercise and hope the weight will come off after. We are good timing since most of us should be finishing early spring right?

I have two Taxotere treatments left on Mar 8 and Mar 29. Bring it on! I tolerated the first Taxotere fairly well. My eyelashes and brows are very thin now and my eyes water quite a bit. This just started! My tongue barely has any tastebuds. I have had some ringing in my ears and some pain in my neck which felt like my lymph nodes. I'm meeting with my MO on Monday. I'm also going through rads. My tumour was 2cm and I had 2 positive nodes. Not sure when it starts but I'm not having additional surgery until my final reconstruction surgery which could be a year from now. Anyone else going through rads with an expander(s)? I'm a bit nervous as there could be a lot of tightening etc and then a long wait until final implant placement. I'm just excited to get my hair back! Ugh I hate looking like a freaking alien. I have been researching and it seems that most people have hair growth about 4 weeks after finishing chemo. Fingers crossed! Congrats Hopfull2 and Gmmiph! All finished chemo. Amazing!! I suspect many of us will finish in March also. Yay! Pamela - glad your lymphedema is improving and your water retention is resolving. Thanks also for the diet info. I love steamed broccoli but will also try raw (even through I much prefer cooked!) Jezikah - glad you had a nice time away. Enjoy Vegas!! Irishmom - sorry about the hearing loss. That is really scary and I'm glad your MO is taking it so seriously. Can they reduce via eliminate your doses? Either way it's good to know you are through the most effective treatment and then you will have rads so any stray cells won't have a chance! Scaredashell I'm right behind you.

Bring it! Good luck with rads! Lordhelpme I am also taking Ativan. I find it helps a lot but I try not to take it every night since it apparently won't work as well if you take it too often. My dr wants me off of it once I am finished treatments but that will be difficult since my mind goes to dark places at night and I can't imagine that will end. Good luck to everyone finishing their last treatments this week and next.We did it!",

Scaredashell and Jezikah sorry about the neuropathy. I really hope over time it improves. Jezikah sorry about the nails also. I keep reading that nails, eyebrows and lashes can fall off even a month or two post chemo :( For those of you with teeth sensitivity I have also experienced this. My teeth were sensitive before and it also looks like my gums have further receded since chemo. I have a dental check up next week to see what the damage is! Not wanting to be scraped and poked but my dentist said it's good to do a check up soon after chemo. They better be gentle!! Is anyone considering a cleanse post chemo? I have started doing a bit of research and have been considering.",

I found a lump one week ago and have since had an ultra sound and mammogram. I am bi rad 5 and most likely dealing with cancer. The size is under 2cm so hoping that the stage is early. I will be getting a biopsy and other testing at some point next week. I am most paranoid about my lymph nodes and whether or not the cancer has spread. I have had an ache under my arm and am fearing the worst even though the ultra sound showed my lymph nodes of normal size. Every ache and pain in my body sets me off. Just looking for support and any similar experiences anyone can share. I'm 42, married and have a 7 year old son. Lots of support around me but hoping to connect with others going through similar experience.

I have only told people that are close to me since and have given the heads up to my workplace letting them know that there is still a slight chance. Ativan is helping me sleep which is great. Now I need to get through the weekend is if all is a-ok! Thanks so much for your responses! Hope you have great weekends.",

Trying to prep for information overload, telling people, surgery, treatment options. It's overwhelming. I think it is good to weigh your options as there is a lot to consider especially being a single mom. Hope you have a lot of support around you to help with the decisionsand help with your children. All the best and hope that you are on the road to recovery very soon.",
