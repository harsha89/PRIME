I recently re-connected with a friend after 13 years and discovered she, too, had breast cancer, diagnosed 2008. She still thinks about it often. I guess we have to get used to the new us. On the bright side, I do think about it less than when first diagnosed. Small steps!!!",

Generally, driving should not be a problem and there will be days when you feel almost normal. I hope someone comes along who has done/is doing chemo with young kids at home to tell their story, and give some insight into what it might be like. But noone reacts the same way to chemo.

The only way to know is when you visit your oncologist and find out what is your treatment plan. I advise you to join a chemo group - a new one starts up every month as people get their treatment plans.

When I checked in I was asked had I taken my \"prep\". What prep, I was just told no food or drink after midnight -easy peasy. So the tech mixed up almost a liter of artificial lemon flavored stuff and said it takes a couple of hours to work so we'll do your MRI first. I worked really hard at not moving and not being freaked out in the tube. I sang songs in my head and recited multiplication tables (!) and then she pulled me out. She was having computer problems and needed to reboot. Of course this meant she had to start over with me. After a break on to the C/T scan. The tech had trouble getting the IV in and sent for the nurse. Told me I might want to burp with the crystal stuff, but try not to. When he injected the contrast he said you might feel a warm flush and some people feel like they need to pee, but you won't. Well I did feel like that and had to check to make sure I hadn't pee-ed. Back home and I'm sitting with my laptop checking out the posts and I'm passing gas (those burps?) and I think oh sh$t - literally. I dash to the bathroom with new undies. Sheesh. It's a long time since I pooped my pants. Anybody have loose bowel reactions to C/T fluids? Nobody warned me about it. I'm glad I was home!! otobehealthy - I get my port on the 15th too. Do you have a start date for chemo? I don't yet as I still have scans to do next week. I'll keep thinking good thoughts for all you ladies about to get/just had/recovering from chemo.",

My foot hurt so much I went to the doca. Was there 2 hours plus and I have broken three little bones in my foot and am now lugging around a big boot. Took a nap for 21/2 hours and still managed to nap watching tv in the evening. They also did a blood draw thinking perhaps low RBC that made me keel over. But that was ok.However my WBC was very low, but I don't know if that is normal as I usually only get a blood draw right before tx and it has been fine so far. So really no idea what went on. I was up with a headache in the night and a fever, but ok after tylenol. So today is work day 2. I am going but feel like there will be very little I can do. Pauldingmom - I have hired teachers to take care of all our sessions at preschool. I will just be an extra when I'm up to it and take care of the business end. Up till this week I felt like I could do alot so hoping I'm done with bad days and I'm on the way up today. Oh yes - I get the weepy eyes now too. That and my constant runny nose, I dread to think what I look like!! Hoping for little or no SEs for all",

I have finally got appointments for my scans and they are spread out from July 9 - 17, and then back to the oncologist July 21. I had been hoping to start chemo July 14 but obviously that is not possible. I thought I was having a port put in on Wednesday but found out today this is just a pre appointment. Everything is taking so long - a penalty for living in a rural area. At this rate I might have to join the August chemo thread - just when I'm getting to know \"my\" group! Is there anybody else not got started yet? Thinking good thoughts for you all.",

I was put under deep sedation rather than a general and was told I might hear things, but I was out like a light. Michelle - I am having a little trouble swallowing on the port side.

I have to say this port is more painful than the surgery for lumpectomy/nodes. I think the different anaesthesia just knocked for a loop.I slept hours during the day and then all night even though I woke up many times, but that is normal. However it is done now and hopefully I can get started with chemo soon.

Sitting in its little net nest it looks like a guinea pig. I'll have to make sure the cat doesn't get it. I have always thought of myself as being red headed, though its got lighter over the years as the grey creeps in but now I am strawberry blond (well my wig is) - sounds much more glamorous. I keep putting off a short haircut until closer to chemo time and then I'll take the wig with me and get it sorted out. I think it's going to get to July 28 before I get my first chemo. I know it will be a Tuesday as I want to be on the Tuesday rotation and so be able to get infusions at our local hospital (5 minutes away) when the cancer clinic comes. But even if that doesn't happen and it ends up in August I am still going to be a July ********. This is where I belong.",

With DD I believe the thinking is that you only have 14 days to recover so we might as well give those white blood cells a boost. I have a question about all the fluids we are supposed to drink. I was recommended 3 liters per day. Now does this apply every day (I understand it can do me no harm, but...) or only on chemo days and a couple of days after? It is hard to imagine doing it everyday, but perhaps that is why you more experienced gals mention different ways to drink fluids.",

If all goes according to plan, I will finish chemo on October 27,(half way through right now) just a few days before my birthday (55) and I have decided I'm going to throw a party. I'll still have rads to get through, but the end of chemo sounds like a good enough reason to celebrate. For anyone interested. I'm still lugging my boot around. I don't know why I say \"still\", it's only 21/2 weeks. Had my foot re-xrayed this week, doing fine, back in four weeks. The soles of my feet have been a bit sore the past few days. Anyone have that?",

Though I don't think I could hold down a full time job. I own a preschool, and have hired teachers so that I don't have to be there. I try to go in every morning just to say to parents and children, then leave when I feel like it. I am still taking care of the business end, and shopping for snacks and supplies but am so pleased to be able to leave things in capable hands.

Dianne -  I live in rural ID and had to travel just 45minutes to see the oncologist. I will have my first chemo there to check on any adverse reactions etc. Then I can get treatment at our hometown hospital as the practice has a satelite clinic there once a week. It is a little scary trusting our rural doctors and hospitals. But DH has a surgeon relative who says chemo for bc is fairly standardized. They use computer algorithms to work out treatment. So we'll see. If there are connections with a big city hospital I don't know. I'll have to find out. My own kids have reacted very differently to my dx.The older son (21) wants to know everything that's going on, and is very comfortable talking about it. He has a good friend dx with cancer a couple of years ago and so is quite familiar with a lot of what goes on. My younger son (19) seems oblivious to the whole thing. But as I have only had surgery so far, recovering well and seemingly in very good health there isn't much for him to see as yet. I am trying to get a handle on our July people and have noticed that there are several people who have only posted here once or not been on for a while. Do you see them on other threads?

Like you, I would love for nose hairs to return - I am sick of constantly wiping my nose. On the positive side, I am definitely less tired now than when on chemo. Have a good day everyone.",

My cheek numbness is gone as is that in fingers (though I am losing some nails), I can taste food again. The 5 pounds weight I have put on can attest to that. I am less tired and just feel good!!! Also I am almost at the end of rads - just 4 more boosts to go with skin doing really well. And finally - my hair has started to grow! It is so pale it's hard to see but I can feel it. DH rubs his hand over every morning and tells me how much there is. So before you know it you really will feel better. I'll be thinking of you with the last of the taxol.",

Should I be concerned about going through security? Do they make you take hats off? Can't remember!!!",
