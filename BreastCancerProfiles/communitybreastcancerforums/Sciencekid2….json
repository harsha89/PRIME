I just wanted to post and let you know what happened after my ultrasound today (and hopefully help someone else with the same symptoms as me)! The physician said that there was nothing concerning on the ultrasound and that I could rest easy but that I should come back if the lump grows or becomes painless! Thank you, mustlovepoodles and Egads007, for being so supportive and reassuring. You've helped my mother even more than me because she was extremely distressed the past few months. My heart truly goes out to those who are unable to hear this good news but I am so grateful for this wonderful community. Not to make this post too long and cheesy but this scare has certainly been a learning experience. As someone who is trying to get into medical school, I'm always on overdrive but I've realized that life is so precious AND its fleeting. To anyone reading this, do not sweat the little things. School, work, finances...though they're all important, their significance doesn't compare to that of your loved ones, your health and general happiness. We often only notice these simple treasures when we feel that they'll be taken away from us altogether. As the age old saying goes, stop and smell the roses! Thank you so much mustlovepoodles and Egads007 for sharing your wisdom and kindness and just the right moment. May God bless you all. <3 <3 <3",

When I visited my physician, though she didn't express any concern, she never gave me a clear understanding of why I'm experiencing these symptoms. Either way, thank you so much for taking the time to reply! You certainly put me at ease and right now, any form of reassurance is extremely helpful!",

I'll keep that in mind. Your words are very reassuring and I'm becoming more convinced that it could simply be a cyst but the fact that the tissue in the left side feels thicker is still worrying me. Do either of you ladies (I'm assuming you're ladies) know if it would be a good idea to get a biopsy to confirm that the lump is benign? From what I've learned in school, ultrasounds can only visualize something filled with fluid. If the mass in my breast is not a cyst, but some other fibrous mass, I'm not sure how effective an ultrasound would be at detecting malignancy. I know biopsies can be painful and invasive but I'd take that over losing my sanity! Thank you so much to both of you again!!!",
