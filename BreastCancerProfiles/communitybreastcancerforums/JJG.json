Like you I have dimpling on my right breast its only evident when i raise my arms and like you are very worried. My worries are the test I know they will do a mammogram but I'm concerned that, thats all they will do. I dont feel any lump and I have read that a mammogram does not always pick things up. I have been sent to Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup which has closed alot of departments I will keep my fingers crossed for you when you go to MRI. Your at one of the best Hospitals in the Country x",
