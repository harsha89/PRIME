I can't remember what all she told me- all I heard mainly was benign and not cancer! She mentioned fibrocystic changes and hyperplasia. I follow up with the surgeon in 3 months and have another mammogram in 6 months",

She immediately sent me to the breast center where I had a mammogram and ultrasound. Nothing was found where my pain was (and the pain has since resolved) ButThey have a radiologist that reads the mammograms immediately and they provide you with results before you leave. I had micro-calcifications that were a \"loose group of variable appearing calcifications\" my report also said they were indeterminate calcifications a biopsy was scheduled, and I had it on July 5th. Stereotactic guided vacuum assisted technique.... My mammogram after the biopsy showed that they removed all of the calcifications and the marker is in place. I was told by the breast health navigator nurse that my results would be in today (Friday 7/8) However she called me this morning and told me the results were not back yet, but she still expected them today. I'm on pins and needles waiting for that phone call! I am PRAYING hard they call me today, I even took off work today, just in case of bad news because I didn't want to get that phone call at work. :( Just looking for support and encouragement while I wait!!
