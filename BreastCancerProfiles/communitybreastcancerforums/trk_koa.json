The core needle will be guided by the ultrasound so that it goes directly into the suspicious tissue. So it depends how deep that suspicious tissue is. I had multiple tumors but they were very close to each other so they only went in from one spot. I remember being uncomfortable a bit and kept my eyes closed. I could see the monitor if I wanted, but I'm squeamish. I don't remember pain when the anesthetic wore off and I do not have a scar. Went home with just a band aid. Hope this helps, Nancy",

The wire itself was probably no thicker than a few strands of hair. It doesn't hurt being in there. I had about a two hourÂ delay waiting for the OR and with the gauze and tape over it, I wasn't even aware of it. I thought a core-needle biopsy was much more uncomfortable, to be honest. You have already braved that. I got good news about mine (B9 sclerosing adenosis) and hope you will be as fortunate. And once it is removed, it won't be there to worry about any more. Be sure to let us know what happens. We'll be thinking about you and sending good vibes your way.",
