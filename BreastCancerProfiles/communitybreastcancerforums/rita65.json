My cancer is ERpos PR neg and Hr neg. I will have 4 sessions of chemo with Taxotere and Cytoxan, if I do well on that onco will set me up for 2 more sessions of same.  It's a scary thing but even though I dread chemo I will be glad to get started to get this all behind me. Also the chem risk is worth the percentage that recurrence will be dropped to 8%.  Hang in there I know I will and be positive, we are all here to beat this thing.  Hugs God Bless",

The test is geared for your specific cells and onco can treat you with the right therapy for you.  If your insurance pays for it then have it because test the tumor itself after removal. Good Luck to you and all of us.  I intend to fight this fight with all that I have and stay positive!!!  No looking back at my Onco and my decision, just forward to live a long and healthy life. Hang in there, I will!!",
