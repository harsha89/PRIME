They want to wait until I'm a little further along. Its going to be a long 2 weeks.",

I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in Jan of 2013. I underwent a bilateral mastectomy in March of the same year. I've had ultrasounds of my left breast (cancer was in the right) every six months since due to some scar tissue that they wanted to keep an eye on. Up until now, everything has looked fine. I went in last week for my ultrasound and they found a lump with irregular borders that they want to do surgery and biopsy. They are thinking its just scar tissue that took a different shape, but I'm TERRIFIED to go through this again. To add to the stress of this, I'm 14 weeks pregnant and the thought of going under general anesthesia scares me so much. Has anyone ever had a biopsy on something like this and it ended up being scar tissue? This is the report from my visit last week. Thank you.

Well, a friend of mine is good friends with one of the top rated psychic mediums in my area (I\u2019ve never personally had a reading, but I\u2019ve never heard a single complaint) and told me to send her a messages asking what the feeling she\u2019s getting is on which way my results will go. So, I did just that. This is the reply I got. Now I\u2019m sitting here over thinking this. In a weird way, I\u2019m happy she said what she said bc I want to walk into that office on results day expectint the worst..that way I can\u2019t be totally crushed if I do recieve bad news, and estatic if I hear good news.

It went pretty good..I do have a small spot on my right \"breast\" where the blood flow isn't so good. It Looks like a reddish reallly dark bruise. He pushed on it with his finger and it change color, so he says there is still a small amount of blood flow to it..so we scheduled me to see him again next Wednesday to check on it. If the skin ends up dying, he said I'll have to go in for another small surgery and have that small section of skon cut out and stitche back up. He didnt seem too worried, all that's going to happen is my TE fillings will probably be pushed back a few weeks. The good news is I had 2 of 4 drains removed!!!! Dr said if the other 2 stay under 30 for the next 24-4& Hours I can call and have the other 2 removed Friday! I cannot tell you how excited I am to be drain free..I can't wait to shower! I have stayed as clean as I can other than smelly pits here and there due to not wearing deodorant ( scared it will infect my drains since they are so close to my armpit) but a hot shower will feel amazing over my chest! If anyone is wondering how it feels having the drains removed, it wasnt bad..it was a strong burning feeling..it did hurt a bit but nothing too bad! I have my appointment tomorrow with my oncologist so I'll post tomorrow about how that goes! Hope everyone is doing ok!",
