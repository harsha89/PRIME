I don't want to do the rad or tamoxifen.  I am also probably going to be tested for the BRCA gene and if that comes back positive, they will do a hysterectomy. I already had my uterus out in 2002 due to heavy menses, but the gyn left the ovaries.  I am so ready for surgery, just waiting  for the phone call for the date.  I want to get this over with and put this behind me.  I myself have very dense breasts.  They caught this on a screening mammo.  I am glad I do yearly mamms.  My onc dr thinks I am being a little too aggressive with a bl mast, but it is my decision and my body.  Don't let no one decide your decision, go with your gut, that is what I did.   Just stay positive and good luck with your decision.   hugs {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{mkd1061}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}",
