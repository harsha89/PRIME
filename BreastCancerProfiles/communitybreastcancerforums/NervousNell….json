My pains have not been consistent or even very bad. They actually seemed to have improved. The spot is still there though. I am so confused as to what is going on. Wish me luck!",

I too am having off and on pain and a little extra soreness on my right breast. I have had flat pinkish/purplish spot on my breast for almost 5 months. The surgeon thought it was hormones from nursing, I have quit nursing and it's still there. He now thinks it's vascular but he did a skin biopsy, I should find out results next week....3 weeks later....Just wanted to say you're not alone. Google has terrified me as well. Hang in there.",
