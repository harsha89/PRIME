You can get STD and LTD at the same time as SSDI, but SSDI doesn't pay until you have been disabled for 5 months. However, because of Social Security rules, the first check doesn't arrive until at least 30 days after you start receiving benefits. For example, my effective date of disability was 6/4/15 Benefits start 12/4/15 First check is due 1/4/16 but Social Security issues checks based on the day of the month you were born: 1st through 10th Second Wednesday 11th through 20th Third Wednesday After the 20th Fourth Wednesday My first check will arrive 1/27/16 Your STD benefit will be exhausted before this, but I would check with Social Security about how they handle the LTD. There's rules about \"Substantial Gain Activities\" and your LTD may be deducted from your SSDI payment. Still it's worth applying and getting approved for SSDI because of the effect it has on your Medicare eligibility. There are vocational rehab opportunities available to you and should you choose, you can do trial of work programs that allow you to return to work without losing your disability benefit or Medicare eligibility.",

As anticipated just a few years ago, physicians who care for anemic cancer patients have been facing a dilemma, whether to treat the anemic patient with an ESA, thereby potentially increasing the risk of worsening the malignancy, or to withhold ESA treatment, with resultant patient fatigue, reduced physical activity, increased hypoxic stress, and reliance on transfusion therapy. Primary tumors are not yet EPOR typed (like breast cancers are assessed for ER/PR expression) though this idea should be considered. There has been much discussion of EPO use in cancer patients, and several professional and regulatory organizations and authorities have issued various guidances. Perhaps, the following \"rule\" used by several clinicians interviewed by one of the authors should be considered. If the cancer patient is being treated with curative intent, avoid the use of ESAs. If the treatment plan is more conservative or palliative, consider ESAs for anemia treatment, but proceed with great caution",

It's something we never think about, but it costs money to work. I don't drive nearly as much as I used to. I used to spend $50 per week for gas. Since I no longer have to go to work every day, the amount I spend on gas is minimal. A tank of gas lasts me over a month, depending on doctor's appointments. Because I was so busy, I seldom had time to cook and I used to eat out a lot. Now, I have time to cook my own food (better for my health), and my food costs have gone down. If your disability pays you 60% of your salary, remember that is 60% of your pre-tax dollars. For me, that meant I received nearly as much money as I used to get after taxes and deductions for health insurance and disability insurance. So I didn't feel like I was getting less money and I certainly was spending less. My disability was more than I will receive from SSDI in January. But working part-time will make up for some of this lost income and I will be ok. I've worked in long-term care during my nursing career, and it happens to almost everyone if you live long enough - you will develop health problems, retire and will need financial assistance. Most of us won't have acquired enough assets to cover our expenses. We will need to apply for Medicaid and Medicare (working with people right now who used to be engineers and college professors - and they are on Medicaid and Medicare). I have been fortunate enough to work in the administrative side of healthcare and it taught me how and when to apply for these programs. These are your safety nets and they are there for you to use. I just look at this as a new chapter in my life. It's an opportunity to get involved in the things that I enjoy and enhance my spiritual growth. I have a neighbor who is my age and he is retired. He's very involved with his church and because it's the holidays, he goes to local nursing homes and provides entertainment to the residents. He gets to do things in the service of others and it keeps him active and involved in his community. It's really up to you. But leaving full-time employment isn't a loss. It's an opportunity for growth.",

      "Content": "Dec 25, 2015 12:21PM pwilmarth wrote: Those are interesting articles and worth reading. Everyone who is contemplating taking disability should read them. My concern is that these articles are quite intimidating for the average person and create needless anxiety. As a practical matter, it's not difficult to navigate the system. Everything is automated and you receive letters informing you of your rights every step along the way. I can tell you from experience with the healthcare system on the financial side of things that most people who don't have insurance don't understand how the system works. Because we are a long-term care provider, we deal with the Medicaid process all the time. Some people will be fortunate enough to have some assets before they need Medicaid and will have to do what we call \"spend downs\". How much this is depends on the state you live in. But you can get this information from you state's Healthcare Policy and Financing department. The main point I want to make is that eventually everyone can qualify for Medicaid, regardless of your financial situation. If this weren't the case, we would have many people over the age of 65 who have no insurance coverage at all. This would also be the case for people over the age of 50 who develop health problems. And yet, I've worked with many people between the ages of 50 to 65 who are disabled due to health problems (not necessarily cancer) who are fully eligible through Medicaid and have all of their financial needs met. They aren't wealthy, but they are not homeless or lacking basic necessities like food and clothing. Most people who are not working will meet the poverty level requirement. Unless you have amassed a large sum of money, you won't be able to afford COBRA benefits or be able to afford your own coverage. Because of the nature of cancer treatment, most healthcare plans in The Marketplace simply don't provide enough coverage and you will still have large copays - especially for standard things like PET scans and MUGA scans. I was quoted a copay of $250 for each of these scans with the highest coverage plan they had. With financial assistance, I would still have to pay $500.month for insurance coverage (and I was only paying $350/month through my employer). It's always good if you have a spouse who has an employer sponsored plan and you can receive coverage under their plan. However, some employers of smaller companies are finding that providing health insurance coverage for dependents is too expensive and are dropping that benefit. So your spouse may not be able to get benefits for you. The other thing I would bear in mind that, if you are married, some assets may be excluded because of spousal protection. For example, owning a house. Your spouse must still have a place to live. One mistake that people make is that they think they can give away assets to family members before they apply for Medicaid. If you are thinking about doing this, DON'T. It will disqualify you for Medicaid for five years. My employer sponsored plan was through Kaiser Permanente and when my coverage ended, I received notice from both my employer and KP. This qualifies as a \"triggering event\". Kaiser Permanente is a large enough organization that they have licensed advisors to speak to about my options. When I told her about my personal situation and explained to her that their Marketplace plan was inadequate to meet my needs, she transferred me to the appropriate organization that handles Medicaid for my state. Everything happened on the phone. One thing I would recommend is to talk to someone at your cancer center about applying for Medicaid. They usually have social workers and these professionals are used to helping people navigate the system. As far as finding providers, you will receive a list of providers available to you in your area. But if you are being treated at a large cancer center, they most likely accept Medicaid and the transition from one type of insurance coverage to another will be pretty smooth. Their billing department will do all of the grunt work. Because of computers, they can access information about your eligibility through the Medicaid portal. And frankly, most hospitals take Medicare and Medicaid. If you live in an area with a large university hospital, you should be able to find a provider - and you will get the best healthcare available, because teaching hospitals provide the best care from the leading researchers in the country. My own experience with the healthcare system is that Medicare and Medicaid provide the best coverage available. What most lay people don't understand is that the Federal government regulates anyone who accepts Medicare and Medicaid through the Center for Medicare/Medicaid. Nearly every question you have about Medicare or Medicaid eligibility can be answered by researching their website.",

One of the things I would suggest is you start with a document called The Five Wishes. It's less intimidating. Most of the Advance Directive forms that you see used by hospitals and nursing homes are solely directed at the technical aspects of end-of-life care. This document is more personal and humane. Then have a discussion with the person who you designate as your decision-maker. And the suggestion about including a clergy member is good - but social workers are very skilled with helping people finish these forms. I would also like to say that you shouldn't think of completing this form as an automatic assumption that you are going to die. The treatment for MBC has gotten so much better and it may be years before the document is needed. But the discussion with your family is very important. ",

In Colorado, it's called the MOST form and has been used by hospitals and nursing homes for several years. The basic concepts in it are also covered in The Five Wishes but the MOST or POLST form is legally binding for healthcare professionals and was developed to help members of the healthcare team know what \"rules\" to follow when dealing with seriously ill or life-threatening situations. As you can imagine, end-of-life care is an emotionally charged situation where a caregiver walking into a situation needs guidance about what to do. Prior to these forms, the assumption was a nurse or paramedic always administered CPR/Advanced Life Support unless there was a physician's order stating not to. And for paramedics transporting a patient to the ER, advanced directives were not legally binding. The paramedics were required to administer CPR/Advanced Life Support. Now, we are required to follow the MOST or POLST form. There was a well-publicized incident involving an assisted living center where the caregivers called 911 but wouldn't administer CPR at the request of the 911 operator. It created a lot of negative publicity on the Internet and people assumed that the caregivers were negligent for not administering CPR. It turns out that the patient and the family didn't want CPR administered by the caregivers. But licensed caregivers live in fear of lawsuits and the potential for legal actions against their licenses for not acting according to the patient's wishes, regardless of which side of the question the patient is on. The chances are, if you enter a healthcare facility, they will ask you to sign a POLST Form or MOST form because it's considered a physician's order. But it still is based solely on the technical aspects of end-of-life care and not the personal side, where the patient gets to tell people what they want while they are dying. ",

For example, my lab reports a normal range as 5-40 for an AST, 5-50 for an ALT and 0.1-1.5 for a bilirubin. These are the tests that Genentech recommends for monitoring your liver. Genentech then makes recommendations for dosing your Kadcyla based on something called ULN (which means upper limits of normal). I have had 6 doses of Kadcyla, and my bilirubin and ALT have remained in the normal range and pretty stable. My AST did rise to 50 after my first dose, but has remained stable until this last dose, where it went up to 61. Both of those numbers are outside of the \"normal level\" reported by my lab. However, Genentech doesn't recommend making any changes in the dose until we reach 5 times the upper range of normal. Should that happen, the dose will be held until my labs return to 2 times the upper range of normal and the drug will be restarted at a lower dose This becomes a serious issue if your lab results are 20 times the upper range of normal. That's when they will stop the treatment",

      "Content": "Dec 11, 2015 04:32AM pwilmarth wrote: Here is my experience with work and disability: I knew I had breast cancer before my first doctor's appointment. Since I hadn't been officially diagnosed yet, I told my boss that I would need time off for surgery. So I went on a medical leave of absence in December of last year. I simply was having too much trouble concentrating at work, and I had a demanding, stressful job. After I was diagnosed, it was a month before they were able to schedule me for surgery. I wouldn't have been able to do my job anyway because of the exhaustion I was having, so I spent time resting (I slept a lot) and making plans for what I knew would be a long journey through cancer treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Much of that included simplifying my life and getting rid of those things that I felt I couldn't manage anymore. I sold my house (a big two-story, three bedroom house) and moved into a one bedroom apartment. After my surgery in January, I went back to work in February and felt good, but chemotherapy started in February. I managed to work full-time through chemotherapy but had many days after my infusions (which were every three weeks) when I was barely functional. Much of my job required using my brain and I definitely had \"chemo\" brain, as well as exhaustion from the effects of chemo. Near the end of chemotherapy, I developed peripheral neuropathy. Part of the requirements of my job included the possibility of having to cover other departments when staffing shortages required it. The demands of those jobs required me to able to stand on my feet for long periods of time (8 to 12 hours per day), My boss had kept me out of that requirement while I was on chemotherapy but he had plans to put me back into the mix. With the neuropathy, I would not have been able to do that without severe pain. And I was still facing radiation therapy with daily treatments for five weeks and the exhaustion that comes with it. I had always known that taking disability was an option and the stress of the job I was in made that option attractive to me. I had short-term disability benefits, but I am 61 years old and approaching the age when taking Social Security benefits was an option. Since I'm a nurse, I often receive flyers about various educational seminars. One of them came from a licensed social worker about palliative care and it dealt with some of these issues around spiritual and emotional distress. When we're faced with stage IV breast cancer, much of our thinking needs to be directed towards Quality of Life. And trying to maintain full-time employment in this stressful job that often required me to work 12 hours a day was directly impacting the quality of my life. With some encouragement from a co-worker, I looked into Social Security benefits. I wouldn't qualify for normal social security benefits until I am 62. However, if I took disability, I could stop working and I would receive $500/month more than if I waited until I was 62 to retire. This was very close to the amount of money I would receive at age 66 (full retirement age). And disability benefits automatically convert to normal Social Security at age 66 with no loss in income. In addition, by taking disability this year, I would be eligible for Medicare in two years instead of waiting until I am age 65. It turns out that a diagnosis of Metastatic Breast Cancer is an automatic qualifier for disability benefits. And the whole application process is expedited - you know within 10 days of submitting your application if you are approved (which I was). But there are some caveats - you have to stop working (or limit your income to less than $1090 per month) for five months. Your first check won't arrive until 6 months after your effective date of disability. So you have to have a financial cushion to carry you through those first 6 months. For me, part of that money came from the sale of my house. Part of it came from an old IRA account. The rest of it came from using my short-term disability insurance (which covers you for 22 weeks - just long enough to cover you until Social Security comes in). The other issue is health insurance. While I was receiving short-term disability, my employer still provided me with health insurance. Once the short-term disability stopped, the coverage for health insurance stopped. The cost of insurance through my COBRA provider would be $700/month - something that on a fixed income I would never be able to afford. That sent me to The Marketplace, to try to find a less expensive plan. They ask you about your taxable income for 2015 and your projected taxable income for 2016. Even though I've barely worked this year (four months), I still had a fair amount of income and with financial assistance, I was still looking at paying $500/month for insurance. I always understood that at some point, I would need Medicaid. Social Security disability means you are eligible for Medicaid. When I spoke to The Marketplace person, she transferred me to Connect for Health Colorado, which is the entity that deals with Medicaid applications through The Marketplace. Over the phone, we completed a Medicaid application - and I was approved and received my Medicaid card two weeks after the application. I did have to go to the local Human Services department with proof of citizenship and a Social Security Number, but now all is in place. With Medicaid in place, I have much better medical coverage. I used to have $35 copays for all the specialist appointments through my employer's health plan - now I pay $2. I recently had cataract surgery and my copay was $1. I went on disability in June of this year. Without the stress of a full-time job, the quality of my life has improved 1000%. I returned to work, but in a limited capacity - just one day per week and no prolonged standing. It's therapeutic for me to work one day per week and provides me with some extra money. I still enjoy visiting with my coworkers and most of them seem to feel inspired by my journey with breast cancer. But I'm not working enough to disqualify me from disability. Overall, the decision to take disability was a good one. ",

The study design was docetaxel, Herceptin and Perjeta. There was never any conclusions about stopping this regimen in the metastatic setting. There isn't an oncologist out there who can tell you whether it's safe or not safe to stop this treatment. In this particular treatment regimen, the drug that is most responsible for neuropathy is docetaxel. And I developed neuropathy on that drug. But the goal isn't to stay on that drug forever, just 6 doses. The hope is that your nerves will recover after the docetaxel is stopped. My nerves got better, but it's been over a year and I still have neuropathy. Some days are better and some days are worse. Since the release of the results of the CLEOPATRA study, oncologists have looked at using Herceptin and Perjeta in other treatment settings, including the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. In these cases they would use a carboplatin and the goal might be 12 months of treatment. But the risk of neuropathy is strong with the carboplatins. If my oncologist were to recommend that I start a carboplatin, I would be reluctant to do so because I would not want to reinjure my already damaged nerves. And I would be asking why? The neuropathy can get worse, causing a definite negative impact on the quality of my life. It's never wrong to discuss your concerns with your oncologists. They know that some treatments aren't tolerated well by their patients, and, in fact, this is one of the major reasons that certain treatments are stopped.",

Social Security doesn't say you can't work, but your disability may prevent you from handling full-time employment - that's why there's a cap on the amount of income you have. They also have Ticket To Work programs that gives you quite a bit of flexibility in terms of returning to work. Frankly for the past 6 months, I haven't had the energy to work full-time and haven't felt isolated. While I was getting radiation therapy, I got plenty of social interactions with the radiation therapists, and I've gotten to know the nurses at my infusion center quite well. There's church, and because I'm over the age of 60, there's a senior center I can get involved in. I am thinking about doing volunteer work with a local animal rescue shelter. I am starting to feel better, and I could also choose to work more, but anything over $1090/month is deducted from my Social Security checks. I also have to watch my monthly income because of Medicaid. My state limits my income to $1300/month from employers - and I can't afford health insurance out of pocket.",

If your lab results increase by 4 times, they will stop the treatment (or your platelet count drops to less then 25,000) As far as PET scans go, the general recommendations are every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months there after. I haven't actually seen any recommendations for yearly PET scans but that doesn't mean that a physician would not opt for yearly scans or more frequent scans based on your history. If there is a change in treatment your MO may increase the frequency (usually after two cycles of the new therapy) to determine if the new regimen is working. For some cancers, they are able to detect positive changes on day 14, and in clinical trials, the protocol may be to perform a scan on day 14 and day 59. My first PET scan was performed in FEB 2015 and the second was performed in APRIL 2015 - roughly 8 weeks after starting therapy. So there is room for a lot of leeway in determining when to perform a scan. Think of it this way - One Size Does Not Fit All Denny123 - just watched a video by a radiation oncologist at the University of North Carolina who quoted a rate of 50% of women with HER2+ MBC will develop brain mets. Supporting data suggests that 55 - 65% of patients being treated with T-DM1 will develop brain metastasis. Apparently some women experience a disruption in the blood brain barrier which allows T-DM1 to cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing T-DM1 to treat brain mets. Having just been treated for brain mets, I believe that all of us need to understand what the symptoms for brain mets are. My progression was caught on routine PET scan before I noticed symptoms. So without a PET scan or symptoms, a brain MRI isn't necessary. The Brain MRI is used for planning treatment (my radiation treatment was delivered by something called a TrueBeam machine, which uses computerized 3D mapping to precisely deliver radiation therapy to the cancer cells and to spare the healthy cells). Treatment took only 10 minutes under this machine.

Had a PET scan last week and MO is very pleased with results. Last October, I had a PET scan which showed progression in the liver and bones (left hip). I finally started on Zometa in June after completion of dental work. There is no activity in hips or bones. Last week's PET scan showed only two tiny spots on the liver which continues to be an improvement from the previous PET/Scan. My last Brain MRI was essentially clear. I had another one yesterday and I'm waiting to hear from RO for results. AST is slightly elevated  but remains between 60-70. My MO is very pleased with today's results.

It followed the course of 5 patients who were being treated for a brain cancer with a radical new therapy using the polio virus at Duke University. The gist of the story is: a doctor has learned how to alter the DNA of polio so that it invades only cancer cells. This makes the cancer cell susceptible to the immune system activating T-cells and killing cancer cells. They have only had a few patients in a Phase I clinical trial, but the results were so astonishing that the FDA has fast-tracked this treatment so it can be available to everyone with this type of cancer. Patient Number One was a 20 year old woman who was in nursing school when she was diagnosed. Her prognosis was poor. She had all of the treatments she could for her cancer. There were no other options for her. Today, her cancer is in remission (I don't think they are quite ready to use the word cured) and she's finished nursing school. The second patient was a 74 year old retired cardiologist. His cancer is now gone. There's still a lot that the oncologists involved with treatment are learning, but this treatment has the potential to be used on every type of cancer, including breast cancer (the researchers thought it would be available for clinical trials within 3-5 years). Watching the journey for Patient Number One made me cry. It seems we are getting close to a \"cure\" for this disease using our own immune systems to fight the battle.

Medicaid is the insurance provider of last resort. You will be covered by your employer's health plan, then be offered COBRA benefits, which you won't be able to afford. You apply for Medicaid, and everything gets billed to them. The way medical billing works is this: First your provider will bill any health insurance plan that you may have - either something you purchase or your employer provides, or workmen's comp if it's a work-related injury, or auto insurance if it's related to an automobile accident. If the bill is denied, then they bill Medicare if you have it. If Medicare denies the claim, then they bill Medicaid. There's only three questions you have to answer to be eligible for Medicaid: 1. Are you currently working? 2. Is anyone in your household disabled (why it's important to get SSDI approved because you can answer yes). 3. If you are working, how often do you get paid? How much money do you make with each paycheck? If you have no income, you are eligible for Medicaid. Be mindful of how much money you have in your bank account. You can't have a large amount of savings. You are allowed to own a home, even if it has a large amount of equity and you are allowed to own one vehicle to meet your daily transportation needs. The government is aware that most people need a car to meet basic transportation needs.",

One of the things that struck me about the OP's POV - and that is what she was expressing - is the anger she was feeling about the disease and coming to terms with it. So she hated the idea of journey. I'm not particularly fond of the War On Cancer metaphor and using The Battle perspective. I've never found fighting something that is part of me (and make no mistake, cancer is as much a part of me as my fingers and toes) as very useful for my overall mental health. I prefer to live in hope, love, forgiveness and positive thinking. I cringe whenever someone says \"You're so brave\". That's also a war mentality, but there's also nothing Brave about it. I have no choice. Cancer, chronic disease, old age, and death are part of what it means to be human. All of our ancestors experienced what it means to progress through these phases of life that make us human. So I choose not to comment on someone else's expression of what being human means to them. Each of us are at different places. If someone is at the anger, denial, and resistance stage, I let it be and let them express what is their reality. Over the course of time, as people adjust to their new reality, these words soften. But in the beginning, people want to think that having a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer marks them as different or special from other human beings who are dealing with difficult realities of being human. We had a reminder just two weeks ago about how suddenly the \"journey\" can end in Orlando. From what we know, those were young, healthy people out celebrating at a local nightclub. They had no idea that their journey was about to end. Those who died had no chance to contemplate what it means to die. Those who survived are now on that path in their lives when they get to learn what survivorship means. And some of them will be sure to tell us their stories.",

They're not concerned with the value of a human life. New treatments are always expensive because of the cost to bring these drugs to market. So, if we're only basing treatments on costs, we all would be getting the drugs from the 1990s.. Because they're cheap. Currently, organizations like the National Cancer institute have determined that the standard of care for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer is THP, followed by H&P. That forces the insurance companies, as well as Medicare and Medicaid to pay for the treatment. Where patients who might benefit from THP are being shortchanged is the Stage II and Stage III her2+ cases. They have to progress to stage IV to get the best treatment available! Right now, there's many exciting advances happening in breast cancer treatment. When these treatments are approved for treatment, we'll be facing the same issues. Will vaccines only be available for stage IV cancer, or will it be used to treat cancer before it advances this far?",

Which means that the cancer has become resistant to Herceptin alone. About 3 years ago, they finished a study called the Cleopatra study which showed that women with de novo (never treated) metastatic breast cancer did well on a protocol using Taxotere Herceptin and Perjeta. They lived longer and had longer progression free survival than women who were treated only with Herceptin At about the same time they were doing studies with T-DM1 which also showed good results but wasn't better than Herceptin and Perjeta for first line treatment. So the standard of care became THP for firstline treatment and T-DM1 for women who progress on THP. What you will see is a mixture of women on T-DM1 because THP wasn't the standard when they were diagnosed with MBC and they have been treated with other treatment protocols. Plus they are still investigating ways to use T-DM1 with other drugs for HER2+ cancer that has shown resistance to current treatment protocols. I often refer women to the following link about HER2+ disease. The one thing I take away from this video is how upbeat and positive the oncologists are about treating this type of breast cancer. HER2+ Breast Cancer As far as the question about can you go back on a drug that was used in the past - that's a complicated topic as you can tell by the way the oncologists discuss it in the video. Clearly they are using Herceptin in T-DM1 to deliver the chemotherapy drug to cancer cells, but they are using it only as a mechanism to deliver chemotherapy to the cancer cell and not for its therapeutic benefit for the Herceptin. My understanding is that the T-DM1 has more Herceptin in it. As far as your question about ER/PR status - it doesn't matter in terms of being treated with Herceptin and Perjeta. They treat everyone with a targeted therapy for HER2+ breast cancer. It's just that the oncologists also have to consider the ER/PR status in their treatment plans. You will often here them talk about the Luminal status of women with breast cancer. I think the more difficult cancers are triple negative and Luminal B. Luminal A is easiest followed by purely HER2+ breast cancer.",

I'll start with lung mets: When I was first diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I had just had surgery. My first PET scan was about a month later after the surgeon had cleared me for treatment by the medical oncologist. The PET scan showed a small liver mets and a small spot to the rib. I don't really consider that mets but a progression of the primary tumor into the rib as the surgeon told me he had taken as much of the tumor from the rib as he could and the margin was very small between the tumor and the rib. After the PET Scan in October, it identified one small spot to the left hip. I didn't start noticing symptoms until about two weeks ago, which is about a month after the PET scan showed the small spot. The two symptoms I noticed are Pain in the hip and back pain. We did labs last week and my calcium levels were normal. As they were at my last blood draw in September. The liver mets never produced any symptoms and my Liver Function Tests were all normal. After two rounds of Taxotere, Perjeta and Herceptin, the PET scan showed No EVIDENCE OF DISEASE and I stayed there until the PET scan in October. Typically you will see the following listed as symptoms of liver mets: \u2022loss of appetite. \u2022weight loss. \u2022dark-colored urine. \u2022abdominal swelling or bloating. \u2022jaundice, a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes. \u2022pain in the right shoulder. \u2022pain in the upper right abdomen. \u2022nausea. As far as the liver goes, I still have no symptoms, and my Liver Function Tests were normal. But I suspect you would have to have significant mets to experience these symptoms. On my last PET scan (October 3rd), the PET scan showed two small spots to the liver and one small spot to the left hip as well as three small spots to the brain. After an MRI of the brain, my Radiation oncologist counted 18 small spots to the brain - which meant that I was headed for Whole Brain Radiation treatment. At the time of the PET scan, I had not noticed any symptoms to the liver or bone, but by the end of Radiation Therapy I was noticing some achiness to my left hip and some back pain to my left side. But I also have a history of an old back injury to that area from sciatica and prior to the bone mets, I would get flare-ups that were similar to the type of pain I am having now. Symptoms of bone mets are: As far as the brain goes, there were some things going on around the time of the PET scan in October that I didn't recognize as symptoms of brain mets. I also had high blood pressure and was on Metoprolol - a drug that is recommended for women on Herceptin to prevent declines in Left Ventricular Ejection Function as well as to control High Blood Pressure in women receiving Herceptin (High blood pressure is a common side effect for women on Herceptin). I had two episodes where I had visual difficulties and I could not read the computer screen because I had double vision. I took my blood pressure and noticed that it was sitting at 180/90. I thought I may have missed my metoprolol and I took another dose - which lowered my blood pressure and restored my vision. I also noticed that I felt a weird feeling in my brain - like I was wearing a hat on my brain - but only on the left side. I didn't have another episode for another two weeks which was about the time that the radiation oncologist was counting those 18 spots on my brain. In addition to this, I noticed that I was having trouble staying awake and I was having trouble concentrating on normal cognitive activities. I like to play fantasy football and during this time I was having trouble completing my lineups. After WBR, I no longer have this problem. The main issue with brain mets is that it's not the cancer itself that is impacting the ability of your brain to function. It's the pressure that the cancer cells put on normal brain cells that causes the symptoms. It's what the doctors call cerebral edema and cerebral edema can be caused by many things - including infection, trauma, stroke, bleeding into the brain, radiation therapy, brain tumors, and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. So there's a standard set of questions you ask to determine if you are having cerebral edema: Do you have a headache that is not relieved by Tylenol? Based on my experience I would follow up that question with are you experiencing any abnormal sensations in your head or brain? Are you seeing any unusual spots in your eyes? Do you see shooting stars or fireworks? Double vision? As we got further into this I was noticing that some objects that I looked at for a long time (like this computer screen), would still linger in my visual field after I had stopped looking at it. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in unusual places in your body? For me, I noticed an area on my left arm and left leg that would have numbness and tingling that would come and go. Are you experiencing any balance problems or difficulty controlling what your arms or legs do? For me, I noticed that I couldn't always predict where my left leg was going to go. I also noticed changes in my hearing. The Radiation Oncologist said it was not unusual to feel like your head is under water - and that you are trying to hear things like they are under water. Nausea is a difficult symptom for me to recognize, but I did experience that from time to time. Here is a list of symptoms that you might also experience:  The good news is that once your medical oncologist gets the results of your PET scan, he or she will start you on steroids and every one of these symptoms will start to improve. Once radiation treatment begins, you will notice a rapid improvement in the symptoms One of the things that complicates your treatment when you develop mets to the brain, bone and liver is that the radiaton oncologist has to treat the brain mets first before they can begin treatment to the other areas. For those of us who will receive Kadcyla as our next treatment, this is because the drug can cause low platelet counts which can cause bleeding into the brain, which is something that neither the radiation oncologist nor the medical oncologist wants to see. So I was very happy to finally start Kadcyla on Monday.",

That means feeling tired, having high blood pressure, numbness or tingling in unusual places on your body, and difficulty concentrating. Headaches that do not respond to mild pain relievers are also symptoms. It can also present with difficulty walking and balance problems. I had most of these within 3 weeks of spotting the micro-lesions on an PET/CT scan. So if you are getting regular scans, chances increase that the lesions will be caught before you have symptoms. And your MO will immediately refer you for an MRI. Senator John McCain, was just diagnosed with Brain Cancer, and it was found by CT scan. If you went to the ER complaining of these symptoms, they would order a CT scan. The MRI has more specific uses for treatment of brain metastasis. Here are a few YouTube videos from UCLA and the University of North Carolina on Brain Metastasis which may help you discuss this with your MO: Cancer Treatment for Brain Metastasis | #UCLAMDChat Webinar Brain Metastasis - Dr Tim Zagar - 2014 MBCN Conference at UNC Understanding Brain Metastases An Overview of Treatment Options and Care Guideline Good examples of symptoms It's been 8 months since I was treated for brain metastasis and nearly every symptom is gone. One of the confounding factors once you are treated is deciding if your symptoms are a result of the cancer or a side effect of the therapy. I have been left with some hearing loss in the left ear and it's not certain if this will clear by my one year anniversary. It has shown improvement since last November. This symptom started after treatment began when my head felt like it was underwater. So the answer to your question is to continue to communicate with your MO. Many doctors will send women for an MRI to ease the anxiety but I gather that you live in Canada or one of the countries that want to limit the expense of unnecessary MRIs. If you are worried, be the squeaky wheel and keep bugging your MO about your concerns. BTW radiation therapy for brain metastasis increases long-term survival two to four times longer. This has been known for 50 years. New uses of radiation therapy has improved this data.",

I also was producing a lot of tears while I was on Taxotere, which impacted my ability to see. I never thought to mention the visual changes to my oncologist. After I finished Taxotere, my vision cleared in my right eye, but remained cloudy in the left eye. I scheduled an appointment with the optometrist and was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts last week. I'm scheduled to see the opthmalogist at the end of September for evaluation for cataract surgery. After reading this, I know now that it wasn't the Taxotere that induced or hastened my cataracts. It was the steroids I took with the Taxotere that was responsible. I don't think I would have been scheduled for cataract surgery any sooner. Because of the risk for infection while on Taxotere, I think we would have waited until I was done with chemotherapy. I just completed radiation therapy 3 weeks ago. Sometimes, we know more about our disease than the professionals we see. The optometrist I saw wasn't sure if the progression of the cataracts was related to chemotherapy, but based on this article, I'm certain it was. Thankfully, there were no signs of retinal damage or glaucoma. I'm just grateful that cataract surgery is available to correct the problem. The vision in my left eye does impact my ability to drive and work (have to increase the font on the computer in order to read the screen).",

When your oncologist says for as long as you can tolerate it, then you need to watch for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. If you develop neuropathy on Taxotere, the hope is that it will get better or go away after you stop the drug, but that isn't always the case. I have peripheral neuropathy and have been off of Taxotere for 18 months. The damage from the Taxotere is permanent. If you don't stop the Taxotere soon enough, you could end up with the type of damage that impacts the quality of your life and limits your mobility and ability to walk and do simple things like type on a keyboard, or button your clothes. I don't mean to frighten you, but there was a story on Dateline about an oncologist in Michigan who was giving high doses of chemotherapy to patients without cancer. Many of them developed peripheral neuropathy that greatly reduced the quality of their lives. Instead of stopping the drugs, he would keep them on the drugs, while their symptoms got worse and worse. It was very sad to watch the damage that was done to these people by a greedy doctor who was administering these drugs so he could bill Medicare and the insurance companies. Eventually that oncologist was charged with murder and sentenced to prison. So I wouldn't say to stop the drug, but you need to be cautious if you go beyond 8 doses. And speak up and squawk if you develop any unusual sensations in your fingers and toes.",

It isn't always easy thinking about my own mortality, but life is still good and I'm choosing to live life with as much joy as possible.

This is something that you would want to discuss with your MO because the goal is always quality of life with treatment for MBC and if headaches are causing you to have a decreased quality of life, it should be managed. But headaches are the cardinal sign for a number of diseases including stroke and migraines as well as swelling of the brain - which can be caused by a number of things either related or unrelated to your cancer. As someone who just underwent radiation therapy for brain metastasis, I heard enough about headaches either caused by swelling of the brain or radionecrosis. Which brings me to the second point - something called palliative care. Once you and your oncologist have ruled out other causes for the headache, you should consider palliative care - which means symptom management. Symptom management covers a broad range of symptoms, but improving the quality of your life by managing your headaches is something a palliative care team can help you with.",

So it's possible that your friend didn't have symptoms and it's also possible that her symptoms were so subtle that she didn't recognize them. Remember that one of the symptoms of brain metastasis is memory problems and decline in cognitive function so she may not be a good historian. As far as scans go, the medical oncologist uses three types of scans - bone scans, CT scans and PET scans. MRIs are used primarily by radiation oncologists to plan treatment - the mask you are given to wear is based on computerized 3D mapping from your brain MRI and to monitor your brain after treatment. You will be followed closely by the radiation oncologist every 3 months after treatment and you will have an MRI every three months afterwards. The radiation oncologist is checking for healing of your brain as well as monitoring for the return of any metastasis. Suffice it to say that you will become good friends with the radiation oncologist. As far as the treatment being painful - it is not. You hop up on the table of the machine and the radiation therapist positions you on the table with the mask in place. The purpose of the mask is to prevent you from moving during treatment because the machine is programmed to deliver radiation to the cancer cells avoiding the healthy cells. Then the therapist delivers your treatment, removes the mask and you are done. It never took longer than 10 minutes and it never hurt. And you start feeling better very quickly after treatment, within 3 to 4 treatments. Very often, a PET scan is performed with a CT scan, so it's not incorrect to think of a PET scan as also including a CT scan. The difference is the PET scan is detecting spots where cancer cells are utilizing glucose (or sugar) and the PET scan may miss a certain type of bone metastasis. It just so happens that breast cancer produces this type of bone metastasis, so your medical oncologist may prefer a bone scan over a PET scan or CT to detect this type of metastasis. As far as is it better to catch these things sooner - I would say yes because of the issue of quality of life. If you wait for symptoms to start, you also have to wait for treatment to kill the cancer cells, and for your body to heal, which means more pain and discomfort for you. But the treatment will kill the cancer regardless. It's just a question of how long it takes for you to recover. If you aren't having symptoms, it will take less time to recover.",
