I have asked my oncologist and radiologist both have said it is not related to my radiation or chemo treatments. I received my final chemo treatment on March 14, 2018 and my last radiation treatment in June. I've been trying to get some relief for this issue since I began chemo. I have gone to see a podiatrist and were given orthotics for my shoes but they have not provided me any relief. My podiatrist says I have a heal spur that was caused by a tight Achilles tendon but that still doesn't give me an answer for the pain in the first place. I'm still in pain and gaining weight fast. Not to mention chemo pushed me into early menopause, making weigh loss a whole new beast for me. My general practitioner says I need to workout in a pool for weightlessness but I do not own a pool and I don't live near a pool. I live in the country. The nearest pool for me is 35 miles away.",
