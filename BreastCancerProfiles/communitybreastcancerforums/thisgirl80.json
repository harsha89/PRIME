Thanks again ladies.  I want to cry every time I log on and find someone has responded to me.  The support that this board offers is incredible.  God bless.",

Her short term memory is not doing so good.  Her anxiety level has went through the roof.  She gets so upset that it affects her breathing. She is on ativan already, had to up her dose recently.  I am just wondering if anyone else has had experience with all of these meds and mets.  I don't know what to expect.  I am scared and a bit numb by now.  I have found a lot of hope from this board and the things I have read.  It is nice to find some positive in all the negative out there.  Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you all for sharing your stories and your stuggles and your trimphs.  Bless you all.

Mom felt good and we had just returned from a week at the beach, all was good.  Until, I called to ck on her the day after chemo and she was in A LOT of pain.  I went over to see her and she had a visible knot in her stomach and she said that is were most of the pain is located.  She was having to take pain meds, which she hasn't had to do in a while.  I am just worried since we got good news, nervous I guess.  Could this be a side effect from chemo? She is on navalbine and gemzar.  Nothing new to her.  I am just concerned.  She goes back for another treatment tomorrow.  My imagination is getting the best of me.  Oh well, I guess I just need to throw this out there.  Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",

What struck me about your story was that, like my mom, they originally thought the spot on her lungs was something else and then decided that it was cancer.  My mom's was thought to be infection but after her PA looked at the scans he determined that it was lung mets.  Scary that they miss things like that.  I pray that things get better for your mom and you.  God Bless.",

You will be in my thoughts and prayers. You can PM me if you have any questions, I will try to help.",
