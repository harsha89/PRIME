I had a excisional biopsy done on Tuesday, 2/2 and received my results at my post-op appt this past Monday, 2/8. I have DCIS, Stage 0. My surgeon told me that she was able to get clear margins on what she took out, during now what she calls a lumpectomy so I would only need radiation therapy, no additional surgeries or chemo. I have my first consult appt. with a radiology oncologist this coming Friday and then they set me up an appt with a general oncologist for March 8th. My surgeon told me that I would probably start a hormone blocker (Tamoxofen or something similiar) after radiation and that depending on what the oncologist says, they may want to remove my ovaries (I had a partial hysterectomy 5 yrs ago but they didnt take out my ovaries). Right now, this is all the information I have and I do feel thankful that my cancer was found so early just through having my regular yearly mammogram. Any advice out there from the BC pros??

Just something she was telling me I may hear from the general oncologist but I'll be making sure at that appt. to ask those questions because the less surgeries I HAVE to have the better. The waiting for it all is the killer right now...I just want to get these appointments done and move on. :)",
