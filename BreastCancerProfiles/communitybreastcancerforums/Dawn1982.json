In some ways I'm already doing much better - e.g. can reach the faucet to wash my hands, can take deep breaths - but I am still taking some of the oxycodone and flexiril. Ideally I'll wean off the narcotics over the next couple of days. Tylenol has been incredibly helpful. I'm sleeping in a recliner and keeping my activities pretty minimal. Waiting to hear back on the node pathology (had one positive prior to chemo, if still positive I'll need rads) The most uncomfortable part right now is my armpits - especially where the nodes were taken. Surprisingly, my drains are getting very little fluid - maybe about 5-10ml in the last 16 hours. Should I be concerned about this? It seems too soon (day 4) for such little output. The expanders feel heavy but are tolerable (of course that could be because of the meds!) Thanks all for being here. I'm 35 and this was the first surgery I'd ever had, so I was pretty nervous about all of it. But honestly it was totally doable, even the anesthesia and the catheter and whatnot. I wish you all luck on your upcoming surgeries and speedy recoveries. <3 ",

The primary source of the pain is that apparently the axial lymph dissection was \u201ccomplete\u201d (they took 12) and therefore according to PS would feel pretty intense. Everyday that passes I get a bit more optimistic. I'd like to stop taking meds but it's only day 5 today, so I'm just continuing to decrease doses and increase time betweeen. Kskchap- we were not told to strip previously, but he taught us yesterday and that will be a great help moving forward! LisaRx- thank you! Definitely staying hydrated. Doc suggested Tylenol, but you\u2019re right it\u2019s in some of the narcotics. Di356- sorry you are here, but welcome. You will find wonderful support here and a lot of incredible people. I don\u2019t know about the specifics of your situation but I do know it\u2019s okay to be afraid. I\u2019ve been afraid of every step of my journey - diagnostics, getting a port, doing chemo, getting a mastectomy, etc - but I\u2019ve gotten through each one and it has made me a stronger person. Just do one thing at a time and remember you are not alone.",
