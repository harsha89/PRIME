That pain is almost gone, but now i have a pain in my forearm when i stretch my arm. i felt this pain 2 days ago, then yesterday nothing, and today i felt it again, its just when i stretch it or move my wrist side to side, i have no pain when the arm is resting. I always have had discomfort in this arm (mastectomy arm). My question is, can bone mets present like this? feeling the pain just when stretching my arm, and no pain when resting it??? i know this sounds like a pulled muscle or something, but im still worried.",
