Even at your young age, a lot of those symptoms could be hormonal changes, hormones fluctuating, can cause sweatiness, backache, sore breasts, anxiety, etc. Even benign breast lumpiness. HOWEVER! I am very glad you are getting an ultrasound to make sure,esp. with your family history. I would call the ultrasound place, my experience always is to call instead of waiting! Just tell them you're waiting to hear from them! You'll take first available. Call about the bloodwork too. I never wait to be called. Sometimes they forget! Call today, waiting around is too nerve wracking! The odds are in your favor that it's something less than what you're worried about. 💗",

No fatigue, nausea,nothing but a sunburn like reaction. In one area of concentration, right on my collarbone, skin scabbed up a bit. It was aggravated by bra strap, so I got convertible sports type bra. I also used aloe, aquaphor, calendula and a cream called Miaderm. The calendula and Miaderm worked best for me.

If you could have your chemo sessions on a Thursday let's say, recovery over the weekend you might be good to go by Mon.Just be really germ conscious, your immune system is compromised on chemo. They do your blood count before every infusion and won't do it if counts are too low. Mine were always ok. I never threw up from chemo, took anti nausea meds. But I still lost weight, food very unappealing 😜 I only wanted bland food, because nothing tasted right! Even water! I forced myself to drink my kale &berry protein smoothies.

I only have recon on 1 breast, maybe that looked odd in the scanner? Try just explaining your fears, they were super nice when I did",

I had the full menu of chemo, surgery radiation, more chemo, and now it's over and I'm feeling great, so try not to despair. It changes your life, but you will find a strength that you didn't know you had and do whatever you have to do! My tumor was grade 2, which means it's not overly aggressive, I believe. It would have to be a weekend! The scariest part is the beginning when you dont know what to expect! Try not to Google, cuz you dont know your stage so dont know what your plan is yet. Try not to freak out(hard) Come back to this site when you know your treatment plan you'll get lots of good advice!💕💗wishing you all the best!",

I remember that the lowest end of my back scar would burn and feel really tight. I had my hubby massage (organic) vitamin e cream into the whole scar a.m. and p.m. That seemed to kind of release some tension. And my scar became very smooth and more stretch -able. Another thing, on the day after chemo, I actually felt pretty good , I guess from the steroids and anti nausea meds in the infusion, so I think a p.t. session could be ok. I'm a very active person also, and really chafed at the forced inactivity! But as you go along, you'll find ways to get some of your activities in.I think your anxiety is that you won't be able to resume your active lifestyle. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO! OK? You have challenges to get through first, one step at time. I can do everything I did before.

You're right about the muscle\"memory it will be harder to stretch out the more it gets used to its current position.Normally you'd be opening up your upper body, chest, mid back by laying on your back either on the Big exercise ball or the foam roller, but that would be difficult at your stage of healing. Maybe you can lay with your upper back on a mound of pillows, try to extend your arms out in a T shape, if you can't, bend your arms.Lay there to try to stretch your front torso , might take some of the extreme pulling or knot out of your back. Or put the pillows under the area that hurts, to kind of arch that area, and lay like that for awhile.I had a left sided lat flap, didn't experience this problem, must be stitched together very tightly. Can you get to P.T. sooner? I think ,sooner the better. Wish I was there to help!",

My Lat flap surgery was my 2nd reconstruction, my first was straight to implant surgery, which got all tightened up by radiation. The first surgery was uncomfortable because my implant was under my pectoral muscle. I hated it! This is so much better, especially for weight training, and other upper body exercises. 16 infusions in one arm! Yikes🤤My veins got fried, and we alternated arms! So great that you found just the right therapist, makes a big difference😊 Happy New Year!",

You are right about needing to stretch the back muscles.Without the lat muscle, the trapezius, a muscle that goes all the way from neck, down the back along side the lat, is going to take over some of the work. Also some smaller supporting groups , rhomboid, in between the shoulder and spine, and spinal muscles further down, towards the bottom of your scar. All need to stretch out! I did stretches at home, before 6 weeks! Gentle of course, dont want to mess with the healing layers inside. Try reaching forward, and pulling back, like rowing, while seated. Round your back forward, hold it to a gentle stretch, then straighten,pushing chest out. Feels good! Also shoulder rolls, loosen trapezius up. You'll get there, frustrating when you have to wait, I know!",

Basically, I went back to my weight training regimen, at reduced weights, and let the weight machines kind of stretch the back, and scar area, GENTLY. I work at stretching my upper body every day. I have gone back to ALL my former activities. There is a tighter feeling on that side, because the lat muscle is removed, and then skin stitched back together, naturally gonna be tighter. But it will loosen up ,once you're exchange heals completely, and you can start really working on it. I was impatient, didn't know why I had to wait so long ,til my Dr. explained, just cuz it looks healed outside, inside many layers of muscle, blood vessels, nerves ,etc.have to heal. But now, a little over a year after, I'm back to Super hero status😉 . The only weird thing is once in awhile, the lat muscle in front will animate when doing a back exercise. Feel and looks weird, but no obstacle to any activity. You will be able to go back to work and recreation, with a little patience and work! Keep a-stretching!",

My onco coordinated all my treatments, the order and timing of everything. There is a tumor board that goes over it all, at least at the university hospital I had all my treatments. So the tumor club, I called it, will discuss with all , surgeons,breast, and plastic,radiologist, oncologist and come up with your plan of attack. The tumor board is all the big shots of cancer treatment at your hospital. Only the biopsy can tell if there's cancer, so don't be too mad @doc who missed it. When I was 1st diagnosed, I read books, unfortunately I gave them away, so don't remember titles. Just go to bookstores and get most recently published books on breast cancer, you'll learn all about what to expect . Of course here ,Breastcancer.org is a goldmine of info. Just Google any question you'll find a bc.org topic to click on",
