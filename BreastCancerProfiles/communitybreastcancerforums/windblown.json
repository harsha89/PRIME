Use every weapon you have and remember a little ativan never hurt anybody!! things I've done to cope in the last couple weeks: this site cannot be beat combined with ativan, bubble baths, new nail polish, really good chocolate, plants and dirt, autoharp, a feel good novel,a girl's pajama night, comedy central, hugs from my friends and knitting. This is the time to pull out all the stops to care for yourself.",

      "Content": "windblown wrote: I recently relocated for my job and am not with my family. I found a lump in my right breast last week and have been dealing with an itchy nipple for a few months...I am terrified it's Paget's cancer! I saw a new MD who scheduled me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound and said I would definately need a biopsy. I am scheduled for the mamao/U/S next wednesday and trying to work and be brave and get support. I thought I was doing pretty good until I went out to get gas and groceries and totally fell apart at the gas station. I couldn't remember my new account's pin # and tried one too many times so the bank froze my card. The station didn't take checks and my other new account only works as an ATM, not debit card. I was in that station for 45 minutes trying to problem solve paying for gas...the poor man was really trying to be patient and was so kind to me....I finally remembered what I set the ATM pin to and gave him cash. He said.\"Why don't you just tell me what's wrong? I'm a little afraid to let you drive...so I blurted out \"I think I have breast cancer and I'm terrified!\" and had my first really good blubber there at Speedway with a kind stranger. When I could breathe again I went to the store and filled my cart with flowers, houseplants, dirt and good chocolate. I made it through today! Decided to join this forum for support. I am struggling because my family was having a big celebration today and I decided not to tell anybody until I know something to tell. I need to tell somebody so here it is....logged on and read this post and felt a little better..... Log in to post a reply",
