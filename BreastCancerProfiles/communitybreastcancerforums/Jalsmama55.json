Then had MRI bilaterally. That showed more nonsense in the cancer side and questionable lymphnodes. I immediately opted for BMX because I didn't want to mess around. I have 3 young children. Although I was scared to death and it seemed like each new phone call from a dr was worse than the last, I made it through. I also have to say that the BMX wasn't as awful as I had imagined and quite honestly, I was happy to get those things off with all the problems they were apparently causing me. I always thought of it as \"these b$tches aren't worth my life\" so I really didn't regret it for even a second. I still haven't had recon due to the fact that recon would've put off chemo even longer. So I'll start that process sometime between October and december (haven't decided yet). Please let us know how you're doing. Lots of love and hugs Xoxoxo",

It's very scary and overwhelming. Saying lots of prayers that you're still stage 0. The fear is what gets the best of all of us in the beginning. As soon as you have your path report and have a plan in place, you'll start to feel a little more in control. Take care and keep us posted.",

I know its easier said than done, but like I've been doing, try to stay positive and only deal with what you know to be true.. I've decided that if my pathology results come back as cancer tomorrow, theres nothing that i can do to change it regardless, so why freak myself out until I actually know whats going on.. Am i still scared? Absolutely! I'm totally worried for my children etc, but i won't be much use to them if I'm a total wreck and regardless, I dont want to live my life like that.. B9 wishes and best of luck to you darling.. <3  Thanks everyone for the kind words.. I'll post an update after my follow up with surgeon tomorrow..For now, I'm still a little sore but mostly just itching like crazy from the bandages, tape and healing process Ugh!  And totally forgot to start stool softeners before taking my painkillers, so I'm sure you can all imagine what that means about now (2 days in) YUK! :)  Thanks again all for the positive thoughts and prayers! xoxo",

Dr said the smaller of the 3 lumps are \"nothing\" and had pathologist take an initial look and they concur on that. After laying eyes on the big one, hes still very concerned. We all got the feeling that hes pretty sure it cancer but hes still being optimistic. he said he might have taken too much of a margin on the inside skin side because the top of the tumor was so close to the surface, but he wanted to make sure he got everything. therefore i have quite a dent.. But like i told him,\"They might be attached to me but im not attached to them so do what u gotta do\" lol, he smiled :).I see surgeon monday and get pathology results..   I really want to thank everyone here for the positive thoughts, prayers, good juju etc.. It means oh so much.. i am very positive right now and feel that no matter what, ill make it through this. With the love of my family and u amazing people here, i can do anything..  Love and B9 wishes to all of you! XOXOXO",

My experience was that initially after my unilateral DIEP, my lymphedema got better. And it was especially good while I still had JP drains in. I did however also notice that once I had the TE placed on my non cancer side, the lymphedema got a little bit worse. I assume from the TE and then subsequent placement of the implant causing more pressure and therefore blocking lymph channels. This is just my personal experience. Although it is a little bit worse, I would still do recon all over again. My lymphedema is mild truncal on cancer side and in my entire cancer side arm including hand and fingers. Hope this helps",
