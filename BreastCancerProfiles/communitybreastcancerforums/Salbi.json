    "Content": "Salbi wrote: Hi, this is my first post here. I went for my annual mammogram last Thursday (5/14). I'm 47 and have been having one done every year for the past 10 years.  They have always been normal and when I didn't hear anything back Friday or Monday I assumed this one was too.  My dr called today to say they found a mass in my right breast and they want me in for an ultrasound on Thursday.  I know it will probably be nothing and I'm being silly for even worrying but this is the age that my aunt (mom's sister) was diagnosed.  I don't want to call my family and worry them, and my best friend is turning 50 this Friday so don't want to upset her before her birthday. I'm so happy to have found this forum and a place to let things out.   Thanks for reading this, and please excuse my nervousness. I know it is probably nothing.  I do have one question though, how long after an ultrasound do they usually let you know if they have found anything. thanks again Log in to post a reply",
