She is doing localized radiation to T4 still as well as 40% normal dose of Chemo (Gemzar)weekly due to her liver failure. Dr advised liver is dangerously delicate in the state it is in now. She is jaundice, barely walking and her ALL lab values are either critically high or Alert low. She goes in for IV and calcium infusions over the weekends but we were advised they will be discontiued due to heavy pitting edema showing up in legs and arms. She is heavily bruised due to low albumin and as her ammonia levels increase her mental state is slowly declining as well. This is all progrssing very quickly. Chemo has slowed the cancer progression but it still continues to thrive due to not being able to take a full dosage. Thankfully she has no pain, I was told death liver failure is often painless. She takes a \"5\"mg oxycodone(such a small dose) pain med at night to sleep better. Home health nurse is suppose to be set up soon. I love my mom but she refuses to let my brother or her husband help her. She is often incontinent and will lock herself in the bathroom until i am able to assist her or get to her house. Today they gave her medications to start increasing bowel movement hoping to expel the toxins her liver is not processessing. She has serious difficulty making it to the restroom and she refuses to wear depends. Im am tired. And frankly very fearful of this new medication. My mother is a mid-upper class woman. That up to 4 weeks ago had alot of pride and joy in life. She is a shell of what she use to be, extremely embarrassed and depressed. Any suggestions? I cherish all the time i have left with her. And want to make things as easy and comfortable for her as possible.",

Heart test was A-ok. But jaundice wasnt clearing up so a CT abd/pelvis was done reveiling numerous nodules in liver, base of lung and pelvis area. That same day we were in the Oncologist office. After MRI/CT/PET and Liver Biopsy she has been dx w/ Lobular Breast Cancer that has gone into 80% of her liver, lungs, various lymphs and mult vertebrae. One of the most concerning tumors is located on T4 vertebrae and is already showing signs of spinal compression. Radiation Onc advised he couldnt sleep unless a healthy? dose of radiation was given immediately (this was friday).He advised she is at risk of being paralyzed. She has recieved one localized dose of radiation to t4 and will continue everyday for 3 weeks. Radiation to the rest of the body is not an option due to her liver. She has also started on Aromasin. We are still awaiting the final biopsy results. This all very new. Thankfully she only has slight back pain btwn her shoulder blades (who doesnt have back pain? And never in a million years would we have thought cancer). Her one small breast nodule is unpalpable and painless. Other than being Jaundice she is a very sprightly tough norwegian woman. She was born with Right side deficits and along with poor diet worries me tremendously about whether her body is strong enough to go thru what may lay ahead. Is there anyone out there that is also experiencing this type of situation?  Is there anything that makes women feel more 'pretty' or really lifts one's spirits a time like this? With a liver so inundated can the tumors be reduced to function properly and will the Jaundice ever go away? (I understand this all depends on how receptive she is to medications, and the liver can function normally on just a fraction of itself)  Any HELP/ADVISE is soo so so greatly appreciated! You all are so strong and truelly inspiring! Thank you, Tiffany - A loving,scared, concerned daughter Log in to post a reply",

No surgery or Chemo due to liver inundated with tumors. Daily hormone (Aromasin) and daily Localized Radiation to T4 will continue. Chemo is desired by the Oncs as soon as tumors shrink up a little in the liver. Sandilee and Steelrose ur stories bring us hope thank you so so much for sharing! My mom isnt computer savy just yet but I shared both of your stories with her. Its encouraging! Also LauraX your right on the money. Nothing but shock and tears thus far, thank you for the reassurance that this is a normal response. We were even able to get the men folk in the family to understand the jist of whats happening via the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 101:interactive tool (it was recommended, THANK YOU). Im so appreciative of this information you have shared Ladies! Bon, we are from the Olympia, Wa area. The medical teams have been amazing to say the least. So compassionate and its been a whirlwind of a week, everyday has had an unexpected/unscheduled appt. We are truely blessed and I spend alot of waiting room time filling out thank you cards to keep my little mind occupied. :) Moms still in good spirits, sprightly and hopeful!
