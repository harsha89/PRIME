I'm currently on taxotare, perjeta, and herceptin every 3 weeks. I've been really lucky so far. My cancer is stable or shrinking depending on where it is. My only side effect of chemo is fatigue and it isn't that bad. My problem is that I'm just tired of having cancer. I'm single with no family and I hate having to ask for help. I just feel like I'm so needy and am bothering people. I want my life back. Am I the only one who feels like this? I know my life will never be the same, it just gets so hard sometimes.
