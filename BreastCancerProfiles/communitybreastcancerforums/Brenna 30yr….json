OMG!! i am so freakin sad. i wish i wasnt sick. but i guess since im just newly diagnosed 6 months ago it will get easier. thank you ladies! B ",

I just dont understand how inhumane people can be to not have a heart and at least sympathize a little. thats all i ask is a little bit of compassion. take care and good luck to everyone out there regardless of age!! we all are going thru this together! xoxo B ",
