Was treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Had thyroid cancer in 1996, surgery and a radioactive iodine pill. And now, July 2013, breast cancer. Will be having bilateral mastectomy on 7-31 and am still deciding about recon or not. Due to weight and blood clotting issues my only choice is immediate, 1 step implants. I am worried about the pain of no expanders and other issues but mainly it seems like I am inviting trouble. Hate hospitals and surgeries and I just don't know if its worth it. Taking advice and opinions.... Thanks, K",
