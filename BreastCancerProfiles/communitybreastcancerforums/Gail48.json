Hope everyone is doing well and that your treatments when well and will go well for those that haven't started.   Jenweg, sorry you had an issue with your port and getting a blood clot, but sounds like they are right on top of it.  Since they had such a time with my veins they thought about a pic or a port, but decided since I only have 4 treatments that we would try to go without it, Now only three left  Wahoo!! Healing thoughts and prayers going out to everyone.  ",
