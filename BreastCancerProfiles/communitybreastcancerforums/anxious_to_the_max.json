Started in May , Bleeding from single nipple duct, mammogram (benign changes) ultrasound (benign changes), biopsy (nothing), fluid drained from same area (nothing), swab of nipple discharge (nothing), and then last Thursday removal of duct that is bleeding - DCIS. Now MRI tomorrow, god knows what that will show but my automatic response is aggressive treatment (double mastectomy) with immediate reconstruction. As you can imagine I trust no test they will ever do on me ever again! Im 37 with three children, great career. I want symmetrical breasts and no fear of cancer every day for the rest of my life. Extreme??? I've seen some posts from others who have gone down this path. Would love to hear from anyone really. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "anxious_to_the_max wrote: I am 35, have 3 small children. noticed bleeding from my nipple in the shower, went to the doctor the next day. she ordered mammogram (useless? came back as BIRADS - D, which I believe means very dense breast), ultrasound which showed a lump (8mm, new to me, and easily palpable). Report said \"could represent fibroadenoma\". Mammogram showed layered microcalcification throughout the same breast (\"of no concern\"). Bleeding is one breast only (same side as lump and microcalcification) and spontaneous (find spots in my bra/crop top). From one duct only. I have a referral to a specialist clinic for review, but can't even imagine how one breast has zero changes, the other has bleeding duct, a lump and microcalcifications, and somehow this will all be no big deal? Freaking out. And have told no one except my husband. I can't find any literature which speaks to all three of my symptoms. . . . Thanks for reading. Feels helpful even just to write about it.
