I started getting a rash by the 3rd to 4th day and I had been using a 1% hydrocortisone creme with aloe per doctor orders. Saw RO one the fourth day and they switched me to their 1% hydrocortisone creme and taking benadryl in the eve before bed-said it is uncommon to get a reaction that fast and must be the creme. I am slightly fair skinned with a celtic ethnicity, but not overly sensitive.Â Rash has gotten worse and spread with little blisters has this happen to anyone else? I welcome any advice. Thank you!",
