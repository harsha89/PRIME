I had a BMX Nov. 20 (cancer on L, prophylactic on R). My tubule score was a 3 (overall Nottingham grade 2, with nuclear grade 2 & mitotic activity score 1). I had multifocal IDC, both solid and mucinous types, along with a 6 cm DCIS mass. Stage 1. No lymph node involvement, no lymphovascular invasion. Low KI-67 score (10%). Hormone positive, HER-2 negative. I am 32 years old. I will find out my Oncotype score next week. In the meantime, I'm trying to educate myself as much as possible so I can make an informed decision quickly. My MO is anticipating a low Oncotype score and thus no chemo. There was initially a question of whether or not the Oncotype test could even be run because my tumor size (0.6 cm) was right at the cutoff of how large a sample Genomic Health needs to run the tests. It turned out to be big enough for the tests, but if they had not been able to run the tests, my MO told me she would have recommended no chemo in absence of a Oncotype score, based on everything else she knows about my tumor. Anyways, any additional info you can give me (or threads you can direct me to) on the effects of tubule score and mucinous type on treatment would be appreciated. Thank you! And now, off to bed...'tis 2 am in my corner of the world, and last I checked, all medical professionals are still in agreement that sufficient sleep is, in fact, recommended for cancer patients. Glad some things are still clear-cut! :-)",

I've done so much reading since my diagnosis in late Sept, but there's still so much new info every day. I wasn't familiar with the separate diagnosis of tubular breast cancer. Thank you for clarifying for me (you are right--I was assuming your reference to tubular referred to high tubule score, not a separate tubular cancer diagnosis). I'll be checking out the mucinous type thread. Thank you. :-)",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2013 11:56PM - edited Aug 12, 2013 11:59PM by Adelaide77 Hi...I was hoping I could get some feedback on the results of a recent xray. In Sept. 2012, at age 32, I was dx'd with IDC, stage 1. Low onc score, no chemo needed. Shortly after my dx, during a baseline dexa prior to starting tamox, we discovered I also have osteoporosis. (Several years prior I had been dx'd with osteopenia, but now it has progressed to osteoporosis.) This past Friday I had an xray to check on a possible T12 compression fracture that was identified several months ago during an abdominal CT scan (unrelated; to check for a hernia). Friday's xray showed I do indeed have a fracture there as well as demineralization through the entire spine and (in the thoracic) mild degenerative disc disorder and exaggerated upper thoracic kyphosis. None of the blood tests my endocrinologist has ordered has found a reason for the early onset of my osteoporosis--vit D, thyroid, parathyroid, IGF, & cortisol have all come back normal. I can't help but wonder (worry?) that perhaps this isn't osteoporosis at all but bone mets. Since bone mets weakens bones, could a dexa, in theory, read in the osteoporotic range when the underlying cause is actually metes? No mention was made in the xray report of dark spots, etc. Would a routine xray show mets? I viewed my results this evening electronically (they are posted to a secure site online that I can log into & see them), but I haven't spoken with my MO or endocrinologist yet. Hoping to touch base with them or a nurse tomorrow during office hours to discuss the results, but I wanted to see if anyone here has some insight too. Thank you so much!",

I've posted in this thread one or two times before, and I (along with everyone else in here, I'm sure!) so appreciate the time you lovely ladies take to answer questions. Thank you so much Chrissy & Barsco! I had a PET-CT this week as follow-up to a suspicious spot found on my sternum during a bone scan. Fortunately, no focal bone lesions were found on the PET, but I did have diffuse increased FDG uptake throughout my skeleton. Has anyone seen this before? My MO is stumped. She says she sees this in post-chemo patients, but I am not post-chemo. And blood counts are all normal. I am being followed by an endocrinologist for osteoporosis (I am only 33), and I have emailed him at my MO's recommendation to see if there is any reason osteo could somehow cause a PET reading like that. I have also been referred to a hematologist. A few months ago I had an abnormal urine electrophoresis (to check for multiple myeloma as a possible cause for the early-onset osteo), but the follow-up immunofixation test came back normal. So I'm stumped. Anyone experienced anything like this before? One thing I'm concerned about is the possibility of bone marrow mets. From what I've read it's extremely rare, so thankfully unlikely, but is this something I should be considering? Does anyone know if bone marrow mets can present without bone lesions? Does it stay confined to the marrow alone? I've emailed my MO this question but thought I would pick some brains here too. Thanks, ladies.",

I am hoping someone can give me insight on whether to push for some additional testing re: symptoms I've been having, as well as what type of testing I should push for. I am almost 5 years out from initial diagnosis of stage 1 IDC. About 2 months ago I began waking several times a night with tingly fingers (I am a back sleeper, so it was not from laying on my arm). In the past week, after doing some yard work, I have begun having very bad back pain, at times 8 or 9 on a 10-pain scale. It's mostly mid-back and neck, but I'm also getting strong aches in my lower back and hips. It ebbs and flows, and it's varied in behavior--sometimes achey like childhood growing pains, sometimes more muscular, sometimes sharp stabbing pains. Also in the past week, I've begun having nausea. I've had my calcium tested recently (albeit a few days before the nausea started), and it was normal. I had similar symptoms almost exactly a year ago, and my MO ordered a liver CT and brain MRI (she was more concerned about the unexplained nausea, and also some muscle twitching I was experiencing at the time), but nothing to check bone health. Both brain and liver came back fine. Shortly after those scans, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease -- which in hindsight probably explained a lot of the pain and nausea and muscle twitching symptoms I'd been having. After Lyme treatment, I felt great for a good stretch--until this past week when the pain and nausea started up. I am assuming it is a Lyme flare-up, but could bone mets present this way as well? Could the pain go away for a year and then flare back up? Or would untreated mets not be quiet that long? what about elevated calcium levels causing nausea with bone mets....could that ebb and flow as well, or would it stay permanently elevated? The other piece that has me concerned is my mental health. I have a history of anxiety and depression, but it rarely gets severe. About a week ago, I spiraled into such a bad state my husband ended up taking me to the ER; the last time I was like this was just months before my initial cancer diagnosis. I know it's unlikely to be related, but I've also done some reading on how tumors can affect brain chemicals/mental health, and it has me wondering. The similarities between last week's emotional episode and the episode I had months before my initial cancer dx have me concerned. I see my MO next week for my yearly checkup. Should I request a spine MRI? PET/CT? I'm concerned about sensitivity of bone scans/inaccuracies for lytic lesions, so am wondering if I should ask for additional testing and what kind. I've also been having A LOT of gynecological symptoms (although a recent TVU came back fine), so I'm wondering if maybe asking for a PET/CT is a wise option, so as to get a better look at multiple fronts. Thank you for any insights.",
