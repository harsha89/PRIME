The cup sizes in these swim suits is usually a B cup. I have considered buying the cami's that I have seen that advertise the built in underwire bras that come in band and cup sizes and then pairing it with swim shorts or a swim skirt. You can see one of these camis if you go to the TravelSmith website and enter cami in the search feature.  In my opinion a nice classic halter style suit that goes around the back at the armpit level would be an attractive suit for any age. It could be paired with bikini bottoms, swim shorts, or swim skirts.",

You boobless ladies have me so jealous!  I had a unilateral mastectomy, 20 years, ago.  I'm small 5'0\" and weigh 110 lbs.  Unfortunately, on my small frame I carry a 34D breast.  I have a size 7 breast form.  There is no way I can go braless out in public without looking extremely lopsided. I do go braless at home and when I'm working in the yard.  It is such a relief, especially in the summer.  Recently, I have been looking at myself in the mirror and actually like the way I look on the side that is missing the boob.  I'm 57 and it is actually a younger look.  I think that large breasted women begin to look matronly as they age, because of the boob size. I have been seriously thinking about having a prophalactic mastectomy when I retire at the end of this year.  Overall, I think it would be so freeing.  However, I'm not sure if my insurance would pay for it after this long.  But, I was thinking of getting the genetic testing, which they didn't do 20 years ago, since it would probably come out postive, because of my family history.   Then, I'm sure it would be covered by insurance. You ladies seriously rock! ~elaine~",

To quote from her site, \"I realize I feel like a freak ONLY in the context of oppressive \"norms\" and the idea that reconstruction makes more \"social\" sense, but that's about it.\"  She, also, talks about how it seems to be a \"given\" that ALL women who have mastectomies want reconstruction.  A given that you would put yourself through major potentially life threatening surgery that is not guaranteed to provide the results that you want.  She says that, \"the concept of reconstruction being a part of the mastectomy experience also means that all the pain suffering and disappointment is all a part of it to.\" Check out her site (www.rebel1in8.com) and make sure to look at \"The Songbird Branch\". ~elaine~",
