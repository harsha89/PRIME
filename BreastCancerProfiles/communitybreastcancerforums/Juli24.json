I made the decision that I was not going to take any of the hormone blockers. Just had too many horrible side effects plus the tables didn\u2019t show a huge swing in the survival rates taking them. Because of that decision his protocol is to test more often to catch anything early. That being said, those numbers swing sometimes going above the top advisable margin usually due to inflammation or some unknown factor. For that reason, we don\u2019t panic if the numbers are high in one set of tests. He says wait until that becomes a pattern. So far his reasoning has been correct and the numbers go down again. The few times they didn\u2019t he did scans. Interesting how different doctors have different methods of follow up. My insurance hasn\u2019t questioned any of the bills luckily since I am surethey are astromical.",
