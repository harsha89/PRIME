I have been reading post since September when I was diagnosed.  It was very helpful reading everyones suggestions and being guided. I thought I should add some of my own now.  I finished 4 rounds of A/C on December 18th and had my first of 4 rounds of  Taxol on Jan 2. My A/C treatments went as planned and the only side effects I did encounter were those from the Nulasta and the steroids.  I was able to deter the mouth sores by removing all acidic foods and drinks. I also did not eat any salty or sharp foods before my treatment.  My doctor has been amazed by how good my mouth is.  I also used sensodyne  toothpaste which has helped.  Regarding hair loss \"go with it\" as the Kenneth Cole commercial states \"We all walk in different shoes\" There are great pictures in the commercial especially of a beautiful model who is bald. I did not go with the wig, but did purchase soft baseball caps and turbans. However, I have stopped wearing anything due to the fact my head was getting so hot that I could actually increase my body temperature by 5 degrees.   One thing that I wanted to add was I am a teacher, high school coach and aunt to 12 nieces and nephews and if it were not for the simple honesty of children and young adults I would be an emotional wreck.  My team of high school soccer players were the strength I needed in the beginning with my diagnosis. They surrounded me with their love, honesty and strength. My 7 and 8th grade students have endured the hair loss and my crazy humor and they think bald is beautiful.  My niece who is 4 thinks she should cut her hair to be like aunt kimmy and my Varsity basketball team is working so hard to WIN one for the coach.  They just don't realize I have won already with them supporting my decision to stay on as the new Head coach. If you can surround yourselves with children or young adults the strength you get from them can be amazing. Be strong out there we will endure.",

My nurse commented that my water intake really helps. I also took one preventative nausea  pill the night of treatment.  As long as my stomach was full the nausea didn't take over.  I had to stop drinking green tea I think it made my food digestion go too fast.  I just had my first taxol on jan 2 and unfortunately I wasn't able to go back to work today, my joints from the waist down are very painful.  I have only missed work the day after treatments so that I could sleep. I have opposite reactions to steroids and I sleep but unfortunately get very red in the face. I am a very impatient person and hope the pain is gone by tomorrow I miss my students we have been on break since Dec22",

Students are very honest and want nothing but honesty when its comes from their teachers.  It also give them an outlet to talk if they are in any way affected by this in their lives. You can't imagine how many students came forward and just opened up about how cancer has effected their lives and they never shared it with anyone.  Good luck",

I am a special education teacher  with in class and out of class responsibilities .  I have plenty of sick days to use.  There was never any question as to what I needed to do, it was what can they do for me.  They make sure the custodians clean my room every night as well as the classes Im in.  They are more concerned about me getting sick with the low white count. Regarding students and what they can and cannot wear (district policy) and what I wear was never questioned. Admin cannot state what you have to wear in my district as well as if the students are educated during this process it would make it clearer. My team is all for the natural look, (bald is great) but when I do where a hat there is never a question.  I have been in four other schools within the past month coaching girls b-ball and again no issues, just plenty of well wishers and support. Please research what the law is in your state.  Everyone needs to be educated. Good Luck",
