I had bi-lat mast so there was no breast hanging around getting in the way but the whole area that was radiated did start bubbling off into a seeping mess. And yes, it was terribly painful. Do you have any vicoden or percoset hanging around from surgery? My rads onc told me to use that for pain. Laying in a position so that air can get to it really does help. I would walk around the house all day without a shirt with my arm up in the air, ( would have been considered BIDDING at an auction house ).  I would also spend a fair amount of time in the shower letting warm water run over the tissue to flush out the dead skin. Debriding (dead skin removal) is how burn victims are treated. That's why it's such a long and painful process. The silvadene did work for me when I put it on after the shower and patting dry. Airing out before the silvadene is key. I can tell you that after about two weeks from the end of my rads, you could hardly tell that the area had been such a mess. I am sorry you are having to go thru this misery.  It just doesn't seem fair, eh? But, after all we've been through you will come out the other side wiser and stronger than you ever thought. Hang in there girl.",

I wanted to post a picture in this text but can't get it to work..does anyone know the trick? The disturbing thing is that my eyebrows and lashes have all fallen out again in the past week or so. When they grew in, they were really short, so short that putting mascara on was a major mess so I didn't bother. Now they're gone again.",

Having finished treatment at the end of 2009 and starting to get my body back over this year, I found that I had to break away from these pages so that I could \"get my life back.\" Ironically, the horse thread was the first thing to pop up when I logged in, and boy do I need it! I wasn't strong enough to ride during my whole treatment episode so unfortunately Echo, my 11 year old BLM wild horse that I raised after he was gathered as a weanling, stood around for over a year. One day in June I finally felt ready to \"get back on that horse\" and was feeling really inspired and did something totally stupid. I just hopped up on him bareback in my pasture. I of course had no balance or leg strength, he was surprised and I think a little mortified that I would assume the \"inspiration\" was mutual, so he promptly bucked me off into a pile of rocks and I fractured three ribs, tore cartilage and bruised my lung. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!! My initial response was to quit horses, sell everything and find a new sport, afterall, I hadn't just spent the past year in the hardest battle of my life only to get killed by my horse, right? For the past 3 months he's been up at a friends boarding barn being ridden by several people so that I could have him in shape to sell. Every time I'd go up to check on him they'd tell me how much fun he is to ride and what a great mover he is yadda yadda yadda. I was still feeling the hurt of broken ribs and pretty much held my ground about my decision to sell him. The only thing holding me up  was that several of my friends and I were supposed to ride our horses in the 100 Year Celebration of the Pendleton RoundUp. This parade is one of the last in the country that is non-motorized and usually has about 500-600 horses in it each year. Well, the idea that I'd miss out on the Centennial really started to fester in my mind.  Five days before the parade I got up the nerve to get on my boy. I was really afraid. I just didn't want to get hurt again. I was still very weak. He took such good care of me and the feeling that you get only on the back of a horse seeped into every cell of my body. Three days later we were on our way to Pendleton to spend the week at the rodeo. We did the parade. I sobbed tears of joy practically the whole way. This parade broke the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest number of horses in a parade at over 1600! It was so fun! So, we came home. I'm not selling him, but I am going to keep boarding him so that others can keep riding him until I get my old strength back. I am totally out of breath after about two times around the arena at a trot. It's nice to have a partner to work out with. I keep having that saying in the back of my mind about \"the best thing for the inside of a woman/man, is the outside of a horse.\" So true...........",

I had to put my dreamhorse Kelly, a Morgan mare, down the year before my cancer came along. She's buried out in field with a lovely red maple planted over her. (She's who I'm riding in my avatar photo). I usually have everyone home but decided to board my horse up the road at a boarding barn for the winter because they have a covered arena and it will cause me to get out more in the bad weather to ride. Typically I trail ride, go camping alot in the summer with my horse. We used to be able to go right from the house years ago to trails nearby but over the past 10 years our small town has become a tourist mecca for all things sports related, so the trails are packed with mountain bikers, motorcycles, etc. I usually trailer to whatever neck of the woods within a 30 minute to 1 hour drive that has the best weather that day. Riding in an arena bores the hell out of me and my guy, so I do a lesson every week to keep us motivated and less lazy.",

I have a friend that I've ridden with for years. Both of her Morgan geldings have retired due to lameness issues. She and her husband leave the Pacific Northwest for 6 months each winter. For the past two summers she has leased horses. Both times she wound up with great matches. The first one was a big overweight Hafflinger that was huge, a gentle giant. He was like riding a sofa. This summer she had just the opposite, a really small Icelandic pony, sweet as can be and lots of fun to ride. The best part is when summer is over, she hands them back to their owners and has no committment. Right now with the economy being the way it is, lots of people have horses standing around that could use some love and attention. Putting an ad in your local classifieds or dropping the word at barns in your area letting people know you have interest is a great way to try out several different horses knowing that if it doesn't work out you can return them to their owner and try another.",

I generally keep quite a few toys out in the yard for my guys, two donkeys and my mustang. They like to mess around with hula-hoops, old tires, dog toys and feed tubs, whatever is around. It had been really hot that year and we kept rotating the boys around to the other pastures so we could water the empty ones. My gelding loves to play with the sprinklers. He'll stand right in front of it while it rotates around in a circle and he scoots along with it so that his chest and belly get wet, then he goes over to the dustbowl and rolls...comes back, gets wet, goes and rolls...this can go on for hours. Our irrigation system is run from a pump in one of the pastures next to our barn. I had started the water that morning which always entails priming the pump, moving the hoses, changing pipes all around. About ten minutes after I went back in the house, I noticed the water stopped and I thought a filter needed cleaning so I go out clean the filters, prime the pump essentially do everything all over again, get the water going and go inside to make coffee. Now you see, every time I have to go out to screw around with the irrigation, the boys have to stand there and help me out which then leads to scratching and petting etc. I get my coffee made and sit down with a good book and notice that it's awfully quiet outside....the water is off again....DANG! I storm out the door and head for the pump once again and notice my mustang is standing nearby, sort of waiting for me to get the water started again, hhhmmmmmmm. So, I start the pump again, go inside, peek out the window and see him standing next to the pump, looking at the front door of the house. A few minutes later, he bends his head down and uses his teeth to swing the valve off enough that it causes the pump to turn off, and stands there looking at the door waiting for me to come back out! TALK ABOUT PAVLOVS DOG! My horse had me totally trained. He knew everytime I had to come back out to get the water going it meant another scratch on the belly and \"oh, isn't this game fun Mom?\" Even the donkeys were impressed. Ultimately my husband had to build a box around it and of course the boys were right in there, handing him the tools and telling him how it should be done !!",

By that afternoon I was in the emergency room hooked up to the monitors declaring I had A-fib. By 7:00pm I converted back to normal on my own.  Well, it happened again this go 'round. Except this time it lasted longer. I chose not to go to the ER because I knew there was nothing they could really do except watch me. I finally converted on my own 36 hours later. Other than bone pain from the Neulasta shot, my side effects are minimal. I get Emend, Zofran and Compazine for nausea and vomiting and I am happy to report that they work for me and I have avoided that misery. I wonder if it's all the drugs combined causing the A-fib, or something specific. At this point my Onc has not been able to define any solution. Has anyone else had to deal with this?
