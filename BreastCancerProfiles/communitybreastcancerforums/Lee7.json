The whole article is very interesting and brings up many pros and cons about being able to access your own lab results.  I found out recently that I could do just that through a patient portal site of my cancer center's webpage.  It allows me to see my lab results and also see some of my clinic notes (definately not all of them). This is much easier than going to the place and filling out forms to get copies. ...and there's no wait.   I am concerned about all this medical info being able to be accessed from my home computer. Makes you wonder how safe it all is. And I did have a few lab results that were out of range. Not panicking though!!",

There was a thread asking about it .  The anti-hormonals are for the ER+, so I think the higher ER+ a tumor is.. the more benefit you get from taking one of the anti hormonals for 5 years.  The Onco test does look at ER/PR with a different type of test than what my lab used and I think its more sensitive. Maybe more accurate?  There are other members who know more about this and may be of more help. I am just recalling what I read on other threads here and on the Oncotype website itself. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/108/topic/770063?page=2#idx_52   This was one of the recent threads talking about Oncoscore and miotic rates etc. (edited to add the thread I found)",

It allowed the machine to track the movement of my chest as I breathed in.  When I had taken a deep breath enough to register in a specific 'zone', then I would hold my breath. The radiation would turn on (for about 15 seconds). If I exhaled, or moved out of that 'zone' then the radiation stopped.  Once I was back in the zone, it would turn back on until the correct amount of radiation had been delivered.   I felt the procedure made the radiation safer for me.  My Rad Onc explained it as when I took in a deep breath and held it, my heart dropped a bit lower inside my chest  toward my back so it gave  more space between it and the radiation beam.  The danger is more from the radiation hitting the arterty than the heart itself so this helped keep it more out of harms way.  (Hopefully !!) It may be a longer drive for you to the treatment place but if they are doing a more precise job to protect your heart then I think it's well worth it. My drive was almost an hour to get there...and everyday for 5 weeks, but I felt much safer. Lee",

After xrays showed nothing, a nurse pointed out a very small line of blisters along a rib. I would've thought they were just pimples.  I only remember the sharp pains, not really how long it all lasted for, but if that was the shingles, I certainly don't want them again.

For anyone who want to read in depth about the Oncotype test, you can go to their website, www.oncotypedx.com and read under the HeathCare Professional pages.  They have pages just for patients too.",

You might want to look for threads under the \"Chemotherapy\" topic about Cytoxan & Taxotere. They can tell you what to expect about side effects. ",

I am seriously worried about my job, and afraid if I appear disabled, I'll be on the list to go. I have to be able to type. If it gets to a point that I'm unable to, I'm in trouble.

It bumped this thread up to where I read it again and it reminded me that , yes, we can still have nerve pain and tenderness years after as things heal and change due to the surgery and radiation. I am still experiencing it but have found too that limiting salt, continuing to do gentle stretching exercises, and resting my arm on that side when it flares up has helped some.  I agree that the anxiety/fear is hard to get over.  I'm still working on that one!",
