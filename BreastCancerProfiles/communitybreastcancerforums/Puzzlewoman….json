In my area there is a cancer support community that is fully funded through grants and donations, visitors are never charged. They have been such a huge support to me, like a family. And even though I\u2019ve lived here all my life, I didn\u2019t know it existed until a nurse navigator told me. Maybe there is something like this near you? Best wishes ❤️",
