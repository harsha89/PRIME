She has 4 children, 18, 14, 12, and 10 and 4 step kids (me and my siblings) and has been married to my dad for 12 years. Her and I are only 8 years apart. Last week my dad tells me she found a lump in her breast and thought it was a cyst. She actually had the lump for months before going to the dr. She went to the doctor on last friday and was sent immediately for an u/s. The dr told her right then that it was cancer and then they did a bx on Monday morning. The tumor is 3.3x3.1x2.5 cm and they suspected it was in her lymph nodes as well and possibly thyroid. Her biopsy came back today. The dr said it was \"the most aggresive form\" of cancer and that it was in \"several\" lymph nodes. My dad didnt know the name and didnt want to ask. They go for a meeting with the dr tomorrow to discuss options. The dr told my dad that it was the form of cancer that is not survivable. Said that he has seen a few women survive several years, but said that most likely she will not live a long time. SO.......I live 1700 miles away and I am sitting here desperately trying to wrap my head around this. I plan to go home next week to be with them and the kids. Can anyone give me any advice, hope, support?? I want to do whatever I can do for her and my dad and my siblings right now. Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
