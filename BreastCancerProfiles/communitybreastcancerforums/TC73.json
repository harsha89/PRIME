I scheduled my appointments for the afternoon so I could go from work to treatment and then straight home. The first couple of days after treatment I came home and got straight into my PJ, but after putting on 8 pounds since surgery this week I have been coming home and going for a short walk - I feel like I need to start geting back into a fitness routine, not only because of the amount of weight I have put on but also because it helps me to clear my head and relax. We are all different and I would encourage you all to do what feels right for you, be that working or taking time off. Don't feel guilty or allow anyone to make you feel guilty about working or taking time off - do what is best for you. ",

Joytx, sending positive thoughts and a hug your way & congratulations - you are nearly half way through your treatments. Stay positive, you have got this üòÑ LilyCh - that's an interesting article. Since DX I have learnt from this forum that it's uncommon for two people to receive the same treatment plan. I am having 21 treatments (7 completed), I'm unsure of the total dosage - maybe I should know but to be honest I was more interested in how many treatments I would be having. For skin care I am using Nivea and Aquaphor morning and night; I also take a small tube of Nivea with me and straight after treatment (before I get dressed) I cover the area with more Nivea. The ONLY reason I am using Nivea is because I was advised to stick with my regular moisturiser. So far it's working for me, but I also have Aloe Vera on hand and ready to use if needed.",

Congratulations, you got through day one - mark it off the calendar and be proud of yourself. Hopefully things will be easier for you tomorrow. I really believe that we do not pay enough attention to our mental health, actually I don't think anyone on my medical team has spoken to me or offered me any type of mental health care. I am very grateful for this group and for all of you who are happy to share your experiences, thoughts and well wishes. Tomorrow is day 16 and then I move on to 5 X boosts. I'm tired, I have a rash (it's itchy), and today I have been feeling really emotional and there have been a few tears... Sometimes I need to remind myself that this is hard and it's ok to cry. Sending hugs and positive thoughts to all of you.",

Moisturiser, lots of water, and a gentle walk around the park have all helped me.",
