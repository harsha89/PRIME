Not only did I have it in the breast it is also in my bones. Do not be scared they have come along way with treatments.1980 Was 28 years ago. I was on Taxol, Avastin, and once a month Zumeta for the bones. My oncologist gives pre-meds when you go, before you start any chemo and it helps with nausea and reactions. I also took decadron the night before. I have not have any complications and have done exceptionally well. Everything I read about BC it tells you to stay busy and have a good  attitude, which I have. I am still working 4 days a week also. I will tell you one thing though, you can't make this alone without the Lord Jesus Christ, he is the great physician and healer. I pray daily for HIS guidance and strength and HE will see you through. Trust your oncologist , sit down and talk with them and they will help you in anyway they can. Feel free to email me and we can chat. cadavis1944@windstream.net",
