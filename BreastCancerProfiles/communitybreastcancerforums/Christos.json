    "Content": "Christos wrote: Hi everyone,This is the first time I have wrote or talked to strangers about my situation.  My mom was diagnosed with depression in 2003.  I took her to the hospital at least 20x in two years, depression, anxiety is what all the doctors told me.  I asked if my mother had cancer out of the blue one day, they thought i was crazy.  Well March 2006 I got this horrible news, they told my mom that they can't take the 7cm tumor in her breast out.  They gave her two years and the \" quality of life\".  She is still with me but Iam noticing changes very quickly.  I drive around and just cry and I don't know what I am going do with out her.  Next time you see or know someone that is constanly depressed think twice IT COULD WORSE.
