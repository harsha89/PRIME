Do you have either of these benefits available through your employer? I did a buy-up for my LTD and will be able to access my employer's group medical, dental and vision plans for 24 months. I applied for Social Security Disability as soon as I transitioned to LTD, and Medicare will be available to me in 24 months so I won't have a break in benefits. Yes, I'll have to find a secondary insurance and make sure I pick the best Rx plan for me. I agree this is a highly personal decision. It works for me because I wanted to decrease as much stress as possible and feel that taking care of myself is my full time job.",

My tumor markers decreased, my CBC and CMP values are all within normal range. I guess cancer is not logical. Though MSK nurse mentioned two trials to me, I don't believe I'm interested in either one. She stated the first trial was for Her2+ people-well according to my liver bx my Her2 status remains negative. The 2 trial is blind - you don't know if you're getting the trial med or not. That definitely doesn't work for me I don't know if it's because it's been a difficult day and I've had a lot to process, but I'm really ok with starting chemo. Do I like the thought of a port?-no I don't. Who looks forward to losing their hair? No-one. But I'm ready to use something that's been proven and hopefully not only beats the cancer back, but gets rid of it. I feel the same as you - something tried and true. The trial med did a job on my body. I developed hyperglycemia, dealt with a bad reaction to Metformin and subsequently have been on four oral meds to tame my blood sugar. I'm looking forward to a glass of \"real\" Pepsi. My local oncologist mentioned Abraxane several months ago when my liver lesions were first discovered. I'll share if that's what she offers now. I've already been in touch with her via email today and hopefully will see her tomorrow. I know we'll talk one way or another. I've spoken to my surgeon and he stands ready to insert a port when I'm ready. But first, I'm going to Turks & Caicos with very very good friends and now I can't eat and drink whatever I want! I believe I'm going to be fine, that conventional chemo is the way to go now, and the chemo will do a great job on the cancer. I've got to have hope.",

When I was on Ibrance-my oncologist jockeyed with the dosage and frequency of the med. I ended up on 75 mg every other week and along with Faslodex exceeding our expectations of attacking my breast cancer in my bone marrow. Now, with progression to my liver we're approaching administration of Abraxane the same way. So far I s a 70% dose 2 weeks on /1 week off. My numbers are holding their own and I feel great on my first off week. Much less fatigue I'll be scanned at the end of June which will determine if I stay the course or make alterations to dosage/frequency. Scout",

Actually this trial is being held around the world. I know Mass General is also a participating facility. I'm in phase 2 of the trial. I believe I read there are a total of 157 participants in phase 2 and MSK has 25 slots. I asked this week, and the majority of women in phase 1 are still taking the med and phase 3 has not been outlined yet. The trial is currently scheduled to run until 2020. Yes, I did experience a side effect, hyperglycemia! This s is a common SE of the gdc-0077. And it was awful. I had an allergic to metformin, one of the anti-glucose meds, and it took a few days to recover from that, and then it took time to come up with the correct combo of meds (4 oral with insulin only to be used as a \"rescue\" med if my glucose shoots up). And a big change in diet! Now I feel I've settled in nicely in the past three weeks. I'm working hard on my end to recalibrate my eating and drinking as it's what I have control of. My body is very sensitive to meds (one of the reasons I wanted in on this trial). My strength and stamina are steadily improving so I'm feeling pretty good about things. I'm praying for good scan results and will feel much better once I have that under my belt. My visits to MSK have been weekly and will decrease to every other week starting in April and then monthly beginning in August. I live in Ct and it's a three hour drive each way so I'm looking forward to April",
