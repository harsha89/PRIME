My boyfriends mom was diagnosed with breast cancer as recent as this month..today she went in for surgery and they removed a breast..they are sending her home tomorrow, just like that? Where is the care and the aftercare? I don't understand the \"Lack of Compassion\" for patients even with ALL the money being raised for Cancer & Cancer Patients why are they being treated so cold ? This is Canada and I am ashamed right now to be canadian :( Log in to post a reply",

My goodness it all sounds like to me as if she took a car to a mechanic and he removed a bad part and sent the car back to the customer... are people like objects when it comes to the medical proffession? one of the highest paying careers out there and thats what we get..? we are no more than a number on a chart and a raise in the Doctors bank accounts....and that folks is why there will never be a cure for cancer nor any concern for the cancer patient and any other such illness..   :(   There was once a time when doctors where paid with farm animals...and ran outta town if they didn't show 'care' for their patients.. they musta done some fancy manipulating to come this far in thier pay and arrogance.. some day I hope Canadians grow a certain body part and take back the control from these \" Proffesionals & Politians \" till then I'm still ashamed to be canadian till we grow those ....thx again but I'm still looking for \"WHY\"",
