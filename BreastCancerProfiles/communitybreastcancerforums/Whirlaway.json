I was shocked too when I found out. I searched back then and found a few more with high KI 67, 2 with 90, one with 95 one with 100 %, if I remember correctly. They were two years ahead of me back then which I found reassuring! I hope everyone is still doing well! BTW, my onc. nor surgeon ever commented on it.  Wishing you best of luck!! I know it is so scary in the beginning. ",

I always was/am on a healthy, high fiber diet and had no problems during chemo but two weeks into rads that changed. I think in my case, part of it had to do with the position they put me in during radiation. I have osteoarthritis on L3/L4 (lower back) from an accident years ago. I just think I got a bit 'misaligned' with all that 'fidgeting' they did to get me in the right position. I have been seeing an osteopath for my old injury for years and she said that I felt especially stiff after radiation and it is getting better now. The other part was possible the long drive every day -  1 h each day - and change of my meal schedule as I had different appt. each day. It is hard on your body not to have healthy rhythm. Two more weeks and then you are done. Hang in there and best wishes!",
