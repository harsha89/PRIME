I'd also mention your treatment by that radiologist. It may be that your surgeon has no choice in who she sends her patients to for exams - but maybe she does.

(I'll spare you the details) So I guess I was sick. If I had to get health insurance it would be difficult, if I had to get life insurance (a concept that has always escaped me) I wouldn't be able to or I would have to pay an awful lot. They surely won't take my blood donation which pains me because the donations of others kept me going. So I guess I am sort of tainted or something. I have lingering side-effects, my fingers and feet are bit numb, my nails are sort of crumbly, my hair still does peculiar things. I have to be a bit mindful because I've had axial node dissections on both sides twice. So I guess I'm a bit disabled. Three rounds of breast cancer but I still don't regard myself as sick.

In Toronto, there is a lot of support stuff available, Willow, Wellspring, and Princess Margaret hosp.  Willow is mostly an information resource now I think, but they used to do peer support.  You could google them and see what they have now. How are you feeling?",

There is a Canadian section so you might find a kindred spirit close by but SK is a big place.  I do feel for you, dealing with another round of BC and your husband must be hard, not to mention livestock.  That is way too many unrelenting needs. You didn't ask for advice, but have have you tried Biotene mouthwash or toothpaste?  They help some.  I smoked for years and finally kicked it with patches and Zyban.  I was on taxol (taxotere's cousin) with my second round of BC and I will say it was awful.  Strange - it's easy for some, and ghastly for others and no one seems to know why.  Heating pads helped a bit with the joint/muscle pain and I was on a diet of beef broth and fruit yogurt for the last couple weeks. Let us know how it goes for you. ",
