I had a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound on Friday February 24 and a core Biopsy Tuesday, February 28, all in Kamloops. 6 days. Very fast. Wondering how long is typical to wait for biopsy results. This lump is in same spot where another lump was excised and diagnosed as ADH five years ago.",

Mary 2011, I am happy for your B9 results :) Gloryof the '80's and Bapsplus5 I await your news of B9 results !  ",

Lots of support there :) I don't know if I like what I have been reading on the internet.  It would be more comforting if I had genetic imformation.   It's frustrating for me because I'm adopted and I do not know my medical history. I have inquired into having genetic testing but because I do not have family history, I do not meet the criteria.  It is suggested that I pay the 4000.00 for the test in the US.  patti",
