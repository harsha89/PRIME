So, I have two questions.... Wearing the wig hasn't seemed to have any effect on the new hair growing, am I right on thinking there's no harm in wearing it?  The other question is about color.... I feel like I wouldn't mind the short hair as much if it was at least my own normal color.  Will coloring it damage the hair? I've been told using a \" natural\" hair color isn't going to cover all,this grey and white.  If I use normal hair dye, will it slow down my hair regrowth?   It's like the hair growing in at the back of my head is my old color - will the old color ever come back all over?  ",

When it was gray it was very kinky, the color made it softer so it was literal ringlets. It's still pretty curly in the back, though much flatter n top as it starts to grow out more. I blow out the front. Another thing I did that I feel really helped - I only washed my hair, when it was super short, once a week. Even now I do two or three times a week. This was recommended to me by a friend who has the most amazing long hair, and I feel like it really worked.You have to understand, prior to losing my hair with chemo my hair was very fine and literally NEVER grew. I was so afraid it would never grow back, or it would take forever since pre chemo I had little to no growth. anotherNYCgirl, I haven't seen that brand anywhere for sale either. I use their shampoo and conditioner too, I have to buy it at the salon, I can't find it. I never n my life had my hair colored at a salon before chemo, but a fellow survivor at work told me about a local place that was all organic, and I was afraid to color my hair myself because I had no idea if the color would take. I was really pleasantly surprised that t lasts as long as it does. I don't even get a blowout to keep the price down lol",

I wasn't gray at all prior to chemo but my hair grew back very gray, and at 49 I wasn't thrilled....it didn't look like me in the mirror. After about 10 months PFC I went to an organic salon and had my hair colored. The stylist was excellent, she had colored hair for people post chemo before. Looks exactly like my old color, and if anything my hair has grown in even better- I'm sorry now I waited so long to do it. Prior to chemo my hair was very fine, it's actually in much better shape now. I also use organic shampoo and conditioner. The brand name of the color is Davines. Wish I had looked better with the gray... I definitely didn't. Also the texture of it was very coarse, the coloring makes it softer and easier to style. My hair did not grow at all during Taxol...probably took a good month PFC to get going. I did take Biotin throughout Taxol and still take it daily. Iwas so afraid it wasn't going to grow back! At 19 months PFC its 8 inches long.... I can remember measuring it every day like it was yesterday. It's like, one day you wake up and you have hair again. Seemed like it happened overnight.  ETA: sorry if that sounded like an ad for the color - just wanted to share the resource, it was one of my biggest questions when my hair was growing out. ",
