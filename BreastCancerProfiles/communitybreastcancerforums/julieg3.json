I was stressed to the max over first treatment. 4 AC and 12 Taxol regimen. The 1st AC went surprisingly well. I am on day 4 following the treatment and can tell each day after gets better. I am just a little tired. No nasuea. The first day after treatment I felt great, little woozy in the morning just had to eat every couple hours. The 2nd day first thing in the morning was the same. 3rd day morning was worse had to actually take a pill. The woozy feeling would only last untill I would eat. I am pleasently suprised on the side effects at this time. I didnt feel anything while 1st treatment took place. When it was over and got up felt just a little light headed. I hope this is a sign that I can handle the remaining AC;s as well ",
