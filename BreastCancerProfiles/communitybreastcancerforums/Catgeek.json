Just like the crazy name for medicines and bad doctor handwriting unfortunately insurance companies use blunt sterile terms. Do what you need to work through this cry, scream, shout or laugh just don't hold it inside and come here and vent all you want.",

Being a geek who can't research things enough, ever since the first squish I kind of knew this was coming. MRI on the 1st and hopefully surgery on the 11th. They are waiting on an OR opening. I've decided on BMX with no recon. I'm a 'stuff happens so let's move on' kind of person but every now and then my hands shake and I get sick to my stomach but I guess the stress has to come out somewhere. I do have some extra help though. One of my co-workers was diagnosed last year with IDC and has been a wealth of info and help along with recommending a great surgeon. I have also found this site and the class of May 2012.",

I did my pre-screen call yesterday and they told me nothing after midnight to eat but then she said, well it's really 8 hours prior but you wouldn't be up at 4:30 AM. I surprised her when I said, I actually wake up at 4 to feed my cats as that is the normal time I wake up for work. So nothing solid after midnight and then only clear liquids until 4:30. No sugar in tea or coffee and only 8 ounces. I was checking out my insurance coverage, as that has been my biggest worry, and when I talked with the benefits rep it turned out she was a Survivor. She told me everything was covered. I told her my doc said I would be in the hospital overnight. She said to make sure the admission is coded as a true admission and not just admitted for observation as that makes it out patient. The charge codes are different. The financial difference is huge. I pay only $200 for the hospital stuff (non surgery stuff) if admitted, but if it's out patient with an overnight hospital stay I now pay 20% of all the hospital charges. I'm still trying to find the person who actually directs what code to use but ran out of time on Friday. I'm definitely going to start again on Monday My appetite seems to be back and i'm looking forward to my Saturday brunch. I did manage to embarrass one of my big bosses on Friday. My coworkers filled my cube with pink balloons and ribbons on Tuesday so I have them pinned and taped all over. He likes to prowl around on Fridays with his assistant. I was on the phone and suddenly there he was. I put the call on hold and after saying Hi he says \"the pink balloons are pretty what are they for?\". My direct management knew but evidently the info never made it up the line. It was really funny to see him scramble when I told him. I was almost tempted to say 'I just like pink'. Just before I left for the day his assistant came by to apologize for interrupting my phone call. Go figure, that is what he felt bad about? Since I am the second lady among 8 in our group to be diagnosed within in the last year and both of us with IDC you would think they might have an idea what pink might mean. Anyway, here is wishing my best to those who have taken that first step and the rest of us who will be there soon. To quote Buzz Light-Year 'To infinity and beyond!'. I'm moving forward to kick this thing in the butt!!",

The first time I went to pee was when I was just ready to get my next pill. What was funny was the side that hurt was the one where they didn't take any nodes. Once I got my med I was ok. The second time was just fine. I was very lucky and had no nausea. My surgery was at 12:30 but i couldn't eat after midnight and I didn't get to the room until after 5:00. I was hungry!!! Luckily I was able to get a dinner tray, later a ham and Swiss box lunch and crackers, jello and puddings. And I don't know if it was the pain meds but it all tasted great. Steerersluver I hope yours went well too. Good luck to all the rest. A speedy recovery to all",

It sounds really nice and comfortable and I received a UPS notification that it would be here the 7th. That was standard shipping but they did offer speedier options. Val, I'm looking forward to how things go for you and wish every one an easy path. I hope the OR has a spot for me on the 11th. Is anyone besides me having problems with eating? I'm either too sick to my stomach to eat or I can't get enough fruit veggies and bagels. If it wasn't for the fact I had a hysterectomy many years ago I would swear I was pregnant. Every Saturday we go to do the shopping stoping first to get breakfast and just the smell made me sick. I was barely able to go shopping as even the bakery upset my stomach. Sunday was better but I went on a mega cleaning binge and didn't eat much but made sure I drank a lot of water. And today every thing was back to normal. I've been doing this since the biopsy results came back so I'm pretty sure it's the stress but was wondering if you all were doing this too Also for those with pets are your critters following you around more than usual? I seem to have two cats as an addition to my wardrobe.",

Every day it sinks in a little more and I try not to spend all my free time researching the same thing over and over. I also am trying to find distractions to keep from thinking about it all the time. I'm really trying to look around and as they say, enjoy the moment. With spring having arrived so early every chance I get I'm looking at the birds, flowers and even the clouds. I also like to people watch but right now that's harder as I get this feeling I want to shout 'I have BC'. Don't know why but I do. Maybe if I keep spreading out the news it won't seem so bad. But in the meantime I am doing my best to focus on my next step, a MRI, which I really find uncomfortable and then a date with my Doc. Focus on the beauty around you but keep looking forward too.",
