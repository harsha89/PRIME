I go to the surgeon tomorrow and I'm sure he will give me the option of watching and waiting or getting them out. I've already decided they are coming out asap!  Anyway, I really admire you guys! I'm getting the breast cancer bike and my friend bought me the Brighton breast cancer necklace.  I'm now a huge supporter of breast cancer research.  Sorry it took this for that to happen. You guys are the best! Log in to post a reply",

Can anyone tell me what this is? The doctor kinda explained it and it sounds like I have to keep a good watch on this..... here's what the pathology report says\" fibrocystic changes seen in the sections include fibrosis, microcysts, apocrine metaplasia, adenosis including sclerosing adenosis, and ductal epithelial hyperplasia including focal atypical hyperplasia. Involvment of the biopsy margin by atypical hyperplasia is not seen. There are scattered intraglandular microcalcifications.",

Worrying and waiting is absolutely the worst!",
