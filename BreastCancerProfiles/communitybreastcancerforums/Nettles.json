I am back for a six month follow up mammogram to continue tracking it. I understand what you\u2019re saying. I sometimes feel like I am playing Russian roulette, just waiting for the diagnostic test that will result in a mastectomy but I do take comfort in the fact I am being so well monitored so if/when something is found it is so likely to be at the early stage. So I go back the beginning of April, which is still far enough away that I don\u2019t think about it every day! Take good care! Nettles  ",

      "Content": "Nettles wrote: I was diagnosed with LCIS in 2014 (discovered with stereotactic and excision biopsies after 2014 mammogram detected increased calcifications in my right breast) and my mother had DCIS so I am now considered high risk. Since 2014 in addition to an annual mammogram, I have bi-annual office visits with my breast surgeon and I have had two MRI mammograms. My annual mammogram in late March 2017 found an asymmetry in the right breast and I was called back for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. The asymmetry could only be found on one view on the mammogram and apparently was not evident on the ultrasound. The radiologist recommended that I return in six months for a follow up diagnostic mammogram but after talking with my breast surgeon I was referred for a second MRI, the results of which I have copied below: FINDINGS: Comparison made to prior MRI (2014) and mammography exams (2017-2014). There is heterogenous fibroglandular tissue. There is mild to moderate background parenchymal enhancement. There are innumerable foci of non mass enhancement scattered about both breasts with low suspicion kinetics that look similar to prior. Post surgical changes at the right breast are stable. No evidence for dominant mass, abnormal enhancement or suspicious appearing kinetic curves. No evidence for skin thickening, lymphadenopathy or lesions of the visible anterior chest wall. After the MRI was read it was been recommended that I still return in six months for another diagnostic mammogram. The term \u201cmild to moderate background parenchymal enhancement\u201d is new to me. I did a bit of research and it seems that this is yet another high risk marker for breast cancer for someone already determined to be high risk. I am wondering if anyone has had a similar finding on her MRI mammogram and if so how was it followed? Thank! Nettles Log in to post a reply",

I am due back the first week of October, first for a mammo to follow up on the asymmetry; I suppose to see if it's grown, and then next day to review the results with my oncologist. I will also have a chance to talk with her about the significance (or hopefully lack thereof) of the parenchymal enhancement found in my last MRI mammogram. I'll be sure to let you know what I learn about this finding. I should add that I am 57 and have always been diagnosed with heterogeneously dense breasts. Sending you hugs! ",
