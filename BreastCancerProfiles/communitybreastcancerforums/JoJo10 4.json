What I wanted to share with those headed for their own post-surgery experience is the feeling of RELIEF on a cellular level that I had immediately after surgery. I don't know if others have experienced this, and it sounds kind of weird, but even though I only had DCIS, stage 0 (which was blessedly confirmed in the pathology from surgery), I still had this sense that my healthy cells were celebrating, breathing a sigh of relief, after the departure of their delinquent, mutant cousin cells. And now, the healing journey unfolds.  I have this tight elastic \"girdle\" around me that drives me alittle crazy but my surgeon shared with me some insights that help me understand why it's so important to rest and allow the drains & girdle to do their job: TISSUES THAT REST HEAL BEST Right now, the skin needs to heal back to the muscle.  There are tiny capillaries forming--and if you move around and do too much, these break.  This was evidenced by the red color my drain fluid took on again (it had turned more orange/clear a few days after surgery).  I have two kids under 6 years old so being \"still\" is hard.  Even so, i am really trying to embrace the Princess lifestyle--and fortunately have a sweet husband and others who can help wait on me hand & foot. Also, if you do too much, fluid can build up under the skin.  I got a seroma after my core needle biopsy and it HURT. So, my advice, is share with your community and allow people to help you!  I set up a page on Caring Bridge to share the journey and it has been SO great to have friends & family follow along, post comments, and be able to help out when needed. Best, healing wishes to you all!  Thanks for sharing. <3",
