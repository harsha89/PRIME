I bought an airline ticket, a new dress, and booked a hotel room for a friend's wedding in Charleston. One night, I was sitting at my desk, working and thinking how much I was looking forward to the wedding, when I  glanced at the date and realized she was getting married that night.  I lost a bike for good on the street, couldn't find doctor's offices I'd been going to for years, etc. Things got a lot better, though, after about six months. Hang in there.  Kathy ",

I was having dinner with a friend who works at the Science Times and was telling her about them, and she suggested this piece. The story's kind of a tribute to the board. I don't post a lot, but I lurk and I feel so connected to people on here. The story's also a call to the medical community to find a way to do more innovative research, NOW.   My agent just forwarded on this email and I wanted people to see. it. Here's to every one of you.  <<I read Katherine Russell Rich's piece in the Times and was inspired. I admire Katherine's ability  to approach her medical care with courage and tenacity. But more so, I was affected by the description of the online survivor's group of which she is part. I have always found that no matter where you are--even if you don't speak the language or understand the customs--women will take care of their own. It's reassuring to hear that this is true of cyberspace as well.>> With love and hope, as much as we can muster, Kathy ",

When, disbelieving, I complained to my oncologist, she said, \"Oh I hate when he does that.\"",

BAD stomach stuff, headaches, dizziness, days in bed with utter exhaustion, couldn't keep weight on. YOU HAVE ALL MY SYMPATHY. But the Xeloda has been getting me good results and I'm glad now I hung in and worked out solutions. First, My onc dropped the dose down and that helped a lot. You might want to investigate that. Also, you might get relief if you take it one week on, one week off--I'd ask, if you're not already doing that, if you can. And the vomiting/diarrhea was causing me to get badly dehydrated without knowing it. Now, if I have any of that, I make sure to drink a truckload of liquids, especially Gatoraide or anything with electrolites. It was the dehydration that was mainly causing the headaches and exhaustion. So we cut down on the dose, I figured out how to manage some of the side effects (ate a lot of bananas and rice to combat the diarrhea), and my body had time to adjust to the Xeloda. Now I find each cycle gets easier and I can happily live on this stuff. Good luck. Kathy",

Ie, is there any way they can say the Fasolodex wasn't working when it could have been the Epogen wreaking havoc? Log in to post a reply",
