This was followed by 4AC and 37 Rads. I have been on Arimidex for a little over a year. I am 59 years old. My BS alternates between mammo and MRI every 6 mos. I had an MRI a couple of weeks ago and it showed a focal area of progressive enhancement in the same breast that I originally had cancer in. So... I am really scared about what the biopsy might find. I know I'm getting way ahead of myself, but that's me. I'm imagining all kinds of things. Please help me get through this. My husband and I are taking our son on a cruise in a week and a half for my retirement/son's college grad., so I'm trying to be positive. He doesn't know anything about this. I will be grateful for any and all help you can give me. DeniseW Log in to post a reply",

My husband and I were looking at cameras at the time and I told him I wanted to shout, cry, and dance right in the middle of the store. I will see my BS when I return from my trip as he said I have a choice to make. He said he was confident either way. I can have another MRI now to make sure the right spot was biopsied (he knows what a worry wart I am), or I can wait 6 mos. and have an MRI then. The doctor that did the biopsy is highly regarded in her field and I trust my BS completely, so I am probably going to go back in 6 mos. Thanks to everyone for their positive vibes. Everyone on this board is in my prayers! DeniseW",
