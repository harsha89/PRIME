Around a few weeks ago a red itchy rash appeared on my right breast, i went to the doctors about it as it was so uncomfortable and i just wanted to scratch it all the time. Seen two different doctors about it and they prescribed steroid creams. Tried those and although it didn't really improve, it didn't make it any worse. Anyway a few days later the rash dissapeared. The last few days this particular breast has been feeling really uncomfortable, sore and itchy again. It feels lumpier and heavier than the left breast and i woke this morning to find the rash was back but a lot worse than it was the last time. It covered a lot more of my breast than it did the first time. It is extremely itchy and the breast is sore to touch or move. Went back to the doctors today and she agreed it looked quite sore and red and said it looked like a breast infection and prescribed antibiotics however she didn't sound too confident when she said it which is worrying me too. I feel so down at the moment because of all the worrying and this burning itching sensation on my breast is annoying me :( Can anyone shed some light? By the way i am a 25 year old woman with a 20 month old son. P.s How would i upload a picture of it? Log in to post a reply",
