I was on a consistent dose of muscile relaxers, Norco, tramidol and Xanax. I had some serious depression for a couple weeks that i now take meds for too. Keep an eye on her for this, it is very common for this to happen. After 4 weeks I started to feel better slowly also after my first fill the expanders felt more tolerable and that got better each fill for the first few. The only way I was able to sit up in bed was to kind of hook my toes under the outer edge of the bed and use my legs and abs to sit up and rotate off the bed. Please tell your wife it does get better, she just has to make through the first few weeks",
