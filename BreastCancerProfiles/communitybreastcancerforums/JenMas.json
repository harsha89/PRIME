I didn't think i would ever get through chemo, but i completed 6 rounds on 4-3 and will now start radiation. You will get through it! Netter, the plastic utensils do help. I found that cold foods tasted better. I was never fond of jello but it tasted good during chemo! Wishing for low SE days for everyoneÂ  :)",

Although i have many great friends nobody quite \"gets it\" unless they've experienced it. Had 2nd chemo on 1/3/13. It's becoming increasingly more difficult to sleep through the night. Aside from days 1-5 when i have no energy and sleep well, the rest of the time has been like this. Anyone else have this experience?",
