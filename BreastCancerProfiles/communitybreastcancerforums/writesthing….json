I'm hanging in there, but I'm obviously not a happy camper at the moment.  Guess I'll be hanging out on the other boards soon...",

But God, it's hard sometimes, I know.  I still have occasional crying episodes, or I wake up early in the morning and stare at the ceiling until I finally give up and get out of bed.  For right now, though, I'm trying to live my life as if everything's going to be okay - because no matter what the outcome, I don't want to look back on this time and think, \"Why didn't I just enjoy myself?\" Oh, and the falling down stuff - I've done that off and on for over a year!  In January I even fell and fractured a finger.  But I seriously doubt that anything like cancer is in either of our brains.  If cancer has spread to that point, I think we'd be a lot worse all the way around, not just in our boobs.  :) Hugs to you.  I'll be praying and hoping for all the best.  Keep us posted.",

Thanks again, and I hope your surgery provides more definitive answers for you.",

I'm hoping, praying, and trusting that your own journeys will be successful ones.  I will try to stay away from Dr. Google (heh), breathe, and enjoy life and not worry until I have to.  And I will keep tabs on this topic/forum and let everyone know what happens.  Again, thank you.  (And if anyone else wants/needs to chime in, feel free!) :)",
