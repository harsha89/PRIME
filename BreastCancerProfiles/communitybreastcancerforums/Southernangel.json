He called me again today to reassure me \"if i thought this was anything to be concerned about I would be advising you to prepare yourself, I would not lie to you, I don't think it's anything\". Ok to me atypical cells is a SOMETHING. I'm nervous, I'm scared, I'm sick to my stomach, a constant roaring in my ears/head that won't stop. The breast that he needle biopsied Monday is now throbbing all the way to under the arm with shooting pain. I want to just scream. Everyone has words of comfort to say but I guess I just need to hear from ladies that are going thru this or have been thru this so I don't feel so alone. I have not even been diagnosed with anything and already feel like i have been handed a death sentence and every time i look at my 5 year old (I'm 41) I cry. Last nite he was laying on my lap and i was talking to him telling him how much i love him (he doesn't know what's going on but has seen me crying) he looks up and says \"mama I love you, even if you die I will still love you in here (and pointed to his heart). again i lost it. I just needed to vent tonite and if anyone is reading this no matter what you're going through leave a reply. Let's be here for one another. Thanks bunches! Log in to post a reply",

Went back for another mammo and US. Radiologist \"thinks\" the lump/change he is seeing is from the surgery I had in May 2013. I go back Tues. Feb. 3 after my 3 month wait to see if anything has changed. I have already had this breast biopsied twice. First time it was a thickening-b9, second time needle biopsy showed atypical cells, surgery performed path showed a necrosis-b9. I know surgery can cause lumps to show up on biopsy so are they just going to keep cutting on it? Now I'm worried about those atypical cells on biopsy from 2013 thinking they missed something on surgery. My husband just had surgery for prostate cancer. I guess I just need to vent. Worried about husbands cancer and now this! Need some words of wisdom. It's like a black cloud over our house! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Southernangel wrote: I have had ongoing breast pain for a few months (see other posts) and the bra I was wearing the seam hit right where the pain was so had to stop wearing it. After biopsy years ago I know the surgeon recommended I wear a sleep/sports bra to keep support, anyway, so I bought an ahh bra and it doesn't have seams digging into my side, light support, and comfy enough to sleep in. Only problem is the band tends to roll up which is frustrating. Does anyone have suggestions for a comfy seamless bra that won't roll up on the band? Log in to post a reply",
