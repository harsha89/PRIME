We sample some lymph nodes to draw reasonable conclusion but not factual conclusion. The judgement is helped with imaging the area but imaging technology has limitations. We sample some parts of the breast tissue for final pathology report. This step focuses more on the suspicious/biopsied areas. The whole breast tissue is not made into slides/examined. Some patient might have a tiny coexisting breast cancer with worse prognosis hidden and this second locus is not found out by the lab. She might receive a \"lighter\" or not entirely targeted treatment plan as a result. If there are already circulating tumor cells, she might find out years down the road that despite the double mx and chemo, she has mets that are a completely different subtype (ER status etc).",

However, when I talked to the BS and the MO, they're reluctant. The BS's office states that because the affiliated hospital's pathology department does not deal with Mammaprint, I have to pick up my paraffin blocks and mail them myself. Later the pathologist's office says all of it is not billable and I need to pay on my own. After a couple more back and forth phone calls, I gather that because the pathology doesn't get money out of this (most of work will be done by and reimbursed to Agendia), they're unhappy. Does anybody else also experience this problem? How do you go about it so the hospital personnel doesn't get grumpy?",

It was not prepped with a TE so that side hurt more in the beginning few days post-op. My MX side mimics the TE pretty close, so it looks like a full B (small C) as planned. But I lack fullness in the upper pole and have obvious step effect. Maybe it will fluff later (I'm 10 days post-op) but I wonder if I had insisted on Deborah's advice and got a 320 cc instead, would I be happier? But I won't ask for any revision so I must be relatively happy. :p Jo",

My first biopsy indicated triple negative (ER/PR/HER2-) and second biopsy said ER/PR+ with the cancer cells. Because the treatment plans would have been quite different, you can see how confused I was. I understood receptor staining was about percentage anyway (e.g.30% cells [I made the number up] counted by the pathologist were stained positive, it is considered ER+) but how could one spot was more densely clustered with receptor positive cells than the other? When I consulted my second-opinion MO, she explained that a situation can happen like a pepperoni pizza where the pepperoni represent triple negative cells and the rest of the pizza is akin to the rest of the tumor that has receptor positive cells. If the pathologist sampled the pepperoni (triple negative), he/she would have drawn that conclusion. Same decision making process happens with the non-pepperoni portion. Honestly I still think it doesn't make sense: why within a primary, the cancer cells are heterogeneous. But I want to offer this weird experience of mine. Maybe people have better explanation.",
