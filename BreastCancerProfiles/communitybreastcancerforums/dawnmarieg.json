The 44 yr old sister who was first diagnosed did not have genetic testing done. The 47 yr old sister had a panel done for 16 cancer genes and came back negative on everything. I have talked my youngest sister into genetic testing and has scheduled it for the beginning of June. I find it strange as well that three of us sisters have been diagnosed so recently.  Thanks for your reply!!!",

      "Content": "dawnmarieg wrote: Hi all! Was diagnosed with Stage 2 BC in April 2016. I have chosen to do a bilateral mastectomy. I have a tumor in my left breast 1-2 lymph nodes and a benign mass in my right breast. No family history of breast cancer until March of last year when my youngest sister (44) was diagnosed with stage 0. In February of this year my older sister (47) was diagnosed with stage 2 also. I am not a stranger to cancer, my father has lung cancer and another older sister had thyroid cancer and my youngest brother (32) had lymphoma. After speaking with Oncologist I believe this approach to the double mastectomy is the best decision for me. SO May 26 is my day for surgery. I will have to wait on reconstruction as I had Bariatric Surgery in January of this year and still losing weight so the plastics dr said to benefit me more to wait on reconst until I have lost 50 more pounds. June 22 I get my port put in and start my first chemo of 8 sessions. Then told possibly radiation and 5-10 years of Tamoxifen..... I need opinions. I was told that after my first chemo I would start losing hair. Have any of you cut your hair or buzzed it off totally prior to chemo? I am not attached to my hair or my breast and will wear hats or whatever. Good luck to all my May surgery buddies and those coming in June Dx 4/18/2016, IBC, Left, 1cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 12/20 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 5/26/2016 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 6/22/2016 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",
