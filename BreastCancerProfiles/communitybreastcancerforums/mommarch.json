It is the way to go if you are a candidate.  You may have fatigue, at least I did, it hit me about the 5th treatment.  My tumor was on the inside portion of my right breast next to my chest wall.  They said it was in a very unique place.  The removal of the devce was very easy.  I had a  little redness and some peeling.  I bought fasten down the front cotton sports bras and they feel great.  Actually I am still wearing them at night.  I seem to sleep better bound up.  I decided after I had the port put in for chemo I had better buy a couple more, as I can not wear my form fit bras with the port.  I am 62 and had never owned a sports bra.  Also not only did I wear the front close bras but also wore a button blouse so all I had to do was unbutton everything and did not have to get into a gown.  That was great. Good luck",

On April 18,2015 I had alot of pain and bloating, by Sunday morning April 19 I had horrible pain in right side. DH took me to ER, They ran, CT, ultrasound, etc. flew me off to Odessa Tx. I went home on Monday April 20th. Saw my ONC on April 25th. Breast cancer mets to the liver. Pet scan on April 28, saw ONC on April 29, mets confirmed. On May 7th I started on 2000 mg of Xeloda a day. So far so good, having leg cramps at night and very fatigued. Get my CBC tomorrow at our local hospital. We live in Fort Davis, TX and have to travel 200 miles one way to cancer center. I am 14 days on and 7 days off. CBC every week. I think I will lay down for awhile.",
