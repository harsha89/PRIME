I have to keep the compression wrap (ace bands) on because I have a bleeding disorder but she had him rewrap me. The bands were pulling on the steri strips. I have A LOT less pain now. Thank God.",

I swear my breast are touching my bottom lip. lol Anyone else have this? I have a very high pain threshold and this hurts like heck. Tylenol is like candy. No effect at all. I wonder if a compression sports bra would work just as well without the added pain? I've read how everyone was able to go about their day afterwards and some even went back to work. I didn't expect this. -Deb Log in to post a reply",
