    "Content": "Jul 9, 2008 07:25AM - edited Jul 9, 2008 07:26AM by 41yrpeachgal I have 4 high risk lesions and am having a BPM in August with SNB and expanders/implants (non nipple sparing).  I am wondering and worrying of course about the SNB and wondering if they will find anything as the couldn't actually deem any of my sites to be DCIS or greater.  With my family history of BC and these ALH lesions I am wondering if the invasive cancer is in my breast currently and cells will be in the nodes. I guess I am looking to find others who had lesions, had the PBM with SNB and they discovered through their nodes that they indeed did have cancer-undetective via the core needle biopsies.  Thanks you guys. ",
