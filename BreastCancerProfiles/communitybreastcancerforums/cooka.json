      "Content": "Jan 18, 2013 01:27PM - edited Jan 18, 2013 01:41PM by cooka Hi everyone, I have been lurking, but not posting much, which is generally my MO:)  I was on another board and we were discussing the issue that many of you raised about tailoring treatments/rehab to our stated needs rather than what others think we need.  It prompted this response from me: One of my PT friends interviewed me about my experiences because she is hoping to put something together for health care professionals to get them to consider that women have active, dynamic lives and people treating us should assume we want to resume them after treatment.  This is a very early rough cut she worked on a while back, and I felt like sharing it even though there are some things that might be insensitive because they are strictly from my viewpoint.   One thing that you can see in the film (in addition to my ridiculous glasses!) is that my back is full of fluid (truncal swelling) in the beginning, but in the next couple of months it is all gone due to the paddling.  Almost none of that is related to weight loss. Also, now, many months later, paddling is the way I keep my LE at bay, if I am relatively inactive (like over the holidays) I can feel it start to return a bit.  As you can see, I am flat and thankfully so, because when I asked the PS what would happen when I flexed to take a stroke, she said that my expander would likely jump a bit.  Anyway, I am now (one year later) competing full force and it has really helped me emotionally as well as helping to control the LE (which developed during chemo).   Thought I would share since you have all shared pics, videos, etc., and I appreciate what you have shared.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD69ufUqq7U Some of the women on that board thought I should share it here, although I was somewhat reluctant because my case was very mild and that is how I had so much success...I don't want to seem as though I am somehow minimizing how much effort it takes to try to control LE or giving advice about lymphedema in general because it is so individual (as you have mentioned). Really, for me it was more about how when you meet a professional who listens and tailors things to your needs how wonderful it is and it makes you much more hopeful about recovery...BTW, the PT I talk about in the video was someone Binney told me about...I am very thankful! Best, Anne",

The cap sleeves are a little irritating but the v-neck (and not needing a bra on top) is worth it for ventilation, and it fits very snugly at the axilla (but I am flat so this may help). For yoga I wear no UA shirt and a I sleeve, and for running I wear the UA women's shirt and a I sleeve.  i think the fit of the women's shirt along my obliques is better and promotes better flow. I also have the women's heatgear in tank but i think it is not snug enough at the axilla for sports...I wear it doing other dreaded activities, like shopping at a mall:)  Question about flying- I am taking my first flight back east and am trying to decide to go with a II sleeve or I sleeve. Sometimes if my muscles are not working the II sleeve is irritating, but I am not sure the I has enough oomph at elevation? any suggestions?  thanks!",

The UA helps with bra chafing as well as compression. Then, I wear a medi one piece (sleeve w/gauntlet) and a paddling glove (or a NFL wide receiver glove works too) over that. I started out with a class I but found that I need a class II or else my LE winds up in my forearm.  I actually have found in my case that with this contraption my arm stays white while the other one tans (don't know if this will hold true later in the year). Also, my sleeve has gotten wet and although that is okay for a two hour practice, during a regatta where I had the sleeve on for several hours I ended up with swelling in my hand that I don't usually get. Now I take the sleeve off and do MLD when I am in between workout pieces or races and it seems to be going okay. Went a couple of hour straight last night with no swellling. great to be on the water:)  Glad your surgery went well!",

So while I could have breasts, fully producing ovaries etc., I could still blur the lines of my gender by dressing a certain way (pork-pie hat, etc.) I guess I think of gender as just one more way we identify in-groups or out-groups. Even without my breasts or hormones, and with my height, I could don some foobs and a wig and get a very good response from men who would see me as female gendered. I think I would also get a good response from women who would view me as 'appropriate.'  Right now, the pool of people who will consider me part of their in-group is smaller...but quality versus quantity, yes? As for sex, I do wonder about the influence of all this on my pheromones and other things that are hard to measure but also impact social interactions. My hormones were always a little problematic in some ways, but even so, I miss them. I have found ways around that though (but I am still a newbie), and for now my more superficial social interactions are more interesting to sort through.  I think for me, feeling sex-y has been more closely tied to feeling confident in my gender rather than my sex. The type of people who view me as attractive now are the type of people I want to attract...I am very \"feminine \" in many ways, and people who recognize this in me don't need breasts or long hair as a signpost to figure it out.

I bought some Under Armour shirts but I am also supposed to wear foam block thingies (I am sure they have a better name) under each arm...so I wear an UA shirt, with foam blocks over that, and a bra over that. I did not have reconstruction and finding a bra that hits in the right places without rubbing is tough (the UA helps with chafing). I have been running in this getup, but can't imagine doing this forever. Has anyone tried triatholon compression suits (unis) for sports/workouts? I'm wondering if i can forego the blocks and bra (really p o'ed that I'm still stuck wearing a bra with no boobs) and invest in a good sports compression suit. Realize I need to run this by my therapist but just curious if anyone was doing this...thanks!",

For me, I am glad I did it, if for no other reason than I feel like I used the full weight of current evidence based research to tip the scales in my favor. I look forward to the day we have other solid, tested, and well published options that are as (if not more) effective.    I had many side-effects, but they were manageable...and for me, worth my peace of mind. The worst SE's I experienced were 3 days of flu-like feelings each cycle and 2 days of neulasta bone pain (which were manageable). I also lost hair, and look horrible bald. Oh well.  I had a host of other annoying SE's: eye twiches, tearing eyes, leg fatigue, taste deprivation, some anxiety.  I was able to do yoga and walk 3 miles per day, and I still found life to be generally enjoyable throughout treatment...in other words, even with my SE's I still felt very glad to be alive:)   I have no regrets now that I am finished, and am now researching all the other holistic options I have to help prevent recurrence. I am at a high risk for recurrence, but if it happens it won't be because I didn't use the tools available to me (including chemo).",

      "Content": "Dec 6, 2011 12:00PM - edited Dec 6, 2011 12:12PM by cooka AA, I guess the main reason I was having such a hard time following you is because I was missing the piece where you seem to think everyone is beating down the door to get chemo, and if some other treatment were offered we would still insist on chemo to be \"on the safe side.\"  Even so, you have presented a lot of info- but I have seen nothing that presents a viable alternative that is available today supported by stats. I came on this thread because I made my decision fairly recently, and did a lot of reading before I did it. In August, I had never even heard of triple negative breast cancer. I was terrified of chemo, and as a long distance athlete, thought I would rather take my chances with cancer. The research I read just didn't support that decision though, so here I am. I read your posts with interest looking for an indication that I missed something making my decision. Originally my reason for stopping by though was that I wanted to tell other people like me that it is frightening, and I had side effects that continue past tx, but I am at peace with my decision and feel the toxic onslaught was worth it! I understand you feel that this is \"newbie\" optimism, but I don't think so.  I wish I had better timing with my cancer and could wait for the new stuff, but c'est la vie. I do think now that the pipeline of psychotropic medications has started to dribble, we will see a lot more money thrown at cancer (not that there isn't an enormous amount already). I think that although research is hampered by things like professional responsibility;) there are some brilliant minds out there \"putting it to\" some poor lab rats in an effort to find something that will help us put down the chemo Kool Aid and move to the next thing (which is sure to have its negatives too). Anyway, thanks for the disussion! anne",

Anyway, I did closely look at my options ( I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't) and chose chemo. I'm sure it will effect me, and if I am still here in 10 years to let people know what those effects are, I will not know for sure if I can thank the chemo...but I probably will anyway. Wish we did have more research though to make things easier and quell some of the debate.",

In my case, wearing a sleeve while paddling has actually made my LE MUCH better than when I was relatively inactive (of course it was during chemo so that helps, right ? :)  I recommend finding a good LE PT and letting them now you want specific exercises to get you back on the water...and see what they think about wearing a sleeve prophylatically..the guys in the NBA do it, why not us?
