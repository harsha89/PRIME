    "Content": "Maleah wrote: I'm new here and have a few personal questions. In April of 2013 I had a lumpectomy on my left breast for dcis. My nipple was removed. I did 7 weeks of radiation & have been on tamoxifen with little issues (some night sweats) I am 45 soon to be 46. In March I had a breast lift on my right (the good breast) and cleaned up the scar and did some liposuction on the left (dcis breast) side. With hopes of creating a more even look. It's only been 6 weeks but I'm disappointed in the look when I'm naked...they look fine in a padded bra. How long does it typically take for things to \"even out\"? If I raise my left arm things look even (keep that pose ;)) I meet with my plastic surgeon next Thursday and plan to discuss this. He came highly recommended & I'm guessing I'm being impatient?! Words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. After I get the right look I plan to have nipple reconstruction & tattooing. Log in to post a reply",
