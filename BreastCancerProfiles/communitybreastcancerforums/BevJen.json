From the MRI and CT, it looks like there are 5-6 spots for me, with the largest being 2 cm and the others being \"sub centimeter.\" My consulting onc at Hopkins put this before the liver board yesterday, and the surgeon said no go on straight surgery. However, the IR doc said that he thought there were several \"options\" -- and she did use the plural word in describing what he said. So now I'm waiting for a scheduler to call me and set something up, hopefully for next week. I will report back as to what he says and the options that he describes. The onc is NOT crazy about this idea because she wants me to start on fulvestrant and Ibrance. But she's agreed to just start me on fulvestrant for the time being until all of this settles down. I think her concern was blood counts, in starting Ibrance prior to any interventions. ",

Treated with TAC and radiation, and put on tamoxifen (I was premenopausal.) About 12 1/2 years ago, I had a small focus of BC cells found on my cervix during a routine gynecological exam. Had a complete hysterectomy and went on Letrozole, which I am still on. Tumor markers started to rise a year ago. No symptoms. Had not been imaged since 2008, but since rise in markers, which continued through this January (haven't had them taken since then), I've had 3 diagnostic CTs, 3 nuclear skeletal scans, 2 PET/CTs, and yesterday, an MRI of my abdomen. Until scans of last week, nothing was found. In scans last week, radiologist suspected possible bone mets and also saw a \"suspicious\" ill defined liver lesion of about 2 cm. Bone mets have been eliminated. Liver lesion is still not settled (mets or not), and now, the MRI showed up 5 more sub centimeter lesions. Next week I have a CT guided liver biopsy. No other symptoms, and I'm pretty much gobsmacked because I feel great. Also thought that liver mets were not that usual with ILC. Just looking for the collective wisdom of the group regarding whether this was how your liver mets were found. Thanks much.",
