My surgeon was able to get wide, clean margins. Honestly, I felt like I was being pressured into getting on the chemo train.  The oncologists that I started out with was so gung-ho about chemo, but would not directly answer questions about the benefits to my specific type of cancer. Turns out, my Oncotype score revealed a 3% improvement with chemo, versus taking Tamoxifen alone.  When I consulted other oncologists - they all pretty much said the same thing.  If a patient does not see at least a 10% improvement, from a certain treatment, it's typically not recommended. So, I decided not to poison my body for a 3% improvement.  However, if the grade of the tumor would have been higher, or if I had lymph node involvement, or if the surgical margins had been tight, I would have probably done chemo.  Also, keep in mind that cancer is binary. It's yes or no. Not a % of.  Statistically, I should not have gotten cancer. No family history, I don't smoke, or drink. I am almost a vegetarian and I have a very active lifestyle.  So statistics are useful to an extend.  BTW:  I changed oncologists about a year after I was diagnosed. The first thing I asked my new Oncologists was how she felt about my decision to forgo chemo. After looking at my various reports, she told me that in my case, it probably would not have made much of a difference.  If you would like her contact info - let me know. She is in Colorado - very highly regarded breast cancer research Oncologist.",

After reviewing my path report, she told me that she would have done the same thing. But honestly, I wonder if she was just trying to make me feel better.  The reality of it is that they just don't know.  If anyone would have told me that chemo guaranteed that I would not be at risk of recurrance, I would have hooked myself up to a drip line immediately. But they just don't know.  Even early stage cancers can recurr, despite dosing the body with chemo - so where's the benefit?  I've come to terms with the reality that when it comes to cancer, the risk is binary: I will either get a recurrance or not.  It's not a %, it is Yes or no.  And unfortunately, until the results of the Tailor-X study are published, those of us in the Oncotype \"grey zone\" will just have to rely on our intuition and pray that we made the right choice. ",
