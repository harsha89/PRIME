    "Content": "blogmom wrote: Since November 2010 I have had a cough. When I cough the right side of my rib, under the arm hurts. It also hurts to take a deep breath. Some days It's more severe than others. My right breast is bothering me as well. I've noticed that when pressure is applied to the right chest area, the area near the ribs hurts as well as the breast too. Has anyone ever had anything similar? And if so, did you get a diagnosis?  I've also noticed that I can feel pea size lumps at the top of my right breast. In addition, my collarbone has been bothering me and so has my neck area. Not like a sore muscle, but what I can only assume to be swollen lymph nodes. I can't really feel them in my neck or collar bone when I touch those areas, but that is all I can think of that it could be some type of lymph node swelling.  I would really like some feedback on this please. I have a mammo in the morning. Log in to post a reply",
