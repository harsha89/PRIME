She did tell me that I will need radiation and will take a pill for 5 years. She didn't tell me the name of the pill. I'm very scared of the side effects..Fatique.. is there weight gain? Can I continue to do my exercises. The pill is an estrogen blocker. She wants to block all estrogen. I didn't think I had any at 62~~! So, I'll have all those symptoms from no estrogen...any body out there on radiation and an estrogen blocker to prevent any more cancer? What were your side effects? I'm just so low right now....",
