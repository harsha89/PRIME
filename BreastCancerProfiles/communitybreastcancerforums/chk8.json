May I ask you a couple of related questions?  Will COBRA cover you for the entire 24 months before you go on Medicare?  And will you be able to get a Medicare supplement?  I am starting my 7th year as a stage IV survivor and don't think  I'll be able to work until I'm 65. Thanks for the input.  And this site is a great place to rant! Connie",
