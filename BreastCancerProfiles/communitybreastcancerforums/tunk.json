    "Content": "tunk wrote: So my rash faded to tan at this point. It took a week. Had a mammogram and ultrasound last night. Both okay. I guess the only comfort I receive from that is the lymph nodes look okay. Scheduling punch biopsies with my dermatologist next. There has to be some explanation for the red, discoloration on breast and I don't want to ignore it. I have read several stories like mine to find out they had bad endings. If someone doesn't have anxiety issues yet, this will certainly do it. Help!! Log in to post a reply",
