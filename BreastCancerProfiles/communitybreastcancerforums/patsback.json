Went for a mammogram on June 4th, had ultrasound and biopsy on June 5th.  On June 6th, I got the call that it was malignant.  Had the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on June 25th and on July 2nd was told I need a mastectomy.  I meet with the plastic surgeon on the 15th and on the 18th I see my surgeon (for the first time since the lumpectomy - she was on vacation on July 2nd).  I'm assuming I'll get the date for my mastectomy on the 18th.  Any ideas on what to expect?",

Good luck to all of you.",

I meet with the medical on oncologist on Tuesday.  PET/CT given Wednesday shows spot (I think that was dr.'s word) in bone by pelvic area and lower lumbar/spine.  It's got me worried a bit, but I'm trying not to dwell on it now.   For those who have had their surgery, is it common to have a nagging \"burning\" sensation where the breast was?  It's not painful, just annoying.",
