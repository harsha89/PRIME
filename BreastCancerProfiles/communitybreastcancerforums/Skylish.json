She said the \"gun\" thing made a funny noise, but that was all.  Thankfully she had a positive outcome to the whole procedure.  But, for someone that was so worried and scared about the procedure she said she was pleased and surprised that it went to so smoothly.  True, everyone is different, but I thought you might like a positive story to get you through.  Never appologize for being scared or nervous.  We understand.  Glad to hear you are taking your husband with you. Be sure to let us know how the procedure went and what the results are.  I will be carrying you close to my heart during these next couple of weeks.    ",
