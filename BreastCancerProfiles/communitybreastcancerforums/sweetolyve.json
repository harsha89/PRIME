If you're able, have your anti-nausea meds before you leave there. They should also include them with/prior to your treatment (or include them). I am certainly no expert having gone through only one treatment/infusion so far, but those are the things that I remember. Also, I didn't eat immediately after just in case there was nausea (and there was) and I didn't want to toss my cookies. By the time you get this response you may have already had your treatment. Please let us know how things went for you. Debbie...(O: ><>",

Although I complained about my treatment being way too strong, he kindly stressed the need for it. Also, he said if I get that down again after my next treatment to call asap so they can get me in and fix me up. My hair started falling out today. I thought it would bother me, but not really as much. It already falls out due to hypothyroidism. Also, I bought the book, The Longevity Diet, to study the fasting mimicking diet. That is some very interesting stuff in there if anyone cares to read it. It helps protect healthy cells from cancer treatment while forcing cancer cells to be better exposed to chemotherapy, if I got that correct. Well, that's about it for me. I'm feeling great, have lots of energy since the side effects of chemo/neulasta have worn off, and I'll be sewing and making jelly today. I hope all of y'all have a very wonderful Christmas. God bless you all. Debbie...(0; ><>",

I have literally been totally exhausted from the se of chemotherapy. I know the nurse told me the names of each drug as she hooked it up to the iv, but the only thing I do remember is the name \"red devil\" and that it is the one responsible for my future hair loss. Everything else is passing in a blur. It's this nagging sense of borderline nausea and upset stomach and the fatigue that really bothers me. I don't have my next infusion until the 27th of this month. I do go see my doc this Friday and I sure hope he has something good to tell me. Thanks again Debbie...(0; ><>",

When I complained to her about the metallic taste of everything, she went to work. She found a product called MetaQil. It's a mouthwash designed to reduce that reaction caused by chemo. It is strong, so I will do as another user did and water it down and put it in a spray bottle. It is sold on Amazon and quick to find. After my infusion I went on ahead and took a phenarghan instead of waiting until today for the zofran. I slept well and woke up with almost no nausea. My doc brought up the cold caps to me yesterday and said that since my doses are the strongest possible for me, he was concerned that it would not be a good option for me. But, people on lower doses should have no problems with it helping them to keep all or most of their hair. I'm glad he brought that up because it lets me know he is treating me as a person and not just a patient. I didn't lose any weight, unfortunately, but thankfully I didn't gain any either. Hopefully, this next three weeks will see a positive change in that area. He also said that after this treatment my immune system will bottom out in 7 - 10 days, to be extra careful. How has everyone else handled this particular situation? I'm just curious. Onto my one funny situation yesterday. I drunk a lot of water on an empty stomach, so I had to make multiple trips to the bathroom. Which meant I had to bring Ivy along with. Well, she was more like Oliveoil..tall and thin. She refused to go quietly through the bathroom door and we had a very loud wrestling match getting in there! I was trying to be quiet (did I say that already?), but by the time I finally got her through the door every eye was upon us...lol. Thank God I don't have a shy bladder anymore. And my dh was on the other side of the room laughing at me...lol! Well, I hope today I can go see some more caps for myself since almost all the hair is gone. Hope everyone is doing well. Have an awesome day, ladies! Debbie...(0: ><>",

I can honestly say that in spite of what it was that brought me to this place, my first ever treatment went off without (nearly) a hitch. I had two wonderful nurses who explained everything to me and made sure I stayed very comfortable. They started with antiemitics, followed by the \"red devil\" and by that time I was too drowsy to keep up with it all...lol. the one hitch was that the tube for the main drug hadn't been primed, so they had to take it back to the lab and get it primed. All in all it wasn't too bad. I came home and drank lots of water, took my phenarghan, laid in bed and watched TV. During the night that wore off and I had to take more. What's crazy about that was I didn't feel nauseated at all. I was told to keep taking at least 3 days, or more if needed. I will be going for a walk later on this morning to keep my strength up. I'm so thankful that I have access to great care and my wonderful husband who has not left my side. I pray that all of you have an easier time than expected during all of your treatment. Sincerely, Debbie",

Just a deep whiff or two helps repel that feeling of nausea. I did follow their advice and literally only needed it for about 4 days. Hope this helps. Debbie...(0: ><>",

Just trying to figure out what is the best plan of action before going there this afternoon. I do plan on bringing a large cup of ice water (it's something I do anyway), something to read (hubby will be with me), and really I'm not sure what else. Oh a small soft neck pillow because I've seen those chairs and I'm pretty sure the pillow will help comfort-wise. My A,C,+T will be administered via a power port that was installed on Tuesday. I did have the training session with the oncology nurse, but I don't remember most of that, although she did give me a ton of stuff to read. I just don't remember what she may have said about the prescribed anti-nausea meds, except that they now have an on-site pharmacy so I don't have to drive all over picking up meds. We shall see when we get there. Thanks so much for sharing your stories. I'll see y'all on the other side. Debbie...(0; ><>",

I'm not sure which was worse, feeling weak or being dehydrated or hung over from phenarghan. I feel like I am caught in a catch-22 where if I don't take the phenarghan or zofran I'll get sick, but when I do I'm too tired to force myself to drink tons of water. I did read something about withholding food prior to the infusion and I believe that it helped me out tremendously. The thought has occurred to me to request a bag of saline or two to kick start my fluid intake. Has anyone ever done that? Thanks for letting me speak. My mind is literally in a fog from the anti-nausea meds I can't think straight. I look forward to hearing from you all soon. I hope you all weathered that better than I did.  Debbie...(0; <><",
