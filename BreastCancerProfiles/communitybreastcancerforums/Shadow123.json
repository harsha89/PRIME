It takes more time to position you then anything else you hear a buzzing sound that can last up to 30 seconds mine was done in 3 steps. A few days of tiredness more annoying with having to go in everyday. My skin broke down 25 sessions in but the nurses see you everyday to keep it clean and bandage it up. I healed very quickly when it stopped within a week. Best of luck",
