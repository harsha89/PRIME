My mets are numerous and diffuse but he always talks about our plan of action and what's in the pipeline for new cancer treatments.

I asked her if this was for chemo and she said she was going to get the auth in order. I have an HMO. I know the onc and I talked about next corse of action if the TM went up again. That is very interesting about the anti- hormonals, I will certainly look into that. My mom was diagnosed with BC at 49 and grandma with ovarian cancer at 60. It may be the strong family history or the sheer panic on my face that put more chemo on the table. I think I will get another pair of eyes on this.",
