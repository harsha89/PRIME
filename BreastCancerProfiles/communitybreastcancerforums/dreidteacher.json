Started therapy in January going twice a week. Massage with wrapping fingers, hand. arm to get swelling down before they could measure for the sleeve. Finally got the sleeve and glove last week. Started wearing it and now my hand is worse than ever. Still wrapping at night, but should I stop the sleeve and glove and do wrapping during day again too? My therapist is out of town this week and as a teacher we are in middle of testing so I really do need my hand for writing this week and next.  Wrapping is not good for writing and has been difficult with what I do in the classroom, but I want to do the best for my arm. I must say all of you are an inspiration to me as lymphedema is the worst thing about cancer. Any thoughts will be appreciated.

Have any of you experienced this? When do you finally stop collecting fluid? Any information will be appreciated.

I keep thinking I have so much to do as in my family, job, and taking care of others. I'm getting my list of questions ready for the doctors, what else do I need to do this week before the meet? Oh, this is a party I wish I wasn't invited to, but will attend. Thank you for your inspiration and openess on the boards.

I had surgery in May but still get swollen with fluid and have pain on the side of the largest tumor. There are two areas that are very painful if touched. I thought removing fluid could help.  She examined me but didn't remove fluid. I also have headaches and back pain that I blame on Tamoxifen.  Due to all  this I will have my first scan. I have never been scanned before and the doctor wants it for restaging.  What will a PET scan tell? How long does it take? Is it uncomfortable?  Is it like an MRI?   A few years ago my husband had an MRI and they had to stop as he couldn't handle it. They had to reschedule and drug him. Thank you for any information.
