Worth and Abilene.  Same distance to each.  I have been told that with my \"minimal type cancer\" MD Anderson is probably not where I should consider.  They specialize in more difficult/involved cancers and that I wouldn't like it. Any thoughts.",

I have to go through the weekend in turmoil.  I went to my primary doctor and she rec that I see a surgeon and an oncologist.  My question is which one do I see first.  I should have asked her but... shock was prevailing.  I live outside of Ft Worth, Texas (2 hours) and don't have a clue about any of the doctors.  I don't want to \"interview\" I just want to get this going.  Second question... should I just go on to MD Anderson in Houston (5 hours) or try to do this locally?
