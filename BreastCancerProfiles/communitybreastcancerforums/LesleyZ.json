What are your xmas plans?",

Are you doing implants or a flap?  I'm doing implants....I don't qualify for the TRAM and too afraid of the DIEP (besides, the doc said he would only recommend 2 hospitals in the US for Diep and neither are in Michigan).  I'm kind of worried about doing the implants, because of the risks and lifetime follow up involved, but I don't think I could do nothing at all. Did you see an oncologist yet?  My doctor said that I will likely have to have chemo due to the size of the tumor, but we will know for sure after surgery.  I'm just wondering if it is normal to not see one before surgery / just after the diagnosis?  Sorry you have been delayed, but glad to have someone with the same surgery on the same day as me",

I thought you might be interested in this I was searching the web trying to find some pictures of someone who had the bilateral mastectomy done and what they looked like right after they got out of surgery with the TE's.  I found this girl's blog who has taken pictures of the entire process.  She didn't have cancer, but had the gene so the doctors recommended that she have the mastectomy.  She has not posted pictures yet of her final surgery, where they do the nipples and final filling in of the areas around the implants, but she has the first two surgeries and process where the fills are done documented in the photos.  It was really helpful in letting me know kind of what to expect.  Below are the links to the two blog sections if you are interested in seeing them....The girl is very young...and much thinner than me, so mine will certainly not look the same but it is still helpful I think.  You have to scroll down on the blog a little to get to the pics.  She also has documented her entire process in detail. This is the link for the 1st surgery and the \"fills\" that are done afterward http://sameerandapril.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html This is the link for the second (to put the implants in) http://sameerandapril.blogspot.com/2011/05/day-1-to-3-weeks-post-op-exchange.html",

Here is what I found out tonight at the BS office - does not think the nodes are going to be involved, but will need to do all the standard tests first, lymph ultrasound, chest xray, MRI on both breasts (i have some tenderness in the right side so we want to ensure nothing is going on there), blood work, and i am going to get the genetic testing since I am only 41 and have also had my uterus removed at 27 due to pre-cancerous/hyperplasia.  We do not know the ER/PR/HER2 results yet.  Because of the mass being on the nipple and surrounding area, the doc is recommending a mastecomy....which was a blow at first, but I'm quickly adjusting to the idea.  Depending on the genetic testing results and the MRI results, I may have bilateral mastectomy....they are going to schedule me for that much time and if I decide not to, they will change it (so they can get the time scheduled and coordinated with the plastic surgeon).  I will likely have to have chemotherapy after surgery.  This is primarily due to the size of the mass, and the chance that a cell could have broken off at some point - as well as due to my age.   The doctor was pretty upset about the fact that this was not caught last year.  He said clearly it was cancer at that time on the u/s and mammo.  He said that the outcome would be the same - except the chemo would have likely not been  needed.  He said if we find out that it has gone to the lymph nodes, that this would be absolutely because it was not acted upon last year by the doctors who were responsible for advising me of the test results and ordering additional follow ups.  I got copies of all the reports today.  I am not a \"sue happy\" person....but I am so TICKED about this situation I cannot help but think I will see an attorney about this in the future.  But right now I am just going to focus on getting better. I need to know how long you all think I would have to be off work for the mastectomy?  I have a sit down job/office work, so I'm hoping it won't be long.  I was off work for 3 months in the beginning of this year for my lumbar fusion surgery, so I don't currently have any family medical leave left....also my annual bonus is now going to be cut even more because of more time off. Thanks again for all of your support! You all are AWESOME! Lesley",

Fast forward to February 2011...my regular doc gave me an order for a follow up mammogram...I got a letter immediately afterward saying the results were normal/benign and to follow up again with my regular annual mammogram in September 2011.  My regular doc again gave me an order for my regular mammogram, which I had done on 10/4/11.  Now comes the interesting part...I get a call from the radiology department at the hospital a few days later, asking me if I ever followed up after 9/28/10 to get the ultrasound done???  I advised them that I had the US done and called them back and advised it was done the same day as the mammogram-9/28/10.  They proceeded to tell me that the 9/28/10 report advised me to get another US done in 3 months...which I was never advised to do....by anyone.  After a few phone calls to confirm this was not a mistake, I scheduled the follow up US...which was done this past Monday 10/17/11.  On Saturday 10/15, I got a letter telling me my mammogram was normal/benign.  During the US, the tech was at first very informative, explaining to me that US shows things that Mammograms can't determine...she showed me the screen and the first mass that she showed me, I didn't even know I had...and how it was perfectly round - smooth edges, and clearly benign.  Then she went to the others that I found July 2010 - and stopped telling me anything...this was not round, not smooth, etc.  I waited for them to come and tell me I could leave....but instead the nurse came and told me to follow her...where she told me that I need to have 2 core biopsies done as soon as possible....which are scheduled for Tuesday 10/25/11.  I am trying not to worry...but the fact that this was supposed to be done 9 months ago is kind of freaking me out.  I am mad that this was never communicated to me and scared that the results could be bad....but still trying to think that there is no way I could have BC.  I am also very mad about the fact that this would happen to me...I have had so many medical issues and surgeries in my life.  I just had a lumbar fusion in January 2011 and I just want to be healthy and not have to go to the doctor all the time!  I'm 41 years old and feel this is just unfair.

Here is what I found out tonight at the BS office - does not think the nodes are going to be involved, but will need to do all the standard tests first, lymph ultrasound, chest xray, MRI on both breasts (i have some tenderness in the right side so we want to ensure nothing is going on there), blood work, and i am going to get the genetic testing since I am only 41 and have also had my uterus removed at 27 due to pre-cancerous/hyperplasia.  We do not know the ER/PR/HER2 results yet.  Because of the mass being on the nipple and surrounding area, the doc is recommending a mastecomy....which was a blow at first, but I'm quickly adjusting to the idea.  Depending on the genetic testing results and the MRI results, I may have bilateral mastectomy....they are going to schedule me for that much time and if I decide not to, they will change it (so they can get the time scheduled and coordinated with the plastic surgeon).  I will likely have to have chemotherapy after surgery.  This is primarily due to the size of the mass, and the chance that a cell could have broken off at some point - as well as due to my age.  That is about all I know.  They are to call me Monday with all the appointment dates. Thanks again for all of your support! You all are AWESOME!",

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask/pm me.",
