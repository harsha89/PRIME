Last week my onc/hemo did a bone marrow biopsy on me. He said the pathology was okay although I am still physically sick and weak. The wound site healed on the outside but the inside swells when I lay down to sleep and wakes me in the middle of the night. Is this normal? Has anyone every had one? What exactly does it show in regards to something like bc? My onc is one of those young arrogant sorts who thinks himself an authority on all things blood-related, and he didn't really explain much to me. I often feel \"left out\" about what he says. I have graduate-level education but still feels uneducated when I talk with him...more than with any other doctor I've ever had. I think he intends to make me feel that way. I am unsure exactly what a bone marrow biopsy is supposed to show. Have anyone ever had one done that revealed anything? Anything you can share with me is appreciated. I had 8-week IV iron to address deadly and severe iron-deficiency anemia and have had problems with my right breast for more than four years (pain and thickening tissue). My lil sis had bc at 36. Docs won't cut my breast open to look at thickening tissue because no hard lump exists and they don't want to make scar tissue. I just have to keep going back every three or six months. I didn't keep my last appointment because it seems pointless. Comments? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
