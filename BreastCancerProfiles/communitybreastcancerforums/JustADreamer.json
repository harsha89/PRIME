I have months now that I feel and notice a lot of differences on my left breast. The Christmas, my left breast [the nipple more specific] start to became really itchy. [Something that it have been like that till now, just not that much as before] This month tho, I start feeling it different. It feels more heavy. I feel like the right breast is unconscious or really lightweight while the left one is more heavy and some moments in the day is painful too. I did self examination and I notice something big in my left breast. Not only one to be honest. The others are smallers but this one is big and I can feel it easy. It's were my nipple is, to the up side of the breast. Like they are connected somehow. I checked my right breast to make sure that is something natural, but it was 2 times smaller than that. And not only that but today at school there was an hour that I felt so weird. I was feeling pain from the left breast to the armpit (which I feel it a little painful and swollen 3 days now) and after the school today I feel the same pain every time a make a move with my left hand. I talked to my mom about these syptoms but she said that I'm too young to have breast cancer. Even if the possibilities are small it doesn't mean that it can't happen tho. ;/ Are these syptoms of cancer breast? What can I do? Log in to post a reply",
