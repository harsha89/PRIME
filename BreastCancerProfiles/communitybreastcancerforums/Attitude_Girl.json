Any one live there or have experience of the health service there?  I've finished active treatment but am taking tamox at the moment. Ovaries being removed in next couple of months so I'll be stopping Tamox and moving on to another drug of my oncologists choice! Because I'm supposed to have 6 monthly mammograms, the regular drugs and check ups I'm concerned about transfering treatment but I'm determined to go, even if it's only remotely possible, as I can't let having had cancer stop me from what we've always wanted to do!!! I've put this on stage 1/11 board aswell as hoping to find anyone who can help me! Katie Dx 6/30/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 1/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
