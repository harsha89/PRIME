They are ok for an awards dinner or something where I need to dress up but no way am I wearing them everyday! I can be super casual at work, jeans, t-shirt and button down shirt was my wardrobe before and it continues to be what I wear now. I have always been a tom boy so I have never been into fluffly blouses or dresses so I am good to go!  I stand straight and tall and look people in the eye. This is who I am, my new normal and I am good with it. I look at my scars and say they saved my life. We all should be comfortable and proud of ourselves whatever we choose to do. ",

I am in the March MX group. Go there and you will see that we March girls have all made it past our surgeries and are doing well. YOU WILL DO IT TOO!! I am four weeks out and doing fine. I had no recon. It was my decision to take my healthy breast as well as my DCIS breast. I wanted no future worries and to be done with it. I am very happy with my decision. The drains are a hassle but you get used to it. My surgeon just pinned them (4) under my tank top. I was able to get into a tank top and it worked well. Big zip up sweatshirt, button up the front shirt, comfy pants and slip on shoes.  A few hints are start some stool softners, you will need them. Pillow in the car for the ride home. Put it between you and the seatbelt. Sleeping in a recliner is a great way to go. Stay ahead of your pain meds, no need to be brave. Take a deep breath, let people help you. You will get past this surgery date and move on to beat this menace.  Happy to answer anything if needed.  Hang tough April group! God bless,  Beck ",
