      "Content": "JessD wrote: Hello to all. I am 29 and about 3 months ago started getting stabbing pains in my left breast. After several weeks, I noticed a lump deep inside the tissue, (had to really dig in and got me sore). I had a mammogram and ultrasound which were negative about a month ago. However, in the last few weeks I have started getting stronger pains in the breast. I saw my family doctor last Wednesday. She referred me for a Mri, but was adamant that I dont have BC that she ordered it without contrast. So my question is, is Mri without contrast reliable in finding any hints of cancer? I am wondering if I should see another dr to refer me with contrast. My doctor insisted that the contrast dye could cause kidney damage. Thank you for your time. Log in to post a reply",

I wouldnt want to spend on a test that will not show the whole picture. @GB, I might do that. The Dr. Though was adamant that she won't risk it by damaging my kidneys, she even told me if I need contrast I need to see another Dr. to get referred :/ I will talk to the MRI place to see if they can call her and talk to her about why No contrast is useless. If she still won't budge I will pass and see my gynecologist although the earliest appointment with him is in 3-4 weeks :/",
