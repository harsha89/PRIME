However, the average number of nodes removed was 7!  So some women were maybe 2/2 positive, maybe 3 of 7 positive.  So - one might surmise that there was disease in other nodes that was never detected hence the survivor benefit.  The other study was Canadian - it was smaller, average nodes removed was 11.    So in my case - the possible benefit is not so clear.  I had clear margins, good testing of nodes (of course it doesn't include the nodes up by my neck, sternum), but there was no visible reason to be suspicious.  After chemo & with Tamoxifan - the benefit to radiation might not be worth the short/long term risks. Apparently, I am a little unusual having grade 1, pre-menopausal and some of the other 'good' indicators, but none the less, I want to point out that in some particular situations a rad onc might NOT recommend rads. ",

After I recovered from the shock of his rude behavior, I found I was more sure than ever about wanting to just be flat  - even lopsided forever or until I find a decent surgeon.  I teach high school and have a pre-teen old daughter.  She is awesome - doesn't care about my bald head or missing breast, she just wants her momma healthy.  I'm not necessarily planning to show it off everyday, but if people notice, so be it. I want them all to know that woman can still look good, feel good without having to subject herself to further surgery.   Reconstruction is supposed to be a choice - not a mandate.  There's no shame in being just who I am.  Until reading your stories, it didn't seem like there was anyone else who made this choice. It makes me feel more confident and less angry.   I bet I see women like us everyday.",
