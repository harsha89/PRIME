At time of dx, Onco put me on Dexametasone 4mg x3 daily.  It was necessary to reduce the swelling from the tumor.  Tumor was very close to area the drains cerebral fluid down the spinal column.  If swelling got worse, I could have had a seizure.  It the cerebral fluid couldn't drain, I would have had to emergency surgery.  Thankfully, that didn't happen but the steroid is very hard to deal with.  I am gradually reducing the dosage and it is better but I couldn't sleep more than a few hours at a time and the mood swings were incredible.  I see Onco this week and I think he'll order the follow-up MRI to check on the tumor.  I still have the pain and headaches, but in my mind it is the tumor shrinking  ",

It was great to meet you!  I, too, was lost at the opening session and it was the same Dr. that did the brain mets workshop.  She presented  it the exact same way.  It was more like a medical conference and she was directing her speech to medical professionals.  I was very disappointed.  But it was nice to be there will all of you.
