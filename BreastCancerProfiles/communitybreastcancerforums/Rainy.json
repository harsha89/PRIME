I am really thinking about the accelerated hypofractioned whole breast irradiation since I live very far from a hospital.  Has anyone had good luck with this route?  Are two treatments given each day for 3 weeks?  How far apart are the treatments?  How many hours in between each treatment?   I will be so happy when all of this is over.",
