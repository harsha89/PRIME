In Sept. 2009 I had a mastectomy and lately I've noticed my rib area hurting right where you described ....thought it was my underwire bra. Plus I have new lump on the top of my foob. I saw my BS this week and mentioned these two things. She told me that when she did the cut on me, she actually cut away tissue down by two ribs!  I had no idea they cut stuff out that low but she said that's her standard operating procedures. So, instead of broken ribs, like I thought, she's inclined to believe it's scar issues. And as to the lump on top, she believes that's scar too. I'm agreeing with her since in the last year I've had MRI, bone scan, etc.",

It was the best holiday season I had in years.....and, I've continued with that tradition. The holidays are great now.

Instead of calling her right when I discovered the lump, I consulted Dr. Google and via a search for 'lymph glands near the shoulder' I could see my lump is located where there are deltopectorial and infraclavicular nodes (why I freaked out)....but my BS told me that this lump was too close to the surface for it to be a node - so most likely it's a fat necrosis. However she did state that sometime she's wrong so for peace of mind we should take it out and she said she could do it as outpatient in her office, a little numbing stuff and cut away. Also, it's very little so it will probably be only one stitch - two at most, and a needle biopsy might not get it.  I had been dxd with DCIS in 2009, grade 3, right mastectomy, so she doesn't mess around. Plus, I have an MRI every six months and the one I had in February ended up with a grade 3 Birads of the left breast.  Better safe than sorry, I guess. ",
