I feel so sorry for all those students that she manipulated, not to mention the friends who were so good to her. Kinda makes me wonder if the mental illness she claims to have is real or fabricated. Some people are experts at fooling people. Fitztwins, that dog is the cutest thing ever!",

That being said, it does get easier. Nobody loved a party more than my Dad, and we all know he would NOT approve of us sitting around with long faces. Things will never be the same, but different doesn't have to be terrible. Think of enjoying special days and times as a way to honor your loved one.  I'm sorry for your loss; the pain will get easier to handle with time.",

When something \"big\" is going on in a family, kids really pick up on it and I think what they imagine is sometimes worse than the actual facts. When my dad was dx with his cancer, we were honest with the kids, and answered their questions when they came up. We didn't go into alot of detail; they really didn't want that anyway.We just reassured their fears and let them talk openly about them. What I believe is that they need to trust that you will always tell them the truth. That way they can be reassured that something terrible isn't happening that you're not telling them. If you promise that you'll always be honest, and tell them that you'll let them know when it's time to worry, they can go on with the business of being a kid.",

All the waitresses wear them.  Well, my cousin, who had a bi-lat , chemo and rads 3 years ago just went off on our server. She was really offended by the shirt. First, she said breast cancer isn't cute so the term boobies is stupid,  and second, as a person who chose NOT to save her boobies in hoping for a cure, the shirt sends a mixed message. Not everybody can or wants to \"save\" theirs. Yeah, she got that the shirt didn't mean save in a literal way, but she was making a point.  In the same vein, could you imagine a t-shirt for testicular cancer with a penis and testicles and the words SAVE THE BOYS--it cracks me up just thinking about it!",

      "Content": "jilly47 wrote: I posted this over on the IDC page but didn't get a response:  My mom was diagnosed in Oct 2003  at the age of 74 with IDC. Her tumor was a little less than 1 cm no node involvement ER/PR+ HER2-. She had a lumpectomy followed by rads and 5 years on Arimidex, which she has  finished. I am wondering about further treatment for her. Can someone educate me on this? I have heard about Femara and avista (sp), just not sure why this hasn't been mentioned by her surgeon, who she sees 2x yearly. I am a little worried because she has been very fatigued and is just generally not feeling well for the past month or so. On the one hand, she is now 79 and may be just slowing down, but  breast cancer is in the back of my mind. I haven't gone there with her because I don't want her to worry unnecessarily, but she has some Doctor's appointments coming up and I would like to speak to them about my concerns. My dad passed away 2 years ago and it has been really difficult for her, so I also wonder if her physical symptoms could be depression. She is on a very low dose of an anti-depressant which hasn't been upped in 2 years. I know I am all over the place on this post, but I guess I am trying to get some helpful insight from you ladies, some of whom, I 'm sure can relate to these issues. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
