There are other terms in my pathology that worry me such as multifocal sclerosing adenosis. Anyone have something similar? My mother at 49y/o (1995) had a biopsy and they diagnosed her with lobular neoplasia. Nothing was done at that time and 17 years later, in 2012, she was diagnosed with Stage IIIB invasive lobular carcinoma. I am concerned that I am high risk since of my mom's history. I am meeting with the breast surgeon later this month. Is it worth removing my PASH or just watching it? The radiologist recommended one year MRI follow-up which I am not happy waiting that long to see if anything changes. Anyone have family history of breast cancer and being diagnosed with PASH? What kind of treatment did you seek? Follow-up? Thanks!",
