Surgery was 10/10 and I finished up four cycles of Taxotere/Cytoxan in February. WOO - HOO!!!! I started developing an itchy \"sunburn\" last Thursday and they gave me a prescription for Xclair cream. I've been slathering that on three times a day and was thankful for the weekend to let myself heal a bit. My rads nurses and rads onc are wonderful. Fast, efficient and great personalities. I've been blessed with such a wonderful healthcare team. I'm back to work at 32 hours a week. I used to work 40, but with a two year-old and an appointment every weekday, I thought I might need that radiation nap everyone has told me about. Best wishes to everyone!",

A solid mass will show as a dark area and a fluid-filled mass will show as white. If it's fluid-filled, I believe that means it's most likely a cyst.  I had a stereotactic core biopsy and was given a local anesthetic. I had no ill effects and was able to go right back to work. I was nervous about my surgery too. It had to be performed under local anesthetic. I had an excellent surgical team and sailed right on through.  If it makes you feel any better, about 8 out of 10 \"lumps\" that are found by a mammogram are benign. Good luck to you and I'll keep you in my prayers!  Sharon ",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2007 08:29AM georgias_mommy wrote: Hello January gals! I started chemo (4 x TC) on November 30, so I wasn't quite a Nov gal. However, I jumped in to ask a bunch of questions. I usually post with the November and December groups, but since I'm only halfway through, I thought maybe my experiences could help some of you just starting out. My next tx is scheduled for January 11, then final tx on February 1. Here's a little more of my backstory...I had a lumpectomy on October 10 at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore which was the result of a very scary surgical consult here in WV. Here's a bit of advice....if you don't feel comfortable/confident with your medical team, do ANYTHING you need to do to feel that way. It makes all the difference in the world! The good news is that the surgeon that scared the bejeebers out of my husband and I is now practicing elsewhere. Whew! I'm having my adjuvant therapy here in Morgantown, WV and I think I feel even better about my oncologist and his staff than I did about my surgeon. I'll have rads then on to Tamoxifen for five years.  I used the first treatment as a \"let's just see what happens\" experience. Boy, did I learn a LOT. I had horrible bone/muscle pain and fatigue and, due to the amount of other meds, really didn't want to take MORE than necessary. Well, this time I took an Aleve every 12 hours and I had almost NO pain. I went from feeling like I'd been hit by a bus to almost normal. I would highly recommend trying this if you're on the TC regimen.  I had dry/raw/bleeding nasal membranes and dry cracked lips also. I used Simply Saline (spray, every few hours) for the nose and Carmex on my lips. Worked WONDERS! The constipation was probably the worst. Do whatever you can to avoid this...drink gallons of prune juice, take peri-colace, eat more fiber...WHATEVER it takes. Even though you may not feel like it, exercising helps too.  I take a Tylenol PM to help me sleep at night. Those steroids don't let you sleep for long streches and I think that sleep is the one thing that we all need more than anything. With the Tylenol I'm able to sleep at least 6 hours in a row. It's a blessing!  Speaking of blessings, I haven't had any nausea to speak of. Supposedly, TC causes less nausea than AC. I'm a little queasy for the first few days, but I eat five small meals throughout the day and it works well for me. I did this during my pregnancy and it worked well then too. Make sure you take ALL of your anti-nausea meds when they tell you to.  As far as the fatigue goes, I've really not been able to shake it. I do take a multi-vitamin with iron and a Co Q 10 (Coenzyme) capsule daily, but I can't really tell if they are working or not. My bad days are 5 and 6, so I've just come to accept it and I rest as much as I can. My white blood cell count took a beating with the first tx. My oncologist said that he wanted to see how I fared with the first one, so he didn't prescribe Neulasta or Neupogen for me. I went in for blood work about a week later and my neutrophil count was .036. They consider .5 too low and you have to be at 1.0 to get your next treatment. I was given masks, a heavy-duty antibiotic and sent to bed for several days. This time I had a 5-day Neupogen regimen and my counts are BEAUTIFUL! I'll continue that with the next two treatments. Please, please, PLEASE be careful with getting out in public until you know what your counts are. Especially at this time of year when it's flu season! My husband said something that I really thought about. He said...\"why would you work so hard to beat cancer and then die of something stupid like pneumonia.\" He's got a way with words, huh? WVgirl...where are you located? I wish you luck with your first tx! (((hugs))) and warm wishes for everyone! Hang in there and don't be afraid to ask, whine, or share with each other. It's been the most amazing support I've had throughout this journey! Sharon ",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2007 10:21AM georgias_mommy wrote: Hi Sherry...I started losing my hair on day 14 after treatment. However, my scalp was sore starting on day 8. I had my husband shave it all off (to about a half inch) on day 14. I had long, thick, very fine textured hair, so I didn't want to deal with tangling as it started coming out. It took until about day 18 until it started really coming out. I remember I had to spend 45 minutes in the shower just trying to get all the hair out of the drain, off me and out of the SOAP! My husband is, well, shall we say \"folically challenged\" and it's kind of funny that my 18 month old daughter has more hair than anyone in our family! Kimberly, I think I can answer your question about the steroids. It looks like you are going to have Taxotere and they prescribe Dexamethasone/Decadron to combat serious allergic reactions to that regimen. I haven't had any problems whatsoever. I pre-medicate with a day and a half of that steroid in pill form and then the infusion consists of a Decadron IV about 30 minutes before they administer the Taxotere. The oncology nurse stays with me for the first 5-10 minutes of the infusion to make sure that I don't have an adverse reaction. Evidently, it can range from mild to severe...something like anaphylactic shock. The last time I was getting my IV before treatment, a nurse came into the VAD area and said that someone had a bad reaction to Taxotere (did NOT make me feel comfy). When I asked the nurse about it as she was hooking me up to the IV, she said that the patient didn't pre-medicate with the steroids before her infusion and didn't tell them when they asked her if she'd taken all her medication. OOPS!  Oh, and thank you for posting in my \"Anyone else feel forced out on Disability Leave\" thread. I thought your name looked familiar! I was forced out four days before my first treatment (thank you for the added stress!). I had exemplary performance reviews with this company for seven years and would never have seen it coming in a million years. I've talked to lawyers, the Patient Advocate Foundation, and the American Cancer Society. They all said that companies have found a loophole in the FMLA. If they force you out because of your illness, that's illegal. If they concoct a case against your job performance (truthful or not), that's legal. I don't want a fight. I just wanted a little support from a company that I've bent over backward for, for many years. So heartbreaking. I hope all of you who have just completed a tx are comfortable and enjoying the weekend. For those of you who are awaiting their first...hang in there. The anxiety is the worst part and once it's over with, you'll wonder why you worried so much! Take care! Sharon ",

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2007 06:13PM - edited Dec 30, 2007 06:14PM by georgias_mommy Hi Carol! From what I have read, the Neulasta shot is NOT automatically part of the tx plan. There is also a 5-day regimen called Neupogen. Both help the body produce red and white blood cells. My oncologist did not prescribe either for my first tx. Only 40% of women experience neutropenia (low white blood cell counts) during chemotherapy. I think he wanted to save me, A) the cost and, B) the misery if, in fact, I wasn't in that 40%. The average cost of one Neulasta syringe is $3800. Neupogen costs about $300 per syringe (x 5 days), so it costs around $1500 total. Unfortunately, I did develop neutropenia, so my oncologist asked me which regimen I would prefer for this last treatment. I chose Neupogen for the following reasons... I have an 18 month-old, so the \"moderate to severe bone pain\" that Neulasta is famous for was not something I wanted to be immobilized by. Also, the cost of Neulasta is a little too high for my liking. I volunteered to give myself the Neupogen injections so I didn't have to drive (actuallly have someone else drive me) to the cancer center and back five days in a row over the Christmas holiday. It definitely worked because my counts were GREAT when I had my blood work done the following week. I also had NO BONE PAIN which I was thrilled about. I'd rather stick myself with a needle than have that! I'm so sorry D1!!!!! ((((hugs)))) I understand it can be quite dibilitating. Ask your onc if you can try the Neupogen next time...and you don't have to give it to yourself. They can give it to you each time. Carol, ask your onc what his plan is for you and weigh your options. Have a peaceful evening everyone! Sharon",

He has been nothing but patient, kind and willing to answer any (and every) question I throw at him. I've never felt rushed either...which is RARE these days.  I also just adore Angie, his oncology nurse. They make a GREAT team. I live close to the Cheat Lake area off of Route 7. I work remotely (at least I think I still do) for a company in Northern Virginia and my husband is in school at WVU in Morgantown.  If you ever need someone to go with you to an appointment or infusion, just let me know. If I am able, I'd be more than happy to help! I have my next treatment on the 9th, so I guess we are a week apart. Feel free to send me a private message and I can get you my contact info. Take care!
