I will admit that I was definitely dreading it because of having to have my hands over head for however long after a double mastectomy. I am also dreading this radiation and so wished that I didn't need to do it. I can't believe that I was in tears after realizing I had to start (after the meeting with the RO). I think I was holding out hope that I wouldn't need it. I had a great response to chemo but the percentage advantage decrease was too great to ignore. So I grudgingly agreed to do it...30 treatments for me. The mapping was surprisingly easy. I didn't even have to have the left arm, affected side, totally up. I did the mold, measurements and tattoos in about 45 min. The worst part was right before I went into the room I had to use the bathroom. So after I get in there the nurse was like...\"Oh no, I have to give you a pregnancy test!\" Lol...not, then spent the next 10 mins. trying...well you get the picture. I am in menopause but she said they had to be sure. Funniest thing was when another nurse comes in and proclaims, \"Well, your not pregnant!\" As if...lol üòÇüòÅü§ó As far as creams and stuff, my RO had her nurse do a radiation training session with me and gave me a large booklet. Eucerine and Alaphor (forgive my spelling) were mostly recommended along with aloe. I think they said the most important thing was to put some type of lotion on right after the radiation session. I was advised to do the back side also. So, starting soon and now kinda can't wait to get this part of the journey finished. Healing thoughts to all",

Hopefully, someone may benefit from this. After my diagnosis, I went for an MRI and that result showed a much larger mass than originally considered. So instead of surgery first, my doctors recommended neoadjuvant chemo to shrink the mass. I will also need radiation after the surgery. The next event (more like obstacles) was getting the port. After placement, I was told I would feel slight soreness for 24 to 48 hours. Unfortunately that was not true for me. I had to research, but some people feel lots of pain for several weeks, especially if you have large breasts. So I (very large breasts) had pretty extreme pain at the site and right side of body. What saved me is wearing soft sports bras at all times, even during sleep. My next events were getting ready for chemo. I looked at it as getting a tuneup! I was advised to get a flu shot and my teeth cleaned. I went a step further and got a Pap smear too. Well, it turned out that I needed two extractions as well! Then my general practitioner told me to also get the pneumonia shot (recommended for anyone going through cancer treatment). As you can see, my body was put through a lot before I even got the \"Red Devil\". So, onto chemo. I was super nervous and scared about going on chemotherapy. Of course I heard lots of horror stories and have had family members who went through treatment. I was so anxious that my doctor suggested a mild anxiety pill. I went on a low dose of Activa ( or something close) and it helped immensely. The administration of chemo went easy and I had no problems initially. I was also given three anti-nausea medicines through the IV before the chemo started. My nurse told me to take the first dose of a prescribed anti-nausea pill that night. I took all the recommended doses and never got nauseous or sick. I also had the Neulesta patch put on my stomach and took Claritin first thing in the morning. I had no bone or muscle pain. I was told to take Claritin for five days after the Neulasta however I found that on day six I started getting a headache and bodyaches so I took the Claritin again. This seemed to take care of the problem. I have been fortunate so far with the SE's of chemo: no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea etc. The only bothersome symptoms are the medicine/metallic persistent taste in my mouth and extreme fatigue (although that may be a SE of the anti-nausea meds). So far, no hair loss, but when that event happens, I will be using a wig. Thanks to all of you who posted tips about gargling with baking soda and salt and the advice to get with the class that the American cancer society offers. My next chemo is slated for next Friday, December 2, and I am a bit nervous about the cumulative effects and enhanced side effects of chemo. My motto of late about cancer, treatment, upcoming surgery etc. is this: I have one life to live and thus I am in the fight of my life. Take care sisters and get the rest you need. I am an elementary school teacher and will probably not work after my second chemo treatment due to all the possible infections, colds, etc. that I could be exposed to at school. Is anyone wearing a mask most of the time? My husband is a bit freaky about me wearing one nearly all day. Well that's a fight for another day! Signing off for now, but \"Let's Do This!!!",

This is despite different kinds of sleep medicine. From what I have read, sleep problems are pretty normal. My blood work before chemo showed a slight problem with anemia, but that is also common with chemo. Hope you can entertain yourself while stuck at home. I am also an elementary teacher, but I still am not sure if I will take any extended leave. My MO said it is totally up to me and she will support any decision I make. I went to work all last week with no mask and stayed away from any sign of sickness, but felt a little cold coming on by Wednesday. I got lots of rest and was able to do chemo on Friday. Becky, my hair finally started shredding today. It is very sad. I kind of hoped It wouldn't really happen to me, but they say de-Nile is a river in Edypt. Hang in there we are all \"losing\" it together! Keep the faith all. ",

I did ask my MO if the AC was actually working and she felt my lump to see if it had shrunk any. Then she said she thought it shrunk a little bit, but it was only after one treatment. She said she would really tell after the second treatment. But I would like to ask her about this test so that I don't keep taking a chemo drug that's not useful. She also mentioned that some people shrink their tumors more with that Taxol, so I thought why am I taking AC then? Anyway, thanks for giving me something to think about. Rock on",

Nfullblume, sorry to hear about your hemorrhoids. I have had them since my first pregnancy. Are you experiencing blood problems as well? Hope you feel better soon. I can't remember who asked about foot pain or numbness on AC, but I am experiencing that as well. My right foot is the worse, but that might also be because I have arthritis in that foot. The pain and numbness was pretty bad all day yesterday, but got a little better today. I am kind of worried what will happen with Taxol. Well, now with the shredding of my hair, I have the tingling and sensitivity of my scalp. My hair is in a sad state. Ok, I am depressing myself...lol. Have a great day ladies!üòçü§ì",

I already have darkening of several of my nail beds from the AC, so maybe I will try the dark polish. I would hate for my nails to get worse or fall out. I am also using Udderly Smooth to help keep my hands and feet moisterized. Unfortunately, I caught a cold and hope it does not interfere in getting my treatment on Friday. Thankfully, no fever yet. I am taking off the rest of the week to try and rest up. All those little kids at work and their germs aren't helping me...lol. Has anyone lost their eyebrows or eyelashes? On Monday, I noticed that my eyelids were swollen. I was wondering if that is a precursor to the eyelashes falling out. I have also noticed that my eyebrows look much thinner lately. At any rate, I guess I will (hopefully) get to see how I react to Taxol on Friday. Good luck and few SE's to all of you!",

I had my first last Friday, and it seems to be very different SE's. Much less nausea so no constipation, but now I am having the opposite problem. Also, much more pain in my lower half. Seems weird that I am having more issues with the Taxol than the AC. Maybe it's just the cumulative effects of all this poison. Anyway, I can't wait for these 10 more weeks to pass. I go for an ultrasound tomorrow to see if my tumor has shrunk any. Fingers crossed. The good news is all my heart tests came back fine. So onward and upward! Have a great evening ladies",

Aterry, so sorry to hear about your port issues. The installation was the worst for me, but so far no problems with access. Hopefully it will get sorted out. I don't spend hardly any time in facebook either, so I am here to stay. Aterry, since you can't drive are you getting a ride to work or not working? The ultrasound showed that my tumor has shrunk a little bit. I was told it is a good sign that it isn't growing. They may add hormonal treatment to the Taxol to see if that helps. Either way, if things continue about the same I am heading for a mastectomy for surgery. I am actually good with that. ",

That may help lift your spirits. Also, are you taking anything for anxiety? Several people (including me) are taking Xanax or Ativan to help soothe and reduce stress. I also enjoy listening to uplifting or fastbeat music helps. Hope you are feeling better soon.

Is anyone feeling more tired and weary when walking? I am really having difficulty and leg pain walking up steep stairs (at my school). I know this is a side effect from chemo, but the walking issue will definitely keep me out of stores shopping for Christmas. Oh well, gift cards and money here I go.

The tiredness and leg pain continue, but now I have a few new SE's. I thought my heart was hurting and aching, but thankfully after an EKG, they think the pain is related to the cancer and chemo. My hands and especially palms are getting darker. Has this happened to anyone else? Nanpop, my husband shaved the rest of my hair which really helped with the scalp pain. You are fortunate to keep 15% so rock it! As far as your kids, try to be as honest as possible unless they are super-sensitive. My daughter is older, but we have grown closer through this experience. Sometimes she thinks I am sad when I am just tired or trying to push on. I find in general that people don't want to know our every ache and pain. For the holidays, we will just be celebrating with our immediate family (husband, son, and daughter). I am grateful for this Christmas since last Christmas and New Year my husband was in the hospital. At least this Christmas we will all be together. I wish all of you a peaceful and restful holidays!üòçüòäü§ó Gail",

When icing at home, how long per session and how many days? I seriously don't want this issue to progress to the need for more mediation. Do any of you have issues with constipation or diaharria?
