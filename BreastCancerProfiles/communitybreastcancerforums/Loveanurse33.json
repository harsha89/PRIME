I have a significant family history, my mom passed away from ovarian cancer in 2005. Both my maternal and paternal grandmothers had breast cancer as well as both as my paternal aunts. One of the aunts was 30 at her diagnosis. So now to me. I woke one week ago with pain in my right underarm, it had some mild swelling and I assumed it was a lymph node. I told my husband if it didn't improve within a day or two I would see my dr. It didn't improve so the next day I made an appt and really thought I would be leaving the office with an antibiotic, I assumed I was fighting off some sort of infection. Well my dr felt what he called a \"fibro ridgeline\" from my axilla to my left upper quadrant of my left breast. He said it was hard to feel just the edges but did not feel a specific mass. He said it was concerning so he wanted to set me up with a mammo and an ultrasound. I took it upon myself to make an appt at a breast health center in Rochester NY even though its a few hours away. I have heard great things about the physicians there and I know you see the dr that day there and if they feel the need for a biopsy they do it the same day. Results are usually in that same day, so no long waiting. I go on Monday. Anyway, I am worried. I know that it could be nothing, and my husband keeps telling me to just remain positive it will all be fine. I want to be prepared if the news is not great though, almost like I don't want to be blindsided. The area is actually not as painful, but I also feel like I am hyper sensitive to every twinge I feel in that breast now. I can still palmate the area and feel something. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms? If so what was your outcome, fibroids or bc? I just want to be realistic if that makes sense. Any help would be appreciated, I have been reading the boards the past few days and you all seem so supportive and full of great information. Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
