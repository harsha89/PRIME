But it's been months and I've never looked at them or wanted to. If you think you would like to do that, go ahead. It's easier to ignore pictures you've already taken than to wish afterward that you had taken them. We're all different and have different reactions. I never identified myself by my boobs, so don't feel less of a woman for not having them. When push came to shove, the thought that they were threatening my life meant they had to go. I didn't even hesitate. I had the other breast removed more so I wouldn't have to worry about when IT would get any bright ideas and try to kill me, too. Now that it's done, I like being symmetric. Sometimes I wear my prosthetics, but most times I don't. I like not having to worry about whether my bra will show with this or that neckline. I've told my family that I'll wear my boobs for special occasions, but otherwise, forget it. Everyone's fine with that. Out in public, I've never noticed anyone noticing that I don't have boobs, but I do tend to wear earrings and necklaces more. Just be at peace with it and with yourself.",

I also have BC/BS PPO coverage, but in Indy. They never uttered a peep if the med was infused (I got Avastin, too), but balked at pills (Xeloda they called experimental, and Emend was just rejected in pill form). My doc got Roche to donate a bottle of Xeloda and I had to pay $3,000 for the second one! For the Emend, he'd order a double dose of Emend with my infusion, and if that didn't last, I'd come in for 'hydration' which would contain another dose of Emend. Has your doctor appealed to the drug manufacturer about them giving it to you for compassionate reasons? If not, it couldn't hurt to try.",

I have Celtic knotwork on my right ankle and the top of my right foot, done years ago. I'm contemplating a tat on my left shoulder/back to commemorate my fight with this @3$#^* disease. A friend facetiously suggested an angel on my shoulder and laughed when I grimaced, as I don't \"do\" cute and fluffy. But since then, I've revisited the idea of a larger tat of a rather no-nonsense guardian angel with a drawn sword and a wicked grin on his face that would suggest \"You'll have to go through me first!\" Maybe in medieval dress, perhaps a surcoat with a Celtic cross on it to keep some continuity to my other tats. More on topic, I'm leaning toward no recon and would consider mastectomy scar tattoos, but not sure how big or what, except nothing cute and fluffy. Or pastel. Or with a pink ribbon. No offense to those who like them, but I really don't like them, even beyond the fact that they're pink (see: no pastels).",

Then I liberally apply the emu oil - 5 or 6 pumps, but I really don't have to rub it much, as it seems to absorb quickly. Then I finish with a light coat of hand lotion (Curel, fwiw), as I was told the emu oil helps other lotions absorb more readily. I figure it can't hurt, and so far, so good! No signs of redness or tightness. Good luck! Today was 7 out of 33 treatments for me.

While there's the occasional 'bad egg', for the most part, I think it comes down to 'corporate philosophy'. Everywhere you work seems to have a corporate philosophy, or attitude that is rewarded. Some bosses don't really care about people taking shortcuts, as long as they get a certain amount of work done. Other bosses want it done right. Hospitals are the same way. The hospital where I work pays lip service to doing things right, but it's more of a 'don't get caught' attitude than a 'do it because it's the right way to do it' attitude. Needless to say, I'm not being treated by them! I went out of insurance network because my GP recommended this place, and I've never regretted it. It's a Catholic-affiliated hospital and it's amazing how everyone seems to have a good attitude, friendly, not rushed, really care, etc. Hmm. Maybe I've been working at the wrong place.",

When four of Santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and Santa began to feel the pre-Christmas pressure. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more. When he went out to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were sick and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.   The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?' And thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree. Not very many people know this.",

I made a joke about it, but was serious when I said that the first one had tried to kill me and I wanted to get rid of the other one before it got any bright ideas. I think I would have been anxious and morbidly obsessed wondering when I would develop cancer in the other breast, and whether or not I'd be lucky enough to catch IT before it spread. I kinda felt that I'd dodged a bullet the first time and didn't want to press my luck, so to speak. So for me, BMX was the best choice.

Many women continue to walk or work out lightly while on chemo, so there's no reason to think you won't be able to do that as well. Death is not inevitable and your family will not get tired of waiting for you to die. I'm sure they love you and want as long as possible with you. You can do this! You might also talk to your doctor about some anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs to help you cope with the shock of this diagnosis.

It is essentially a small scar or calcification and usually doesn't mean anything. So try not to worry too much about small spots in your Mom's lungs - unless the doc is concerned.

Was diagnosed Stage IV in early February, so the SOB stayed away for 7 years. That's good for TN, right? My tumor markers were normal the whole time. I thought I had pneumonia back around last Christmas, but it wasn't getting better. Finally realized it was pneumonia wrapped around a metastatic tumor in my right lower lobe. I started Abraxane and have been taking it 3x/month since then. It almost immediately shrunk from 5x7 cm to 3x2 cm and has stayed there. I lost all my hair except for some weird, white, old man fringe around my head. I desperately miss my eyelashes because I'm sick of my eyes watering all the time. I'm starting to have fingernail issues - sensitivity and soreness, with about half of them starting to turn white and lift up. I've chopped them ultrashort to keep from catching them on something. When I was treated originally, Taxotere made all of my finger- and toenails fall out. The nails on my big toes are still jacked up and mostly dead. Maybe it's not surprising that another taxane is causing problems again. I just had a consultation with my old radiation onc, and he wants me to stop chemo and zap the hell out of \"Ralph\". He said since this is my only met, he would consider me oligometastatic and that with the rads, I can achieve long-term remission. I so want to believe this, but know there are no guarantees. I'm not sure if I have any questions, but just wanted to stop in and introduce myself. Thanks.",

The first time you go in, they make a file with your insurance info, how much you're entitled to, etc. Whenever you visit, the information is right there, so you can take the goodies and go, while they deal with the paperwork.

Re: the docs giving directions only to the still sedated patient - I've apparently talked on the phone before while asleep! I had no memory of it later. So yes, they really should know better. takeadeepbreath, I bought (for my 1st MX) a surgical camisole that comes with those little drain pockets on the inside. They were VERY handy, so it's nice to hear there are other ways to get those. Tomorrow after rads, I go for my pre-op labs and mammogram, and see my surgeon on the 9th. Whoo-hoo! Let's get this thing going. To back up a little, I was diagnosed in late January and have been on the cancer rollercoaster ever since. Thankfully, I had both short-term and long-term disability, but it's only 60%; it's doable, but a little tight financially. My surgeon said I needed pre-op chemo because I had an aggressive tumor (grade 3, triple negative) that he didn't want spreading. He referred me to my oncologist, who got me into a clinical drug trial, which was almost 6 months (I got Avastin, Taxotere, and Xeloda X 3, followed by Avastin, Cytoxin and Adriamycin X 3). I had a LMX in September and started rads in October. I was referred to the radiologist, who said I fell into a grey area between definitely helpful vs definitely would NOT help, so he left it up to me. I said to go for it, since I want no regrets or \"woulda/shoulda/coulda\" second thoughts if this damned thing comes back. For the same reason, I'm having my other breast removed before it gets any bright ideas about trying to kill me, too! My rads end next week and a week after that, I'll be in surgery again. Whew! I'm going to write 2010 off as a very bad year and hopefully reboot my life next year. Wishing everyone good surgeries and happy holidays!",

The spots haven't disappeared, but they itch much less. I'd think it was hives if it wasn't so sparsely scattered. I think it's something different from the blisters, too. Weird. I put bandages on the blisters to keep myself from scratching in my sleep and bursting them. My drain output today was 30 cc, which is the lowest it's been, so I'm getting there with that.

As to where the fluid will go when they pull the drain: if your body can't keep up with draining the fluid away, you may develop a seroma, or accumulation of fluid. It can be large or small, and they may want to suck it out with a needle if it's large or not going down. My doc says he doesn't like to do that since it usually just reaccumulates and will eventually get absorbed on its own. I had one with my first MX and if you poked it, it would jiggle. My doc also said to start wearing the chest wrap about 12 hrs/day, or at least at night to help it absorb. It took it a few weeks to completely go away.",

You'd never have to worry about whether your mastectomy bra is showing. And lots and lots of mastectomy bras seem to have a large \"footprint\", which limits what you can wear over it, so thanks for the tip! ETA: I very rarely bother with foobs, as they seem more trouble than they're worth (bulky, hot, etc.), but I might if it was that easy.",

So, I just got the bright idea to print out a sign to tape to the head of my hospital bed saying just that: NO IV STICKS OR BLOOD PRESSURES IN LEFT ARM. THANKS! in giant font. I'm also debating using a sharpie to write on my left arm in the morning \"NO\" on the back of my hand and the inside of my elbow. No one can say they didn't get the message, right?",

I loved my overnight stay; the unit used to be a room-in labor/delivery room before it became post-op, so the room was huge and had an alcove with a cot for my Mom to sleep over with me. Also had 24/7 food to order that was faboo! I was hall-walking within a few hours, which the staff got a kick out of. I decided to ditch the gown and change into my pajamas and the nurse walked in and startled me with a loud, \"Where do you think you're going?\", and when I spun around, she started laughing and said, \"Busted!\" As she did when I found the nutrition room and helped myself to ice water, crackers, etc. Everyone loved the sharpie writing on my left arm, but they also put a 'protected extremity' armband on that arm, too. And when I was discharged, they let me walk to the entrance, but the nurse watched to see that I got into the car with my family, as she didn't trust me not to try to drive myself home. LOL They're beginning to know me well. Lovely place, excellent care, but friendly, laid-back staff. Now I'm home ahead of the big snowstorm that's supposed to start tonight. Mom and I will stay holed up warm and cozy and let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!",

Since this was a prophy MX, my brother and I had discussed whether I wanted the path report to be clear (Would I feel like I had had my remaining breast removed unnecessarily?) or would some ADH or DCIS let me know immediately that I'd done the right thing? I said I wanted it to be clear, since my aim was to get rid of it BEFORE it got any bright ideas. We laughed, and sure enough - clear! Merry, merry Christmas to me. So I bought shoes!",

I was awake enough on the way to my room afterward that I asked them to stop just inside the room so I could hop off the stretcher and use the restroom! I had Tylenol because I had a bit of a headache, but otherwise, nada. Of course that wasn't with reconstruction, which might involve more pain, but don't expect pain. You may not have much or you could have a lot. Just let it unfold the way it's going to be and try not to \"impose\" expectations on your experience, either physical or emotional. You may be pleasantly surprised! I always thought my breasts were one of my best features, but I wasn't \"attached\" to them as the definition of my femininity. When I found out I had BC, my best feature became the enemy and they had to go. No regrets and no emotional upset; they'd tried to kill me and I wasn't going to let them. Sayonara, bitches! And let me add that my reaction kinda surprised me, too, but I just went with it and didn't try to tell myself I shouldn't be feeling this way. Give yourself the freedom to react however you react. There is no right way or wrong way, there's just your way.",

      "Content": "Jan 8, 2012 11:28PM - edited Jan 8, 2012 11:29PM by riley702 Another suggestion would be to look for a Catholic-affiliated hospital. I was treated at one because I'd had a bad experience with the hospital group my insurance would pay for, and my primary doc referred me to the Catholic-affiliated hospital. I called their billing department and asked them to please work with me. All my bills are rolled into 1 monthly payment; $100/month, no interest for as long as it takes to pay it off. If I get a new bill, I call the guy in billing and he adds it to what I already owe. It's been a God-send to let me be treated at a place I like and trust. I was horrified at the thought that I would have to go where my insurance dictated, so tried to find a way around it. It's certainly worth a try.\\ PS - I'm not Catholic. They don't care - never asked.",

I hate what I see from some, as it seems to be blaming the victim (NOT talking about anyone here!), with comments that we weren't positive enough, we couldn't handle stress well enough, we didn't eat or exercise well enough. There are plenty of ladies here who did \"everything right\" and still, here they are. But I think some triggers are beyond our control, with pollution, chemicals in our environment, perhaps even bacterial or viral infections, etc. I'm all for finding ways to block these triggers from activating, but not encouraging us blame ourselves for our disease. It's like that stupid series of commercials for some heart medicine, where the victim says, \"I should have been doing more.\" and their LOVED ONE tells them, \"Yes, you should have.\" How is that helpful? It makes me snap at the TV, \"Oh, shut up! Way to be supportive, there!\"",
