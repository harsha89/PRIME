I had a 1.2 cm hypoechoic lump with indistinct margins, BiRads 4. Google was not my friend and I truly was becoming paralyzed with fear. I have two young boys and cried every time I looked at them. I was recently told it was benign. Please try not to let fear get the best of you. Prayer for a good outcome.",
