For the stubbly ladies, I hated that part because it seemed to catch on pillow cases and hats and be nearly painful, I shaved my head with a razor in the shower until it wasn't an issue any more (didn't have to do it after a week in the end). I was surprised how easy it was to do without looking and didn't cut myself at all, I did check for moles and lumps and bumps first though. I found it easier to look in the mirror all shiny and bald, I felt wispy or patchy hair made me look more ill. Kitchenella, I started on AC once every three weeks and it started to fall out 14 days after the first infusion, had to shave it 5 days after it started coming out else it would have blown off my head in a light breeze.",

Then I started on T (paclitaxel) which I get every week, now that I'm 6 weeks into it I have a thin #2 kind of length. But, yesterday I noticed a few strays, and today it's coming out along with my eyebrows (which thinned at the start of T but filled out again pretty quickly). Will I lose it all over again? Has anyone lost their hair twice? I've got 6 more weeks of chemo to go and I'll be bummed out to lose what I have managed to grow back, I only just stopped wearing a buff under my hat this week because I felt I had enough to look like a normal hairline.",
