I can absolutely understand how something so traumatic could lead to the debilitating anxiety you've described. I can also relate with how you are feeling obsessed and constantly worried about your health. I am struggling with this too and I feel like every time I stop worrying about something, a new health concern pops into my head and I start obsessing over that.   Recently, I had noticed breast tenderness on and off but hadn't really kept track of when it was occurring.  Within the past two months, I had noticed the soreness more distinctly in my left breast and upon feeling around I noticed a ball type lump inside.  It is moveable and kind of right in the center of my breast.  It's hard to distinguish whether it is actual tissue or separate. I compared it to the right breast in which I can also feel lumps in but not painful or as large.   Not sure if this was normal or not so I went to my gyn and he was also able to feel the lump in the left breast so he referred me to get an ultrasound.  I went immediately the next day. My anxiety was through the roof for this.. the tech said my heart was pounding out of my chest!  The tech wasn't able to find anything on the ultrasound even though she could also feel the lump.  The radiologist came in and said everything was fine it was just \"normal dense breast tissue.\"  He said I have the same kinds of lumps in the other breast they just aren't as swollen.  He said this was hormonal and normal for women by age (25 years old and on the pill btw.)  I was able to breath for a couple hours after that until my gyn received the results and still wanted me to be checked out by a breast surgeon because \"there was definitely something palpable there\" and he just wanted to be sure.  Cue anxiety attack again!  I called to schedule an appointment with a breast surgeon, and the earliest she could see me would be in a week.  So I was miserable, obsessing, loathing in bed for the entire week up until the day of the appointment...when they called me at 8am to say the dr had an emergency and had to cancel!  They rescheduled me for this Tues.  So currently, I am still sickened with worry and fear and anticipating this appointment (again).  I have also cancelled a vacation for this week due to this because I know I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself being so obsessed and worried =( I also have my sisters wedding in two weeks that I have to do a lot for still and I worry that if the dr orders a biopsy it will be even more waiting and worrying that will take over me.  My family and friends say I need to stop worrying and wasting away each day obsessing over this fear.  It is so much easier said than done and I wish I was mentally that strong!  I know that going to the surgeon is the only way to be sure but it is just so terrifying.   So you are not alone in feeling extremely anxious with your concerns.  I hope we can both calm down a little! (I've been cleaning and organizing things for work to distract myself)  Don't be afraid to ask your dr questions and express your concerns and anxiety over everything.  Please keep me updated on how the appointment goes!  ",

Wasn't sure if it was normal tissue or not so I went to my gyn and he referred me to get an ultrasound.  The tech and radiologist could not find anything on the ultrasound..even though they both could feel it afterwards.  They just said it was normal dense breast tissue and that hormonal changes could cause it to feel bigger and more painful than the right breast.  My gyn received the results and still suggested I see a breast specialist because there was definitely something palpable there... so I am going to see her tomorrow (scared out of my mind!)  He says he thinks it is nothing to worry about but he wants us both to know for sure.. I agree!",

I'm 25, found a large oval lump/ball type mass in my breast after feeling around since I was experiencing extreme soreness in that breast while my right breast felt totally fine.  I wasn't sure if it was normal tissue or not, so I went to my gyn and he said he could feel what I was talking about.. and referred me to get an ultrasound just to check.  Well the tech wasn't able to find anything on the ultrasound and the radiologist came in and assured me it was absolutely nothing, just dense breast tissue and said it was just hormonal.  He even felt for the lump and said that I have the same type of tissue on the other side, its just not as big.  My gyn received the results and still suggested I see a breast surgeon because \"there's definitely something palpable there.\"  He said he would just be more comfortable if I saw a specialist, so I am going tomorrow to a breast surgeon to see what she says (scared out of my mind and obsessing!!!)  I really am expecting her to order a biopsy because I think it is really the only way to know for sure what exactly it is.  So I would suggest maybe calling back to see if he would suggest doing something like that to make sure or if he thinks you don't even have to do that.  I would also try to get a second opinion if you could.. it's terrifying and I would love to just believe the radiologist but it's better to know for sure.  I can understand it must be hard without insurance..maybe try getting in touch with someone from the program and explaining the situation and your concern??",
