Of course it's your decision, but if you take the disability you can spend time nurturing and caring for yourself, your husband and your other family members. Do what you love--if you have a creative outlet, go for it! I know you are heartbroken now--I could not have children because of endometriosis, and it's a sadness that doesn't go away.  But there is beauty in life every day, all around. Ina",
