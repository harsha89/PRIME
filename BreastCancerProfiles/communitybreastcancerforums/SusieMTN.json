I will have to see if I can get more and honestly I don't recall the name but it worked.  I have tried St. John's Wort in tincture form from a acupuncturist and herbalist. I did get good results so we shall see but it conflicted with Tramadol for pain.   Time will tell, feel free to PM me! Susie",

I had a MRM with some muscle removed so I have a concave area, in the area that in concave was where the most damage to the skin occurred, my incision opened up and I had a heck of a time getting it to close, mind you chemo for me was first, surgery second and radiation last.  I am almost 1 year post radiation and I have skin still in the concave area that it splotchy red.  Everything did eventually heal but my skin still is sensitive and I will get a red mark if there is any pressure like from an under-wire bra (which I don't wear often).  Make sure you use the cream your Radiation Oncologist tells you to us, mine recommended Udderly smooth and AquaPhor. Good luck to you and wishing you wonderful skin!   Susie",

It is THERE job to do so!

I was getting these muscle like cramp's where my incision is, yikes!  I find it funny that I was almost pain free for the first 2 days after surgery and more pain as the days progressed, but still the pain was not as bad as I anticipated!  I think because I was so numb after surgery (modified radical mastectomy) that I just didn't feel the pain!  Who knew!  The drains are driving me crazy, so I am on a count down for their removal on Tuesday Feb 10th.  Just taking it one day at a time. Good luck to all you who have had surgery and those that will have their's this week.  Tip: Make sure you get enough pain medication for the worse case senerio, you can always not take it, easier to do that than call and go thru that hassle.  I goofed and was too focused on the surgery itself and not beyond thru recovery. ",

Here is what I am thinking.  Nothing prepares you for Cancer and no one would or could REALLY know what it is like to go thru this.  You have Chemo a head of you.........  Your daughter will regret not being their for you at SOME point in her life, and unless she is completely shut off from all emotions, she will feel guilty about this. Sometimes we need to save our children from themselves.   Do come here often, with all the wonderful women here you are bound to find useful idea's, advice, and most importantly...... We understand stage III........  And a lot of us are MOM's ((((((((((((((((BIG HUG))))))))))))))))",

I would mention this again to your Oncologist.  Tell him you are really concerned and would like a scan to put your mind a ease. Also, could this be a muscle thing?  I do the Pain Free exercises by Pete Egoscue (on the web but you can get the Pain Free book too) that really help joint pain and other pain type stuff from my body being out of alignment.  ",

It then hit me that for me end of treatment was something I had not expected and had thrown me completely off guard.  Its hard when you are done.  It took me a while to get my sea legs because I did not expect how I felt!  I knew I was strong but this was scaring the heck out of me. We each go thru our journeys, some the same, some different.  What has helped me a lot are my two favorite books: The Breast Book by Dr Susan Love (a UCLA doctor who runs the website www.armyofwomen.org/)  and Life Over Cancer by Dr Keith Block (who runs the block center for integrative cancer car) at http://www.blockmd.com/ You might find these helpful.  Sometimes we need to find something that makes us feel we can do something to be at cause in our life, as cancer sort of takes that away.  See if those two books or even their sites help, the did for me.  Or find what gives you the information that helps give you a course of action.  When you are on treatment you know what you have to do - you go in you get your chemo and take your meds, when you are done there is nothing given to you to do - nothing for you to do.  When you are done with your treatment providing your doctor says it is OK walking or running does wonders for the soul!  Walk around and look at your environment or walk in the malls.  Or even in your house at first.  Study what to eat that helps your body have the right nutrients to fight cancer, take antioxidants, etc.......   We are all strong, deep down we have to be to get thru treatment, you will find this if you look inside.  Feel free to PM if you need to, you have many wonderful women here to provide support, you just need to find what will work for you! Wishing you health and wellness! Susie",

I have the form of mets to the lungs that form a fine pattern throughout both sides of the lungs, so no nodules.  Apparently this takes up room in the lungs, creates scars, and makes my lungs less able to expand.  I believe the puffers help to open up the airways.  Chemo improved the state of my lungs.  My pulse ox was a bit too high for O2 but I did fine at home as the doctors thought I would do.  Bone scan showed mets to spine as \"no progression\" but a new spot on sternum or one of my ribs but that was a few months ago right around Chemo's end. If memory serves the type of lungs mets I have is far less common than nodules and harder to detect on X-ray. I am now on Faslodex, Zomets and Herceptin. I am wanting a SCAN as I don't want anyone assuming the FASLODEX is working.  I didn't see my normal Oncologist last visit.  So........ it was a little weird. As medicine is a science it just makes sense to me that HARD core proof is needed (a SCAN).  I \"get\" that the more the SCANs are done the more radiation exposure. But one still needs proof otherwise it is just flying by the seat of the pants. It could be my normal Oncologist has plans to do one.  It just seems to me that at stage 4 (diagnosed back in April with bone mets and then in July Lung Mets both in 2011) evidence is needed that all treatment is working.  I thought I would check with you guys first and see what the \"Norm\" seems to be.  I thought I had read somewhere that scans every 3 months were in order for stage 4, I have a really bad case of CHEMO brain!
