PS says due to compromised blood supply from the surgery. For the past week it seemed that the new incisions were doing great (except for the bottom corner of the TE making its way through the bottom, PS says skin is extremely thin ) but as of this morning the left one is leaking again. The fluid is enough to soak through the abdominal pad. I'm so upset and frustrated at why I am not healing! I have been on high protein diet the past 4 wks, which hasn't seemed to make a difference. PS says just have to be patient and allow to heal. I see him tomorrow so I'll find out about the leaking again. The only thing he has me do is wash with soap and water and dry dressing under ace wrap. All I can do is cry. Last week he said it will be a while until I am fully healed that we can even think about starting to expand. He placed them with 150cc. He also mentioned that the skin is so thin it will only stretch so much. The skin will dictate how much I can expand. Feeling like I should have not tried reconstruction at all! Sorry for venting!",

Scottiemom sorry to hear about your pain, and I feel your frustration. Just when you think you are doing / feeling better something will flare up (or in my case leak out ) and you feel as though you just took 3 steps back. On the bright side at least you can sit outside, here we still have snow, ugh!",
