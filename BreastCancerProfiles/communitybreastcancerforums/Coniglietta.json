Besides it looks I'm not so well informed like you all seem to be about the diagnosis. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and because there were other suspicious spots I had a single masectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (LD flap) a couple of weeks ago. My PS has done a great job! When I went for the results and treatments, the outcome was that I had Paget mucosis,which was the reason why I went for a mammography in the first place and told me that the tumor was 1,1 cm. The most confusing thing was that I did not have an indication for chemotherapy or hormonal therapy because my bi-rads value was 1. Actually my surgeon told me this in the corridor. At that time I was merely relieved that I didn't need chemotherapy and hadn't a clue what Bi-rads was. But now I guess I'm all confused. Has anyone ever heard of bi-rads score after mastectomy?  Thanks and hopefully my English is good enough.
