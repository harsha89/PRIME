I got a call back asking me to come in for more tests, they scheduled a mammogram and ultra sound. They did a few mammogram pics, the lady was in and out. They said I didn't need an ultrasound. Is that a good indication my test will be negative for cancer? Do they always do ultrasound if suspect more or does it just depend on how well they were able to see on the mammogram?
