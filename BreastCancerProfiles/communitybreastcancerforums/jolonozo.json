While excision is a must, my surgeon is also recommending a unilateral mastectomy. I do not know what to do. It is suggested too that I go ahead and have a bilateral Mastectomy to avoid any future problems.  It all seems so drastic considering I do not have cancer (as the doctors remind me each time I have an appointment). I am going to an oncologist this afternoon for a 2nd opinion on treatment.  My doctor has stated the mastectomy recommendation is due to the fact they will have to remove large amounts of tissue, hence making the breast look extremely distorted.  Does this seem reasonable?? I am lost, confused and honestly do not know what to do.",
