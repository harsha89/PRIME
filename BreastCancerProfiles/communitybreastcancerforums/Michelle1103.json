I have to have two mammotome biopsies on my left breast tomorrow and am wondering if this will be very painful. I understand that a local anesthetic is administered; but I am worried about pain, swelling, bleeding, etc. afterward. I am also anxious about the results, as I have two beautiful daughters, ages 17 and 8, who need me. My BI RADS score is a 5. Any advise, support, or encouraging words as I wait are appreciated.   Log in to post a reply",
