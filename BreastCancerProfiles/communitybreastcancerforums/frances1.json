Iam very confused..does anyone went through the same..and what did you do...I was hoping to do the surgery first and to  do the oncotype dx test and than see if chemo needed. I heard also that eating raw  vegetable food and juices will reduce breast cancer returning. Help.. Log in to post a reply",
