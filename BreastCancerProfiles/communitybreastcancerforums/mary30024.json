They will numb your breast, and you won't see anything....and they will take a sample and send it to the lab for results...I was so scared when they did mine this past week...BUT, it was very simple ( 10 minutes max) and the soreness came hours afterward.  There will probably be other women in the waiting area going for the same procedure and I found there is lots of female bonding and talking (total understanding and compassion)..... The idea of it is much scarier than the real procedure! I wish you luck:)",

Next thing I knew, the radiologist is saying I have 2 simple cysts, and 1 complex. I go to the surgeon today. I'm off my wits end after all I've read. I understand that complex cysts are \"complex\" because they may be cancerous. Mine is 1 cm and that's all I know. The only thing I know is how scared I am....and how my eyes have opened.  Im 42 and I keep thinking the worse. Does anyone know the stats for complex cysts as far as what they \"may \" turn out to be. I'm sure a biospy will be sch. today for a later time. The soon the better. Any information you guys have would be helpful. Thank you so much. Mary  Log in to post a reply",

But, you know, going through this whole experience made me realize that I need to join the Breast Cancer walk in May, and contribute in any way I can. I had NO idea what a silent sickness this can be for all we women. I pray the biospy will be B9 and from what the Doc told me and what all of you have said, complex cysts are pretty much B9 but I will find out around May 8th. They weren't even in a hurry to aspirate or do more tests. They said that when they are really concerned, they rush procedures for women. God Bless:) Mary",

I've learned that the best offense is a great defense:) - early detection is the key. I wouldn't put it off but get the answers you need. I know you may be worried, but focus on getting an answer:)    The Dr. may order an ultrasound, and until they can really look at it, then you won't know what it is.  I know it's scary, but since you just found it, you can get it checked and have answers! Best wishes! Mary:) ",

I asked them too, lol. Yikes. They decided to aspirate the 2 complex cysts with a fine neddle biospy. The Doc was very nice and said most complex cysts (the larger majority) are just debris, ect:) Thanks! I'm nervous but still cautious! ",
