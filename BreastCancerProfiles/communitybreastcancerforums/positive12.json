Have a great day ladies and let's try and stay positive!  My daughter's 14th B-Day is this weekend and I am staying busy planning her party.  Life does not stop, we have to keep going.",

Here are my results so far.  1st Mammo- There are two densities in the left breat.  One deep near the chest wall only partially imaged and one medially which is irregularly shaped.  It has a nodule with tail.  This measures approx. 8.0x12.0 mm.  There are no suspicious microcalcifications or distortion. BiRads Cat 0:Needs additional imaging and/or prior mammogram for comparison. Findings in the left breast require further evaluation with compression views and ultrasound. 2nd Mammo and US-There is a persistent flamed-shaped irregular density in the left breast far medially with slightly angular margins.  There is also a nodular area deep near the chest wall which is unclear whether or not it is a slip of pectoralis muscle. Birads Cat 0 Needs additional imaging and/or prior mammogram for comparison. Abnormailty in left breast is not fully characterized by mammograph and ultrasound.  MR evaluation is recommended. ",
