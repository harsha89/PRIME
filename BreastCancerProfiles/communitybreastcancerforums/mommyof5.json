Although the postcard came back normal at that time, today (nearly 2 years later) I actually saw the official results. I was a little shocked to see that I have very dense breasts and \"mammography may not demonstrate all breast abnormalities.\" It also reads, \"Cluster of calcifications seen within the inner posterior left breast likely respresenting dermal calcifications.\" Again, I never knew this. Recently, I have been experiencing pain between my shoulder blades, left shoulder pain, and itchy breasts. I have not gone to the doctor yet and really thought nothing of it until reading breast cancer symptoms today. Now, I am concerned and have put in a request for an appointment with my doctor. Has anyone with diagnosed breast cancer had these symptoms? Also, how many people were misdiagnosed due to dense breasts? Any advice for me for when I receive my doctor's appointment?
