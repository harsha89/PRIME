He was a wonderful person and an excellent doctor. He has saved the lives of my Mother and a friend of mine. A very brilliant mind. I hope you are able to find someone who can put you in touch with him. UTSW just lost Dr. Euhus to John Hopkins, I know its a great career move for him, but he has prevented me from following my maternal aunt and Mother down the cancer trail.",
