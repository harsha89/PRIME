I guess a \"fraction\" is basically the math term they use when dividing the one dose we all get over x amount of days. So, as I understand it, for example, a regular is 27 sessions (plus 5 boosters if you're into that ;) =33). I will get the same benefit of 27 but in 25. I think. I'm SO not a doctor, but I think this is how it was explained to me. Brought it up to my PS and he is pleased. It might be harsher in skin, but better in the long run for upcoming exchange surgery. So he says... Anyone have a better understanding of fractions",

Saw my MO yesterday and she wanted to run a blood test to recheck it along with a GGT. She said it was a little high but she wasn't too concerned but likes to be proactive. I come home and check my e-record and see that since June of last yr this thing has a steadily been rising. Side note: I had rads in June when it started going up. It's 128 now. Not super high but the steady increase has me freaked out. This is a bad signs for mets isn't it? If it was one oddball high number that'd be something else. What do I hope for here hope here, fatty liver? So scared all over again, constantly. :,",

My bilirubin and triglycerides have been going up too. My husband tells me to not worry till there's a reason to worry. Good advice, but I think people that don't have cancer don't understand the mental side effects and how every bump, pain, and \"upward trend is super stressful. Edited to add: GGT came back normal. So I guess this is a BONE questions now.... Any bone mets folks have the ALP rise an an indication? Rise to what number? Thanks, lisa",

Anyway, during our meeting with the MO she said the way perjeta is written in the books, or whatever insurance companies look to for guidance, there is a loophole for post surgery use if you fit certain criteria (something like early stage, mid size, node positive?). It really depends on your insurance company if they go for it or not. Well, I got a letter from my insurance company today and they are \"a go\". The only thing I can find on the internet (about post op use) Is a study that ongoing till next year. Of course, everything we're doing here has side effects, hopefully justifiable for a greater cause, just wondering what folks know about/personal experience with post-op Perjeta? TIA..
