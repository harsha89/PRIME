Well she goes I'll b back when then the radiologist sees these well she comes back in twice says he's in a procedure and final comes in and says we think it's just a cyst and sends me home. I get home from Tennessee and the mammogram paper is in well a card it says everything is normal that's it no need to see me again. Well today I get a phone call from the cancer center saying they need to schedule me for a consult. My heart dropped the lady could tell me nothing other than that. Well I call the health department bc that's where my results went she said that bc I had an abnormal mass that I have to go have a second opinion and so please go to make sure. OK can anyone tell me what this means I'm freaking out and really didn't even know what to ask I was just like I was in lala land.",

For the last couple of weeks my underarm has been sore not painful just sore and full it almost feels like I stuck something under my arm to carry or something. We'll today I checked to see if I felt anything and there it was a lump not small enough to say I'm just being paranoid. I know I don't have to much longer b4 i go to the breast cancer center and get the answers. I just needed to get it off my chest. Don't want to worry hubby anymore than he already is. And we'll my sister pretty avoids the conversation she is my little sis but always try to big the big sis we r extremely close and I think it scares her to let her mind go there .
