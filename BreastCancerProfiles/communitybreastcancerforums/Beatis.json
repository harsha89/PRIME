I had some scares lately and whenever I was very stressed, I said you mantra and it never failed to cheer me up - especially when I did what it says.   I think you're a real trooper! ",

As has been pointed out here by LindaLou53 and others, the numbers do NOT refer to survival rates, but to the contribution of chemotherapy to overall cure, compared to other therapies the patients have undergone. You can compare it with wanting to know what makes the biggest contribution to weight loss: exercise, diet, weight loss pills, etc. You consistently seem to want to misunderstand this. I wonder why that is. Btw, the study you are referring to also has some major flaws, which you can read about here.",

Dutch health insurers have now decided to standardly pay for testing with MamaPrint. I believe some health insurers in the USA also pay for this test. It will significantly reduce the number of women having to undergo chemotherapy. ",
