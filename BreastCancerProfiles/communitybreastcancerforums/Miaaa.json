I live in an Arabic country so I don't know what you call these stuff ^^ First off, thank you for your wishes and I hope the best to you too! I'm going to a speciality centre after a little while -- if it doesn't resolve after pms.",

      "Content": "Miaaa wrote: Hello, I'm a 19 yo medical student. Female. No family history of lumps or cancer. General symptoms: Dizzy when standing up, almost always tired, & confusion. A long while ago (yrs) I've noticed that my breasts aren't even near the same size. But gladly no one else noticed that!! My left breat is larger & harder. While my right one smaller and softer when pressed. Two days ago, I noticed a lump on the bottom of my left breast (I think I might have felt it a while back but didn't care to push on it).. It's hard but movable, it's like they're little holes in it too? And it's not in a particular shape either.. It doesn't hurt at all!! And the outer skin is just normal. It feels just like my right breast tissues (meaning the little holes) but much harder and stiffer.. I think it's around 5 cm in diameter.. And one last think, about three years ago the tops of both of my nipples started to flake (cut off) and they stayed that way without growing back. And the tops has blackish spots on them, too. I thought everything was normal until I felt the lump. What could it be? I know i have a very low risk of cancer but could it be just hormonal? Is it worth the checkup? I need your honest thoughts!!! And thank you!! Log in to post a reply",

Not holes like big holes, they're tiny holes :p my pms became irregular these past months maybe that's a reason. And you're right I'm waiting until my Pms starts to see if there's a difference during or after it. Thank you so much for your input, I really appreciate it!!",
