Plus I had incredible fatigue to go along with it. Day 7 was by far my worst day & very unexpected. Thankfully, I feel much better today. I took an alleve this morning along with my daily Zantac for chemo-induced heartburn/reflux, and my fatigue is much less today. Also, sleeping on the couch was much more comfortable than my bed. Maybe a firmer sleep? I did get the shot in my arm, but luckily no pain at the injection site. Have you had continuous pain since the injection? Trish",

I want so badly to feel clear in the head & I'm sure nobody close to me has an inkling of what I feel inside, both physically & emotionally. I've found that it helps to take my shower every morning to get me going. Otherwise, I'd just laze around. If I'm showered & dressed, I can get myself out the door for something. Like I said, I've managed to drive myself everyday post treatment (7/24), and that helps me to feel somewhat independent. I just got back from a trip to the grocery store, where I picked up some OTC heartburn meds & the smooth move tea (peppermint) that itsalltemporary suggested (can't wait to try that- may not be able to wait until bedtime). I also picked up a variety of drinks (so tired of water) & some snacks that sounded appealing. I think for me, it helps to keep as much control over my day as possible. It's not easy. My energy is low, but it's not paralyzingly. I do push myself a bit from my comfort zone, but I think that will help in the long run. So far, no mouth sores for me, luckily, and I am prone to them. I'm still using my sonicare toothbrush a few times a day to keep my mouth clean, and a friend picked up some mouth spray called \"rain\" which has xylitol in it to help keep the mouth moisterized. Cjanet- are your anti nausea meds not helping you? I have zofran, phenergan & Ativan. My doc said to be sure to let her know if they didn't work & also to not let the nausea get ahead of you. Take the meds as soon as you start feeling off. Also, since they are different, she said if you take one & don't feel better within an hour, take the other kind right then. There are also others they can prescribe if all others don't help. Hang in there & don't be afraid to take the meds! :) When did you TC folks lose your taste buds? Mine still seem ok on day 6. Munching on some cashews now as I summon more energy to put away the groceries I just bought.",

I find myself looking at all the \"cancer-free\" peeps around me and feeling angry. I too would think about growing old with my husband and being around forever, but that's hard to do now. I just want this chapter to be over. I want to feel good again and sleep well again and do whatever I want with my kiddos too (almost 6 & 3). It's so unfair. I feel your frustration and I'm sorry for both of us. But, we will get through this. Remember when you had a newborn at home? How miserable you felt for months & months? But you can hardly remember those days now. One day we will be able to look back on this the same way (although this makes us feel a bit worse & will last a bit longer). We will get through it. And luckily our kids are young enough that in a few years, they won't remember it much, either. :) It was just the summer that sucked!! I may not be helping much, but I didn't want you to think you're the only one feeling this way. This would be so much more tolerable if we didn't feel so physically shitty. I'm having a rough day too, physically, and I'm not sure why. I had been doing fairly well. It's day 7 for me and my energy just dropped to nil. I'm terribly constipated, so I hope that's the root of my problem & not blood counts. :(. It's ok to feel angry & sad. You can get through it though, and dammit if we won't be so much stronger for having done so!! Chin up! Smile & take it easy today. Hugs, Tricia",

Bone scan looked normal, but there were a few areas on my CT scans that got attention: likely fibroids in my uterus, possible ovarian cyst, and something on my liver (apparently consistent with known variant). All are warranting ultrasounds, but MO suspects they are all nothing to be concerned about. I hope she's right. /: Even after the blood transfusion last week, my hemoglobin level is still 9-something, so I'll get one or two iron infusions next week before starting chemo the following week, along with a PS appt, at PT appoint, and my port placement. Sheesh. I'm hoping for a brand new me by Christmas!! And for those of you who have already started, stay strong, and keep us posted!",

After my bmx on June 18th, I thought I was on track, but found out almost 3 weeks later that I needed an ALND. I had that done July 10th along with my port placement, but ended up in the ER on June 11 with an 80% pneumothorax and an 8.5 day hospital stay. My MO was anxious for me to start chemo ASAP, so I started 6 rounds (every 3 weeks) of TC this past tues, July 24th. So far, none of my SEs have been as bad as having a chest tube & week-long hospital stay. ;). The day of, the cytoxan made my eyes burn a little & feel heavy & made me cold. The taxotere I didn't notice anything with. I was able to eat pizza in the chair & snack on some treats my friend brought. I had my neulasta shot yesterday, and I had been doing ok until mid afternoon when I got more fatigued & a bit edgy (likely from steroids). I was also really emotional last night & felt a bit out of control. The tears came easily without provocation almost. I have two young children & I think I was feeling pretty guilty for not being up to par for them. :( My mom has been here to help & she is leaving this afternoon. I hope I can do it by myself the next 2 days (days 4-5 are typically bad), so fingers crossed. I went to sleep early last night after my last steroid pill, a Zyrtec for the neulasta shot, a zofran for mild heartburn & an ativan to help me sleep. Slept well I made breakfast for the kids & managed to eat waffles myself. Taste buds still in tact. I have some lower back pain (likely neulasta, but also didn't have a bm yesterday). Overall, mild SEs from the TC. I'm still functioning at a good level. My husband is already tugging at my hair. He already shaved his in anticipation of my bald head. ;) I'll be around here much more now. Hope everyone is hanging in there. Hugs, Tricia",

I'm also getting the kids ready to go to a bday party this afternoon, but luckily my husband is meeting me there. It's a pool party. I'm pushing myself just a little, but not too much. I was asleep lots earlier than usual last night & suspect an earlier bedtime than usual tonight too. But i was feeling fairly normal until day 2 afternoon. :) Tricia",

I just can't shake the feeling. Hopefully, that will be something the gradually improves as the next treatment approaches. I have some mild aching in my jaw/teeth area, & my throat is a bit sore, but so far manageable, I guess. I do have heartburn, which in my case actually causes me to eat (feels like it might soothe the heartburn), but I could stand to gain a few pounds. I generally take a zofran in the evening to quiet things down, but perhaps some Zantac is in order. ;) Ativan at night & I sleep soundly thru the night, apparently like a freight train, according to my husband.
