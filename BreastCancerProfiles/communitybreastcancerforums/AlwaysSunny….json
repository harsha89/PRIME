      "Content": "alwayssunny wrote: I'm back!  For those of you who may not remember me, I'm mostly known in chat starting late 2005.  I was dx as having stage 1 breast cancer in my right breast which was successfully removed by lumpectomy.  I didn't need chemo or rads.  I was very fortunate to just have the 2 biopsies and 1 surgery.  I haven't been to my breast doc in forever due to the fact that I moved away from her and haven't found anyone remotely close in my current area until just recently.  I will be scheduling an appt on Monday because a few months ago I found a lump in my left armpit.  I wasn't concerned at first because I'm a \"lumpy gal\" to start with.  I started a journal for this lump and have since noted that the lump never goes away or changes near or during my menstrual cycles and is only painful if I press on it.  It's hard, not moveable and started out the size of a pea.  It recently grew in size to about the size of a green grape.  It's deep in the tissue and close to the crease of my armpit.  Now I'm concerned.  My previous doc informed me to have mammo's and u/s every 6 months to check the microcalcifications that I still had.  I haven't done that.  I know, not bright.  I know it could just be a swollen lymph node but my gut says it's breast cancer rearing it's ugly head again because I haven't kept up on it like I should have.  The wait isn't going to be any easier this time but at least I do have a great support system here at home and I'm near my family again so it shouldn't consume me so much this time.  Just wanted to check in with you gals and update you.  I'm concerned but I'm not letting it rule me at this moment.  Still have much to do for the holidays so I'm too busy to really let it set in.  I hope you all have a safe and Merry Christmas and have a safe and Happy New Year!  I look forward to chatting with you all again in the very near future.  Thank you for being there for me when I needed you and I miss those of you that I haven't spoken with in ages.  Luv, hugs and Light to you all!
