They cannot tell if it is a complex fibroadenoma or a phyllodes tumor. The breast radiologist specialist is referring me to a breast surgeon for the removal and for the itching and changes to my skin. I have been on steroid cream and nothing has helped with the itching. It is not sore, never said it was. I would rather start with the breast dr instead of a derm and rule out something more serious first",

      "Content": "ScaredSteph wrote: Hi, I am 33 years old. I noticed a lump in my left breast in February. I went to my OB/GYN and he said it felt tiny and was probably a fibroadenoma and not worry. Well, about a month ago I felt it had gotten bigger and noticed ALOT of itching around the area and some weird tingling in the nipple area. My PCP sent me for an ultrasound and we are waiting on the results on the core needle biopsy I had on Tuesday. What is really concerning me is that the itching has not gone away despite the steroid cream they gave me and the skin around it looks a little scaley. I have been concerned about IBC but the radiologist who is a breast specialist said it's not that. Can it start out slower like that and then get worse? What would the next move be? Thanks. Oh, the lump is about 2.8 cm and is either one or two. They couldn't really tell. She thinks it is either a fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumor Log in to post a reply",
