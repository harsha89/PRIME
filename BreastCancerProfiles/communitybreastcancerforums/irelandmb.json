I had an Oncotype DX score of 19, gray area for treatment. Can someone answer me why we need more that one drug? I am concerned about Cytoxan and the potential for secondary cancers caused by it. If I have clear nodes, relatively low score on Onco DX, stage 1, grade ii, am I putting myself more in risk for Lukemia or something else by taking cytoxan? Could I not just get Taxotere? Sorry, confused, concerned,wondering. Any input would be appreciated.:)",

It really doesn't make sense.:)",
