      "Content": "runner1987 wrote: Hi, I just turned 25 years old and had a diagnostic ultrasound on a small (1.7 centimeter) breast lump two days ago. The lump has been present since August, but my first doctor told me that because of my age, it was most likely a cyst. When it didn't go away, I saw another doctor. It is rubbery, smooth and moveable but the radiologist informed me that the ultrasound results were extremely suspicious of malignancy and a biopsy was performed on my lump and my auxillary lymph nodes immediately. Because of the holiday, I have to wait until Wednesday or Thursday for my results. I understand that statistically the odds are in my favor that this is benign, so I am not looking for reassurance on that front. In fact, I would prefer to assume the worst and prepare myself. I am just very scared and would like to hear how others dealt with the waiting, with their diagnosis and how they are doing now. I feel as though I am living in a nightmare...I have no family history of breast or ovarian cancers and I am very young and otherwise in great shape...but if this is cancer I am ready and prepared to fight. I am terrified that I will die before I have a chance to get married, start a family, start my career... I wish most of all that there was something, anything, I could do right now to start healing myself. Breast cancer? Me? But I'm only 25!

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2013 03:07AM - edited Feb 15, 2013 03:24AM by runner1987 I'm in my mid-20s and opted for a skin-sparing, nipple-sparing bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, despite being a good candidate for a lumpectomy. I did not wrestle with the decision at all. Although I was (and am) sad that I'll never experience breastfeeding, in the end, it came down to not wanting to look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. Why would I want to keep these breasts that were a danger to my health and my life? The way I see it, they were weighing me down, making me sick and stopping me from being happy and carefree. I am far better off without them. Now my chances of local recurrance are less than 1%, instead of close to 15%. It has been 5 weeks from my surgery and I'm happy to report that everything is pretty much back to normal! I have regained full mobility and I have absolutely no pain and only minimal discomfort. I can sleep comfortably, wear all of my favorite outfits (although I needed new, bigger bras - yay!) and even go jogging. I am beyond thrilled with my cosmetic result and, even though I still have tissue expanders, can honestly say that my fake set of 32C boobies makes me feel sexier and more womanly than my old, cancerous 32As ever did.  If you are afraid of the surgery, let me put your fears to rest. It was no picnic, but I got through it just fine, and you will too. Honestly, I kind of had fun taking it easy and letting everyone wait on me. :) I am completely happy and at peace with my decision to remove my breasts. However, I know that many women in my situation would have chosen a lumpectomy. In the end, the decision is yours and yours alone, and it is highly personal. But if you're worried you might miss your breasts, let me just offer my personal experience: I don't miss mine a bit! Good riddance!",

I am just so happy that by this time tomorrow, this cancerous tumor will be out of my body forever. And I'll be on my way to some pretty nice fake boobs. :) I had my sentinel node injection a couple of hours ago. I was nervous but it didn't hurt a bit. The surgeon was there to answer some of my questions and he was incredibly kind and reassuring. I feel like I couldn't be in better hands. I get to sleep at home tonight and then will be at the hospital bright and early in the AM! Will update after surgery to let you know how it went!",

I was so nervous the morning of but of course it was over before I knew it. When I came to I got the best news ever - MY LYMPH NODES WERE ALL CLEAR!!! I was so happy that I cried, and I was so nauseated from the anesthesia that crying made me throw up. But I didn't care - now that I've had my BMX I'm cancer-free! Chemo will be a prophylactic measure to make sure that it doesn't come back, EVER. The first night was a little rough, I was very sick from the meds, but my pain was well-controlled. Now, two days out, my pain is totally under control and I'm resting at home. The most uncomfortable thing is the drains. I have 4, and they pull and pinch a little when they're emptied. Cosmetically things looked even better than expected! I was able to keep my nipples and I woke up with the TEs filled to 80cc (my original breast volume was only 100cc so it looks almost the same). The plastic surgeon was very pleased and so am I. Overall, I'm so happy to be done and can't wait to have my TEs filled to their full 300cc capacity. :)  Good luck to all who will have their surgeries later this month! You will get through it just fine!",

So you can imagine that it certainly is nice to hear how much everyone likes my blog. :) I continue to recover nicely but I am really nervous about my drain removal! \"Milking\" the drains is a bit painful so I think that taking them out might be excruicating. But I just keep reminding myself that the pain of getting them out will be temporary but the relief of having them gone will be permanent. Thinking of all of you who are having surgery this week. Good luck! Soon, it'll all be in the past and you'll be so glad that you can begin moving on with your life!",

It reminds me of a book I loved as a kid, where the characters would run into obstacles and say: Can't go over it, can't go under it, can't go around it...gotta go through it! This is a very important step that we need to take to stay healthy. Although the surgery is scary it is also life-saving. Whenever I feel scared, I remember how lucky I am to live in a time when I have this option and how much it will allow me to do in my future.",

If you are nervous and waiting for your surgery, I wanted to check in to let you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel! It has been exactly one week since my BMX with TEs, and I am feeling sooooooo much better! I'm off the pain meds, walking around, laughing and starting to get back to normal. I had two of my four drains pulled on Thursday and it was completely painless, except for a little stinging at the exit site where the stitch was cut. (The other two are coming out next Wednesday.) I truly feel a little bit like my old self. It wasn't an easy journey but hey, one or two weeks of discomfort to trade for a long, cancer-free existance? I'll take it. Good luck to those with upcoming surgeries. Soon, you'll be just like me - feeling good and happy to be alive! Also, thanks to all that have said such kind words about my blog. :)",
