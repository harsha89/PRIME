Now my surg is tomorrow for diep flap reconstruction and I am happy to be moving forward but I feel that sadness that this BC crap will leave us permanent damage (battle scars) and we will forever be changed in so many ways. I hope you get to go home tomorrow. I stayed one night for my BMX Minot because it was also late in the day. I\u2019ll be staying longer this time. Anyway, we are surg date sisters!
