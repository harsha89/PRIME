Tballmom.. so glad to hear your thyroid biopsy came back B9. I'm stressing.. I have one scheduled for the 13th.  I began my chemo start day by singing this song.  It's posted on my blog and friends and others sang it during their day on my chemo start day. I'm sure all that positive energy helped. http://musingalong.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/kemo-kimo-the-magic-song/ I had a masectomy  - mucinous cancer and dcis, no nodes involved. This would normally mean no chemo. But tests came back HER2 positive, making it now a .2% rare cancer. Top docs in Canada involved and chemo recommended (DCT)  Today, 10 days in,  I feel like I'm as high as a kite.. but it's because I am so excited that I feel this well!  First week 'uncomfortable' but do-able.  Extra doses of steroids because I reacted to herceptin, kept me wide awake and hyper, and I had to consciously practice relaxation, have warm baths to get any sleep.  Some tummy discomfort, cold/flu like symtoms.  This week I feel awesome, and I thought I'd be tired because this is when white counts go down. I'm especially excited about this seeming so do-able so far, because my daughter had chemo two years ago (rare germ cell cancer with ovary involvement)    Her chemo experience was one of those 'worst case scenario' stories, and I'm not mentioning all about it because it's a \"these sweet sistas going into chemo really don't need to hear that\" kind of thing. Suffice to say that I had to have a number of tests to ensure I didn't have some of quirks that caused her so many problems. My daughter is doing awesome now.. married last summer. All is well.  Have been dedicated to an extremely healthy eating plan since diagnosis in April. But was pretty happy last week to suck on sport icepops.. which cooled my mouth and really did ease my tummy. Also taking supplements recommended by an integrative care doc - melatonin to help ease finger nerve ending and nail loss damage.  Lglutamine to help reduce mouth sores. Coq10 for heart.  (these supplements don't interfere with the chemo's ability to work) But please don't rush out and get them.. ask your onc... because they might interfere with your chemo protocol. My protocol guarantees hair loss, but I know many who did not lose their hair on different breast cancer protocols. Got my hair cut short last week.. and the darndest thing, I love my cute hair cut and will be sad to see it go.  And I got out of having a picc!!!  That's because my protocol was changed and one of the more toxic concoctions was taken out of the mix when Top Doc got involved.  Okee dokee.. that's what I know so far.  It's great we can support each other.  Wishing us all ease, joy and darn it, fun.. during our most curous 'adventure.'",

Just did # 5, one more to go of the full protocol, then nine more months herceptin. But energy and hair should come back during that.  Ann, I'm tired of it all, too. I think I could use a good cry but haven't.  I'd say the chemo has actually gone quite well, but now am dealing with swelling and pretty extreme leg/hip weakness.  I am amazed that some of you have worked through this. Not sure if I'd have been able but as it happens I had my own business, and that I couldn't keep up.  Our community hosted a wonderful fundraiser... artists I work with donated works and it was a joyful wildly fun silent auction. I must say it is the people around me who keep my spirits lifted. I had no allergic reactions to the last two chemo's... and we even reduced the extreme steroids and antihistimines a bit. I like to think my visualizations have helped. A doctor is sharing my techniques with other doctors and patients. If you are interested ... you can peek at my blog. This is Part I. There are two posts that follow.. Part 2 is worth the read for sure.  Our strange bodies with minds of their own. ~smile~  http://musingalong.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/instead-of-full-sail-ahead-today-the-masts-and-sails-do-nothing/ Now I just have to come up with the visualization for weak legs.

Whoo hooo!!!!!!  made a little video of the event with friends,  that might help someone going through this - another friend is editing. Whether we do more with it or not, it was part of the celebration. My Whine List of strange symptoms, likely due to the mitachondria... well, some things are improving a lot since I started the supplements.  less joint pain, less sudden exhaustion (wait.. no sudden exhaustion!) less of all symptoms, but still no new hair growth.  I'm counting on that soon.  I'll share the supplements I'm taking, but hope that you all have access to a doctor or naturopath who can determine if and what amounts might help you. (My doc for this does base decisions on my bloodwork)   Beyond a good multivitamin, vitamin d, calcium, we've added large dose of CoQ 10, plus alpha lipoic acid, advanced B complex. Also have been taking a fish oil, and we recently added Barleans Greens and a whey protein powder.  All of the above, organic and high quality.   So, Food for thought, literally. ~smile~ Re the breast reconstruction. I had the TE and now have the implant. Nipple to be done in the Fall. All of that has gone very well. I, too, was considering 'keep it simple and least invasive.. just go flat' but umm.. one flat, and one normal ... realized I wouldn't be happy about that.  A friend had the flap, and she hangs out with a lot of woman who have been through this. Her advice now is to do the implant, as much as she's happy with the results, she felt the surgery and recoup time wasn't worth it, and that everyone she knows are very happy with the implants. I'm pretty impressed with how my implant matches my happy breast.. which happened to get a little lift to make it all work. (Doc said he couldn't quite match the droop. ha ha ha)  My doc has made the nipple sound very simple.. a tuck of the skin on my breast.  A tattoo later. Wishing you all well, wishing us all happy hair, happy bodies, happy minds, happy souls.",

I'm on session 4, and it's so much better than last time, and last time was so much better than the time before. I have leg weakness, not highly energetic, but more energy than other times. Have no pain, no nauseau, no diarhea (the bigger problem with first and second round for me) and my mouth tastes a bit tinny, but food is actually tasting good. I'm celebrating all of this. It's not what was 'predicted.' Sharing thoughts around 'what might be working':  I'm curious if the extreme steroids and anti-histamines I take before, during and day after chemo are making treatments SE's improve each time. I've had extreme allergic reactions day of chemo ..and each session the pre-chemo drugs have increased.. meaning instead of more usual 8 m of steroids, I get 20 ms, 300 m rantitidine, 150 benadryl: morning before, 12 hours before, 6 hours before (and during and after)  hmm, wait a sec.. what if my brain is stunned by all the drugs and is just imagining how well I am? hee hee. Works for me. I'm also taking supplements recommended by InspireHeath doctors to manage side effects. (Canadian Cancer Integrative care http://inspirehealth.ca/ ) Also a strong focus on 'feeding my soul' with whatever feels good right then.. whether arts, nature, movie, visits, paddleboarding on good days, camping. I had no option but to go this route: My business is 'stalled' as its not a business I can keep functioning through all this, my finances are chaos, I'd just been getting back on track after my daughter went through healing from ovarian cancer, and a six month cancer scare with my granddaughter. I knew I had to do whatever it took to keep my spirits lifted, and that that is all I could do. (I flail on anything I 'should' do, but that drains my energy. So, 'what feels good' is my main focus.  Also I do a lot of visualization. ( That's part of my background.. teaching others to both do self guided visualization and to guide others)  So. Something is working. Perhaps the combination.  Just happy as a bald headed clam that side effects mprove each time. And wishing that for all of you!!!!!!",

Susan, I've been reading your posts and want you to know I'm thinking of you as you continue chemo treatments and heal from surgery. You've inspired me to go sleep with pirates. Since my whole theme of this particular journey has been about my body as a tall ship... (long story).. and the adventure of it all, I think a pirate adventure would be a nice celebration. (snicker) Now where will I find a pirate besides Johnny Depp, or the Hot Hook on \"Once Upon a Time\"? I don't think they are available, although 'pulling the cancer' card might help.  HA! 3 months since chemo, still on continued herceptin treatments and started tamoxifen 2 months ago. Both going very well, given my insane allergic reactions throughout chemo (and that included to herceptin.)  Tamoxifen may be playing a bit of havoc with my moods.. pms-ish..but then, all we've been through can be doing that too.  How are the rest of you on tamoxifen doing? My hair is about 1/2 long, salt and pepper, as opposed to a nice mahogany.  I wanted to do something fun with it. I tried a henna, but it didn't take, (nor did it ever take in the 70's when i tried it, I realized afterwards)  but I did have an odd green tinge for a day. I thought metallic silver would rock, and my hair could grow with little metallic tips... but alas, that's pure toxic, and I'm not going there.  Just read today that its not recommended to dye hair until six months after treatment. Anyone know more about that? Also just noticed a rather excessive amount of white fuzzy hair on my face... that's what got me back here. Apparently can be normal. Anyone doing anything about theirs if you have it? Curious about the GrandeLash MD (now I can't find who posted that)... I see it online. Is it also in regular or natural product stores?  My lashes, and the pirates I'm going after, would love to have some 'batting eyes' ability. Enough about me. Happy to see you all here and to be in awe of the spirit of each of you as we \"yo ho yo ho... move onwards.\"",

Just started round two of chemo... turns out I'm the entertainment committee on the floor with lights flashing and doctors running as I 'react' to each component of the chemo.  Nothing a whole lot of steroids and benadryl doesn't fix, but docs and I are wondering about my strange series of reactions. Anyone else having this kind of problem? I'm analphylactic to wasps and allergic to antiobiotics, as well as have 'allergic' reactions to fluorescent lights... so 'sensitive' is what they call me. This is triggering me to try and learn much more about all of this. However, I am otherwise feeling not so bad. First week tired and achey, next two were okay.   I wrote about losing my hair... it became a bit of a 'spiritfull' experience, if you'd like to read it.  And then, I made a video in an effort to make going bald funny.. and well, it worked for me. ~smile~  (it follows the other post, if you go there) http://musingalong.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/be-brave-be-blessed-be-bald-be-beautiful-be-who/ Many blessings to each of you!",

I think I'll feel like chemo is over after this upcoming herceptin alone really doesn't wear me out.. or perhaps when my hair starts growing back! I'll be especially excited if I can get to doing herceptin without the insane amount of steroids and 2 antihistimines that I had to have to stop the allergic reactions.  Tamoxifen begins soon as well.  Pretty weak legged... and get winded easily.. but dang it, I have my nails, at least 12 eyelashes, and eyebrows that look so perfect you'd think I'd had them tweezed professionally.  I'm going to keep them so well groomed, because I've discovered taking that weight off above my eyes, makes my eyes look a lot 'younger'.  So. there's a good outcome.  Stride, also sending hugs and healing thoughts your way.... and wishes for kick butt treatments to get that all looked after. (kicking cancer's butt.. not yours!) I came across a discussion on this site tonight that was pretty uplifting. Although I don't fit the diagnosis, I came across it because a friend does. Nice to read stories of people with 'tougher' diagnosis (they are all tough, I know) and doing well after many  years. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=67&id=773239&page=9 \"July women still doing chemo\"... wishing you whatever you need to make it easier.",

Thanks for mentioning tam causing nail problems. Mine survived chemo, but are now splitting 'upward' occasionally!  Nose runs, but not bad. Losing weight on tamoxifen... apparently a person is more likely to lose than gain, but I was surprised by this, and actually have to pay attention to eating more! Have to work harder to keep my spirits lifted on tam, but I think it's getting better. Anyone having mood issues with tamoxifen? I think my hair could officially be called a pixie cut, and someone might think I did it on purpose. Phew. Laughing when I run into people now and they do a double-take and say, \"I didn't recognize you without a hat.\" Ha! I, too, got rid of my hats and scarves... donated them back to the cancer agency. Except one awesome classy hat, with a lovely bow made of pirate skulls. Might even wear that again one day. My perky new breast and the other with a lift.. well, they are so cute and little and matching, I don't even have to wear a bra! (oh, the silver linings) Hugs and healing to all still going through more invasive treatments, and to all of  us, cuz we rock.",

Yup, I remember thinking that within a year, all would be normal again... I see I'm not the only one who thought that. Ha~ Aren't the anti-hormone drugs crazy? Having said that, I think I'm settled in to exemestane, finally. Joint pain, yes. But not so bad. Just went through a biopsy for a swollen lymph node, and results were good. I am impressed that my docs are still thorough, but oh, that waiting game is hard, isn't it? PaEagles, my stepsister has been recently diagnosed with breast cancer - and as her resource, I am so surprised how much I have forgotten - including what it was like to not have hair!!!

My best bet began by going to the forum of the specific cancer that I had.  From there, I found many links to legitimate research that helped me be well informed, as well as ask my doctors the questions I really need answered. (I had mucinous cancer, so the rarity and general lack of info made it very important to me to get the best docs and best answers.)   It did not look like I was heading for chemo at all, until a twist of HER2+ came into the picture. That clinched my decision to do the chemo. But I felt I made the choice based on being well informed.  Wishing you exactly what you need to make a choice that is right for you. Janet",

I'd like to do it, mostly because we can take photos and she can offer it as an option for others who are going through this.

At the time, I was told \"oh that's rare, they will go away on their own.\"  And they did. When I had my implant exchange recently, I once again developed cords. (and had a rushed ultrasound because one area felt like a lump in the armpit. Results were fine.) This time the surgeon said, \"you are massaging them regularly?\"  Ummm... didn't know about that before. So I am gently massaging them. And trusting they are going to go away on their own again. Have no LE symptoms and have full range of motion. So throwing in my two cents, because yes, it does seem we get a lot of different feedback from different doctors! After reading these posts, I am going to look up LE trained PT locally, and do some followup. It certainly can't hurt.",
