I've made it through 2 a/c- they weren't as bad as I thought they would be. The first was the worst. I felt like crap from that Tuesday to about Sunday. But the 2nd treatment was much much better. Only yucky feeling Tuesday to Friday.",

Its a very nice quiet town and a great place to raise a family. well lets jump to my diagnoses. in December of 2014 i was laying in bed with my husband and my youngest. i remember brushing my hand across my chest and feeling just a little lump sticking out. i was also nursing at the time so i really didn't think too much of it, actually thought it was a clogged duct but i knew that it wasn't there before. days went by and i told my husband the lump was still there. he wasn't concerned because hey i was nursing.....breastfeeding is supposed to lower your risk of breast cancer- so they say. a few more weeks went on and i began to notcie that the lump was actually starting to cause me pain, like a burning pain that would shoot over to my shoulder and down my arm. now i was worried. i made an appointment with women's health and from there she made a referral to see a breast surgeon. the first breast surgeon i saw was a joke. his words exactly \"well breast cancer doesn't typically cause pain so im not concerned\" he said to come back in April for a biopsy if it didn't go away. i left there still wondering what the hell was in my breast. i went home and let it go another week before i finally called and demanded a 2nd opinion and man i am blessed that i did. i managed to get the most highly recommend breast dr there. She looked at me and told me that she didn't think it was anything BUT if it was that its very small and she would expect me to do well with treatment. she scheduled a biopsy for the following week and man oh man did that hurt. 2 days after the biopsy i had the results. Cancer. so some reason i wasn't surprised. i felt like i was getting signs from everywhere. i would open a magazine and see something on tv and it was about cancer. i also found out i am BRCA2 positive and the cancer is triple negative. just ducky. I found the cancer early. Stage 1A no lymph node involvement. Thank god. I underwent a bilateral mastectomy on 4/1- that was a cake walk compared to the 3 c sections i went though, i thought anyway. i started chemo on 4/21. the first A/C whopped me for about 5 days. the 2nd treatment was much much better and tomorrow i go in for my 3rd a/c. i will have a total of 16 treatments and cant wait for them to be over. i am hoping to get through this journey in my life with my sense of humor intact and be here for many many years to come.",

What a bittersweet day- I pray to God that I am here for many many more graduation ceremonies. Finally got the pool opened and took the kids for an hour swim, went for ice cream and went to the local cider mill. All together it was an awesome weekend. On Father's Day I treated my hubby to a movie and we saw Jurassic World- it was a good movie. We haven't been to the movies since 2007!!!Taxol #1 last Tuesday treated me very nicely. I didn't actually feel body aches until Saturday- 4 days post chemo. They lasted all weekend. Other than that I felt great. Although I think I would rather feel sore during the week and feel good over the weekend.

I'm gaining too much weight. It's so hard to be motivated when you feel tired or are just in a brain fog. I am going to try my hardest to keep my weight down. I feel gross just looking at myself but I guess it comes with the territory. I'm at the point now where I don't want to eat because I don't want to gain anymore weight. Thinking about joining weight watchers. I'm so happy that I've been able to connect with some of you on Facebook. All you ladies are just so lovely.",

Unless I'm having symptoms they really don't do a whole lot. I'm glad you're done with chemo. I have 5 more taxol left and then I'm done and into recon.  As for the expanders last night I finally took a Tylenol 3 and was able to get some sleep. I took another this morning so I can enjoy the day with my family. I'm thinking the next fill I will only have ps do a little. I'm already at 600ccs and don't want to be much bigger so I'm going to wait about 3 weeks before I call to schedule my last fill. And I will use this appointment to talk about what's to come next. I'm hoping I can get in as soon as I finish chemo for the swap. My ps is leaving for TX October 1st and I'm really bummed out about it. He said they can do the swap as soon as 2 weeks post chemo- depending on what my lab work days and I really want him to do it and not someone else. I have I think 2 possibly 3 recon surgeries coming up. The swap, possibe fat grafting, and a definite nipple fix- I blame that on nursing my babies for so long- made my right side bigger. Anyway hope everyone has a good weekend. I'm hoping this pain will subside soon and I can enjoy the weekend",

They aren't dangerous alarming levels by any means it's just that this is the first time my labs have been elevated since I've started chemo but I guess it's all cumulative. I didn't meet with my normal MO last week also so I wasn't sure if this doc paid close attention to my labs but I know she did take a peak at them while I was in the room. Just made me nervous that's all. You know always worried that my cancer has spread. Oye. I'm sure I will worry about that the rest of my life.",

I'm so excited to be halfway done with chemo. I've been looking for cake ideas to bring in on my last day to thank my nurses. Congrats Georgie!!!! As for special rings for last chemo I actually had the option to ring the bell at the end of AC and I told them j wanted to wait until I was completely done with chemo. I just love my nurses so much- they are so loving and compassionate. At the end of every infusion they give me a hug and tell me how well I'm doing. They actually take the time to get to know their patients. Even my oncologist is so personable. I feel so blessed to have such an awesome team caring for me.",

Don't have a picture to share yet because hubby hasn't sent the one he took to me yet. It was a nice day. I had my favorite nurse and she saved \"my seat\" for me. I rang the bell 3 times loud and proud. Today I'm just tired. Yesterday I had a stomach ache all day BUT this is the last time I have to deal with the chemo hangover (I hope) so I will deal with it. I won't be needing rads because I didn't Jane lymph node involvement so now I just Monitor it and hope this cancer never shows up again. I go in September 16th to get my foobs. I CANNOT wait to get these expanders out. They feel like bricks on my chest. They will also be removing my port at time of implant surgery and sometime in October or November I will be having my hysterectomy. I already cannot wait for the new year. To start the year out with a clean slate and bill of health. All of this crap before I'm 30?! Thanks to my dad for passing on the BRCA 2 mutation lol  I hope everyone is doing well.",

So I went home- lost sleep over it for about 2 weeks and the. Finally called him and Said I need another opinion. I don't feel right about this. My first doc didn't want to even biopsy it until April- when I was done weening. So I got a 2nd opinion and she set up a biopsy within a week. And 2 days later I had the results. And April 1st I have my mastectomy. I tell all my friends to be their own advocates and if something doesn't seem right ask for another opinion. I'm so so so so glad I did. If I waited who knows what the progression of it could have been. And thank god you pushed for another opinion also!!",

I haven't been able to shake that dream. I've been crying all morning today because I have a spot right by my shoulder blade that's sore and keeps giving me muscle spasms. I'm convinced im dieing. When I first had cancer I dreamt about it a lot so I guess that's why the dream is really bothering me because I'm taking it as a sign. I don't want a scan. Im scared it will show my worst fears and then what?! Chemo again just to maintain the disease and a median urvival of 33 months?! That's not long enough. I want to be here forever to watch my children grow. They need their mommy. God I'm feeling so depressed and defeated over this. Wete I hope everyone else is feeling good and has a good Christmas.",

I feel extremely blessed to have been able to keep them because I am only 29 and this helps me to feel a little bit more like myself.  Also I was wondering how long after chemo it took your periods to stop? After my second dose of ac my period was extremely heavy. I was going through a pad every hour. Also I'm sure it was also from having the Mirena taken out and not actually having my period for about 3 years (pregnant and breastfeeding) but now I'm finding that I'm spotting in between. And from what I've read online that seems to be normal for someone going through chemo.",

I even bought a mini trampoline so I could just jump on it while watching tv but I have yet to actually use it and my 2 year old yells at me to get off it lol she thinks it's hers.

I usually bring some yogurt, my own filtered water, and some other goodies along with me. Everyone is so understanding about it. Even had to pass on some yummy homemade cake because my MIL used unpasteurized milk for the frosting. It was a sad day for me but I filled in that void with some mint ice cream",

I haven't really tried to get it off yet because well I'm tired and just don't want to deal with it yet- but I do have plans to get into doing some cardio again.",

My back pin started about a week after my neulasta shot and hasn't stopped. It isn't a non stop pain just comes and goes. I know that surgery can also cause back pain- especially since having these expanders in. My posture has changed. I know my oncologist said that your back produces a lot of marrow so maybe it's just from amixture of everything.",
