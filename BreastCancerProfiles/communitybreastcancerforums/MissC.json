      "Content": "Sep 9, 2012 05:14PM - edited Sep 9, 2012 05:18PM by MissC Hi again. Feel as though I am obsessed with opting to seek out radiation. I beleive from a scientific / medical perspective it may not be deemed as warrented. However, as a single mom with 3 kids and every need to be here for them I do believe this justifies a need to - at least - discuss the benefit of the radiation. I have yet to be conservative in my approach to this 'thing' growing in me and I dont think now is the time to concede to convention.. From what I have read, radiation post BMX can in fact improve chances of no reoccurance by as much as 23% so ..enough said. There is still a chance that residual cells remain on the chest wall post surgery so this is enough reason for me to schedual an appointment and hash this out........ Thanks all - the insight and leads to material online has been priceless. ",

My tumor was 2 cm / 1 mode involved out of 20..The DR did say exactly as you stated; if in fact 3 more came back positive then radiation would be offered. What is uneasy for me is that I know no more than this in terms of all you have presented here..i do not know if there was angiolymphatic invasion or what the margins were as I never got to scan the pathology report. I am an American living in Ireland and the process is frustrating. You dont get to see the report, you have to apply to get copies (which I have) and there is no referrel to the Radiologist since the DR didnt think it was warrented!
