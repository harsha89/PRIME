January 24th was rushed back to OR for another 4 hour operation the right flap was failing. I am almost 4 weeks post op and have a large amount of necrotic tissue and both flaps. A couple of days ago I noticed a small hole at the bottom of my left flap. The next day the hole had gotten larger, as well noticed another one at the the top. Last night it looked like the whole thing was going to open. I sent photos to my plastic surgeon. They dont seem too concerned. I see her tomorrow. I am an emotional wreck over this. I am afraid to even look at my breast today. It is so depressing after eerything I have already gone through to have this happening now. Anyone else have a similar experience.",
