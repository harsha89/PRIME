I'm 22 yrs old, healthy (thank god), no family history of cancer, no other significant risk factors. I recently found a very slight dimple in my left breast, at 3 o'clock position next to my nipple. It's very slight with my arm down, more visible when I raise my arm. No palpable lumps. The only significant (possibly contributing?) factor here is I had a hormonal IUD placed in May. (Not sure if it's related) Everything I'm reading seems to point to cancer and I'm getting more and more worried. I have an appointment with my GYN scheduled for tomorrow but I'm looking for some reassurance. Has anyone had a dimple that turned out to be benign? Log in to post a reply",
