I am going to the radiologist next week, but I\"m sure they will push it since this is in other breast, the other 14 years ago done with mastectomy....  I don't want to do radiation and already had said no to tamoxifen years ago.. I am more concerned with side effects and if I need further surgery down the road radiation compromises plastic surgery with mastectomy....  I hope I don't meet with resistance with the dr. and /or get scared into it, however with my lifestyle I can't even fit it into my schedule.",
