I am anxious but trying to be thankful that they have advances that can help us to fight reoccurrence. I hope that you are doing well. I see that you have had chemo, I did not have to go through that, I am also wondering about the drug they want me to take after I complete radiation. Arimidex, I have seen so many bad post about it?? Will you be taking some kind of pill therapy?",
