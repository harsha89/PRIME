Robin I will look up Dr. Nuttings info.  I certainly can't hurt and maybe I will talk to my old onc about the spheres.  I really don't think I'm going to get anywhere with the onc I have now.  I still plan on going to see this Dr. Bokar at the main campus on the 9th.  After all, the worst he can say is that he can't help me. Went for more blood work today and the Pallative nurse said she would call me with the results.  I'm curious if my billirubben is still as high as it was.  Doc said he might not have those results before Monday so I might have to call then. Well, I guess I'll sign off for now.  Hope everyone's New Years was a good one.  And God Bless You All.",

I had an expander implant put in during the surgery but because I'm a heavy set person the plastic surgeon couldn't reach the port to fill it. After chemo I developed an infection and ended up having to remove the implant permanently. I don't think I can stand another surgery! On top of that I'm trying to loose weight and have aready lost 25lbs since the chemo last year. And as any of us know the first place you start to loose is in your chest area! Even if I did have the surgery I'd probably end up lopsided again.",

I know I join with everyone else on this sight in sending you prayers and I hope the big man upstairs is listening loud and clear.  ((((((((((((((((((((((BIG HUG))))))))))))))))))))))))",
