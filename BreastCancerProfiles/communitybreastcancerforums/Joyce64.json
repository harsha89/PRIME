My mother still thinks that I should have had a mastectomy like what she had with DCIS. ",

No major side effects yet. I have changed my diet - more vegetables and fruits - Please let me know your decision and how you are doing. I did not want to rely on any medicine especially one that has to be taken for 5 years. But, my oncologists told me that I am not married to tamoxifen and if I am unable to take the side effects, I can stop. But, I cannot miss any mammogram and any paps. Read some of the articles they recommend and I find it very helpful.",

My mother had a mastectomy at 62 years old and her diagnosis is ductal carcinoma in situ. I just saw an oncologist and she suggested I take tamoxifen. But, I get mixed reviews of the this product due to it's side effects and all. What is your opinion? Thank you.  Log in to post a reply",
