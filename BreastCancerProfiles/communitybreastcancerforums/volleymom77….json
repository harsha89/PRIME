I have very thin veins dilating them was tough. They gave me some pain meds, it still hurt. Very sore they placed the line for tomorrow so they wouldn't have to in the morning for chemo. Hope tomorrow is better. Found a fun shirt to wear, its pink and says Attitude Downloading...... Think positive . Now I know I must be sedated or twilight for anything to do with my skinny veins. Hope all is bearable in your world....",
