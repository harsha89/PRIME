So, I was diagnosed officially in Sept. 2012 with lymphedema in my hand only-- went though therapy with CLT-LANA person and am now in the maintenance zone. I got my axilla to fingertip Tribute sleeve recently, and am still within the 2 week trial period. Oh my-- soooo much nicer than wrapping! I discovered that I have a small web between the middle/ring fingers toward the palm-- the finger separator there is abrading the area, and it is quite painful by the morning. The other issue is the cut of the top of the glove-- thumb/first three fingers stick out comfortably but the pinky is nearly buried. I hate how that feels because I have scarring of the pad of my finger (an iguana bit off my finger pad!), and associated weird nerve sensations there. I talked to Solaris, and they advised that I carefully trim the offending finger separator to see if I can relieve the pressure there, and that they would reduce the height of the glove over the pinky if I wanted. If the separator still hurts, they will fix that. I will see my fitter tomorrow to pick up my new Juzo, and will have her make a tracing of my hand with markings that indicate the length that I would prefer for the Tribute. So, Tribute owners, what is your experience with having the finger length reduced by Solaris? Are they just going to cut that part of the glove so that my pinky sticks out, or will they have to cut all the way across (which may make the glove too short for the other fingers)? Will they have to remake the whole thing and possibly introduce problems that I don't have now? The sleeve works pretty well-- does well on arm, fingers and palm, but not so much on knuckles. I am super picky and want this expensive garment to be right (I realize it can't be perfect) but don't want to get something back that I might like less. Advice?
