I had my 4th treatment on June 30, 2011 (Taxotere and Cytoxan).  I did really well and did not feel as if were on chemo.  What I noticed was on Thursday, day of treatment all was normal.  Friday went well.  Saturday, felt a little tired.  Sunday, slept most of the day away.  Got up to eat and go to ladies room.  Monday getting back to normal.  Tuesday, felt like bad yeast infection in vagina and anal areas.  Called oncologist office and was told never had that reaction before.  (When the same thing happened after the second treatment (along with rash under my breast and belly roll), I went to my family doctor.  She teaches at a local medical school and said it is not uncommon to get a yeast overgrowth.  She gave me prescription for Diflucan to take the day after treatment.  I still had itching after treatments 3 & 4 but not as bad as after treatment 2.  I did try to limit sugar as after the first treatment I ate plain yogurt with canned, drained fruit.  I tried to stay away from raw fruits and vegetables unless they were thick skinned and I washed them then peeled them.  All in all I did really well.  No nausea only a couple of times feeling queazy.  Did not want to eat much but ate healthy.  I do want to lose weight to get to a healthy BMI.  I tried to walk every day for at least 30 minutes at a leizurely pace.  I did not lose all of my hair but ended up buzzing it off as it got so thin and scragly that I looked like an extra in a Chuckie or zombie movie.  By Wednesday, my energy levels and appetite bounced back.  I believe in the power of prayer and a good support system.  Praying that you all will be blessed with an easy time.",

The oncologist said that since I was stage 1, would only follow up with breast exams every 2 months when I see her and mammograms every year.  Start Arimidex July 15 and bone density every 2 years.  How are you all being followed?",
