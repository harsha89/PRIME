The hardesst part of this was the \"pushback\" I got from people, including my family at first.  They just didn't understand.  It took me awhile, but I finally discovered that they couldn't possibly understand because they were not standing in my shoes.  I knew that what I was gearing up to do was the right thing for me.  Key word in that sentence is ME.  This has nothing to do with anyone else.  It's about ME.  The one hanging her breast through the hole in the biopsy table every year while everyone else is out in the waiting room sipping coffee and reading magazines.  I had done the research, I wasn't willing to sacrifice the health of my uterus to take Tamoxifen.  I'm a worrier by nature and taking Tamoxifen would NOT help the quality of my life - especially since it provides no guarantees to keep cancer away. So that led me to the Internet. I wanted to find out everything I could about PBMX and what kind of hell I was embarking on.  For me, reconstruction was not what I wanted.  I didn't want anything getting in the way of detecting cancer down the road.  I didn't want to jack around with potential complications and my breasts were barely a \"B\" to begin with.  Plus, I always hated my breasts.  The psychological damage of seeing what my mom went through (didn't know I had the damage until I went through all of this) made me hate my breasts.  In fact, when I would have an itch on one of my breasts, I found myself mentally preparing myself to 'get in, scratch, and get out before you feel a lump.'  I never did self-exams because the fact that I'd find a lump was always a worry for me.  Breast feeding was a nightmare.  My breasts never made more than a 1/2 shot glass worth of milk.  My son was born tongue tied and it was just unsuccessful.  So that was another reason I hated my breasts.  So...all of that played a part in the fact that I did not want reconstruction.  Someone said to me, \"but what if you meet someone and you don't have breasts?\"  I said, \"My husband left me when I did have breasts - what's your point?\" So...down to the meat of what you need....what's the experience like?  Sorry this is long, but you'll get a lot out of it: 1.  First and foremost...pick the right surgeon.  I mean...pick someone who does this all the time and someone you feel is more than capable.  That is 80% of the battle.  Get your game plan set (reconstruction or not) and make sure you are rock solid with your decisions.  You're going to have a shadow of a doubt all the way up to when you're laying on the presurgery gurney, but that's normal. 2.  I woke up in a little bit of pain.  Not gonna lie.  But it was brief, absolutely bearable, and they quashed it immediately as soon as I communicated it to them.  I then fell right to sleep because the drugs were wonderful.  Next thing I remember is being in my room. I never had unbearable pain after that.  In fact, I was shopping on QVC from my hospital bed that night.  I was in for a 23 hour observation.  I had no complications (praise God). 3.  The drains are nothing to fear.  Don't even waste  your time worrying about them like I did.  They are disgusting - yes.  They are a constant bother (emptying, etc.) - yes.  They will make you crabby because you just get so tired of them hanging around - yes.  They are absolutely DOABLE.  Removing them was absolutely pain free.  I couldn't feel a thing.  If you told me that I had to say when they were out of my body when they removed them I couldn't have gotten it right.  I literally did not feel one thing.  Not one pinch, pull..nothing.  Your healing and comfort really ramps up when they are out. 4.  I am now 13 days out from my surgery.  I do feel like I have a tight tube top on, but it's getting better.  My left armpit must have a little more nerve damage than the right because the left one feels very tight.  I'm hoping this resolves over time.  It seems to be improving ever so slightly every day.  I am doing my exercises religiously, as I know that will make all the difference. 5.  Regarding the no recon - I really have to laugh...I think I look so cute without my boobs!  I look so much younger because I look like I'm 10 years old.  But then again, I printed out pictures of women who did no recon and \"got used\" to what it looks like.  I think that's about it.  If I didn't mention something and you would like more details, post on here.  I'm an open book. Thanks and God bless you.  You can do this! I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me! Log in to post a reply",
