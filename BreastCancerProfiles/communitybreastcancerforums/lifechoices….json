As Im reading most on these post lotion like 2-3 times a day but I guess I'll figure out those times once I find out the exact times of my treatments. What was the lotion/spray that they gave you? He also said that I could shower with 'warm' water...not too hot, but not cold (sounded like the three bears) lololololol... but he said because the breast temp may be different inside/out because of the rads its best to try to bathe in a lukewarm water. I asked what soaps to use; he did say I could use the Miaderm soap, but I already use Dove and he said that'd be ok. Just to make sure that I get a 'good lather' before putting it on my skin as I wouldnt want any 'dry' patches to rub and irritate the skin. AND... he said as for undergarments, a nice supporting cotton bra would be best for everyday. Said that other fabrics may cause sweat/moisture but cotton will keep it dryer. I did ask if I needed to sleep in a bra...he said probably not going to be comfortable but a loose fitting cotton tshirt would probably work. He said that allows the skin to breathe and doesnt 'confine' me in my sleep (lol) ... Im a 42DD so it takes alot to confine them. Lastly he said that w/me doing the prone breast radiation most of my affected areas would be the breast seeing that it wouldnt affect my arms and top stomach area; doing this allows the 'part where our breast falls' to not be as irritated and that should also help w/wearing a bra. Its a waiting game; but one that Im near ending so we'll see. THANKS for your feedback, its greatly appreciated!",

Treating the radiated area with chamomile teabags worked really well when the skin was burned (not just red). I used both, as well as silver oxide. I bought Miaderm for my wife who just started her radiation treatment and she was able to continue though 5 weeks of therapy without a lapse of treatment. I was surprised when the Oncologist and the Technician was not aware of the product. Now they do! They were only recommending aloe vera before - no longer ! My wife gave another patient a tube of Miaderm and for her it made a world of difference in the recovery period after her therapy. A bit pricey - But in our opinion worth every drop!",

BRCA and MammaPrint results all in... and yes both MO and RO this week...it was like a whirlwind of days but I thank God for the best med team. They care and they talk it out with me. I'm single, never married no kids but my wonderful guy in my life and my family and friends are the best support ever. No-one wants this news but im thankful to be surrounded by a great support team. Still I'm anxious and nervous on this journey but God is a healer and I'm just moving on this path completely with Him as my guide. I've already had my followup scheduled for Jan 24 2018 so by then I should be on meds. Again, I'll continue to keep an eye out for you and your wellness journey. God's Blessings.",

Remarked my tattoos w/markers for the rad beams; did xrays and I was on my way back to work at 11:48... back in the office at 12noon ;-) I meet w/my RO every Thursday so my session tomorrow will be about the same. All thereafter will be in/out (prayerfully). I did find out the 'exact' areas that are being treated. Just above my boob; and just under the fold and if you were to touch your bra line right under the arm; about there down the sides. I have my nodes scar toward the front of my armpit so it'll probably hit just near that spot but NOT under the arm. The techs said they just wanted to make sure they covered that area (even though my nodes and margins were clear)... but she said doing this will 'hit' any nodes 'creeping in that area and behind the breast'. I feel pretty good. I Miadermed... lol... this morning after my shower (630am) again at 9am (2hrs before my session) and again when I left...and I'll Aguaphor tonight. This has been my process for the past week (prior) to my sessions so im hoping it does my skin well. To all that are completed; 1/2 way there OR not yet started WE GOT THIS!!!... Im finding that although this part of my day is not the normal routine BUT I try to make EVERY OTHER ASPECT of my life 'the same normal'... if one thing has to be out of sync; I cant allow EVERYTHING to be out of sync.

I have black tattoo dots, but today my 1st session, they still circled them with a marker. 2. I love the positive attitudes of everyone. Yes, I know this is a new norm, but we are making it the best new norm EVER! 3. 2017 BC SisterSite would be great! Ive learned so much from each of you and just thinking that if the ROs saw how much we've learned they'd have us to do the new patient consults; free of charge! ROs see way more than we do, but having a room full of knowledge on one site is sooooo helpful. 4. I don't have blue skies in my rads room, just that dome roaming my body. But as I lay there today, the song playing was Beat It by Michael Jackson, I was like Yep...i am gonna beat it! So hopefully each day I'll have a new song to sing as I get beamed:)))) Lastly...5. Ellyn27, I too am ticklish. Every time they dot my spine with that marker I cringe. As for the machine looming over me. I also close my eyes, I'm like if I have to be here I don't wanna feel like I'm being roasted in a rotisserie...so I just sing with the radio and know that by the end of a song, or two I'll be back in my clothes in a few. We're fighters. We're strong and we have a story that only we can tell. Cancer may be our connecting agent. But strength is what holds us together.",

As for the week before, I may just start just to make sure my boob is 'soft' and smooth. lol... I drink plenty of water on a regular now but will add more veggies to my food intake. I also take vitamins daily so hopefully with all of that and prayerfully staying healthy that will play a part as well for the better. Integragirl; Linwentz is correct, you have every right to feel however you want. MOST days Im 100% 'winning', but some days I get that thought in my head like really, is this my life. But then Im reminded one day at a time...and before you know it as Linwentz stated; normalcy will soon follow. I too have a journal. Some days my writing is all peaches and cream; other days i write in CAPS as if im screaming my words on paper. But it helps. Noone can know your true thoughts but you and although my support team are like the BEST EVER still some days I can't even relay to them how i really feel. Linwentz, this too is my last lap (rads); and then on to tamox.",

I want to know how it feels, how it looks, what to use, what not to use and how much of whatever to use (lol)... BUT I know thats not the case so Im being patient and obedient. At my job we do this thing called One Word; its a book about choosing a word and identify why that is who you are. Oddly enough my word for the school year was 'choices'. I guess I had no idea how many Id have; but at the same time, how many I wouldnt have. RIght now; im choosing life, health, and peace of mind. So for all of the 'controlling' that I'd want to do right now...my 'choice' is already 'chosen' for me and that's to follow doctors orders! Relinquishing my control is not so easy sometimes, but I guess in this situation God is showing me that He's in control and you know what IM GONNA LET HIM!

My scripture for each of us; and especially personal to me: Romans 8:18...

Today I counted from sliding in to sliding out and i got to 600; which was about 10 minutes. As I caculated my time that was probably close; as I got in the rads room @ 11:20 and was out and dressed by 11:38. I'll crossover to the Dec room as well to see what my \"CHRISTMAS\" partners are up to. You ladies and ALL OF YOU; take care, be blessed and enjoy YOUR RADS FREE WEEKEND!",

      "Content": "Dec 6, 2017 11:11AM - edited Dec 6, 2017 11:14AM by lifechoices2017 Linwentz, AngelsGal57 and AngelaJL; thanks for the info on the SEs. Today I go in for my #6 (of 20); I feel like Im counting up to the 12 days of Christmas. But Im a 1/4 of the way in and no real SEs to report. Swelling and random twinges but not sure if thats the rads or still healing from the surgery. But still no pain. Last night (on a personal note) I had hot flashes (49yrs old) and i literally had to come out of my tshirt; slept like a baby til this morning. Im still lotioning througout the day. Im african american so I think I see a bit of skin darkening just under my breast but nothing itchy, cracking or patchy. The joy of my afternoon rads is I get to leave my sessions with OR WITHOUT a bra (the little things)! In my mind Im like; 2 more days and Im 8 down and really 9 to go (whole breast) w/4 boost. So Im prayerful that my SE's are few and as lessened as possible (thanking your Lord in advance for your cover and protection). For all those w/SEs I'll keep you in prayer for comfort and a quickened healing! Every Wednesday at 6am my church does a conference call; Wednesday Morning Inspiration. This morning it was 2 Corinthians; 9-10 (And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.)... With that being said; we are the STRONGEST at our weakest point! We got this ladies. Truth be told we were strong before all of this; THIS has only made us stronger! My continued prayers for all for strength, peace and healing!",

I'm to resume reg hrs on the 13th, with reduced hrs and/or leave days..again when rads start... so I'm hoping I can work my 730 to 1/130... rads at 2/230 and then head home. My job has been good about my hours (although the staff is unaware of my journey)...i guess I'm trying to take care of them and me too. Lol. But again, I'll see how my rads schedule works.

I have yet to start my rads and instead of counting those days; ive actually been counting down to appts. With all that said; you got this! IT DOES NOT HAVE YOU... it's cliche' to say you dont know how strong you are until you have to be; but LORD knows thats the truth. I dont know if this will help you, because its never too late to start. But when I was diagnosed; I started a journal. Each day I write in it; how i feel, who i talked to that day, what my emotions are like and I also write out my prayers to God. Ive taped quotes, pictures and sometimes just a THANK YOU LORD just to get me through the day and it helps. Ive shared with my friends/family about this journal and one day its going to be a book; with some tearful stories and OMG so many funny ones (I'll just have to rename my cast)... Dont get me wrong there are days I want to scream and just hide under a rock, but in my mind Im like...if God is working it out, then thats one less job I have to do so I just keep it moving and say 'one day at a time'! ..Im single; live alone but I have the best support of friends and family EVER! I pray that as your journey continues that you are strengthened and I hope in some way that this site and our words of encouragement will lift you.",

My appt was at 11:40; they had someone in there that Im guessing didn't line up well because I didn't start rads until 12:15; but I was in/out and met w/the RO and back at work by 1:15. Im hoping that 3s a charm and tomorrow I'll be in/out in an hour instead of 2hours (to include travel time). But in spite of it all; Im able to work - go to my rads - and go back to work. Next week I get to come to work; rads and home! Thats gonna be wonderful! I did ask my nurse tech and RO how soon will I see SE's he said 'most' of the time the early twinges will start on like day 3-5 and that i'll feel them before I see anything other than maybe my skin darkening. I have 3weeks of whole breast so he's hoping that IF i get any they'll come later in week 2 so that the after that I'll only have 1 week of full; since the last week is boost only. I was like NO...I dont want to see any. He said well you know what \"he calls me Princess\"...lol. He said I dont want to see any either but whatever happens we'll take care of you. I did feel some tightness at the bra strap near my nodes area when I left; but Ive since 'Miadermed\" and its better. Again, glad that as my sessions continue I can go home 'braless' and I wont have to worry about my bra or fabrics rubbing any irritated areas. I'll probably start taking my cotton tshirts w/me to work so that I can lather down and wear that home so that I dont have to change again.
