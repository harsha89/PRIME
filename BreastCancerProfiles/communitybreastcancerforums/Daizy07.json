When I was first diagnosed I was told it was micro invasive, AND told to hold all questions til I received a call back, since he was just a radiologist and could not answer any specific questions!! Then a few day later a call to say, that it might only be DCIS. Then silence. I stepped out on my own and paid out of pocket to speak with a breast oncologist specialist, so I could at least get some questions answered, I was going crazy! Original Dr. said general surgeon would do lumpectomy and bing bang, all done. Specialist ordered MRI w/contrast, which showed 2 other suspicious spots, which put me at a cross road. Investigate/biopsy the other two areas and re evaluate or MX. This is all a very personal journey and decision, you must do what is comfortable for you. I'll share my thought process that I took to get to my decision to MX. My 1st biopsy experience was quite an ordeal, so the prospect of having two more areas investigated was not appealing. If the two areas were also DCIS, too much tissue would need to be removed so lumpectomy would not be an option. For my peace of mind, I elected for RMX and vowed no regrets. End pathology showed two areas were precancerous original area of concern for sure DCIS, so 'fantastic' decision to MX (quote from my specialist). Without that MRI who knows how my path would have been. Now I am entering into the reconstruction journey, so many questions, concerns, horror stories and conflicting information, it is a daunting process! Write down questions and don't forget to take them with you to your appointment. As what if's ie: what if I only do lumpectomy, what are follow up treatments? What if I have MX or BMX? Use resources like this to help discuss and gain insight, but also remember that not all information is relevant to you and your personal situation.",

I'm very much a planner, but this diagnosis has turned me on my head, and I feel like I'm doing catch up. My breast surgeon is quite experienced, but not an excuse for me to just follow in line, I should have inquired more. I tried not to look into too many reconstruction options until I could meet with a PS, didn't want to get stuck on an option and then not be a candidate for it. Was working off of implants only and I am okay with that, but now that I am aware of the flap procedures, I'd like to consider them as well. TRAM scares me with the abdominal muscle bit, probably why there have been modifications like muscle sparing and DIEP. ReadyAbout you bring up a good point on the waiting to see how tissue responds. Thankfully so far my skin and nipple are doing fantastic, just a slight seroma and hematoma further up my chest wall. The sloshing is a bit unnerving, so I'm still wrapping pretty snugly. Some slight bruising still, but honestly with the fluid, it looks strangely close to normal. :) (Course there is a large divot where the cancer site was shaved a bit thinner.) Again I really appreciate the response! It has helped my stress level immensely!",

From the information I have been able to gather most people have immediate reconstruction with nipple sparing mastectomy, I'm still waiting to progress through the reconstruction phase. Am I going to encounter a set back/roadblock with a NSM and no spacers/expanders? Is there a ticking clock/urgency for me to get to the reconstruction phase? I was given an appointment with a plastic surgeon for 5/24 and after talking with him, I'd like to pursue the DIEP option, but unfortunately that Dr. only does TRAM. After researching TRAM, it would seem that DIEP makes better sense, so that means another wait for a consultation, set for 6/8. 1st PS said to not drain seroma since it was keeping 'space'. I feel like I'm being cornered into doing implants, since I don't want the TRAMP and it will be another 2 wks before I can obtain a second PS opinion, then the added time for surgery scheduling. What if I wait for a DIEP consult only to find out I'm not a candidate and then start over again with the implant option? Ugh the stress of it all Any input? Any others out there with NSM and delayed reconstruction? Thanks in advance ",
