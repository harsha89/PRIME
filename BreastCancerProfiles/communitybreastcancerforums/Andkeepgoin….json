I am looking for anyone who has had experience with tanking neutrophils on Halaven: just got back from my cancer centre - had to forego my second dose of cycle 1 Halaven/Eribulin, as my Neutrophils tanked to 0.36 from 3.20 the previous week. They had risen from 2.3 the week prior. :-( Thought they would have rescheduled me to next week; however, the chemo nurse said the doctor told her I should omit next week, then start up on the regular cycle; i.e. which is to start on March 7th (I would see her on March 6th for the 'usual' pre-chemo assessment, according to the 'start up on the regular cycle'). Question: has anyone had that experience with their first doseg and was allowed to continue with the drug? She reduced my initial dose to 1.1mg/kg-squared due to mild-moderately elevated liver function tests after failure of previous treatment, and we had hoped that the dosage would be increased in the 2nd cycle. I am wondering if they are going to pull me off Eribulin. Does anyone have any similar experience with this drug? Thanks in advance.",

I am - ahem - 'was' on the Metadur trial at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada. It is a phase I trial to determine whether the hypomethylating agent 'azacitidine' and 'durvalumab' work on breast cancer, as well as a few other solid tumour cancers. I believe ovarian and colorectal cancers. Not sure how it is working for everyone else, as I am one of two BC patients on the trial, 4 people when I registered in November. Possibly a few more patients added since then. Durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor (i.e. it targets PD-L1). It has been having great success with lung and bladder cancers, from what I read last year; therefore AstraZeneca is expanding the trials to other types of cancers. They received breakthrough therapy status from the US FDA for treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive urothelial bladder cancer about a year ago. Didn't work for me - crashed and burned. By the time I arrived at the hospital, the trials oncologist had already contacted my regular medical oncologist to set up an appointment with her to start on a new chemo. She did not want to consider another trial, due to the washout period required, and they want to pull the big guns out again, which means chemo. Awaiting that appt - they are pushing for meeting with her and starting chemo next week. I expect it may take a bit longer than that, but they are on the ball. My regular oncologist gave me the option of Eribulin or immunotherapy last Nov. I jumped on the immunotherapy trial, as I had high hopes for that new option. I had asked her about Gemzar as well - she said she would go with Eribulin first - they have seen better results. So...I guess I am back to losing my hair and shopping for a new wig. Anyways, I am back at work and have meetings to attend and enough to keep me busy, which will keep my mind off things. Ha. the trials nurse asked me if I was going home after meeting with them. \"No, I am going back to work. What am I going to do at home - sit and think about the latest developments?\". For all I know, I could get hit by a bus before cancer ends me. I will post once I am on the new chemo regimen - or I have a decent update.",

On the bright side, the trial cleaned up my bone mets - not something I read while I was focusing on the progression bit - so hopefully they stay quiet for now. I think I spent a good part of the past few weeks bending at the hip to experience 'less pain' and then 'no pain' and tried twisting and turning a few other spots to check things out. Immunotherapy is not where the current therapies are, but they have been making strides in recent years. There were some trials (Keynote-012 was one of them) which had relatively good success with TNBC. The trial I was on at Princess Margaret CC is run by two co-directors who have been working in the immunotherapy and anti-cancer drug development fields for years. One was the chair of some ASCO committees and is the Head of the Phase I trials at PMCC; the other is the Chair of the Cancer Immunotherapy Steering Committee of the AACR, and sits on a bunch of other boards. They have also indicated that immunotherapy has not been too successful with HR+ BCs so far, but they and other researchers at the cancer centre are investigating a number of new drugs and drug combinations. So, I don't think your wife's onc was just trying to alleviate your concerns. One thing they did say is that when the immunotherapy drugs work, they work for a long time. With that said, I am almost triple negative, and possibly going HER2+ at this point, so perhaps I got somewhat of a response because of that, or the drug combo on the trial did the job to make my immune system 'see' the cancer cells in my bones. All the best for your wife - and make sure she lathers on the hand/foot cream while she is on Xeloda to avoid or minimize the hand/foot syndrome!",

I find it annoying that they cannot find enough chemos to treat us that do not include losing hair. I am gearing up for my third round of hair loss. My hair used to be my pride and joy. Funnily enough, I had compliments on my 'hair' (wig) almost every day. I basically had 'great hair days' for about 9 months each time. It was made specifically for chemo patients - make sure you get that type of wig, and not the regular ones, as they are built to take into account more sensitive scalps (may not work for everyone). The wig should fit, so that it does not slide around - the chemo wigs have velcro pieces underneath to adjust the circumference. I can attest to them fitting well, as I had an incident with a bird with my first wig which proved how well those things stay: I went for a walk down by the beach one morning and noticed a bird started chirping and following me down the path. Well, I figured I was close to its nest or something and it was trying to distract me. Nope, it appears there was a bug in my hair/wig, which it had its eye on. The next thing I know, the bird is swooping down, trying to lunge at it at the back of my head. My natural reaction was to flip my torso, head, and 'hair' forward to get rid of the bird. In front of dozens of people picnicking along the path...Well, I got rid of the bird, then realized while I was still bent over at the waist what I had done. Hmm, wig is still on my head...I flipped my head back up and the wig was still in place! Phew! I brushed my hair down a bit and kept walking. So, if anyone caught it on their iphones, it did not include a woman losing her wig because of a bird going after a bug. I do hold onto a section of my wig hair if it gets windy. It looks like I am keeping hair out of my face on a windy day. Perhaps go to a wig salon, if you haven't already, and talk to them about your concerns and have them fit you with a wig. They should also be able to it for you to suit your face shape. With both of my previous two wigs, everyone thought they were my actual hair. Also, if you are concerned about the wig slipping or falling off, buy a wig cap. They fit snugly on your scalp, and you can bobby-pin your wig to it. I did that with my second wig while I grew my hair out, as I was working, and did not want my colleagues to know what was going on. After my initial diagnosis, I told my hairdresser and that I was not happy about having short hair. His response was that he and I now had something to look forward to as it grew back: a bunch of new hairstyles at different lengths. Yes, I did have fun with that, so perhaps something for you to look forward to down the road. My third wig: probably something at shoulder length to match the current length of my hair.",

My cancer centre has a wig salon with stylists, so I book an appointment with them, and we try on a bunch of different wigs until I find one that I like and which suits me. They will then trim it if I want to customize the look (have not had a wig styled by them, as both suited me out of the box). One of the stylists told me that wig styles may look great on the mannequin head, but can look quite different on different people, as each person's face shape and length of neck dictates what looks good. With that said, I too am tempted to buy a few wigs from a catalog, especially if they are cheaper! I would say try out the catalogs - as long as you can return the wigs if you don't like them. Human hair vs. synthetic: that is a personal choice. As Divine stated, they are more difficult to take care of, and you need to style them as you would regular hair and after washing, but, you could colour them if you wanted to. They are also more expensive. Synthetic wigs come with a 'pre-set' style so when you wash them, they dry back to their original style. Both of my previous wigs were synthetic. My thought was 'If I am losing my hair, I am not going to spend time styling a wig!' I wanted the 'bonus time' to do other stuff, given the situation. Also, with my first synthetic wigs, the wig shop warned me to stay away from extreme heat (camp fires, opening an oven door), as they can singe/melt. By the time I needed my second wig, I no longer had to worry about that, as the new material was heat proof, so look out for those types too. Also, some of the synthetic wigs can be styled with rollers/curling irons, as they are heat proof. That was the case with my second wig, but I never bothered, as I liked the original style. Lastly, with wigs you can have lace front wigs for a natural-looking front hairline, and monofilament wigs with flesh-toned cap, so that it looks like your scalp is showing through your hair for a more natural look. Both my wigs were monofils, one without a lace front and one with. There are also 'hats with hair' - hair attached to the sides of a baseball cap/hat only, so that it looks like your hair is peaking out from under you hat, but the top of your head is actually only covered by the fabric of the hat. Possibly an option for people with more sensitive scalps.",
