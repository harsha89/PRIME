They will mail you information on what to have handy when they call you. I started recieving SSI payments around September, I kept having to update them on my situation and current treatments, surgeries, etc. I recieved SSI for about 9 months, they said I didn't become disabled until Dec 2010, and will be recieving my SSDI payments starting in July. I didn't quite understand why they said I wasn't disabled until Dec, but I'm very greatful for being approved so I will accept that. And you can go to their website ssa.org, and it is helpful. I wish you the best of luck with everything.",
