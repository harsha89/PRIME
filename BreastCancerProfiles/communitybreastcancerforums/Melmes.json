Got to the hospital at 9:00 a.m. and didn't get out until five p.m. I had the dexamethosone intravenously and it felt like I had a yeast infection on the inside - mad weird tingling hot itching!! Intense at first to the point where I was squirming, but it let up after about a minute. They also gave me benadryl, which knocked me out. T/C was uneventful. I feel tired but good right now and am drinking a LOT of water to flush my system, including water with lemon juice to alkalize my liver and help it  do its job easier.  I'm supposed to take two dexamethasone pills tomorrow, then two the day before my next chemo, two the day of, and two the day after; repeat each time, four rounds. Surely such a small amount over the course of four months won't affect weight gain and bloating too much? I'm shaving my head in the morning, or rather my friend is. I saw \"The Craft\" at an impressionable age and I just can't  go through that hair bit - it would traumatize me for life. So I'm doing it myself! lol",

My head is really itchy, but that could be as much due to the RIDICULOUS acne flare up as anything. Did anyone else have a major total body eruption of acne? It's awful - face, head, back, back of the arms, even on my butt. UIt's like being 16 again - all the WORST parts of it! I actually had to go buy Neutrogena acne wash and soothing face scrub and the swipey pads. Awful. Can a gal not get a bit of break?! lol",

The rehab exercises the poor PT girl gave me are silly and I am already past that level of flexibility (I'm a lifelong athlete, dancer and runner, and have taught Yoga/Pilates, so my body responds very quickly to physical activity and rehab work). Prior to the bipsy/lumpectomy, I was running about 25-30 miles a week and dancing and doing pilates  2-3 times a week on top of that. How soon after the lumpectomy can I go back to moderate working out? I don't want to rip my stitches, but I also haaaaaate sitting around. My doctor said \"a few weeks\" and I am scheduled to get my stitches out next week sometime, but I don't want to wait that long to feel good and like I am doing something proactive.

So it will be chemo and rads for me, most likely. I also am very lucky and feel it was divine providence that led me to the tumor, which was under my breast and should have been irritated by my bra yet never was. I wasn't doing self exams - just happened to feel it sudsing up in the shower one morning. I share your timeframe - found it on the 6th of April and it's already out and we're in post-lumpectomy discussions - I see my oncologist on the 26th. I have already found this forum to be a wealth of support and caring and giving. I hope you will also do so.",

I know my diagnosis so far is more or less \"mild\" compared to that of others, and I feel very lucky for that, mild anxiety attacks aside. I don't see the oncologist until the 26th. This all happened so fast to this point - I found the lump three weeks ago today. I managed to get a same-day doctor's visit and mammogram/ultrasound at the hospital, then the biopsy last week and the lumpectomy this week. My doctor is recommending re-excision for a wider margin, because there was DCIS a few millimeters from the margins of the first sample. But they didn't find anything in any of the nodes and found no sign of IDC beyond the initial tumor. Because there were cancer cells in some blood vessels in the sample, I don't think a re-excision is necessary - we know there is a possibility, however faint, for more cancer cells somewhere in my body, so I am pushing for chemo as well as radiation, oncotype or no oncotype (they're doing one, apparently). Regardless of what they say, I don't want to assume that was all because there was so little, and then wake up with stage 3 pancreatic cancer in five years because we didn't go more aggressively now. I just want to hit it with everything and feel confident we handled it. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not scared to death, but I do feel that my prognosis is good, and I'm going to hang on to that.",

We wouldn't necessarily do that, but it is nice to know the card is still in the deck if we wanted to (I had planned on getting to ABD and then trying for a third child, although now of course the doctoral work has been pushed back a year as well).

They found cells in blood vessels. they don't know if they have traveled elsewhere in other blood vessels. I WILL have chemo to kill anything in there, and I don't care what kind of a fit I have to throw at whom. Oncotypes can't predict everything, there's no way to know if there are cells in the rest of my body through the circulatory system, but cells were seen in blood vessels, and therefore I am all about preventative and proactive action. Many women in this thread seem to be doing MX and DBMX - was this a personal choice, or doctor's suggestion? My doctor told me there was no reason to do the MX if it were solely for preventing recurrence, because there would still be breast tissue there, and that she feels lumpectomy followed by chemo/rads is my best course of action. I am wondering why others with \"lighter\" diagnoses (i.e. stage 1 grade 1/2 instead of grade 3) are ending up with MX. 9Which I have no problem doing if it comes down to it - just, why do some have it and others not, is that medical or personal in nature?) I am heartened by the positivity so many women here are showing, and I believe I will have a positive outcome from all of this - but I am still scared, especially when I see people with better stats than mine having recurrent cancer. I thought for sure stage 1, grade 1, with a 90% full cure rate, wouldn't see so many return folks - so now suddenly stage 1 grade 3 sounds much scarier than it did last week. :(",

Friday I was sent to a town an hour and a half away to do an MRI and a follow up ultrasound. My radiologist wanted them to check something he saw on my left breast, in a different location. The MRI was fine - actually, the tech was really great. I got to the \"Breast Imaging Center\" where \"All they do is this, every day, so they are experts\" at 10:30. At 11:15 they pulled me back to tell me the doctor I was supposed to see wasn't there today and they didn't have any of my paperwork or information (luckily, I had my big-ass binder o' Cancer Chick Stuff. NO WAY was I driving an hour and a half home and coming back another day because they didn't have it together). They made copies of everything (while I faxed my doctor's office for the cat and bone scan results from last week) and sent me off on my merry way back to the waiting room. I waited and waited and WAITED. When I finally got taken back to a room, it was 2:25 p.m. The u/s tech did her thing, it took about forty minutes. 'Cause why? Because (as she let slip) they thought my radiologist got the report wrong and what they were looking for was in my right, supposedly disease-free breast and not the left. (?!?!?!?!?! That was the first time I heard that and it came from the u/s tech?!?!?!?!) Then, Dr. Coldheart came in and said yes, they think my radiologist miswrote the report, and the CAT and MRI scans are showing a 4 mm something in my right breast. She ultrasounds again doing exactly what the u/s tech did. THEN she sends me back to the waiting room. Then I get pulled back for a set of mammograms (and the mammogram tech kept going out and coming back and doing another one because she didn't get what the doctor wanted). It was INSANE. THEN, the doctor came back and said \"well, there's a something, but it is very possibly benign. We should biopsy, but you're not a good candidate for MR biopsy because of the location, but we can do a clip biopsy. I can't see it on u/s or mammogram because your breasts are so dense. I'm like well, won't chemo zap anything that might be cancerous, and if the MRI and CAT scans are the only things pickjing this up and they are notorious for being highly sensitive and registering a lot of false positives, and I have had three ultrasounds and eight mammogram shots and you aren't seeing anything there, then what are the odds it's nothing? Her: The odds are good. But in the instances of cancer in both breasts at the same time they don't recommend breast conservation. Me: ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS THING I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IS CANCER?! No, not necessarily, there's a good chance it isn't. We won't know for sure unless we biopsy But if it is, then yes, you might want to consider a more aggressive approach. (Read: She clearly is advocating for an \"extreme home makeover\". Just to clarify, I asked her what my options were). Her: We can just follow it with MRI every six months, it depends on how aaggressive you want to be. Me: In your professional opinion, you're telling me you would recommend a double mastectomy and oopherectomy? Her: your age is very troubling, because you are so young. I mean, she didn't really address my questions, just made me feel more and more hopeless about it all. Finally, she was all, I'm going to send all of this over to your doctor and let you talk with her about it. I left there after eight hours of testing feeling so much worse than ever before, thinking for the first time in all of this I might actually die. It was horrific. My doctor called last night: The CAT scan never saw whatever the MRI picked up on. The CAT scan report was correct, and my radiologist did NOT miswrite it. She has no idea what they were doing with the right breast stuff, unless they looked atht eMRI and then thought they saw something on the CAT scan that my radiologist missed. But I told her I am NOT going back there, and she quite agrees with me. I am being sent to a different hospital from now on (a top-ten cancer research center, no less!!), but it means everything goes on \"pause\" while the new hospital evaluates my case and determines what to do, so I am not starting chemo this week. It's soooooo frustrating!!! But I keep thinking: What if I were not an educated, academic researcher, and this happened? What do women do?!",

He says he wants a biopsy done now just to rule anything out, but he does NOT want me to worry and does NOT think they will find it to be anything. I should get evaluated and seen at the other hospital sometime in the next two-three weeks, and he wants to start chemo immediately post-biopsy - a week if it's benign, two weeks if a lumpectomy is necessary. I am so lucky to have a team that cares about me.

I had the lumpectomy this past Tuesday. My diagnosis is IDC, 8 mm, stage 1 grade 3, 0 nodes. They found DCIS and cancer cells in some blood vessels when they did the tissue sample, but my margins were clear, albeit by a few millimeters only. That given, I have decided to fight for the right to receive chemo - they just want to do radiation. I feel very strongly that if they have found even a few cells in blood vessels, there is no way for us to know if there are cells anywhere else in my body - I am not willing to live with the chance that I could have cancer again in a few years because we didn't throw everything at it now. I don't WANT the chemo - but I don't want the cancer recurrence more. At present, given that even with a double-mastectomy there is still breast tissue present, my doctor doesn't think there is any point in doing MX/double MX in my case - but I am willing to go that route in a second as well, if my doctor changes her mind on it. I caught it early, but it is a grade 3, aggressive cancer. I intend to treat it with respect. Anyhow - I thought you might like to know that you will not be going thhrough chemo alone, there are many of us scheduled to go through soon. And it is very doable - I have a coworker who only missed a few days. I think it is a very individual thing, and of course there are many different combinations of drugs and so forth - it all depends. I know women who barely lost any hair, and then of course those who lost all of their hair. All of my friends who have already been down this road say the biggest issues are exhaustion, nausea, and the burned skin from radiation. There are many ways to handle all of the side effects, and I know I am afraid and don't know so much yet, but I also know there is plenty of support here for me. ((HUG)) Hang in there! I don't know if anything I've written helps you out or not, but I thought at least you'd like to know you are not alone.",
