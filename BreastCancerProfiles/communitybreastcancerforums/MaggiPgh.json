      "Content": "Mar 14, 2013 04:56PM - edited Mar 14, 2013 04:58PM by MaggiPgh Hi Pinkheart, Thanks for responding to my recent discussion.  I am really stuck right now and need some input from as many of you as possible. My PMPS has been with me since 2008.  I have learned over the years to just cope with it.  However< I now have capsular contractures as well in both breasts, which seems to have been exccerbated by a recent car accident, where it was high impact.  I don't have much trust in the PS's in Pgh.  I need a PS in the Pennsyvania area that is highly skilled in breast revisions, more specifically in breast explantation.  I have seen a Dr. Gedge Rossen at John's Hopkins, but my insurance will not cover surgery if done outside of PA. I'm told I can have what's called a capsulotomy (removal of implants, then cutting up of the capsule to relieve the pressure, then new implants back in). Or I can have both capsules removed and new implants put in.  My worry is further nerve damage. I already have so much nerve pain in my chest, should I risk more sugery and subsequent nerve damage? I am seriously thinking of having everything taken off for good.  I am 58 and know of the emotional impact it may have, but my family is just plain worn out.  I have to think of them. Anyone know of some highly skilled PS's in state of PA?  Or anywhere for that matter?  \"Natural\" breast reconstruction is not for me.  I need my muscles and cannot go through the pain and suffering of the recovery.   Regards,  Maggi",

We have Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome.  Drs. really don't want to discuss it, since it is surgical error related.  I do hope this helps. We are all in this together.

I'm new to this posti g stuff on chat rooms and don't understand a lot of the abbreviations. It is so nice to hear about your recovery. In fact, I got to that place of a le to do manual labor without much pain but then had a car accident ruptured my one implant, removed both of them through surgery and now back to square one. I know it will b 2 yrs. before I'm a le to do stuff like you described. It's very disheartening to have that d familiar burning and pressure tightness in my chest again. So it's helpful to read your words of encouragement. Sure would like to hear from some others too.",

It would open up them or their colleagues to a lawsuit. They will lie as much as they need to. Neurologists, on the other hand, are not surgeons, and will usually tell it like it is.  Maggi",

It is still hard to tell if the total deconstruction (the BS called it bilateral capsulectomy) worked.  He did say my capsules (which form under implants) were hard as rocks! I have post surg. pain and swelling now but I am hopeful.  I asked the surgeon to not stitch me up too tight, to leave some skin there.  He also went around the breast area to break up some of the scar tissue (which he feels was causing some more pain). He was the only breast surgeon that believed I had pain and was willing to help me here in Pgh.  I went to 5 total.  If you decide to do more, you have to find a surgeon who does revisions, that specializes in our type of cases, and that is hard because all BS tell you that they do everything. If you advocate for yourself, some BS's will just not take your case (which is good), and others will speak your language, like mine did.     I hope this helps someone else so that they don't have to go through what I did.

Well I did it.  I am now flat chested and I believe that the surgery has helped, even jsut 3 days out.  I have those nasty drains, but they'll be out soon.  then I wil see what happens. I asked my BS, who believed me about my pain, to not sew me up too tight. he also tried to break up scar tissue around my breast area.  I currently still feel the tightness in my chest area.  If that continues then I will work on getting analogous fat grafting. Hey, thanks Whippetmom for all of your research on PMPS. The problem is, BS don't believe in this as a risk, so they really won't discuss it much with patients.  See, like you said, it is caused by surgical technique..so if the patient has PMPS after surgery, they have a good malpractice case.  I tried but it was too late.  The best thing we can do is keep talking about it and encourage, like Whippetmom did, to ask women to talk to the doctor before your surgery. If they don't want to do this. or minimize this risk, find another surgeon. After 5 years of pain, it is worth it to wait, but I know how scared I was and just wanted the CA out of me. We have to be our own advocates and educate ourselves.  I was actually asked to join a study at the University of Pittsburgh that is researching why some women get PMPS and some women don't.  As if, my personality or physical make-up causes poor surgical technique!!! Unbelievable.",

Injections are good but without phenol in them, they never last.  You can only have phenol injections twice per year.  Other types of injections I am not aware of. If you have a neuroma, sometimes they can remove it by surgery, after first trying the frequency injections. Not sure of the proper term. I have a vast knowledge of what has helped me, but we are all different, yet all the same.  These surgeons have just been given a license to cut whatever nerves they want, despite possibly disabling us for life. I applied for disability and got it without even  hiring an attorney. the SSOffice was disgusted when they heard my story.  Keep ranting baby, that helps too.  I am starting a support group here in Pittsburgh at hopefully Gilda's Club or a church. we have to unite!!!

I am just struggling so much with my pain.  When I wake up in the morning, the tightness and burning is there, but really bearable.  I get up and go about my business. by 2 or 3 it is almost unbearable, and it gets worse as the day goes on.  In the morning I think, \"well maybe this isn't so bad..perhaps it is in my head, like the surgeons told me\".  I think the interventions I've been using have just stopped working.  Last night I almost went to the ER, then my husband reminded me that when i went the last time (many years ago), they just gave me more pain meds and kind of treated me like a drug addict.  Ok, so here is what I use to address my pain, both chemically and otherwise: Exercise - stretches, yoga, swimming I wear a tank top that has some lycra in it. I tried compression bras and it was really uncomfortable. Creams and ointments twice daily ice Physical therapy - myofacial release, etc.  I'm just starting this. meds - neurontin, celebrex, tramadol, vicodin, percocet (it seems as if these meds have just stopped working.  When I take them, the effect lasts only about 2 hours. I wanted to know if anyone experiences the pain the way I do and also what other non-narcotic medications you take that might work.  I took lyrica before and it made me way too drowsy.  What else do you suggest?  Please help, I am desperate.  Also, what other non-medication interventions work for you?  It seems like mine just aren't working lately.  I'm so frustrated.   Thanks for you support.  I wish I had some of you  here in Pgh.  Maggi",

First, she told me that my emotions caused my breast cancer.  then she told me that my issue was not the nerve damage and scar tissue, but because I thought my body image was poor and i had not accepted my scars.  She told me that in all of her years as a PT, she has never seen anyone with this PMPS this bad. Well, thanks so much.  I told her that my insurance does not pay a PT to do psychotherapy.  This is the 2nd PT I've found in Pittsburgh that thinks they are \"healers\" rather than PT's.  Doing reiki, etc. She would hold her hands over my chest or over my shoulders and told me this would help.  She also said that all facia is connected and that working on my legs would help my chest!! So now I'm so frustrated and scared that I'll not find a PT in Pgh. who actually does myofacial on my chest. I only have one more person to see next week. After that I guess I'll have to just call PT's in my area and ask each one if they do myofacial release. why does finding the right people to treat us have to be so hard.  Right now I am at my wits end..just having another injection that did not work and going to 4 sessions of PT where I got more riduculous healing theories than actual treatment...hey where is evveryone??  I may have to start another thread or something to get this talk on PostMastectomy Pain Syndrome going.

Perhaps if u r younger you recover better. I don't know but if u truly have PMPS it would not subside in a few months from my experience with the other women on Facebook page. Hope this helps.
