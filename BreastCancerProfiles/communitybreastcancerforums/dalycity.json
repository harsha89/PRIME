But the fact that she has negative PET scans, which is good news, why is he putting her in palliative care? Badboob is correct; there are many, many options available to late stage cancer.  Seems the docs have to try everything possible.  Are you or your sister able to call her doctor with your list of questions? Such as why won't chemo work for her; other options for her, etc.? I am so sorry about the prejudicism in HK.  My prayers are with you and your SIL.  Best wishes, ",

I remember my second opinion doc said that with an Oncotype, you cannot \"hang you hat on it\".  My main breast specialist doc told me he would make the chemo recommendation based on various factors - age, menopausal status, tumor over 2cm, and of course, Oncotype, etc. You do have good news with negative nodes and Grade 1 status. The doctors go by their experience and education, and make their best educated recommendations based on that. No one really knows if chemo will help a particular person or not.   I hope you will get a second opinion.  Good luck to you in your decision.",

And only way of course is a biopsy, which was done in the doctor's office, not difficult at all, kind of like giving blood. Oh, you brought a smile to me when I read that you were embarrassed to show your big breasts to nurses & radiologists; well, I was embarrassed to show my SMALL breasts to them! The whole BC ordeal for me was scary of course; but throughout my whole treatment, I reminded myself that I have to do the best that I can; and that I have to leave alone the things I cannot control.  I wish you all the best.",
