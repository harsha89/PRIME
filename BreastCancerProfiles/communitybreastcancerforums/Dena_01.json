I have read quite a bit that distortion can be caused by previous biopsies. But then I read that the distortion heals or decreases over time. It has been 1.5 years and is larger. It is all very, very confusing. suzythatisme and anamia3-me - Any updates on your end??? I know it has been a while..",

I just wanted to post and say I am in the same exact boat. several mammo/us/ mri/stereobx all for 11mm stellate distortion. MRI shows enhancing nodule in same location (although I just realized I have no info on the margins, shape, kinetics on that. Duh) Nothing shows on US (not the distortion or the nodule). Path reports of distortion benign- normal breast tissue. Radiologist team doesn't agree. Recommends surgical excision. Seems kinda extreme to me to remove something that hasn't been confirmed so I am going to get another opinion on the images while I wait for a surgical consult on 3/25. Hoping everyone had the same benign results. :)",
