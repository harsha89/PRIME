They can be on the spine, the ribs or the legs.Â  Most likely what you are feeling could be a sign of medication, fibromylagia, arthritis, a vitamin deficiency, reumetoid arthritis and host of other things. Mets is highly unlikely. So don't worry too much okay. Let the doctors do their job and try and relax. I know its hard. I am having a lumpectomy on the 29th and I am clueless and knowing my mom died of cancer less than 2 years ago as to what I have. Hopefully its a benign thing. So I know the fear of the unknown and uncertaintly. Lets not right each other off so fast and think the worst. Hope and pray for the best. Thinking of you!",
