The best advice I can give is to make sure your breast surgeon and plastic surgeon work together for the best possible outcome. If you are uncomfortable with one or the other...well, dammit, find someone who you are comfortable with. Ask questions, be frank about your fears....I look at my chest now and am so amazed that a scant six month ago I wondered how it would ever look \"normal\"....and I don't even have nipples yet! hahaha it is in some odd way, a healing part of it all that is for *us*- in the sense of reconstruction.

What could be worse than that? You have been diagnosed with cancer. What could be worse than that? Do you see where I am going with this? I have had a lot of losses in my life, starting with the death of my 13 year old brother from cancer when I was 7. That was the first worst thing. Our lives are filled with them. We cannot imagine anything worse and we lived through them to today. Somedays, that works for me. Other times I just wallow around in it for awhile. We're human. It is ok.

That is the point and pure luck we have in having caught it in a early stage SO IT DOES NOT DEVELOP INTO SOMETHING WORSE. Like Lago said, a few weeks is one thing, but months makes no sense at all....Mine too was very early very low grade but I opted for full BMX with reconstruction. if you have lumpectomy, at the least you will need rads. I did not want to deal with the worry and fears over the other breast or lingering cells in the one with cancer. Please do not put this off. Get another opinon if youwish, but please do not wait.

Even with glowing stats I knew before the biopsy I wanted them both off..sure it could come back somewhere else but I knew I didn't want repeat surgeries as other problems might have popped up in same or other breast. Nipples, schmipples, take them too...all I had to do was read that the chance for lingering cells or them turning black during reconstruction was enough for me (PERSONAL choice- I realize it does not happen to everyone- I know myself though-if anything turned black and died on me, I would absolutley be a bigger nutcase than I am) the worst thing were the drains...i hated them...if need them after exchange I will hate them again. I am going with implants as the doc said I didn't have enough extra fat (YEAH! first time in my life that happened) and did not want the extra scars.Again, personal choice. What I can suggest to anyone getting an exchange is to make sure the doc uses alloderm to anchor the TEs and implants. Makes a huge difference in them staying put during expansion process. After my exchange I will get the nips rebuilt out of the little extra pocket of skin PS had left at top of my vertical incision and then after a time, will get tatoos to finish it off. Alot of my decisions were also base don the fact I scar (and scare!) very easily and the less cutting for me, the better. As for stats...ack, there are too many and too little. I am still wending my way through the maze of what is right for my treatment.  Two different results the oncotype said with AIs I have 5% chance of recurrence and 10% without, Adjuvant online said with treatment it only gives me like 9 mos longer to live...as I said, lots of different outcomes...i have ot make the choice based on what I can learn and what my gut tells me. So far, the gut hasn't led astray.",

Hmmmmm. interesting. Here is a top researcher, who really only saw me out of courtesy as my own \"stats\" were not sufficiently complex or advanced enough to warrant his having me as a patient (being honest here- THANK GOD) but he did agree to follow up. So after that little revelation about the surgical choice he said yes, do the ai's...will likely back up what you did...best we have now...should do some good....if one does not work becasue of side effects knocking you out you can try out the others..... WTF?! all the science seemed to go out the window in my mind. for some reason he was just in a musing mood i guess....we had hit it off personally....I am like what is it with the \"shoulds\"...and the \"best we have now\"....I realized even then there were no absolutes but it really hit me. Crapshoot? coin toss? either is applicable. for some, some treatment will work, for others, will not. like life i guess. and i have to say the 50/50 makes sense to me in that spirit. there are things i have done and can continue to do in order to somehow prevent a recurrence that either will or will not occur. Don't stop research obviously, but in the end, it either happens or it does not. I take small solace in stats. Sure there is some statistics proclaiming I should. But in the end, I have to just to act as if. I won't live in constant fear. I can't. Because then there would be no adavantage to having an \"insignificant\" cancer...which is the biggest oxymoron on the planet. Some moments the mind wanders into the darkness and you know what pulls me back from the abyss? Knowing it will either happen or it will not. I certainly cannot prepare or live as if I would know, because I can't. None of us can. I can't even prepare for the worst since everybody's worse is different. Toss in our own dna and well, call it a day. Barbe is right in always stating her opinions are based on \"observing here\". empirical data in its purest form...to me, it underscores the nature of BC - personally, exemplifying the chaos theory.

She has fulltime care for mom (paid for by mom) and is not trapped in any sense of the word...she went on to tell me that since I am home anyway with my youngest (with his autism) what is the big difference if mom lives here too...that i can hire someone to \"look at them\" at myhouse instead of hers...this is vile and I cannot believe she would do it so I say there is no way, not with the past year...the BC, the BMX the reocnstruction and oh yeah in the midst of divorce after 35 years and the kiddo spiraling out of control because he does not understand why papa does not live here and he only sees him a day or two if lucky a week....my sister said yeah i know you have had a rough year or two but this is MY TIME TO SHINE!!!! so next thing i know she announces mom is moved in...that was just this wednesday...I WAS FREAKED OUT THAT SHE DID IT>..i know selfish and self centerdness but this is ridiculous...I never dreamed she was so....well...i went there yesterday and completely lost it...my mom....who has given everything she ever had in her being to all of us was laying in a dingy room on a metal bed with all of her world reduced to some pics on a cheap three drawer chest..I WENT BERSERK...I had just left a funeral for my friend's father...so my mind was already reeling....I had to calm don so mom did not get upset..she was just laying there looking like life was over....i stayed and faked it and got her to go for a walk and then got out of there...I could not call my sister last night for I feared I would go over there are literally knock her out - we were NOT RAISED THIS WAY...I slept on this and prayed for strength and knew I would keep the promise I whispered to mom before i left...that I would be bringing her home...I called my sister this morning (which is weird since she friggin works in my office and calmly said I am taking her home how do I do that...she asked why....i aid well she will die there and i cannot let her stay...there is no reason for our mother to be in a nursing home...she is not sick...she is old...my sister said fine but can you get her out before saturday so billing does not hit! HOLY GEEZUS....I could not breathe but i kept my tongue and said just get moms stuff together that is at your house so I can set her up and I will bring her home....she said great.. but most of moms *stuff* is gone...not surprising....I was no sooner off phone when my lovely sister rushes out of office to go SIGN OFF on my mom at the nursing home (which is 25 miles away from any of us -always good to keep loved ones close!!!!!!!!!!) and then calls me and says SHE IS ALL YOURS...and \"by the way Annette, she won't have any more checks come in until May...\"(I am guessing she is taking Mom's April money as a little bonus for her martyrdom- that all the money and the house that her and my brother looted from mom was not enough-she's gotta take the small pension and social security mom gets as well)....I said no problem ....and she said you can;'t change your mind...i just shook my head.... so.... my mom is coming to live with me and you know what, it is all going to be ok, because that is how it should be...i only wish i could have done it sooner...So this is not a downer in any way for it will finally be as it should be.... here is the picture I took of mom and me yesterday before I left...isn't she beautiful!!!!!!!

Unless someone is in dire need of something - in which case I'd do my best to get them immediately instead of waiting for a holiday- the best gifts are what we feel in our hearts and know about the person...some thoughtfulness and it may often land up being something very inexpensive but zings right to them- cause it shows we know the person- id much rather just get and give gifts like that to a few and save the list purchases for groups like the homeless and disadvantaged- I'm not trying to sound like a preacher but I am really feeling this way....if I have to tell you what I want then you do not know enough of me to be buying me a gift...visa versa....I love spontaneous gifts ... Where you find something and say oh man they would love this - where it hits ya...those kind of gifts can be a few bucks to way lots of bucks but that's the beauty if you keep the gift giving to those you feel in your heart not because you feel you HAVE to buy them something. I can actually remember those few things over the years that hit me in my heart...same as I can remember someone's face lighting up with recognition when they opened theirs....it really speaks of the heart. I'm pretty philosophical today I guess...geez sorry for the essay but I am so damn amazed when I woke up and understood two years ago today I had my bmx and it is two years that I have been cancer free. I'm allowing myself to forget all the other bs from these two years and saying YEAH!!!! I am alive and looking forward to A LOTTA MO! I love you all and thanks for indulging me these ramblings....",

There is so much they can do no matter how dire it seems right now and you r onc would not be sending you to surgeon or rad doc if there was no point. Take a breath, a deep one. If you aren't convinced your doc is the right one, then go to Ann Arbor- it is a teaching hospital and one of the best in the country, if not the world. Please keep me posted...I care.",

She thought it was because she was taking too much blood...I said no, just freaking out here...and then I looked at my blood and said DOES THAT LOOK LIKE GOOD BLOOD?> IS IT TOO THICK? sheesh...I am a primo nutcase.

And when I got up I look around and there are like three others getting their blood drawn and looking at me like I am the whackjob I am.

Well, as Tina said, listening to my heart. I had actually made my mind up years before diagnosis. It had randomly crossed my mind over the years and I said, no matter what, that is what I would do. Never dreaming I would have that choice to make. I battled off questions in that month between diagnosis last October and the BMX in November. It was the only part of this journey I did not question. And I do not question today. That's just for me, nobody else. I actually had someone say to me \"Would you cut off your foot if you had ingrown toenail\" That was nice. I said \"Not the same as cancer, ingrown toenails never killed anyone that I know of. But I would cut off the nail:)\" In the end, it is such a personal choice and what is odd, after the fact, every single medical professional I have dealt with, including those who tried to talk me out of it, agreed with my decision. Which is even more odd. Since there was nothing beyond some dense tissue in my left breast. I would never question aloud another woman's choice in her treatment. A coupld of weeks ago when I was already in a funk, I got news that a friend from high school had passed away. From BC. She chose no treatment at all. And lived for several years, perhaps five in total. Was she wrong? I can't say for her. For some think me a fool for passing on the AIs/tamox after my experience and just going with nutritionals. Am I wrong? Who can really say? None of us really know. I mourned her passing deeply despite the fact we never quite saw eye to eye on a lot of things but I respected her on many levels for her free spirit earth mother floatiness who did a lot of good work for battered women and their children back in Michigan. It was and is sad when another loses her life. OK< enough of the sad-I hope everyone has a great Sunday:) I cleaned my closets yesterday HOLY GEEZ- what a packratty slob I have been:) I open the doors to them now and then close it and peek back in again to make sure I am not dreaming. And that was just surface level organizing- now I gotta put everything where it should be in a better order. One corner of our lives at a time:)",

The study enrolled people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who had previously received treatment with Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and a taxane chemotherapy. The study showed people who received trastuzumab emtansine lived significantly longer without their disease getting worse (progression-free survival, or PFS) compared to those who received lapatinib plus Xeloda® (capecitabine). Final results for overall survival (OS), a co-primary efficacy endpoint of EMILIA, are not yet mature. The safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine was consistent with that seen in previous studies. These data will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. Trastuzumab emtansine is an investigational medicine known as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It is comprised of the antibody trastuzumab and the chemotherapy DM1 attached together using a stable linker. It is designed to target and inhibit HER2 signaling and deliver the chemotherapy directly inside HER2-positive cancer cells. Trastuzumab emtansine reinforces Roche's personalized healthcare approach of developing targeted medicines to fight cancer.",

I mean for heaven's sake, I was radical in choosing a BMX when a lumpectomy was recommended, there is a point you have to trust on some things. My choice was the BMX to avoid both worry of recurrence in other breast and to avoid rads/chemo. But the point is, I had a choice. If numbers and tumor, etc had been different, my choices might have been different. As it was, I had the BMX with immediate reconstruction and have no regrets. Your doctors sound thorough and most will err on the side of you taking chemo if they thought it best. I questioned mine a million times. It is the nature of the beast.

Years before my diagnosis almost exactlyone year ago I had always said...If I ever get BC, I am getting a mastectomy\". And that is what I said when I got the crappy news. I met resistance due to the patholy of my BC (early and small) but I insisted and persisted. And I have had not one regret. Zip. Oddly enough after I had it those professionals that had pushed for a lumpectomy agreed with my choice. I am not sure why since technically I was a perfect candidate for a lumpectomy and there were no surprises found during the surgery and resultant path tests and scans. I do know the reconstruction process gave my mind something else to focus on instead of the damn cancer. Sure it was uncomfortable at times but so is radiation and chemo. In fact, whenever i have complained of any pain I felt like an idiot when considering what so many have no choice but to go through. Recurrence rates, survival rates...hmmm....I have found in all my research that while those are guidelines in the end, it is all a bit of a crapshoot. There are no real definitive answers as we are all individuals with our own dna, etc. I just had my new nipples tattooed (which created areolas) and I gotta tell you this...I am loving my chest. Which is amazing when you think of it. My old breasts did their job and nursed two babies. I don't mourn the loss of them. I know my weaknesses and I would have been playing the recurrance nightmare even worse than I already do (for there is always that chance no matter what anyone says). If the BC somehow manages to come back in the breast skin area or somewhere else in my body- I will fight it. Today, I feel great and am enjoying my reconstructed breasts (this from a woman who had said no to any kind of plastic surgery in the past) I love em:) Good luck and follow your gut...it is still the best indicator for this kind of thing:).",

It sounds like you have been through hell and back on top of the BC. The circulation issue is huge and very important for us all to know. My PS will not do my exhange until six weeks out from my having quit smoking completely for that very reason. It has been a concern of his since day one. Which is why I could not have my nipples spared althought here was no indication of cancer-he said that is what will \"fail\" the most easily due to your smoking history. I think the dangers are either minimized or blown up- just like everything with this damn disease. Sometimes it seems the disease itself is conquered but the cure kicks us in the ass. If you choose to go \"smooth\" there are plenty of women who have done the same thing. There are photo forums with pictures and discussion. I think if you contact timtam she can let you know how to access it. BIG NEW YEARS HUG TO MY FELLOW TEXAN! (and everyone else everywhere!)",

That is why I am so grateful for a place like this to come and discuss and get feedback that truly does not exist anywhere else. I, too, am an early stager and while everyone gives me reassurances, I keep up my vigilance. It is normal to want everything right now,yesterday in fact. I opted for a double mastectomy and am just now in the final processes of reconstruction-it seems like forever yet in retrospect I am shoced that almost a year has passed. It flew by in a blur!. It is particlarly hard I think on us when we have lost someone to cancer (any kind)- it is our only point of reference and all the love and fear seems to get mixed up together. Yet i find myself drawing strength from my dad, feeling him *up there* rooting for his kid. Just like I am sure your mom is for you.

It is human nature after all we have been through. It came back all clear but then again, thanks to the ativan I slept through it....:) Jo- it sounds about right- my onc was not going to see me for another 6 months but we have changed that back to every three months since I told her I am not taking the AIs but alternatives instead. She will run full blood panels to make sure hormonal levels are low. She was not thrilled. I am supposed to see BS (I have to call-can't remember if I am supposed to her in June or July-I think June-well Duh). The only reason I had the PET/CT scan was because of the liver spots from the CT scan back when I ws first diagnosed-onc wanted to make sure they were b9 and no changes (original onc and BS said it was a waste of time). Following diagnosis I had a biopsy, a CT, an MRI and a bone scan. Then after the BMX i had a bone density (since they THOUGHT I was going to take an AI and wanted to see how bad the bones were). Fear is such a sneaky little b*stard...creeps up when we least expect it. I was for some reason reading all of the stats I could find last night from obscure medical journals all over the world....nice light reading at midnight. When I realized every single one of them after all of the medical gobblydegook and stunning statistics....essentially said...luck of the draw-we just don't know why in some cases...I was catonic with fear. All had \"suggested\" \"perhaps\" \"excluded\" etc...so it seemed that studies that started out with 10000 women landed up being based on ten (I exaggerate-but you get my point). The european doc don't agree with the US docs...enough to make one crazy and it did for awhile to me last night.",

I get my blood and estrogen levels checked every three months....but you know what, honestly, even with all the tests and stuff....on so many levels it is just a crap shoot no matter which way we go....but I had deliberated before trying the AI after researching it but finally said, ok...just try the damn stuff....the next two weeks (yes, two weeks after one pill) were enough to scare me off Hi Sheila:)))))) and everyone else:)",

Russ stood up and starting crooning ( a deep low sound from the pit of his soul only released when extremely happy) while Mom had sweet tears remembering some very good things. No matter what happens in my life, I am so grateful. (and need to stop beating myself up with guilt for not moving mom into my house....since of course bein the anal retentive power tripping chick I am thinks I would take better care of her than my sister...who indeed loves her just differently than I - but once again, Mom helped me out with that...I was sniveling about it yesterday and she shook her head, snugged me up to her and said -\"you have too much on you already...you just can't...I know you and me\" once again she blew me away with just a few words Joan- yes- betrayals of our innermost thoughts hurt so deeply....or when they are treated casually. That is part of the magic here....in a world that sometimes doesn't even come close to getting it, we can find *it* here. Hey- you are in New York- you should (along with anyone else that wants to) hook up with us in May! I am still trying to figure out if I am going in before my conference (May 1-3) or staying a couple days after. But Shelia, Granny and I are meeting up in Grand Central Station! All aboard:)",

Or to even know what is right. The vitamin D3 really has helped- pretty typical for most of us find out that we had really low levels leading up to dx....it was actually the one commonality throughout all of my docs that they agreed on-needing to pump that up. After an intense dose to boost it -now am on a maintenance dose supplemented by the best supply in the world- the SUN (15 minutes a day is all that is required). Nothing beats rest. And then some more rest. Followed by a little more rest. Can make you feel like a bit of a slug, but gives our bodies and minds a chance to heal. I hope everyone has a good Sunday:)",

And as others have said - your dgd is lucky you are in her life:) hell, we're lucky you're in our lives! Munni- sorry you're going thru this right now but once you get on the other side we' ll get you on some biotin to get that hair growing like you were a kid- it is an amazing little supplement:) one of the few damn vitamins/ pills to take that actually does something for us that we can see and feel- at about 5-10 bucks for a month supply! Hoo haw! Valjean - hugging ya right back. I'm nervous because my beloved elder sister (ahem) is (to quote her) picking up mommy to take her out for breakfast this morning ( insert barfing noise here) .... Ahhh I have to let it go and will simply smile and let her massage her ego with her good deed for the week. She's totally gone over the bend and has had a number of insane emails sent to me that I have chosen not to respond to- the last thing I wrote her was after being accused that I was \"playing savior and the bright little shiny star I seem to think I am\" is that no martyrs or saviors here- just doing the only thing to be done\" and that sent off a huge rant so over the top I felt a peace and let it go - I say hello in office but that is it - and in the midst of all this vitriol she is sending I get one that says - so does this mean you aren't standing up in my wedding? Ahem all is said to that was I thinke best not in light of the fact you basically called me the devil incarnate and heartless and we were off to the races again oh geez! Guiltbno matter how deeply placed causes extreme oddness... So I shake my head and let it go - that is what the theme must be for my life right now Let it go - wise words hard as hell to do but I'm getting better at it - Told hubby yesterday time to sh@ t or get off the proverbial pot - divorce could be final may4 while I'm hugging on shelia and granny in NYC - but I am bit tired of this passive bs of his hemming and hawing while I wait - this whole I love you this will help us clear the past etc etc I flat out told him dude if we divorce at this point in my life I ain't gonna be looking for ways to get back with you- I love you still and would work on it but this is ridiculous - we go on dates or what ever and have wonderful times and then nothing it is confusing - like high school were we met - so sign the paperwork or rip it up- I think this is the life he envisions - connecting with me deeply every so often then going back to no responsibility and living like he does - nah not my plan - so now that I have laid that down he has rabbited again - I feel oddly free - and wary - I have a sinking feeling he is going to not be the pure heart he thinks he is and go for my measly 401 k ahhhh that is truly why I want him to fill out papers since he will have to have the b-lls to be that weeny and perhaps that fact will help me finally be free - oh I could win in retaining all that I have worked so hard for ( which isn't much) but you know I just might not - may say here ya go dude take your half of my sweat and have a nice day - might be the best cash I ever spent - Having mom here is teaching me much more than I imagined - I told her last night - we are helping each other remember who we are........ Peace out buddies - sorry for the rant but man it felt good to let it flow:)",

I have been digging in the dirt again this morning until the thunder and rain rolled in again. Man, it just feels clean getting so dirty:) This waterfall garden project is bigger than I thought...... BC is a game changer. In our perceptions, fears, thoughts, etc. It is like Joan said...I never had felt better when I got hit with the news...but now...a year and a half later, well, actually in the best shape of my adult life (albeit with new boobs-but even those I don't mind and actually forget about some times). It is nerve wracking coming up on the next *visit* to check in have the blood work run etc...it is best when my mind gets to the place that realizes we never really do know what is around the corner. I did not see BC coming and I do my best not to look for it now. My regimen of supplements make me feel like I am doing something proactive as opposed to total denial that my body made it once and could cook it up again. I read this this morning and it really gave me another way to look at things today...or at least for the next ten minutes:) \"Things can't be exactly the way you wish they could be, but why should this represent a source of pain or frustration? Can't you wish for something else instead? Can't you start hoping for the very thing that you have actually got already - or that you might soon be reasonably expected to get? Let go of all you regret. Forget the memories that haunt you and the hopes that, for the time being, you probably can't fulfil. Then, what currently seems like a gap in your life will start to well up with a large amount of love.\"",

      "Content": "Feb 17, 2011 10:22PM annettek wrote: here goes folks...This is my personal experience with Arimidex. I bit the bullet and decided to try it. I was fearful that in myown way I was outsmarting myself by not taking what every medical professional told me I needed. One pill, that's all I took. I decided to try it at night, before I went to sleep. I was calm and actually thinking it would be a good thing. I  took a bath and went to bed. I fell asleep shortly after. Then I woke up. And went back to sleep. This repeated itself through the night interspersed with bouts of explosive diarreah. I woke up (for tenth time) and got ready for work feeling like I was on the worst kind of speed. I skipped my vitamins as I did not want any extra enhancements adding to the mix. One pill, the night before. I got to work and was hyper and of course tired, from the lack of sleep. But felt like, ok, if this is the worst, I will just take the pill very very early in the morning and then I will be able to sleep. Maybe the diarreah was stress or something. That was fine until about 1pm in the afternoon, I was standing outside talking to a friend and my left arm went numb. Like I had just woken up after sleeping on it. I shook it and commented how odd it felt. Then she looked at me and said how glassy my eyes were and I said not much sleep last night. I sat down and then my left leg was tingling. I said this is ridiculous, it must be from me being scared or something, one pill could not do this that quick. So I got up and laughed it off and went back upstairs to the office. By the time i got back my eyes were watering and I felt my head was pounding,my eyes were burning and red.I shook it off, again, saying this is CRAZY, I must be getting sick. My brain was completely spinning. My sister came over and asked me what was wrong as my eyes were so red and glassy and I was holding my arm funny. I said I did not know. I hadnever felt this bad in my life...inclduing when I go the BMX...at least when I woke up from that I anticipated something would hurt. But this was weird. Like nothing before. I called my husband and said I didn't know if I could drive home so to hang in case I needed to call him. I made it home crying the whole way. By the time I got home I was convinced it was not the pill but that I had undergone a small stroke. My neck was was sore and the left side was weirding out. My husband got home and sat withme and got me to take a hot bath. Once I sat back in the tub I got really really MAD! I said I must be nuts honey...because one pill could not do this to a person. He corrected me and said I knew better than that. He reminded me of the two times in his life when he had violent side effects following the first or second dose of two different drugs. He reminded me of the drugs back in high school that people (him and his friends,not goody two shoes me:) took and how one little pill did an awful lot. I started crying harder. I sadi what if it doesn't get better? My arm and leg are numb and I have shooting spur type feelings in my foot. My neck hurts and I my stomach is rumbling loud enough for him to hear it. I turned on the jets in the tub to massage my hold body ...and kept crying. I was too scared to take a tylonel or an ativan because I did not know if it would make &it& worse...he told me to get mad so I would not be scared...(he knows me well) so i did. I went on to say not only would I not ever take a FRIGGIN AI of any kind again but I damn well would quit smoking without adding more drugs to the mix. Somehow I had slowly started to buy intoit all...the big name hospitals and the big name docs telling me I NEEDED THIS STUFF. Now don't get me wrong...i am not a fool and if I had a more agressive cancer I damn well would do what was neccessary. BUT...this is why I had a BMX, this is why I started a regimen to suppress the estrogen naturally based on clinical trials...this is why I changed my diet, this is why I decided to stop smoking...to battle the BC so I could live a good life. So I got good and mad. Mad atmyself for not trusting my gut which has led me right since all of this began. I was mad that there untold women suffering horrific side effects so they can make some magical 5year mark while their life is compromised in so many other ways along the path to get there. NO. My sister called as she was worried about me and said she had never been so scared in her life when she saw me that afternoon. And let me tell you my sister is no alarmist and in fact would be the first one to tell me it was inmy head. She said you know, maybe that is why so manypeople can't believe you have gone through all of this...as you are healing so well and have generally been getting stronger and healthier...maybe if you had taken the AIs right after surgery like they wanted you to you might have been sicker like everyone seemed to expect you to be. And maybe you would not haveknown the difference thinking it was all part of the process of breast cancer. That you were supposed to feel like &hit. And I thought about that and I have to agree. Don'tget me wrong, I have had some rough days since the BMX but not anything like what happened to me yesterday. But if I hadnot had eight weeks of healing before trying this poison how would I know how to feel? I had never had breast cancer andsurgery before...all of the symptoms would have gotten swept up in the general Bc aftermath....Let me say this,  Ivcould never have dreamed it would hit me that hardvthat fast. I stayed home from work today and rested. As the day has gone on most feeling returned with just my upper arm and elbow and knee and heel tingling/feeling weird still. My stomach is racked. A little gross aside...I went to the restroom and after wiping...there was blood. Now I know where I wiped and have neverhad blood from my rear before in 54 years. I start screaming a bit ago for my husband and we looked it up...yep, one of the rare side effects...I missed that one in my reading..I am hoping that I had a hemi I did not know abotu suddenly decide to bleed (dont they do that? soemtimes) from all the diarreah....If it continues until tomorrow I will go to doc. But i am sick of docs rightnow. Pissed at docs right now. So here it is almost 24 hours following one dose  of arimidex. My story, my experience. No wonder so many write of their pains, I will never glossover those plaintive writings again when reading them. I truly believe none of them are exagerrating and they must feel like theya re going nuts to have that stuff start popping off in their bodies. My case might be unique and the effects extreme. I can only liken it to a poison that my body is trying to get rid of. The bitch is the drug can linger in your system for 50-60 hours. I will stick with that and not pay attention to someone who called astrazeneca and was told each dose can actually remain active within for 10-11 days. Nope. In this case I will use mind over matter to get over this mini catastrophe. And be grateful that now I do not have to play the what if game. I don't care what brand or formulation, I will not put it in my body again. It scared me and I hope I don't have lingering anything from it. God bless all of you who can handle it. I cannot. ",

I forgot that the last conversation with him after all the pathology reports were in...it was basically \"...take an AI for insurance- you have no cancer-live your life....\" Now we all know there is always a chance that there may be nasty little things floating around, but...that ws obviously true before BC. If you trust and like your GP I say you are on the right track. Even my new onc (since I wasn't comfortable having a frigging email relationship with an onc) said virtually the same thing...I thought of all of this the other day while I was nuts and stopped the process of getting another top onc that was recommended by first onc...reason being is they are all going to push me to take an AI -I am starting to realize that this is just standard medical practice for where we are now in BC knowledge. So instead of jumping through new hoops with a new doc to have the same result...I am sticking with this one and will see her every few months-I will stick with my own version of AIs and she will continue to monitor my hormone levels (last full panel and everything was stunningly low with the SEs to back it up-just not horrific ones) to pacify me for stayingon the AI (which I am not but that is ok, I want the full panel hormone tests and markers she runs ...she also wants to do a PT scan in two months to measure some \"spots too small to classify\" on my liver from before the BMX and the top onc thinks it is a big waste of time, as does the BS. But I will do the PT scan  just to clear my head since I had put it to rest when both the first onc and BS said it was all benign and to forget it, then she brought it back up when she went through all of my records, so, being who I am, the one who will bite into something and shake it around, drop it, pick it up and shake it again...well, now that it is back in my mind...I will get the damn PR. GEEZ I exhaust myself. I hope you and yours are safe from all the turmoil and stay that way...and certainly glad you have no permenant heart damage.

I get offered a lot of jobs and have just stayed where I am out of loyalty and great pay (there is the rub). But the mental has always taken a toll on me. I have to watch for incoming volleys of fire always. Too hard to explain it all, just a whacko environment. Anyway, I woke up mad. And hubby noticed that one day back did it to me.

Gross.         I saw it so clear yesterday. He took some of us out to dinner following meeting and was sweet as pie...two reasons- 1) my main nemesis was not there and the one he most plays to (they have weird relationship and the guy is my former superior before I was promoted - thus his hatred of me) 2) Boss felt bad that he chewed me out and said \"you did good- no tears\"...I MEAN THIS IS SICK- argh...anyway, gonna get dressed and go in- thanks for letting me vent",

Fear over what happened to loved ones in the past rears its ugly head at times. I finally told my hubby yesterday about one thing that has been hard to get past...I started off yesterday in a bad place for whatever reason-I told him that everyone I had loved who had cancer (my Dad and brother-along with other relatives-but those two of course, had the biggest impact) had died. That was apparently imprinted on my psyche- my brother (rare at that time cancer of the thymus gland) on his 13th birthday (which just happened to make it so much more poignant- I was 7) and then my Dad at 76 (colon cancer) when I was 34 . Gratefully, hubby did not really say anything other than listen very closely as it all came pouring out of me...it is so odd...I became so angry at him several years ago when he told me being so young when losing my brother and my sister (she died from a pulmonary embolism at 22 when I was 12) had hurt/impacted far more than I thought- it really ANGERED beyond all reason. I was furious at him. How dare he say something like to ME. Ahhh, as you might imagine, it turns out he was right. It hit me gradually over the years after he DARED (it was a brave thing for him to do as I do not take any hint that I am less than iron woman well) say that to me that perhaps there was more truth to it than I knew. It helped me look at my reactions, thoughts and feelings to things in my life and I could so see the connections. I learned loss so friggin early with my big bro, then, as if to have it reinforced, losing my big sister a few years later. Mom and Dad did so much to help ease the pain but there is only so much that any other person can do when horrid things like that happen. Ack. I am crying now as I write this but they are tears filled with so much more than sadness. I miss them all so much but they are truly alive in me and somehow, I feel the hope, love and strength they send to me. I may be 54 but I am still the little kid inside.They weren't saints but they were so large in my life....loving me completely (what a wonderful thing to feel)- the pesky spoiled with love little sister that I was, showing me what to do/taking care of me as we all hope our own kids will do for each other and mystically, they do so today.  Easter- loss and renewal.   no matter your faith, I hope all of you find a taste of hope and healing today...big hugs ",

Everyone's reconstruction resembles each others, but is so different, just like stinking BC. If the pain near your collarbone starts to freak you out (that place where warning bells won't stop ringing in your head)-call your oncologist then. It may seem alarmist but frankly, after what all have been through, this is one time in our lives that we get a pass to *freak out*. When I thought about it, over the past few months I have called my oncologist and even the BS when I had questions. Wanting them to say it was nothing, scared they would be alarmed. In this point of recovery, my brain is as important as the rest of my body. Back to the nipple surgery (what a strange universe we now inhabit-nipple surgery indeed!)-my PS was going to do them at the end of this month but then told me he would be out of town in June- I chose to wait until July- for if there are any problems, I do not want followup with another PS. It would have only been 3 months. I also asked him yesterday why I can't have areolas for heaven's sake. (again, a very weird thing to talk about). He prefers not to do the extra surgery as it involves grafting-he makes the nips and then the tattoo artist give me color and aerolas. Hmph. I could insist and he would. But then I thought of the extra cuts involved and healing- and have decided (at this moment) to pass and go with the tattoos. He may do a bit of fat grafting for one ripple that I have, but we'll see. Frankly- I want it all over. I see the onc and bs in June for major checkpoints (onc to test my blood and see if my alternative course of AIs is doing the job (if no- I reconsider my choices)_ and my BS for whatever it is they do when they examine you at this point (I have no idea since I have not seen her since shortly after BMX). Then the nip surgery and tatooing in July.  It seems forever that I have been consumed with this battle, when in actuality it has been such a short blip on the radar of life-i am almost 6 months out to the day from my BMX in November 2010, which was three weeks after diagnosis in October. Although I have been very angry at times for what I have perceived as delays or rushing things, in retrospect, I have been blessed with the relative ease of all the docs and tests required and requested coming through. I have actually had some choices (i.e. delaying nip surgery for my own piece of mind for recovery) and some, not so much. I want it over too. I posted a long missive on another thread for  where my head is in regards to wanting my surviving to become my thriving. In far fewer words, it came down to something like this \"dusting off my now flabby ass, getting in the saddle again and riding....\"",

I know it certainly does something to my hormone levels as I have most definitely noticed a surge of them since stopping a couple of weeks ago. I am due for my next blood test at onc to measure that way as well. The SEs (while milder, still exist on the alternatives- reminds me of menopause-creaky bones, some hot flashes, etc) and the blood panel keep me comfortable with my choice. And that is all it is, is a personal choice. I may regret it, but I am banking that it was right for me...since they (med professionals) do not seem to ever really know why some stage 1 early BC strains come back.

      "Content": "Jun 8, 2011 07:00AM - edited Jun 8, 2011 07:02AM by annettek hi val:) Roh- you know what really chaps me? The origin of the research is usually motivated by good. I truly believe this. But then after so much is spent to develop a drug and test it- it can approach a billion from the time it is first researched until it makes through FDA approval and launch-the bean counters come in and say how can we maximize our profits on this. Off label use is one way of doing this and another is pushing the FDA to approve it for everyone. (Back to my pet analogy-pets now are prescribed Prozac, along with toddlers). It is not that the drug in question is necessarily bad, but drugs are approved and precscribed long before anyone really knows their impact. Clinical trials help, but are so limited in scope and size, time is the only true test.  Once it is let loose on tens of thousands of people of all different kinds, rather than the target group for which it was developed, it becomes challenging to monitor and report the true side effects and long term impact of a drug. It would be relatively easy to track a specfic group and catch any untoward side effects, whole different story when everybody is taking it- the details get lost in the profits. It is like what is going on with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) now and in the past years. It is somewhat easier to connect the dots because the group that takes it is women, and further more, women of a certain age. They can even break it down to economic profiles, race etc because of the nature of the drug and the prescribing patterns. They start seeing commonalities in problems and once everything else is taken into consideration, it becomes obvious or more obvious what may be the cause. These problems with HRT didn't begin to rear their ugly heads for decades after women were taking them. First they thought it was heart attacks, then they went to something else, then they said nothing, now they are linking breast cancer- at least the ER+ strain. The fact is they knew something was wrong, they weren't sure what, so they kept prescribing it albeit with \"caution\". Were the docs bad docs who prescribed it? I don't think so. It is hard to buck the system so to speak and it is often a case of \"well, if they were sure it was bad, surely the FDA would pull it\".  It so obviously helped so many women with what they were initially being treated for (i.e menopause-decline of estrogen-) and for many, none had side effects that we know of, or their genetic makeup was such that it did not spur the other problems. ACH- sorry, i tend to go and on. Anyway, I go back to what is considered gospel within the drug industry among the actual scientists- if it is not a drug that could perhaps offer a terminal patient true  hope or is a \"life-saving\" drug- better off not taking it for at least five years after it hits the market, best to wait 10 years. As ten years offers the body a chance to react, mutate, etc from the drug. It was and is difficult to monitor this even with a specific target group- never mind everybody and their brother.",

I said it and I mean it. I had a great day that started off magnificent got horrible very quick and then ended up wonderful. The magnificent part was waking up full of excitement over getting my nipple tattoos....totally reved and ready- first I had to stop and get all my blood work done- figured smart to combine both doc's orders (onc and regular doc) and do it - fine..tech commented on how much blood she was taking and after chatting and discussing BC she put a bandaid on me and said \" Yeah, well my husband's aunt had early BC and she died two years later.\" WHAT IN THE HELL? I could not believe it. I was so freaked I left. Then I marched right back in and gave her a clue. In as nice a way as possible. I explained she needed to perhaps not mention such things to people who were in getting their blood checked for evidence of disease. bla blah blah...I was so ticked I was shaking (and don't ya know those words chilled me in that part of us we all have now) when I got to my breast surgeon's office my cell rang and it was her- she looked my number up on the chart.She apologized and said she was just trying to relate...AACK  I knew she truly was clueless and meant no harm and told her she might want to reconsider discussing death with ANY patient. and then I said I accepted her apology bye and hung up. Anyhooo....the tats are INCREDIBLE and I am happy...it hurt like the disckens which made me even happier as so much feeling has returned in both of the boobs they had to load me full of lidocaine. I am so lucky to have such a great crew....the breast surgeon- the tattoo artist and the plastic surgeon were all in on this today (Plastic surgeon via Iphone)- it is amazing they all care so much to make the results so nice....i will be achy and gross looking for a bit but I freaked when I looked in the mirror...in a good way....I was firm in my decision before I ever had the diagnosis that a bilateral mastectomy (although I didn't know that it was called that- I called it a full radical mastectomy like from the 1950's and continued to do so long after my surgery until my PS gently corrected me- although, it sure LOOKED like one in my eyes) would be what I would get if I ever was told I had breast cancer. So that was what I chose, even during the one day between biopsy and the lovely visit to the Breast Surgeon's office...but no matter what they told me what could be, in my heart I never really believed I would ever have something resembling real breasts....and now I do. Amazing. Are they perfect? Nah, but what or who ever is? Whatever your choices are, that is what I want for everyone, to be happy and satisified with their choice. I love you all....and welcome to all the new folks...sorry you had to find us but glad you did. It was a year today that I was diagnosed and next month will be a year since my surgery- that is the d-day for me. So much has changed in a year...some good some bad but the theme is being alive...and not only surviving but attempting to thrive. A good goal for all. BIG HUGS:)",

Mine was an eensy 5 mm found thanks to a mammo and followups...I am beyond grateful and constantly humbled by those who were found to have so much more invasive/advanced BC. I actually have started crying over feeling guilt after crying over being scared and exhausted and in pain as a result of getting  BC ...now there's an illustration of frustration. I am so grateful for this stage 1 board, I don't feel like an absolute sh*t for complaining when others are facing greater terrors. Our more advanced sisters teach me something everyday on other threads-I am simply amazed at their compassion and strength for all of us...yet, in my opinion, it would be so wrong of me on so many different levels to prance into one of the heavier threads and whine about my arimdex fiasco...way beyond the apples to oranges comparison. I realize a stage 1 could can advance and recur, but our reality today is where we are today. Oh, geez, it looks like I am going to be given to a lot of lengthy emotionally posts with little seeming point as I prep for tomorrow's exchange...and don't you know that some of the biggest supporters of my often precarious mental health are in Stage IV...I did not even know that about one in particular until some time had gone by...blew me away...anyhow... Charmaine- all I have learned with this BC crap is that nothing is written in stone. It seems to be all educated guesses as to what will be with any of us in regards to our reactions, journey and outcomes...for some, everyting works the way it was developed, for others, not so much, your mom's experience does not predicate what will be for you...simply because we are all different. That one armidex pill literally screwed me up beyond what I ever thought one pill could and others take it with no more than a case of mild heartburn and some minor aches...luck of the draw. I think we have to learn as much as we can and ultimately hope we make the right choices...listen to our bodies and hope they do not betray those choices...as for the ovarian cancer from tamox...hell, in my mind it is as true that it does cause it as it does not cause it. That is the quandry with it all. My goal became to get to a place where I was open enough to consider what I could do to live without being completely floored by fear. I have to constantly perform my own little *scans* of body systems. Funny thing of note, I had to stop all of my supplementation leading up to my exchange tomorrow...guess what...I can feel the fricking estrogen surging through my system like a horse out of the gate-poor old body is saying sister what are you doing-you lose it naturally by aging and then try to totally eradicate every last speck of it inside your body and then open the doors for it to bounce back...Of course, I will be back on everything following the surgery-had to stop for the blood thinning factors the supplements might add...so, while I am a bit freaked over knowing I have lots of estrogen enfusing me for a few days-I am oddly becalmed by another indicator beyond a full hormonal panel that my regimen is working. I am playing the odds again, that a week of this won't feed anything bad and of course it is making me nuts knowing how bad I miss the actual balance my body is feeling right now...it is pre- premenopasual levels...which I do attribute to what happens when you hold something down really tight and the let it go..it will spring back a little further at first before settling back in somewhere...ok...I will hit submit before this turns into a complete novel...",

How funny, in 7 years and 7 trips I have yet to see Broadway show...too busy finding *stuff* -which could be everything from a cool looking brownstone or having a cup of coffee in SoHo and seeing some actor from Law and Order who is peeved because he can see me squinting at him and realizing he is indeed \"somebody\" but not somebody well known enough for me to know who he is. How much fun that is! People reading:) Sherry- I am with you on that. Not sure why but I am. If it feels too weird then do not go....you can celebrate your surviving any darn way you please. I get a little hinked out about some things and am learning to listen to those feelings.",

I don't know if your tamox...or maybe something from the sentinel nodes...I would call your BS and ask them. I have heard of people getting problems a couple of years out following any lymph node removal. I know both sides where I had the SNB were the last areas to heal and the most painful part of the BMX.

I realize how rare that is more and more as time goes by. I try to acknowledge that and not forget. THat is why I always try to savor something everywhere I go...I am so far froma jaded traveller it is not funny. I will admit that when I walk out of an airport no matter where I am I whisper in my head \"Oh the places you will go\" from that dr suess book. Truly. Then I think of my Dad who was so scared I would miss out (hell, the day before the wedding he offered me all the money he was forking over and then some to just GO) and who I promised that he did not have to worry...He didn't live to see this latest run of the past 13+ years but he is right by my side on every adventure:) I see you are in Owosso...I am from Michigan...I think Mom and Dad did not live to far from you after they retired they had moved to Lakeview and opened up their antique shop. I loved driving up there from farmington to visit. I like rural and the whole pace of life. Big hugs to you...might be back in Mich later this summer to see hubby's sister in Traverse. Not sure..HE HATES TO TRAVEL if he cannot drive:)! Yet, if it wasn't for him staying with our son while I go, I could never do it. And he has never made me feel bad - he encourages me. Funny how life is! On my own I could never afford to travel where I have gone or how I have gone. And even i had the funds he would not want to go!  We made one big trip to Banff a few years back that was magnificent but more typically we go to Austin or the hill country every so often and just nose around. I got him to drive to Arkansas a couple of years ago and it was magic too. We always drive off fighting and then as the miles add up we remember we actually like going on trips together. The theme is...I just like 'sploring:) waldorf or sitting by a river. all good  by me. my goodness i have a lot to say today! (everyday) good night:)",

If anything becomes really painful- to call him. I am almost nine weeks out and these started a couple of weeks ago. It is the healing- when you think about it, there was a whole lot of work done inside that we cannot see. The outside visible scars heal a whole lot quicker than inside. Good luck and you may want to hop over to the picture forum as there are a lot of in depth discussions on reconstruction and pictures as well. Hey- while i cannot advise anyone on chemo decisions, I did get my hands on the physican's copy of the NCCN guidelines that were updated on Feb 2011...twice as long as patients' version and much more detailed with a lot more side commentary and explanations. You can PM me if you want me to email you a copy. I have to admit, after reading it, it made me truly understand how vague everything is....whichleads me back to crapshoot territory",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2012 07:42AM - edited Jan 24, 2012 07:42AM by annettek Hello to everyone new- so sorry you had to find us:( Ah, I've been away in my mind as now facing the fact of divorce - I know in my gut it is right and the best just hard after focusing on him for over three decades. I'm in psychic pain right now - and keep hurting myself by paying with the what ifs - hard to swallow that I chose to see the good and the bad as good for so long. Bc was the first thing in our lives that was major dilemma about me and I had nothing to give - the whole point in being with someone so long is ya count on the whole sickness health thing- when I couldn't kiss his ass anymore or paint a rosy picture - he booked - on my dime - he doesn't see it that way - 8 months gone - now he has found another - stating she is NICE- and I am not - and that he wants to see where relationship goes but who knows him and i might have a better one down the road WTF - he said that he gave me chances while he was gone and I was always an emotional wreck - she's a fellow AA member- which is how most land up after divorce - with another AA. He is still delusional that he is supporting himself as he is living on the cash he insisted on after selling other house he demanded half or he would not sign the paper - trusting fool I am - but I had to do it as two mortgages for two years was breaking my back - he has sped through two thirds of it in two months - I have to move forward before it runs out and his reality sets in - that Annette took care of those pesky details - I haven't had the heart to cut off insurance - auto and health yet- so damn used to taking care taking care - as I slowly have gotten my bearings emotionally - still pretty fragile- and asked more accountability he said I was rushing him- roflmao (and crying my eyes out) I told him I would have divorce papers here last night and he cancelled now it is to be tonight - well see - I'm not sure he understands that it is real and not part of some fantasy that I will get over- I have threatened many times too many times and on Sunday demanded a resolution that this was frigging ridiculous indulgence - to sh;t or get off the pot . I asked him point blank that if he was done lets get divorce if there was no interest in counseling etc that we should end it - which I've said a million times - he said ok - as he has before - then proceeded to tell me how bad he was hurting and did I think I was the only one who was sad? Something had made me recoil when he hugged me a week ago and I didn't know why - so I asked if he had started dating - to which he said yes -see above- I must have felt it on a primal level when we hugged - and that is what made me stop from where that even during all the bullshit has led in the past while he has been gone - first time I said no - no thanks - a small step of reclaiming some sense of self - I feel like a frigging idiot - not over his leaving and being who he is - it is that he has always been weak and I chose to see him as I thought he could be - he resents my career - and says bc has nothing to do with his leaving to which I said on Sunday the truth is it does - not how I look - probably look better than I have in 20 years- it is that it turned focus off you and I just couldn't keep up being cheerleader to a losing team - that besides bc there was the small matter of paying for everything and everybody - and our two sons - hard to be real nice - he said you weren't nice before bc - always cranky - I said well yea a bit tired - I can still see him waving to me with his morning coffee from the hot tub when I left for work..... Ack sorry for going on - but I'm sick of keeping so much inside or telling it to him who doesn't see reality - ill be ok better than ok for he is right in many ways - when says we don't work as-couple-his goals are surfing skateboarding and now climbing the cliffs inwyoming and working out with kick boxers- while polishing his jet boat - mine- dumbass that I am has been to work and take care of it all - not much time for me and the hobbies he says I need flicking exhausted at end of day - I still would have gone on with this freaky situation as I know myself but the tipping point was the dating - it was what I needed to finally pull my head out of the sand completely - god bless them with their free self employed schedules to do whatever - I gotta move on - what a surprise to find even I have limits - wish me luck my friends- its gonna be a little rocky but I want this done in the 61 days it takes in Texas - if he he won't sign papers tonight I go to attorney - and as hard- yes still hard not to take care of him if you can believe it but 35 years it gets to be habit) I will cancell all the insurance on him- ill be called mean and bitter but that's how I have been treating myself - I'm scared but I think I can do this - I have to - there's a lot more Life to live Again sorry but ad to get this out It hurt too bad to keep in",

As for the Onco test- jury is still out on exactly what the eventual effectiveness the test will have and what demographic it will best serve. It is like a lot of diagnostics in that its initial aim and what its approved for often vary greatly from what it lands up doing best. The more data the better when it comes it to personalized medicine, which is where everything is pointing to as the future of true medicine. And that is what the company is doing now that it has been approved by more insurance companies and governments...is gathering data that would have been impossible to obtain. And make a profit - a hefty one, while doing so. I haveno qualms over a company making money for witout free enterprise we would have no new treatments... but these guys are making an enormous amount of money, ostenibly to conduct further research, mostly using materials received from their patients and bioanalysis (computers). In the spirit of that, I would advise anyone who is on the fence regarding chemo either by their numbers being in the gray area or their onc's strong advice...go with what YOU think is right and do NOT depend on this test as the endall on a major decision. It is simply too new and too statistical, and we all know about statistics. That's just my opinion. Elimar! Not only is the goat flying but attempting to soar! Granny- yeah...i do, its a bit worse then we thought..went yesterday and now i need a another damn CT scan as it appears there are two in there and doc wants to know what he is facing when he goes in there. It has been interfering a lot with me when I eat too much- it literally pops out...or did for the first time last week...anyway, that is next up on the plate ARGH Hello Joan:)) I miss you all and plan on popping in more:)",

It is evil. Now i see him on Friday to discuss surgery...so many women can't get adequate testing and then those with great insurance canbe abused. I have had to let fear of what may have been cooked with all that stuff and the sad thing is I could not even enjoy getting a two year \"you are doing great NED\" since I was freaking over all this other crap.

It is all the rest of the bs that flies around and it ticks me that people who really need MORE help cannot get it. It is wrong. Too many people playing God. I would never post as an authority on anything except my own self. All we can do is share what we know, study a lot and make our own conclusions. Because nobody is always exactly right. BC, like most cancers, is too varied and particular to each individual. What is right for one is wrong for another with the exact same diagnosis, stage, grade, etc. Because we each have different dna, blah blah. The so-called onc had suggested the following scenario...try every approved AI (including those often prescribed that are not recommended) until I could stand side effects and she would then prescribe Bonita (or whatever it is for your bones) and toss in some ativan and an anitdepressant to offset the chaos...and ehatever else I may land up needing as a result of side effects. Really? So I stick with my routine and only kept the ativan -I only take .25 mg once on really amped days....to which she said that is not even atherapeutic dose...I explained any more than that makes me sleepy and she told me my body would adjust and get used to it hahahaha... oh well...again, I stress, this is what MY plan is nobody elses. Not fond of telling people what the MUST or SHOULD do. It is irrational and dangerous. Everyone have a great day:)",

On the other hand, my innate denial of pain or discord from anything, including BC, is not healthy either. I would let slip out some feelinge but for the most part slapped a happy bs patina on it all and plunged on some like gothic warrior-invincible. Doing that is hell, for inside one roils with the frustrations and fears and have boxed themselves in by thinking they can truly do it all, that it is a failure or weakness to allow the fears and sadness to come out. It becomes incredible lonely being a psuedo super hero. Who has no special powers. All the intelligence in the world does not offer any answers when you think you can do it all on your own and then resent the loneliness and the fear. That is bad place to be. For the bad stuff can slip out in ugly ways. And damage your soul. So after swinging way over to the other side....a crying openly bleeding ball of naked emotions....I am slowly trying to find that elusive middle ground. It is a better place to be. Clearing my puffy eyes and popping my head up I look around and find myself surrounded- both here and in the flesh- by people who were always there and I just couldn't see them...they knew my *super* powers were a sham for the most part (although I have a few:)- it has blown me away to feel this love and support....I wouldn't allow it following BC and I wouldn't allow it during any major catastrophe throughout my life....screw that! hahaha....I can't blame anybody for this self-imposed isolation of my inner self- it is just me- but I am working on changing it... Two strange events....on two subsequent nights ....went out for dinner with husband - still processing that-the only thing i kept saying to myself in side over and over is be true to me and when emotions threatened to overwhelm I excused myself patted my eyes and went back to the table. I am always so quick to say all is well I am ok ignore the gaping wound its all good...or shriek out my fears and pains- so I chose the middle. Sick of being extreme. What is amazing is how hard it was not go right or left but just be. To actually not unzip my soul and say Here take it. Funny how a socalled strong woman can do that so often - puts a lie to the whole super hero thing:) I did not whip out any bandaids- even my really big covers all variety. It was amazing. I could recognize his own amazement at my sitting there. It is so not me to do that. Always one of two extremes for me. I am finding the most extreme thing is just pause sometimes. Then last night I went out with my friends. This is huge for me. Which is also an anomaly. I travel all over the place for business and speak-animated and full of life. I did a radio interview a couple of weeks ago sounded so damn smart and analytical- yet when invited to lunch with the cohosts I mumbled an excuse that I had to other plans. That is me. This over the top happy nut in public who doesn't let anyone in my private life. Anyway, a friend from work was playing with his band and bunch of folks were going out there to see him. He has been the most incredible friend to me despite my best efforts:) I made plans, secured yet another sitter for the kiddo ( amazing that I am now able to do that-always could I guess just didn't) came home from workand promptly passed out. I woke up and saw the time and saidnah no way- 40 miles to drive to Clear Lake and it was already almost 9pm. I put on my pajamas and when i was washing my face I said Annette, stop it. Get your butt going. So I did. I walked in and it felt so damn good and it was so damn funny as the affection and surprise flowed out that I was there. We have all worked together for 15 years...all in various positions with the company... As I have moved up through the company they all have supported me with their hearts and last night was nothing to do with being coworkers....they are indeed my friends. I just didn't realize it. It was the same core group that showed up the day after my BMX. I tried to throw them out of the hospital. Seriously. I am lying there in a daze bandaged up with tubes and no idea what is going on and sat up and told them to leave. I yelled at my husband for letting them know where the hospital was and about my surgery. I told everyone to leave. They told me to shut up and go to sleep. That they were not leaving. I was so pissed ....and so damn scared. How dare they be there and see me so vulnerable. A veritable rainbow coalition in that hospital room. In one corner a tough black chick from Baltimore, in the other a born and bred Texas baptist white boy (one with the band), another sister of color who I bonded with the minute I was hired for our shared home town of Detroit, and my scared blonde german husband who wouldn't listen to my request I didn't want ANYBODY there. Damn them for being there. Bless them for being there. Anyway (geez, can I write a long post or what? hahahaha....) I am glad I went last night. Just a couple of hours and I put the beer down after just a few sips (I knew that could end badly as I can get drunk off of one:) and just relaxed with my friends. Patting me on the head like was their damn chia pet hahahaha....My buddy up on stage was so surprised to see me and it felt good to give back a smidgen of the support I realize he has given to this strange armenian hungarian crazy woman that I am. I was dressed more appropriately for a hot NYC club than a dive bar in Clear Lake but the who the hell cares? (Oh yeah, the side effect/silver lining of all these gyrations of mine has resulted in me shedding the last few pounds putting me at 118-I haven't weighed that since high school for god's sake- I actually LIKED how I looked-which is a whole nother subject:)  Aw, you all are great. and if anyone recognizes anything of themselves in what I just wrote and finds something that helps or even just makes them chuckle...or scratch their heads and ask WHAT IN THE H*LL IS THIS BROAD TALKING ABOUT?= that is ok. I love you all- have a good saturday- my mom is coming over to spend the day and I can't wait to see her:)",

It was funny, she asked if 30 minutes would be too long hahahah I told her you will have to give me the hook once i start blabbing. I CANT WAIT TO MEET YOU...gonna be hard to leave once I do. There is a great turkish cafe on brazil street (or 47th?) right off times square where we can get some good food. I was walking by there several years ago and the guy out in front was waving people in...I shook my head no and he asked why not..I said, well, I am armenian..he said please come in...then manager came over and they treated me like a queen...it was amazing....taught me what my dad had already taught me...THAT was THEN and this is NOW. I was spouting one day to him about all those *bad* turks and Dad went real quiet and asked what they did to ME. I said well look at what THEY did to grandma and grandpa and you. He said, I repeat, what did they do to you. All of those people who did those bad things are dead now. It is in the past. Do not ever let me hear you speak of any people with a blanket dislike based on what you think you know. Do you want to be held responsible for everything every ancestor did wrong? this came from a man who saw his parents murdered before he was sneaked away with his sister to an orphanage until his brother could retrieve them. Lots of bad stuff. Yet that was his attitude. So, yes, I enjoyed my dinner at that little cafe and would like to go back there:) criminy...sorry for the long saga but you know me when i get going:) Mimi- i am so sorry you are going through all of this crap.

I love her so much. She is a fighter. brother and sister have stepped up to plate and drama has been shelved for now to get mom through this. My company was very cool in arranging for me to come home early and took the friggin 750 hit in airfare for me. I am grateful. In the midst of all of this divorce was finalized Friday. I texted and asked -\"hey are we getting divorced today?\" He said, we have to honey our only chance to get rid of all old BS and see if the real love we have is strong enough to bring us back together in the right way...\"  Who the hell can process that? Oddly, he has been magnificent in taking care of our son and making sure I am getting rest. In fact, he has been doing everything I wish he had been doing before. He asked for nothing. And has literally had the kiddo most of the time the past couple of weeks in order to try to make it possible for mom to live with me. Then moved in to watch over them so I could go to new york. I cannot begin to imagine his horror when she tripped and hurt herself. It was horrific. (doc said bone could have just snapped due to age and osteoporisis) He did not want to call me but of course had to...ambulance and three fire trucks showed up...he had to make arrangements for someone to wacth our son( who freaked out over his grandman being hurt and all the commotion) and then go meet ambulance at hospital...then called brother and sister to meet him there..oh my...then keeping me on phone every five minutes to talk me through it and steady my nerves since I was ready to jump out the hotel window.Sheer terror and panic but he got me calmed down enough to keep doing next right thing...literally 30 phone calls until I got on the plane next afternoon. It helped more than I can explain. Ironically, nobody else except mom could have done that for me. Before I left tuesday morning, monday was our 36th anniversary..... I was expecting nothing but horrible sadness. He then came over that evening  with our son saying \"too hectic to try this in morning before your flight-this way you can just leave without waiting on someone to get here\" Mom was so happy to see him as she loves him dearly and visa versa. After everyone went to sleep we sat in the backyard and just had an incredible time. Very surreal as I said. ...and it was exactly what I needed in some odd way. I cant even begin to explain how it all makes some weird sense. So, next up is getting mom through surgery. We are in relay teams at hospital since she cannot be alone at all. Drugs cause delirium and she is scared out of her mind. I dont know what the future holds. But, really, none of us every really do. A mom who is a fighter to the core, an ex who is acting like the man I always believed him to be and a sister and brother being the best of who they were raised to be. I think the key is mom here. once again she is herding her wayward sheep. Pray for her please. Thank you for letting me ramble on..I do not like facebook as it is too public for something so private. Now that I had some sleep last night  I am going to get alll dolled up for her since it makes her happy when I don't look like \"something that cat dragged in (her words:) peace out to everyone and hope all are doing good.",

It seems more like another assumption that needs much more true clinical data -pure clinical data-before releasing a headline like that.

I have missed you all...a gazillion pages of reading and just want to send hugs and applause as needed:) NYC was a blast but my new *boobs* set off the full body scanner- that was FUN. The TSA woman came up to pat my chest down and I snarled- BACK OFF LADY YOU ARE NOT TOUCHING ME! I had already told them before the scanner that I had just had exchange surgery, etc...I told her this, she said I have to- I said nope- you are not gonna grope me there...have at anywhere else=not there- wanna see my boob id cards? it was a mess...then she came back and said- OK we will just test your hand?! Sheesh... What a flipping surprise when I got to my hotel- I decided on Waldorf after booking a cheapo rate (matched what the sales team had to pay at Sheraton)....I checked in and they upgraded me to a corner luxury king executive suite! hahaha- oh joy-I had a foyer, a living room-fireplace, a bedroom, a dressing room and the coolest art deco black and white marble bath-all said the suite was about 1000 sqft. It was absolutely wonderful to be spoiled like that for a week. I walked all day Sunday and Monday- took the SI ferry and waved at the old girl in the harbor-then scored some funky loots and a coat in Soho and the Village. Oh yeah, I worked too hahaha a little. This post sounds shallow but you know what, after so much crap it felt good to be just a little shallow. I met some incredible people and it is always great to get so much good feedback from clients. Finally made it to PJ CLarkes and low and behold, there was Alec Baldwin...I gotta say- he was kind of underwhelming except for his magnificent hair:0 I must admit that was the strangest meal I have ever had as I sat with 6 guys and took them through the BC process to date...it was pretty cool. Met with PS when I got home and he is happy with how things are going- will see him once a week for next three weeks and then see when we go for the nips... I am nervous as the time for my intitial followup visits (3 mos) are coming with onc...oh well...I am gonna go plant some flowers today- I went nuts buying them (which is crazy since I have no $) hahaha Have a glorious Sunday and be good to yourself:)",

Sun is shining and I think I am going to go in the pool today- so far only have been in hot tub as I have turned into a wonk with cold water but when I was out there watering flowers I tipped my toe in and it was nice....gonna pick up my mom later and have her come spend the night and just hang out...yet another to show my boobs to! love ya all and wish you were all here enjoying the sun and a soft cool breeze with me- hubby just left for Austin overnight...older son bringing home younger son later today so right now...just me...which is RARE...had a great dinner last night-felt *normal* or at least mynormal...no kiddo so hubby asked me to dinner- it has been awhile for the two of us and it was wonderful=neat little place called Hanna Sushi with great Japanese food...he ate asparagus and broccolli for the FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE (yes, a spoiled kid whose mom did not make him eat veggies- but he is coming around at 55!) since we were in a sushi place of course we ordered steak. hahaha it was so damn good...garlic and mango sauce...holy gosh...i almos tlicked the plate. Dinner out with him sounds liek not a big deal but it is...I am weird in that since we usually have our younger boy around it is the three of us...when it is just me and him I am usully so tired I just want to relax- worse following BC- so even though i love him I tend to say when he asks no thanks too tired- so I decided to \"go left\" last night and say yes. It was very nice. And I let him pay. Another problem of mine since I am the major wage earner...I tend to whip out my card or grab the bill...I have come to understand just how demeaning that can be...what this man may lack in $ over 35 years he has shown himself to be the best of souls- he loves our sons and me with his whole being and while I was away in NY last week it dawned on me that I could never had my career with our son's situation as it is if not for my husband. It was a strong and honest thing to realize. I told him so last night without being all over the top like I can get. He appreciated it- he is so darn handsome hahah now I am getting goony but it feels to good and I am amazed with our 35th anniversary coming up on April 30 that it is a true gift to be in love after all these years. It cycles in and out but I guess because it is real, it always comes back full force...and hits me like it did when I was 16 and had a crush on him. We have had one hell of a road...yet somehow despite the twists and turns we find each other again. I have no idea why I am blabbing away like this except I must be having some insight attacks. Thankfully., I have been so surrounded in my head with ME it feels good to let everyone else in that I love. I love you guys-thanks",

My womanhood was never tied up in them- they did their jobs- fed my babies and got my hubby interested over 30 years ago....the new ones are just fine....I can pick them apart but really, to be honest, my originals werenot so perfect...am a 36 full c now instead of a 36 long:) I am also taking the recent doc treatment guidelines with me from NCCN so doc can have a copy the mos t recent copy from Feb 2011....when i traced my particular stats it said \"AIs can be suggested to prevent minor chance of recurrence in contralateral breast....\" all of the other stages said absolute AIs...oh geez I just hope it all goes well and I MUST QUIT SMOKING- this is nuts..I went backon smoking thread and said I would so I willl..... I love you all for putting up withm y crazy ranting and I truly hope there is some way for us to have a et together...I don't know how...somewhere central and reasonably priced so all can afford...even a weekend would be wonderful....i feel like i know you all and care so much for you...even the newbies...you all add to the mix and have something to offer- remember that- we allhave something to offer. sometimes we may take more than we give but in other times we give freely- how cool is that?",

I know the BS wanted to know as much as possible before going in as she had already been shocked that my cancer was not B9 as she had predicted before the biopsy.My oncodx was a 6. I am assuming from this point out unless blood tests, symptoms indicate otherwise that the only imaging I will have will be either an MRI or ultrasound of my breasts as I can no longer have a mammogram (bmx and reconstruction). Who knows what is right? So many tests get false positives and in my case- the small spots that showed up in the liver from way back to the orginal tests before the BMX did not concern either the onc or bs but since I have a new onc she was all freaked out (thus freaking me out) and wanted me to have the PET/CT to make sure.  So, as I opened this with, I think I know less now than I knew before. That puts me in good company with all the world's lead researchers as it seems so much supposition in so many cases. I have one major hurdle left to fight and that is my smoking. It is so strange to do so much to fight bc and I am so weak in the face of smoking. But I will do it.",

The result of it all is my son will not allow ANYONE no matter how gentle or kind to go inside of his mouth...all the valium in the world only results in a very loopy guy shaking his head un oh no....hahaha nothing dumb about him...so he has to have all of his work./checkup down under full general anesthesia once a year...it makes me nuts the risk each year we do  it....say a little prayer for my guy please...he is a pain in the butt but I love him so much:) I am a pain in his butt I am sure:) we have to be down there at the med center at 530am! argh.....",

She was thrilled with progress thus far (after a heated discussion on my taking DIM/Grapeseed extract as opposed to AI) and said my next visit with her will be in a month or two for tattoo (following my nip surgery this Wednesday June 8) with artist (the artist does it in the BS office)- that was exciting looking at the skill level of this woman, who had BC herself....which puts a whole new spin on it. I did have a few words with her about my course of treatment. When she started to tell me off and said, \"I can only speak from what I know and the two women who chose DIM had recurrences...\" I kind of flipped (as I do respect her). After my head calmed down from surge of fear (which is truly there in little bits anyway), I said hmmm, what is weird is despite the blood tests backing this up the best (?not sure if this is correct term) reassurance I have got is the feeling of hormonal activity (which I know is dangerous) thanks to my having to stop supplementation prior to surgery due to bleeding issues=I said funny that is what all the oncs seem to say about AIs and Tamox working judge by SEs...I have those as well on my supplements and blah blah...ANYWAY...she shook her head and said I feel it important to tell you about those two women...and I said I appreciate that but have you read the latest NCCN guidelines...and she shook her head again and said those experts change their minds all the time - all disagree to a point about all therapy ...so by this time I am hyperventilating and then I say I will stay on this course as long as blood work, SEs, etc maintain and my exams continue to be good...I sat back and then sat straight up and said \"What stage/grade and type of surgery did those two women have? And before you tell me that all stages and grades can return so I am not living in lala land, I know that, but I need you to tell me about these two women specifically. I evaluate all FACTS to the best my pea brain allows and as always-am open to rethinking everything -have always been that way in my life...she kind of muttered and tried to change subject...I said nope, tell me, not cool to toss something like that out and then say the stats make no difference. since all we have is based  on stats...and how are they NOW? well, it lands up both had different stages and grades and surgical options and are doing well now-with nobody really sure if the protocol or lack  thereof caused it...so then I GOT MAD...I asked why on earth would she not have said that to begin with? I would have digested it and filed it away with all the other data I acquire....she said, well, i just thought you needed to know...FINE I KNOW, THANKS...I calmed down and we finished the appt (I did not BEGIN to address my thoughts on the announcement she gives following BMX surgery-HELLO YOU ARE NOW CANCER FREE....argh, i think it iis much better to say it went well, etc..I was even chided for being hesitant to get up and do a hokey pokey over the news...this whole thing is just such a mind(*)*.... ahhh, we can all see Annette is in fine form today:)",

I am glad I had my mammo no doubt about it. edited to repsond to elimar- no- the onc was not going to see me for another six months but base don my choices, wants to do the blood work every 90 days- that is ok with me...i see my BS at the end of the year- I just saw her last month and she showed me what to look for and how to look for bumps etc and will do an ultrasound in December. Currently the boobs are seen often by my PS as I go through the reconstruction process and he is astute as to any changes. Have I been overtested? Yes, based on my pathology. Am I upset about it? No, I am not. I have had CT, MRI, PT/.CT, Bone Scan and Bone Density. I have had a zillion blood tests measuring everything in  me (although to what end- who knows really, regarding the value of these). Base lines have definitely been established. That is never a bad thing. I have heard far too many stories of people being poleaxed by mets that were not found or higher stages not correctly diagnosed initially. The oncs and BS argued and contradicted each other (all are good physicians-different philosophies) as to the need for them (I was in the midst of changing oncs) but I said go ahead. I have signed any form there is offering my resuls to any researcher that wants them. I signed away my breast tissue for research. They can have my pee (which they took by the way) Sure I get anxiety before any of these. Most of which god willing I won't need any more (except perhaps bone density as I age and ultrasounds for my chest that now has implants) - the blood work, well, it is the best thing we have right now so they are welcome to it. We all approach this in different ways. I know ME and ignorance is not bliss, even while understanding I can't really KNOW anything.",

It is something about the ethics I imagine. I modeled my DIM and grapeseed extract regimen on the two old trials I found..I buy the Biorepsonse at whole foods (good sale every so oftern) and my activen grapesee extract at Central Market (HEB stores). What is scary, is they work at least fo rme...I had to be off them for two months and just got my estrogen level test...GAK...went up to nearly not being menopausal...because this time around doc didn't do full estrogen panel (including estridiol) I will call back tomorrow and ask for that next month- that will give me a month back on my *stuff* to",

Seyla- beautiful picture--thanks:) Catbill- may I ask how you are doing on the Arimidex? You and I are pretty close in DX and treatment...I just have not started the Arimidex or Femara (hahaha, I am collecting AIs..) instead choosing to try the DIM, grapeseed extract , etc. But of course I am nervous about this. I know it only pumps up my chance of recurrence to 10% from the 5% with treatment, and the alternatives I am taking are giving me similar SEs that others report on AIs..(hot flashes back, fighting the weight, etc)...but I just wonder if I am being a total idiot not trying them. I just wanted to beon something I could take the rest of my life. So, any honest feedback would be appreciated as I mull my decision. Still waiting on my estrogen test results which should be back this week (they take a week or 10 days to get a result on estrogen). My progesterone is dead low at .3 and I need the estrogenlevel to help make my decision. Thanks-this is really driving me crazy. I am excited to go to MD Anderson this Tuesday and find out if I am accepted into their clinical trial for stopping smoking- it is intense and I need intense to finally quit...they will monitor and counsel and poke and prod for 13 months-which is unbelievable support-they really wan tthe trial to be successful...I figure even if I get the placebo the ancillary care will really help. Thank you all for being here...miss smartypants me is freaking scared",
