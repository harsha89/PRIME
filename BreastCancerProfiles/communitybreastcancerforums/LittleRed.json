      "Content": "Oct 18, 2009 09:41AM LittleRed wrote: Dear Piffken: You will get the three drugs I did.  I had 8 treatments over 16 weeks.  The schedule was condensed (every 2 weeks vs. my oncs standard of every 3 weeks) because I was considered young (44 ha, ha, ha) and strong and able to do a more rigorous schedule. First 4 were Cytoxan&Adriamycin followed by 4 Taxol. Nausea with the C/A was greater, though I never got sick.  (I included a ginger supplement every day, and 3 days before chemo I doubled the dose through the 2nd day after chemo.  Not sure if it helped, but it didn't hurt.  Studies have shown it helps many with nausea.)  I was tired, but able to work PT.  Taxol was more tiring, but didn't make me as nauseous.  With Taxol I had to pre-med with steroids - that made me really edgy...They also started each Taxol with a Benadryl dose - that made me REALLY tired. I lost my hair pretty much after the 3rd treatment.  My nails were fantastic until the 2nd to last treatment.  I've been out 6 weeks now, and those that died during treatment are falling off now.  Not painful, but uncomfortable.  I cover them with waterproof band aids when I go out - those hardly ever wear off. (My onc said she rarely sees nail loss with Taxol, but it can happen.  Guess I'm the lucky winner in that crappy pool!) I have a little numbness (neuropathy)  in my fingers, but my feet remain very numb.  The numbness started somewhere around my 6th treatment.  I take a B complex supplement that's supposed to help for that.  The numbness in my fingers comes nd gos, but I haven't felt a significant change in my feet yet. I agree:  stay hydrated as best you can.  Chemo can do serious damage to your mouth.  My dentist prescribed a Rx fluoride toothpaste, and Biotene brand mouth wash and Biotene dry mouth moisturizer (Biotene is sold over-the-counter).  I got the dry mouth during the C/A, but it was kept under control with these products - I never got mouth sores. Taxol wasn't so bad for dry mouth.  I also had to pre-medicate before visiting the dentist (antibiotics) so check with your onc, even for a cleaning. I lost my taste for things.  Many foods I commonly ate before tasted metallic or even rancid.  That quickly changed a few weeks after finishing chemo.  (I'm one of the few who lost weight during chemo.  Losing my taste buds was not a help.) Hot flashes became routine during the end of chemo.  They continue now that I'm on Tamoxifen.  I hope they will diminish over time.  They contribute to sleeplessness, which hit me during the Taxol.  No problems sleeping during C/A. The neulasta (sp?) shot which you get the next day can make people sick.  I only experienced pain at the injection site for a few days. The toughest thing for me however, was the emotional.  If you've got the emotional support you need that will make it MUCH easier.  And don't be concerned about asking for help.  Now is the time to respect your needs. I hope this doesn't scare you.  Everyone is so different, so no two experiences will be alike.  Not everything hits you at once either.  But you need to know YOU WILL get through the chemo:  The view is better on the other side.  We'll all be rooting for you here! Take good care of you!!",

I have fuzz all over and the hair is coming in too.  I don't let many people see my head at this stage of the game, but you ladies are different.  You understand.  I am so happy just to have a hairline, even if it is mostly fuzz...well, I'm going to refer to it as a hairline anyway... My eyelashes are coming in, but I have not used any product on them.  The lower ones are pretty short, maybe a 5th of their normal length and pretty evenly spaced across; the uppers are also short, but more patchy.  (chelev:  I only have one old eyelash left now - the other fell out when I ran to the store for that brow pencil. You warned me. lol!) My eyebrow hair just started to appear at the end of this week.  I have very little left to speak of, but the new growth is now visible closest to my nose and working  its way out.  They kinda sprouted overnight. Nose hair is coming back; the facial hair is starting to come in.  Leg hair unfortunately showed up by weeks 4/5  so I really DO have to shave now.  And yes, regrettably, I now know I'm going to have to deal with my bikini line once more,  but at least not for a while. I've been taking my mutlivitamin and eating protein and good veggies where possible.  No special supplements or topical treatments for me at this point, except the B complex I take for neuropathy - that does contain some biotin. I would worry about the Latisse risk for discoloration too, but my friend just started using the lash renewal stuff from the drug store.  I have to check back with her to see how that's going.  I might give it a try if she thinks it's helped her.",

I'm not as familiar with all the recon issues and complications that come up, but there is the Exchange City thread here that is visited by a number of extremely knowledgeable women.  Whippetmom is a wonderful woman who I am sure would provide feedback for you if you reach out to her.  A number of women have discussed disappointing results with recon surgery, but it has been corrected and they are now very pleased.  I'm sure you can find the support you need there. Kathy16:  The original plan was to do all my recon at the same time as my mx:  R-LAT flap with implant and L-aug for symmetry.  However, I was informed that if the initial surgical biopsy of nodes was positive, they would to the L-aug and only the R-mx and put in a R-TE.  This is because nodes meant radiation post-chemo.  They thought it would be better not to put the newly moved muscle/tissue/skin under the stress of rads and they didn't want to delay rads. So I am now done with chemo and rads.  My PS wants to wait until May to do my exchange - 3 months after that, fipple, rest, then tattoo.  So, this time next year I could actually be done.  (?)Sometimes that gets me really down - waiting so long for all that, not to mention some hair (mine used to be pretty long, so that's even further out).  But if I can enjoy the next 30 years healthy and feeling whole again.  It will be worth it all.",

Mostly in my underarm area - no peeling, but definately more than just a glow...Using Eucerin.  Maybe I'll switch to the Aquafor (sp?) this weekend.  I need more goop anyway  I'm going through a ton of it...would aloe be more 'cooling' if I got that instead?
