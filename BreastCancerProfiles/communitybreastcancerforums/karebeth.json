I went to the doctor today because of bloody nipple discharge. He immediately sent me for a breast ultrasound. The radiologist wanted a diagnostic mammogram first. My last screening mammogram was normal in April, 2015. The ultrasound shows 2 distinct masses- 1 is 1.5x1.2x1.4cm with indistinct margins and acoustic shadowing. The second is smaller 4mmx 5mm, and again shows acoustic shadowing. The discharge is worse today, but I am assuming that may be because of the mammogram and all the squeezing. I have an appointment with a breast specialist on Tuesday, but I am terrified. The report says BIRADS C4, which I know is suspicious, but I have no idea what this acoustic shadowing is. Anyone have any insight? Log in to post a reply",
