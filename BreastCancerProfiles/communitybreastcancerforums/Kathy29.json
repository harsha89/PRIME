I have had some permanent hair loss with these drugs, mainly my hairline receded at least 1\", maybe more, and the hair won't grow back. I've take Biotin and Biosil to help my hair grow, I've used the female treatment of minoxidil and nothing works. I also lost my eyebrows and they only grew in partially and what did grow in was course unruly hair. I'm going to have micro blading done to replace the eyebrow loss and will see a hair specialist about my hairline. It's already 3 years since my chemo treatment ended and no sign that this hair is coming back. My (male) oncologist never mentioned permanent hair loss to me and didn't even want to discuss side effects really and I had a number of serious side effects.",
