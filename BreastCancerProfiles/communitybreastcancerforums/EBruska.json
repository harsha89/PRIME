    "Content": "EBruska wrote: My mom will be having surgery in a month or so. She has been doing an amazing job losing weight and had gained a lot of confidence that had been lacking. And now a cancer diagnoses. She has decided on a unilateral masectomy without reconstruction, but is already concerned about how she will look after. She's worried about not being able to wear a bra for two months to help her look \u201ceven\" when she's at work, etc, and then being flat on one side after. I'd like to help her prepare by finding practical clothing to help her be comfy and hold her drain after surgery, as well as shirts to help hide the unevenness and build her confidence we'll afterwards. The masectomy-specificclothing I have come across is all very expensive! What are some great styles to rock after surgery? Can you help with (specific) suggestions, please? Log in to post a reply",
