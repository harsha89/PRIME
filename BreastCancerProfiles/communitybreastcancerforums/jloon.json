I'm married to my high school sweetheart for 14 years and we have two young boys, 3 and 7years old. I was diagnosed May, 2010 (38yrs old) with IDC, triple negative, tumor over 5cm - started on the AC/D protocol here at the BC Cancer Agency. After 5 months of chemo I was left with no hair, an extra 10 pounds and a tumor double it's original size! I had a double mastectomy in Nov 2010 - they removed all my lymph nodes - all positive for cancer - told all clear margins though - all my scans - CT, bone, chest xray came back clear - no spreading - a week later had a PET scan which I had to pay $3000 for - the PET showed 2 local reoccurrences - over 3cm and several bone and liver mets (all very small that's why they didn't show up on other scans). I took off to Germany (interesting but too long to write here -you can read about on my blog if your interested). In Dec I switched to a new oncologist, known to be one of the best in BC and started Gem/Cis with Avastin and Zometa. End of Feb I had another PET which showed came back almost completely clear of cancer! Even my oncol was amazed! I then started on daily dose of Capecitibine (xeoloda) and continued with Avastin and Zometa. Just had another PET scan which showed extensive spreading again- seems as soon as we stopped the Gem/Cis it came back. All of my mets are very small - under half cm but there are lots in bones and soft tissue and couple in my liver about 1cm. How upsetting!! I was really really hoping I was going to be one of these freak one or two percents that it was just gone, never to come back. Anyway, no such luck. Damn!! I will be starting again with Gem/Cis and the Parps.If you're interested this is my blog: http://jlunot.blogspot.com/ Since we are starting the same day maybe we can share experiences :) Let's go PARPS!!",

I was diagnosed the day before we were to leave with our kids on our first, longly awaited Disneyland trip. The surgeon suggested that I may not want to go - and that was just a four day trip! I am SO SO glad I went. I did have some rough times especially when things got quiet, but it would have been worse to stay home and cancel the trip. Jackie",

I should mention too that I started on Gem/Carbo/iniparib (through Spec Access) when the skin mets started up (also have mets in bones, liver and soft tissue) and it is definitely helping the skin mets. They have almost cleared up completely and I don't have the itching or burning at all anymore - thankfully, because it was driving me crazy! I'm hoping that it is also helping the other mets. I will have a pet scan in about a month. If you have not tried Gemcitibine (or Gemzar) and Carboplatin (or Cisplatin) chemos I would definitely recommend it. It really works for some TN. And all the side effects are very managable. No hair loss and nausea is very easily controlled. It's also one of those that you see results quick if it was working. Feel free to send me a message if you'd like more info.",
