I thought I'd share my experience today with a core biopsy. There must be many, like me, who have read every word they can find about this procedure. And, have been paralyzed with fear waiting. My first base-line mammogram, 2 weeks ago, showed a questionable 1cm mass, a 6mm and 8mm \"nodule\" and another 1cm \"massy\" area with microcalcification in my left breast. There were various other cysts as well. I was referred to a Breast Center for a core biopsy. Upon arriving, the radio tech did another full ultra-sound. I remained in the same room for the biopsy, lying on my side with a supporting wedge under my shoulder. After reviewing the pics, the Dr determined the 2 smaller nodules were simple cysts. She knew I was nervous and she was so very kind. The needle used to give the local was so small I didn't even feel it, nor did I feel any burn of the medication. I never even knew when the incision was made. I barely felt any pressure when she inserted the core needle. When she actually snipped each sample, I could feel a tiny bit of something I wouldn't even consider pain. She was able to aspirate the complicated cyst and fluid was clear! She took 6 tissue samples of the calcification area. The nurse put 4 strips of surgical tape across the incision. I then went into another room for a mammogram to determine if the margins of calcification were completely biopsied (which they were). Back in the ultra-sound room, the nurse taped a small bandage over the area, gave me an ice pack and 2 Tylenol. I can't stress enough....Don't stress this procedure! At least for me, there was nothing to it!  Immediately afterwards, I went to visit my cousin in the hospital, went to lunch, then light grocery shopping. No pain yet 8 hours later. Dr's \"opinion\" is, worst case scenario: DCIS. I requested results over the phone, they will call tomorrow. Of course I am praying for B9, but after all the worrying I have done, DCIS will be a huge relief. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. God bless you all.... Log in to post a reply",

Follow up mammo and US in 6 months. The nurse that called me with the good news seemed as relieved and excited as I did! She has been such a wonderful support to me. Thank you, Wendy, and Happy 14th Anniversary Breast Cancer Free to you! Recovery from the core biopsy has been going well. Small amount of discomfort trying to sleep last night. So far, no swelling or bruising...just tender. After 2 weeks of paralyzing worry, It's time to get back to a life that will be forever renewed from this experience.",
