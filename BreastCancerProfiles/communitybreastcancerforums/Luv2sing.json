Hair Loss - Found ths wonderful website thru TNBC that provides a free silk scarf to those who are going thru hair loss ... http://www.franceluxe.org .  Look for the Best wishes link.  I've always had thick long hair (you can view my photos at www.myspace.com/bessix) and my husband has always said it was one of best assets.  I got iit cut short hoping that would lessen the impact of the hair loss and now every day I touch my hair (literally) more strands come out.  I can't even run my fingers thru my hair ... I end up with quite a bit in my hands.  It's very depression and I just want to shave it and throw on a wig or scarf, but my husband is adamant about letting it go on its own.  He was already livid when I cut it, so I'm trying to be nice and just watch it s-l-o-w-l-y d-a--y -b-y-d-a-y fall out. Recovery - I had my first tx on March 5 and I'm still exhausted, nauseated and can't even walk thru Wal-mart without sitting down!  My next tx is scheduled for April 3rd and if it doesn't get better I'll probably drive my husband crazy and then myself!  I have managed to go back to work for half days hoping that would help, but now I just come home and fall asleep on the couch.   ",

Although I love doing the pageant, I don't think I have the patience right now to sit thru the rehearsal  and then I would have to drive myself to and from the darn thing cause my hubby has to work!  That means no door-to-door service and I have to park with the masses and walk (in heels and a gown), mind you ... I still cannot walk thru Wal-mart without resting .  At least when I sing this weekend I can sit down between songs and I don't have to wear heels and a gown (hee hee). I just submitted my final class assignment and I'm getting ready to take as many pills as I can to take away some of the pain I'm having and go to sleep.  For some reason I really want a piece of chocolate cake ... don't know where that craving came from????  Good night all ...

I'm still feeling 'not me' and kind of feeling this is all a dream and tomorrow I'll wake up, all my hair will be there, no port, np side effects, no steriod weight gain, no sad looks from people who think I want pity (instead of support), I'm back in the gym and my life is back to normal.  Today was one of those days where I needed to cry.  I didn't want to talk to anyone, I don't want to run for cover every time someone coughs.  I don't want to stay in the house because my immune system is low that day.  I only want my life back.  Just had to get that out before going to bed, so my mind would be clear. Everyone -  For the majority of us, we are considered strong, the backbone, the one who can handle anything ... all those titles that fit the 'wonder woman' persona.  Once we get this diagnosis, those who always depended on us, become lost and confused or even upset.  They expect us to keep up the 'wonder woman' persona and act as if everything is okay and we can still take on the world.  Don't let them put you in that situation.  I'm not saying mope around and behave as if life is over, but I am saying to those who don't allow you to be the one who needs support, the one who needs encouragement and the one who needs to hear 'What can I do for you?'  Let them know even 'wonder woman' had to call on her 'super friends' when things got really rough. I love you all for being a constant source of information, inspiration and support.  KISSESSSS!! ",

I'm feeling kinda bad too, but one of my girlfriends who's going thru chemo has developed mouth sores, sooooo I count myself lucky (fingers crossed).  My Real Name - It never crossed my mind that I hadn't and I do apologize for not addressing that early on .  My name is Raymon (pronounced Ra-moan) and from now on I'll remember to include it in my posts.  Weight Gain - I've gained 10 and lost 6 since my diagnosis.  I seem to keep getting back to the higher weight whenever it's time to be weighed, so I guess you could say I've gained a total of 10 pounds since starting chemo the first week of March (OMG!!!!) at this rate I'll be the Goodyear blimp in no time!  The pictures are all beautiful!!  Crusader1 - You do NOT look 62!!  Michelle - Good luck with the walk!  I'm trying to look back at the posts, but it's not working for me, I can't remember what I've just read (LOL)!  I'll be calling my surgeon tomorrow ... seems my port is still sore and it's been 3 weeks since the last time they accessed it.  There seems to be kinda 'knot' in neck where the tubing is supposed to end and the breast they removed the tumor from in Feb. is sore and I felt a hard 'spot', don't want to call it a lump ... but it's near the incision so it just may be scar tissue.  Will have both checked this week, so wish me luck.

I only go without around my true friends and family. crusader1 - Thank you.  Believe me when I say my perspective on life changed long before my diagnosis.  As I grew older I learned to treat people the way I want to be treated and to have friends, I must be a friend.  I lost my grandfather, father, mother and two brothers to cancer, life is too short.  Every day that I am on this Earth, I try to encourage others and make someone smile.  That is and always will be what fulfills me.  Pickle - You look mah-vah-lus!! Britt - It's interesting you put it that way.... one of my other friends who is going thru tx said she's going to wear a wig because she didn't want to look back and see herself looking like she had cancer.  While I did love my hair  and feel very naked without it, I do want to look back five years from now and say \"That's how I used to look.\"  So you have been instrumental in helping make my decision ... I'm going to wear a Red Dress and Red Wrap with hoop earrings.  I promise to post the picture once I get it!  Thank you to everyone who took time to help me with my decision. FYI - The reason I love my hair so much is it was my trademark (that and my nails).  I used to be an On Air Radio Personality and would make appearances.  I was always referred to as 'the woman with the beautiful hair and long nails.'

I say we can always give him your plate (hee hee).  Went to have my blood drawn (chemo is this Friday) and the woman left me with a serious wound!  It's still sore, purple and slightly swollen, of course she tried to say it was my veins, but I've never had trouble with anyone finding my veins.  Anyhoo .... thanks to all for the birthday wishes.  My co-workers had ice cream and cake and my hubby took me out to dinner, we got in the house just before the storm hit ... hail and a funnel cloud that didn't touch down (thank goodness) just went over our neighborhood.  He gave me the most beautiful card, so I'm having it framed ... it really is a beautiful card!  He always tries to play so macho, but he's really a softie (smile).  I got lots of phone calls, a few vistors and flowers, so even though I was exhausted, I had wonderful day.  Someone mentioned about wanting to rip a wig off ... that's the one draw back with this hair, I can't come home and throw it on the dresser (LOL).  I think for the warmer months I'll just do wraps and once my hair starts to grow I won't wear anything.  Right now I'm not used to being totally bald and the air on my scalp actually gives me goose bumps all over.  Feeling air on my scal is a whole new experience for me .  I just have to say I have been so happy since beginning to take my life back!  I thoroughly enjoyed singing this past weekend, the banquet was fun and this weekend I'll be hosting the King & Queen Pagent at our University.  I told him I had chemo this week, but he said he'd have a chair for me to sit in and I can hide behind the curtain with a microphone until the very end when I have to annouce the winner.  My cousin and I are trying to plan a trip to Va Beach at some point, so I'm really looking forward to that.  By the way ... if anyone is ever in my area and you want to get together to hang out, just let me know!  I'm 25 mins. south of Richmond. I'm starting to ramble cause the sleeping pills are kicking in, so I'm going to call it a night and try again tomorrow. Hugs & Kissess to all ... Raymon!      ",

I'm not moping around, but I do (for lack of better word) suffer with the SEs, the tx, etc.  All I can do is get up everyday, put on my smile, look my best whether I'm going out or not and take it one day at a time. Sessna1 - From a scriptural perspective ... I know you know Jesus was accused of doing things He did not do and still He gave His life for us all.   I agree, that you did not intend to convert anyone in your previous posts, however, what have since begun to do is deliberately offend those who have expressed they do not observe your beliefs.  It is one thing to share what's going on in our lives, but you have to admit your last few posts where intended specifically for those who did not wish to hear the scriptures.  That is their choice and it is not for us to further add salt to the wound by finding every scripture we can and throwing at them.  That's not how Christians operate.  We share, we allow people to make a choice (Free Will) and we move on.  I don't believe this forum was started to have people feel so put upon that they would choose to leave, rather than stay and continue to share his or her journey and allow us to encourage them along the way.  This will be my last post regarding the situation, because as a Christian, I have done my part and am now moving on.  Pray for me as I pray for you.",

Crusader1 - CONGRATULATIONS!!!  I'm drawing a blank on the hair thing though (LOL). Kimmom - I know you'll be a great source of support for your Mother, continue to be strong and you'll both have a wonderful story to tell when it's all done. Kellerka - Thanks for the website! Pickle141, Janet0527, Crusader1 - In the beginning, I asked my BS to do a total MX and she said she could get all the cancer with just the lumpectomy.  Well of course cells had broken thru the lymph nodes and started to spread .... and after the surgery is when I hear about the BRCA test ... had I known this information before surgery I wouldn't have agreed to the lumpectomy.  With my family history of cancer and this Triple Negative dx, I'm a little concerned about my upcoming test results.  I had a hysterectomy a few years ago and asked them to please take the ovaries ... of course they didn't (seems like no one listens to me sometimes) and now I'm facing the possibilty of additional surgery that I shouldn't be if people had just done what I asked them to do in the first place!  I'm furious that I may have to have another surgery!  I'm getting off the subject I intended to post (smile).  Breast Recon  - Here is a link to information regarding DIEPs, (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator) www.diepbreastreconstruction.org/  It's where they take the tissue and vessels from the abdominal area and supposedly women who have had C-Section can be candidates for this type of surgery.  The healing time, pain and possibilty of getting a hernia are supposed to be less.  As with any of the procedures, your body may reject the tissue ... and you have to find a PS who specializes in MICROSURGERY, as this is a vey delicate procedure.  I'm not sure if I remember anyone else mentioning this procedure, as I always read about the Trams and Lats, so just thought I'd share     To Everyone - Try to rest, eat right, drink plenty of water, do a little walking and think good thoughts.

Pickle141 - You are beautiful and I love all the pictures, especially the kissy face. Happy Birthday!! liven42day - Your name says it all. nasharayne - Enjoy the feelings while you can  and hope your test comes out good. janet0527 - You can borrow my hubby for a hug and always remember, beauty comes from within ... it's a poor attitude which makes us unattractive. arnie - Absolutely gorgeous!! MOB - I talk about this board so much, I have to remind myself that my friends and co-workers have no clue when I launch into a conversation as if they should know who and what I'm talking about (LOL)! Deb6563 - Will think good thoughts of you as you begin your journey. kellerka - Sorry to hear you were having a rough time, but without realizing it, you are taking it one day at a time.  I know for me, each day is a new experience. NYDeb48 - I do enjoy the posts on this board and I also belong to one other online support group specifically for Triple Negative folks. Marshall2000 - A BIG HUG FOR YOU!!! crusader 1 - I have grown enough to learn never to waste my energy on negative things.  Life is too short and I have too many things to accomplish  while on this earth.  I hope you feel better soon. ginagina - The recipe sounds great and I'm going to try it as soon as I can get my hubby to fix them (LOL). Thank you all for the sweet compliments!  I really mean it.  By now, everyone knows I believed my looks were in my hair and without I would be less attractive.  As a full-figured woman, I've always made an extra special effort to go out looking my best.  It took me minute (weeks) to get over losing my hair, but now I kinda have fun with it.  Everyone tries to guess what my head is going to look like when I come to work (LOL).  Now on to my latest adventure that I would like to call The Lace-front Fiasco (violin playing in the background).  I was so looking forward to having this thing put on and saved it for this weekend, because I was going to a banquet (last night) and my birthday is Monday, so I figured 'kill two birds with one stone' I'd be sporting a new look for a few weeks.  Anyhoo ... the store at which the wig was purchased \"claimed\" to also have people who specialized in applying the lace-front (HAH!).  I knew it wasn't going to be good when I pointed out where my hairline is and she placed the lace behind it instead of in front???  I normally have a very small forehead and I'm including the pictures so everyone can see I NOW HAVE A FOREHEAD????  Needless to say, I'm going to make the best of the situation and next week see if I can get a professional to re-apply it or just take it off and go back to wraps and the natural look.  My hubby swears it looks fine, but he's my hubby and he knows I can still punch with my left (LOL)!  Here are the pics:       The Close Up                                 My Sexy Pose (hee hee)                                         Leaving for the banquet Soooooo .... word to the wise, if you're going to invest in a lace-front wig, please be sure the person who's putting it on knows what they are doing!! Hugs and Kissess to everyone and Diane, get some rest!",

Okay .... Someone said what I was feeling with regard to the motivational group (I think it was Crusader1).  I like the idea, but I agree it would be good to keep it here as a form of encouragement to others who are just beginning the journey or those already on the journey and made need a pick me up.  I really can't handle the thought of posting to another forum ... only because I'm having enough trouble keeping up with TNBC, Facebook, Myspace, Blackplanet, breastcancer.org, ACS and any of the other sites I'm already using to stay informed.  One more site and I may explode or meltdown on my keyboard in mid stroke.   Ricki/Alyad/Rachel/Sakura - I'm there too.  Even though I'm married, there are days I feel alone.  People are so used to me being the strong one and I find myself now looking for alone time, so I can cry and get it out of my system.  I usually watch a really good emotional movie (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, Father of the Bride ... I believe they're called Chick Flix) and keep the soft Puffs by my side.   That way it's not a pity party but more of a cleansing party.  I continue to reach out to my positive people and try find as much humor as I can in any situation.  Singing definitely helps along with cleaning up and rearranging furniture ... making sure to rest when in between.  I may even use the Swiffer duster this week (hee hee).  I get tired of it too and everything seems to be moving too fast, but I  remind self it could be worse.  I just try to make the best of every day.  I truly believe if you encourage others, you will be encouraged. Hot Flashes - YES!!!!!!!! Those who are wrestling with decisions regarding treatment ... in the end, it's your body and you are the one who has to go through all this stuff.  As long as you are comfortable with your decision and are not giving up on my life, but instead choosing to live a healthier, less SE fillled life ... do what you feel is right. Arnie - What sort of problems are you having with your port?  Mine is always sore and it hurts when she accesses it ... even with the numbing stuff. Laurie - CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! To all who are coming up on their next tx, I wish you nothing but good thoughts.  I'm going to have to call it a night (this catching up wears me out).  I'm getting ready to take drugs and hit the bed.  I wish everyone a restful night and better day tomorrow.",

HAH ... 3 hours of interrupted sleep! Been trying to read the posts - Michelle - We can pick our friends, but family is forever.  From personal experience, I can't say that too much will change.  Just continue to do your best and seek encouragement, comfort and help from all who offer.  To all on Taxotere or Taxol - Is there anyone who gets a shorter tx?  The posts I've been reading so far seem to have almost day long infusions.  Just curious as my  onc is saying it should take me no more than two hours to complete the process.  But she will be sitting by my side the entire time to watch for any SEs and make the necessary changes ... meaning I get sent to the hospital (her words, not mine). Crusader1 - As they say, 'this too will pass'.  As for significant others ... my hubby is not the most sensitive man in the world, but I knew that when I married him.  So when he does go above and beyond I truly apprecite the effort.  Throughout our marriage I've never had to cook unless I wanted to, I never wash clothes, dishes or clean up unless I wanted to and I don't drive unless I want to, he picks out the most thoughtful cards, tries to cook my favorite meals, makes sure I'm not disturbed when I'm not up to visitors or phone calls and makes sure I'm looking my best before I walk out the door, link check, make-up check, pantyline check, etc (I sometimes wonder why he feels he's not the sensitive type, then he'll do something or open his mouth and out come some eloquent words that remind me ... overall I think I did pretty good ().  I'm not sure about nioxin, but there are more 'natural' products out there to use.  The important thing is to stimulate the scalp anytime you're trying to encourage growth.  A gentle massage.  Try it with your head hanging off the bed or sitting up with your head lowered between legs, this encourages the circulation ... lift your head up slowly or you'll have the pleasure of your head spinning.  As for your friend's comments ... it's all about perception.  If she came onto to the board and only absorbed the 'horror' stories, she may have got what she was looking for to support her reason for not joining a support group.  My hubby had attempted to discourage me from joining a support group by telling me he talked with some of his female co-workers who had been in 'those' groups and all they talked about was who had just died, who's cancer had metasticized and who was just given a 'death' sentence.  Well I'm truly glad he told me that as I did not choose to be a part of THAT support group!  I chose this group and TNBC where I can get good information, knowledge applied to life experiences, the ups and downs of this journey, the funny stories, beautiful pictures, support, encouragement and comraderie ... all without stressing about getting to a meeting!  I'm sure if your friend continues to look she will eventually find what's right for her at the right time. Dawnmrn1 - Love the picture! Kimmom - I agree with your comment regarding staying and checking out both boards.  I already know once I'm done with the Taxol I'll be doing eight weeks of daily rads and I plan to read any information I can that pertians to whatever I'm going thru, but this will always be my home.  I have to admit your Taxol and a few posted by others have me a little nervous, so I do hope everyone's next tx are better. Question - Why is all the weight going to our stomach???? Everyone  - Have a wonderful day!",

I couldn't stand the lace-front anymore (I'm used to washing my hair weekly), so I took it off today.  I'll be wearing wraps and easy-to-pull-off wigs for awhile.  My onc gave me the cutest wrap and turban to wear, so I might sport those over the weekend.  Ricki13 - Stay strong and hang in there.  To all those dealing with SEs, try to get a little bit of sleep (HAH!), everyone heading for tx tomorrow remember you're one step closer to the finish line.  I'm not even going to attempt to catch up with all the post, but I'll be back ... getting ready to head out for Church.   Hugs & Kisses to all!!!!!

      "Content": "Apr 24, 2009 02:04PM - edited Apr 24, 2009 02:07PM by Luv2sing Hello Everyone - Just getting back from Tx #3 and my SEs seem to be kicking in early, but there not so bad for now.  Going back a bit ... not only is ya'll acceptable, I do believe they have placed it in the dictionary ... sort of like EVOO, because it's used so much they made the decision to add it in future publishings.  We also 'make groceries' here instead of buying groceries and we carry pocketbooks, not purses (hee hee).  The 'fixin to' ended with my Grandmother (may she continue to rest in peace).  Emend - My favorite drug, the nausea has gone to the land of Far, Far Away (a Shrek reference) perhaps to that mean Prince Charming.  Sakura73 - I'm sending you a (((big hug)))!!!  Sunshine - Our temperatures are expected to hit the 80's up to the 90's this weekend and I'm so glad I took that wig off in time!  bwbly and others -  I agree, my heart goes out to her as it obvious she's got things going on that may require more help than she can receive via this forum.  I was always taught your actions speak louder than words. As a Christian, when I say I don't advertise, what I'm saying is \"I let my works, conduct, behavior, morals, ethics and the way I treat and respond to others speak for me.  This is the biggest and best way to show not only am I a Christian, but what type of Christian.  I don't beat people over the head with it and once you have expressed your beliefs, if we don't agree then we agree to disagree, but we keep it moving.  I always share with people how I've come through various situations, but I don't saturate them unless I see they are eager for more.  I have friends and associates from all walks of life and I try to gain an understanding of each of their customs and beliefs.  I don't judge them if their beliefs are not in line with mine and I don't condem them for their beliefs.  I said before and I'll say it again ... If you are strong in YOUR beliefs, no one or nothing will change what you believe. Which is why I don't mind engaging in CONVERSATIONS with people from different religions.  I find it very interesting and enlightening, but at no time do I say you are incorrect beliefs or try to push my beliefs on them.... it's FREEDOM OF CHOICE, FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREE WILL and my favorite - JUDGE NOT, LEST YE BE JUDGED.  I had promised myself I wasn't going to waste any more of my energy on that discussion, but I too was bothered by her post and reported it, especially after she stated she was leaving forum.  So for her to continue monitoring the posts, just to continue to post what I consider inappropriate expressions, sent me to the next level.  I enjoy this forum and have found a lot of comfort, laughs and information while on this forum.  I stand strong in my faith and encourage others to do the same ... REGARDLESS of who your higher power may be.  Do not give in to the negativity and continue to keep her in your good thoughts and for those who pray, continue to keep her prayer.  For Everyone who's dealing with SEs, coupled with everyday stress, financial hardships, whatever your issue may be at this time, continue to be strong, be grateful, encourage others as that is where you will gain your strength and always remember there is someone much worse than you. I have to go be 'force-fed' now (smile), if I'm able to I'll be back later tonite. Hugs & Kisses, Raymon",

She did say unless my oncologist felt the need for a PET scan when everything was done, there would be no other scans ... unless some other symptoms came up????  Not happy with that answer.  She actually said \"the assumption is ... when the surgery was done they got all of the cancer and the chemo & rads were just to make sure any strays were captured.  Wasn't too happy with that answer either, as I now have a friend who went back for a regular check up and discovered her breast cancer which had be \"removed\" had not only come back but spread to her liver and other organs.  That even made me furious!  Cancer treatment still has quite a ways to go as far as compassionate care and follow-up. Haven't had a chance to read all the posts I've missed but I promise to catch up.  Did see the jokes and videos and loved them!   I had to pass the blond joke on to a few friends (LOL)!  Getting sleepy now ... OH ... the Taxol tx seems to make me more tired and nauseaous.  I seem to always have a pretty bad reaction to the IV benadryl and she can't figure out why.  She said we're going to try something else along with the benadryl can't remember what she said it was going to be though ... I was too busy choking and trying to breath ... Anyhoo ... I feel the take a recliner break for a little while. Good thoughts and wishes to everyone this upcoming week!",

Thank you for the compliments .  I have to admit, even my manager describes me as 'prissy' (LOL) but not 'fru-fru' (his words).  As for the lace-front wig, it's not really a new thing, sources say it was first designed with alopecia patients in mind, then entertainers and everyone else jumped on the wagon.  Tyra Banks and RU Paul are two of the most well-known sporters of the wig, but others like Brittany Spears, Beyonce and Ashley Simpson also use this type of wig.  It is a small cap with ALMOST INVISIBLE lace attached to the front and is attached using either adhesive or substance similar to toupee glue.  Once it on, you can part it and style any way, because your real scalp is showing.  Of course on YOUTUBE there is a video of Beyonce wearing one of her wigs and the lace is showing.  This is because if you sweat profusely or make extreme facial movements, the line of demarcation will show.  It appear as if your skin is wrinkly, that's why it's best have someone (or a professional) trim the lace properly (as close to the natural hairline would be).  This will be my first time, so my experience is mainly seeing other people wearing them and watching them have it put on or taken off.  Of course I'll try to get a picture with it on...espcecially because I'll probably take it off after awhile and go back to wraps ... depending on how warm I may get while wearing the hair, after all it still is a wig cap, just a fancier one. MOB - Bummer about tax season, but glad to know you got thru it, hope you're feeling better soon! Kimmom - Congratulations!! Now onward and upward! deb6563 - It's not surprising to me that you were not aware, I'm still meeting breast cancer patients who have never heard of TNBC.  You will definitely find a wealth of information, support and encouragement here.  WELCOME!!! Sakura73 - I don't know what it is with the aching head??? I'm hoping mine is just allergies.  Hope you get some relief soon. To Everyone - Make someone smile today!  Hugs and Kissess and may your pain, stress and SEs decrease.",

Hopefully, I'll be able to go to work after therapy.  I had my 2nd tx on Friday and was light-headed and tired.  Then all of a sudden I got this burst of energy and decided to drive around the corner, that lasted all of 10 mins. I came back home and collasped in the recliner.  Saturday I woke up early with energy and decided to tackle some things and after that wore off I was exhausted again!!  Went to Church on Sunday and couldn't wait to get home and fall into the recliner.  Slept there until almost 9p!!!!!  My port is still sore and I've kept a bandage over it so nothing (dust, pollen, anything) will get in.  I noticed the hole seemed to be bigger than after the first tx, so thank goodness I only have two more to go and then start the Taxol.  A friend told me your SE could change each time, so you never know what to expect.  I've been a little nauseous and having a ton of muscle cramps.  Then I reached back too far with my right arm and it reminded my I had lymph nodes removed .  My hubby had to finish drying me off. If I'm up to it I'm supposed to host a pageant tomorrow.  If I do I'll try to post a picture.  Haven't decided if I'm wearing hair or a wrap yet.  Will cross that bridge when I get to it.

I need \"My Time\" too.  My second tx left me more exhausted and not feeling myself.  My port was extremely sore (I think that may have been from my PT 'massaging' it too much) and even though the soreness has subsided it is still bothering me.  In my mind, it looks like it's sticking out more.  When I went back for PT, I had a bandage over it and the therapist became concerned.  I told her it was to keep me from scratching it and how it had become sore. She made an extra special effort not to focus on that area. Of course now my fear is it won't hold out thru the rest of my tx.  Guess I\"ll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Hugs and Kissess to everyone!! ",

I finally got photobucket to cooperate, but my hair has grown a little more since the pics were taken.  I probably will take one over the weekend and upload it.  Those of you planning fun for the 4th, be safe and enjoy yourselves!  I'm still fighting SEs and will be begging the doc for something to control the pain other than Ibuprofen (which isn't working).  Took off from work for two days because I couldn't take it anymore and had a family situation to handle as well.  Here's some interesting info ... I gained 12 pounds of fluid over a two week period, I was  miserable, feet were swollen and painful ... blah, blah, blah.  Last Friday, my onc told me to cut off one day of steriods, stay away from sodium, etc, keep my feet elevated as much as possible and increase my water (was already drinking a ton).  From last Friday to this past Monday ... I LOST 10 POUNDS OF FLUID!!!!!!! Happy to say my feet are as painful, but I have to keep them elevated or they start to swell.  I'm watching every salty or processed thing and sipping on water right now.  Because I was a tad bit stressed this week my glucose levels weren't what they should have been, but I'm working on that too.  I plan on just resting the entire holiday weekend and head back to work on Monday.  I now prop my feet up on a trash can and my CPU at work to keep them from swelling.  Still walking like an old woman, but at least I'm feeling better. Okay ... here's my last try at posting the hair growth ... this picture was 6/19 during Taxol.  My DH swears my hair will be to my knees at this rate (LOL)!  Everyone have a great day and a wonderful weekend, in case I can't check back in.

Hubby went back to work this week, not 100%, but he's up and around.  My rad tx are coming along.  The area being treated has gotten darker and it hurts to wear a seat belt, but no peeling so far.  Still retaining fluid and the lymphedema arm has gotten a little bigger, but in the grand scheme of things ... it's all good.  Congrats to those who are finishing up and those who are seeing progress in hair growth!  I'm posting a new profile pic taken this weekend showing how much my hair has grown.  I have to get up a little earlier in the mornings now cause I have no eyebrows or eye lashes and it takes awhile to draw them without looking made up.  I'm really enjoying having shorter hair and it's filled in to the point where people who don't know about my diagnosis think I got my hair cut (hee hee).  I'm sending pleasant thoughts and good vibes to all and may you find a moment to reflect on how really fortunate we are in spite of our circumstance.  Always know there is someone going through more, who would gladly trade places with you. Kisses to all and have a great rest of the weekend.",

I'm jumping on the broken record ... been reading the posts and trying keep up but just not posting.  I'm typing a little slower these days because it hurts a little more.  Happy Birthday and Anniversary to all those who celebrated and will be celebrating!  My thoughts and prayers are with those who are having a difficult time, continue to encourage yourself and others.  Pickle - I love what you posted about being grateful and the picture is still making me laugh! bethr - Your story gave me a mixture of laughter and fear ... I just told my hubby today ... \"No jury would convict me ...\" (YIKES!) 5timewinner - I'll be starting the Taxol on June 8th.  (8 weeks total) She's doing my first tx on a Monday and the rest will be done Fridays cause in her own words \"If anything happens to you with the first tx after you leave the office, it will be easier to find me.\"  We sat and talked a little about the tx cause I let her know I was nervous, anxious and concerned.  She reassured me she heavily medicates and she will be with me the entire time.  We're going to go over everything again next week.  Again, in her words \"so stop sitting at home getting your panties in a bunch.\"  You jut gotta luv her (LOL)! Congratulations to the new aunties and grannies!! Gymmom - I know you are bursting with pride! Crusader - Italy!!!  I've persuaded my husband to start planning for a cruise, but Italy ... I can only dream about.  Have fun! I want to respond to all the posts but I'll be typing all night (smile).  Someone mentioned feeling weepy and I can relate to that ... I'm trying to keep my spirits up and remind myself things could be worse.  I've started to work on some fundraising projects for October and excited about those.  I was selected to be a part of review panel for a brochure educating folks on Triple Negative Breast Cancer and I'm truly exicted about that, it's supposed to completed for distribution by the end of the year.  I had to push my next class back, because the SEs are making it difficult to focus on my school work, but I'll still have my MBA before the end of Summer 2010.  My hair started growing back before I finished my last A/C tx and it's so straight right now that I'm praying for a curl (LOL)!  I still have eyebrows and lashes and hope they hold out thru the Taxol. I'm going to try and post more ... I've kinda gotten into the Facebook thing cause not only do I see some of you, I've also reconnected with a lot of my old classmates and people I've known in several states.  So if you haven't joined the March Warriors on Facebook yet, you should think about it ... it's kinda nice ... minus the stupid little games they have. Going to close for now, it took me like forever finish this post!  Everyone be happy, be safe and take care!",

I'm just amazed at how beautiful everyone looks.  The pictures posted show how far we've all come.  In trying to read some of the posts I've noticed some of my feelings have already been expressed.  Had my port removed on Sept. 10th, because it was causing too much pain.  Will be finished with rads by Oct. 7th, have sustained some burns and prescribed a combo of lidocaine and aquaphor to help ease the pain, cracking and peeling.  My onc told me I have to wait six weeks post rads to be re-staged.  I'm just glad to finally get to a point where I can rest without an appointment.  My thoughts and prayers are with all of you experiencing challenges in addition to dealing with your diagnosis.  Just know that you are not alone and in order for people to extend a hand you have to let them know you need a hand.  This is not the time to keep everything inside.  Find a friend, a neighbor ... anyone ... and allow them to help you through what is already a difficult time.  Stay encouraged, look for the rainbow and when time allows, continue to share your feelings on this board.  I've received tons of encouragement just by reading someone else's post. Congratulations and Hugs to those who are healing, nearing the end of their treatments and overcoming obstacles! To Everyone - I read an article which caused me to think of our group of courageous women and I totally agree with the writer ... WE ARE NOT SURVIVORS, WE ARE WARRIORS!!",

I'm hoping my onc will ask for one since she expressed concern about the knot at the end of my tubing.  I don't want to wait for \"symptoms\" and then find out something's wrong.  I want to know ASAP if all this junk I went thru did anything!  So now my toes are turning dark, my nails are turning dark and breaking more often.  They seem to be growing really fast and then they break, so I'm having to cut them every two weeks ...my hair is growing too, but of course I'm okay with that !  I'm on the steriod train as well and sleep whenever it hits me.  I'm loving the new swollen look on my feet .... just in time for summer .... Congratuations to all who are finishing up!!! I'm gettting anxious as it gets closer to the radiation part of my tx.  I'm not looking forward to the SEs I keep reading about.  My PT said my sleeve should protect me some, so that's a good thing.  Pickle maybe I can come help you pack to get my mind off of some of this stuff (LOL)! I'm thinking about trying the Nioxin as well ... anything that will speed up my hair coming back.  Still holding my breath that the Taxol won't take it out again.  Do we have a choice about keeping the port?  I want this thing removed as soon as they're done with it.  It is very irritating, I can't sleep with it, it hurts constantly and I have to always keep it covered because it's so sensitive that when my clothes rub against it I go crazy .... Never knew whining was an SE (LOL)!!!  I hate to complain so much, but lately that's all I seem to be doing.  I've been in a funky mood, extremely exhausted, can't walk without getting out of breath ... I'm just not a happy camper right now.  Been trying to do some light exercises in the bed and recliner though.  Using two pound weights to work my arms and doing leg lifts ... I feel like I have to do something to combat the weight gain and the lack of going to the gym. Happy Anniversary kduling!!! I know I seem to jumping all over the place, but I'm trying to wind down from these darn steriods!!!! Everyone disregard every negative thing I posted and focus only on the fun or good stuff .  Have a wonderful rest of the week, try to stay cool and make someone laugh today! ",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2009 02:23PM - edited Apr 25, 2009 02:29PM by Luv2sing Good Morning Everyone!!! Just checking in for a quick minute before I'm 'forced' to eat breakfast .  To backtrack on the 'Friend' thing -  The few friends I count as close have been as close as ever, I'm lucky that when we first discovered eachother as friends years passed and we found out we were in the same family one on my mother and on on my father (talk about fate).  Now my children (ages 29 & soon to be 22) they each handled it differently.  My son called constantly, stopped by my job (it helps that he works on the same Campus - hee hee) every chance he got to check on me.  My daughter ... I'm going to use as the possible example (or reason) why some of your 'close' friends or even family members may have distanced themselves ... I was diagnosed in January, had my surgery on Feb. 6th, her birthday was Feb. 12th.  Prior to my surgery she made what I hope was joke about me still making a Rum Cake for her birthday (I pride myself on my cooking skills) .  After I told her that would be \"NO.\" she was disappointed.  My husband had asked her to stay with me the weekend of my surgery because they could not replace him at work (long story) and she agreed.  I was very disappointed when she did not call, nor did she show up??  I did not see my daughter until the first week of April.  This means she hadn't seen me lose my hair or go thru any of the changes I was going thru.  Her bestfriend kept asking her 'have you seen your mother?' and she would be honest and tell her she hadn't.  Then her bestfriend asked ' Well, do you know what she at least looks like now?' and she was honest and said no.  This was confusing to me and her bestfriend as we all have 'myspace' pages and are friends.  Her bestfriend was constantly visiting my site to see my Triple Negative updates (pictures), so she began to tell her about my hair loss, etc.  I couldn't believe my daughter had not even looked at my page?? It wasn't until she after she came to see me, that I understood.  She didn't say anything while she was there, but once she got home, she called me.  Her conversation brought tears to my eyes as we talked.  SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME SICK.  You have to remember, I lost my brother (her favorite Uncle) less than two years ago to Cancer.  We were both by his bedside when he passed, just as we had been throughout his battle.  But it wasn't much of a battle, because he gave up and didn't want to live.  She began to relive those fears and didn't want to see me like she saw him.  This could be the reason some of your friends have strayed away.  Some people can't handle illness very well and you already know when most people hear 'Cancer' they equate it with skin & bones, wasting away waiting to die.  I'm just throwing that possibility out there and a suggestion .... You may want to reach out to them, send them some pictures, let them know you're in this to win it.  After I explained to my daughter that I was not Uncle Wayne and that I have made a conscious deciscion to live.  She began calling every day, although now she can't stop by because she was exposed to TB from one her patients and we are waiting for her test results ... I don't want to take any chances, but at least we are laughing together on the phone.  I realize the best thing I can do for her is to reassure that I will not hide my meds behind the Armoir, I will say not I took them and know I didn't, I will not switch doctors, not tell them of my history and hope to get a better diagnosis, I wiil eat (even when I don't want to) and I will take care of my health (these were just some of the not-so-good choices Uncle Wayne made).  I have to say my daughter and I agree we are both mad that he chose to give up.  We truly believe if he had least tried, he could have won. Back to what I was saying .... Reach out to your friends, maybe they just need to know you're handling your business and you're not seeking pity, you're seeking their love and support.  The same love and support the used to give.  Let them know you are still the same person, just with a little more excitement in your life (smiling).  Remind them how special they are to you, don't be so quick to cut them loose.  After reaching out, In time (as someone mentioned), things will sort themselves out.  If your friends still don't attempt to at least call you, then you have your answer and you can save all your energy for your friends who are there for you.  Hope that helps. 'Makin Grossrees'  (phonetic spelling - heehee)  Any 'real' southerner knows all about Making Groceries (LOL)!  I was still saying it my 20's until I realized that was one of the ways people determined I was from (don't say it!) the country (oh nooooooo!).  I admit I don' hear it unless I'm around the ole folks who came up during my Grandma's time (she was 93 when she died and that 3 years ago).  We now say we're going to the store to shop or pick up some things.  We now have what my husband likes to call 'Eda-ma-ka--shun (thank you, thank you ..even with Cancer we still keep the jokes rolling!!). Chemocentric - I really do like that word!!! ginagina - Paraphrasing one of the most remarkable movies \"So it shall written, So it shall be done.\" Now who can guess what movie that was from and who made the statement? To Everyone - I have to go eat now and I know I've missed some of the posts, but I'll be on later tonight ... here's wishing you all a restful and as much sun as possible day! Hugs & Kisses, Raymon",

I've been suffering with SEs but hanging in there.  I get on the computer, get side-tracked with other stuff and then I just get tired and get off the computer without checking in with you all.  Tried to read posts but couldn't keep my eyes open.  Then I would wake up at unnatural hours and feel like a zombie.  My heart goes out to all who have been having a rough time.  I've been reading the posts about the taxol/taxotere and trying not to anticipate too much on my first tx.  I've been neglecting to drink enough water, but have been drinking a lot of juices and tea, going to the bathroom every hour, so I don't know if I should drink more or not.  Attempted to cook for myself today and managed to scald my right hand ... the one that already has lyphedema.  Needless to say I'm not a happy camper right now.  Fingers are sore, but I'm watching them to make sure they don't swell more.  I'm really not liking losing what little independence I have.  Want to go walking but that has become a challenge as well.  I'll try for 5 minutes again tomorrow.  Forgive me ... I don't usually like to complain this much, but I think I'm just a little frustrated at my lack of progress, nervous about the taxol and anxious about every new pain.  I could use a vacation right about now.  Thankfully we have a three day weekend, so I'll try to make the best of that time. I'm keeping you all in my thoughts and prayers. ",

Janet0527 - I had a hx of family cancer (no BC) and still did not officially hear about the BRCA test until my onc asked me to sign a paper stating whether or not I wanted it done.  There have been so many times when I'm feeling this process is moving so fast and sometimes my head starts to swim from all the information (did I mention my doctors all say I read too much ... LOL).  I'm just not looking forward to more surgery and recovery.  I hate being cooped up. rsdsboys - Welcome to the group!  Pickle141 gave you great advice, drink plenty of water and try to get your rest when your body tells you to... don't feel bad, quite a few of us are putting on the pounds at this point.  Doctors really don't recommend that you diet, so just make the best of it, eat when you have an appettite and deal with the pounds later towards the end of your journey. Buddy1 - Thank you for always bringing sunshine into my day. 5timewinner - I'm no doctor, but I'd get that foot checked out soon.  The last thing you want is an infection.  I know I've been having more numbness in my hands and tingling in my right foot lately, but I thought that wasn't supposed to happen yet.  It's hard keeping track of all these SEs and I'm tired of getting nervous everytime I get a new pain. Happy Mother's Day to all who have wiped a little nose, dried a litte tear, bandaged a little knee or shared their life, love and wisdom with a little one.  Always remember, you made the difference in someone's life. ",

Congratulations and good wishes CCBaby!!! Sakura - For the Taxol tx, I take 20 mg of Decadron and 150 mg of Ranitidine the day of and then 8mg of Decadron for two days after tx .. which are weekly.  Prior to that the dosage was higher during A/C part of the tx.  This doesn't include anything I may get during the actual tx and I have a terrible reaction to the pre-meds.  Since I lost the fluid right after taking her advice, I attribute it to the steriods and some of the processed meat, noodles and sodium that helped to increase my swelling.  I've been following the same advice and the swelling has gone down in my feet and ankles and I'm back to my pre-chemo weight.  However, the pain has not improved and has actually gotten worse.  I'm finding it very difficult to stand for even a short period of time, am getting short of breath quicker and even have pain while sitting.  The worst pain seems to concentrated on my right side, mid-section of my back.  The tingling in hands and feet drives me nuts, the hot flashes are worse and I'm having a harder time smiling when it hurts ... but it could be worse, so I'm going to continue sucking it up and moving forward.  Buddy1 - I'm on Taxol and \"Yes\" have the swollen feet and ankles, but keeping them elevated, watching my sodium intake, cutting back the steriods and increasing my water has helped immensely.  Just popped some pills and getting ready to hit the bed.  My onc did say if the pain pills she currently put me on are not doing the job, she would change the Rx.  I just want the pain to stop. Healing thoughts and good wishes to all and have a wonderful week!!!!!",

Our weather has been really great so far, so that means alot of folks are walking around sick and with sinus infections.  We start out with warm temps and by the early evening they've dropped.  It's driving me crazy cause I stay warm all the time, so I have to take a jacket even when I don't want to.  I have been avoiding going to the malls and even Wal-mart cause I don't want to be caught in the pre-christmas frenzy.  As for my health, I'm still discovering who's supposed to be responsible for what as it relates to my follow-up care.  I'm starting to feel like a beach ball cause I get passed around so much.  Found out I was supposed to have a six month bone scan in MAY!!  It wasn't ordered because one doctor thought the other doctor was handling it and vice versa ...grrrrrrr.  Supposedly we will attempt to get back on track next week.  Of course my fear is something being missed during this 'interim'.

MzMiller - The doctor said it appears we caught it early and at this point she will not have to do a mastectomy, just a lumpectomy to remove the two tumors.  This is pending the results to see if it has spread (her words). Leaf - I don't know how it can be diagnosed prior to the results except to say it is my understanding they can tell by the shape of the it (??).  One of the lumps, in my opinion is shaped exactly like the continent of Africa  and the other is so close to it ... it almost looks attached. Mumayan - I'm happy to say my husband was with me and will be going through this with me.  He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002 (had it removed).  Now part of me feels that's a good thing because he knows what I'm going thru, but the other part of knows he's kind of not the most sympathetic person in the world.  He believes the answer is to take everything out and then you won't have to deal with it anymore ... problem solved.  This is the man who feels he cured of cancer because he told them to take everything ...that means he does not do follow-up visits.  I'm happy to say he's more diligent when it comes to my healthcare, but he's got a lot of understanding to do and he has to realize that sometimes it's not so simple as to say 'take everything'. Now I'm back-tracking .... has anyone ever known a doctor who looked at the u/s and/or x-rays and was able to tell anything?  Again ... thank you to all of you.  I will continue to check in and as soon as I hear something this week I'll let you know.  The doctor said by Tuesday, so we shall see.",

I contacted my doctor's office because I didn't understand the test results.  Once they explained everything ... it turns out I'm triple negative.    I'm letting it all sink in and once again am out researching information.  I am also blessed to have a friend who going thru the same thing and have used her as a fountain of information.  I'm back to that overwhelmed feeling again, but I know it will pass.  My surgery is Friday morning, so I'll be sure to check in with you all.",

Thnank you all for the conitinuous prayers and support and I'll be back when I'm more coherent.",

      "Content": "Jan 29, 2009 08:57AM - edited Jan 29, 2009 09:01AM by Luv2sing Hi Amy.Jancie, Beth and Mumayan, I'm beginning to feel overwhelmed.  There are answers to questions I want to ask, but can't seem to gather my thoughts to ask the questions.  My sugery has been scheduled for Friday (2/6) and I'm not sure what my husband will need to do to help in my recovery.  I'm looking around my house trying to figure out what I'll need to be comfortable and the dust bunnies are attacking me .  They talking about doing additional biopsies prior to the surgery and are hoping to have the results of the MRI before then as well.  There is a strong possibility the cancer has spread, so I'm just not a happy camper right now.  Every time I touch my breast now, in my mind, I feel new lumps.  Will definitely ask for a refill on the Valium. ",

Thanks for the drain info, I'll be sure to ask Monday when I see the doctor.  My husband is being as supportive as most 'typical' males would be.  I'm trying to share information and reading material with him, but he seems to think if I read it and the doctor gives us a discharge summary that's enough.  I'm not knocking him, just trying to get him to understand I'm going to need a slightly different level of care then in my previous surgeries (he's been with me through an emergency appendectomy and hysterectomy).  He's a sweet person ... just all man.  A little too manly sometimes and doesn't always exercise a gentle touch.  I'm concerned he may not be as careful as he may need to be when assisting me .  I was concerned about the house until I read your post and realized how trivial that issue was...I'm going to do some shopping this afternoon with my list I compiled from all the suggestions I've read on the site. Question - Why does it seem the lumps are getting bigger?  Not just my imagination.  My husband can actually see it protruding from the side of my breast now.  Should I be more concerned?",
