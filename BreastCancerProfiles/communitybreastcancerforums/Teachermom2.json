I am devastated. I have two kids teen and preteen and I was trying to keep things normal. But I went in with horribly thin hair from previous treatments and I think my gig is up. I will attempt cold capping again tomorrow but if this continues there is no more hiding it. Do any of you know anyone who has maintained a decent amount with capping? Good news is after one cycle my TM's went from 133 to 105... so that's something. Especially since in the last two years I have been burning though treatments. I hope you all are feeling well!
