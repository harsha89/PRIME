    "Content": "DowntownJBrown wrote: I am currently awaiting results from a core biopsy I had done on Friday January 27th. While having the biopsy done the radiologist thought it best to put a marker in the suspicious area...I had no choice in this, or at least was not asked whether I wanted it in or not. My question is if this titanium clip is safe to be inside me, and did the radiologist put it in because she suspects the results will be bad and I will need surgery. Unfortunately I am not a newbie to this disease, my sister was diagnosed in '09 with breast cancer and has been through a very rough time. She is doing well now, but here we go again with more worry about breast cancer. Just looking for some answers while I wait for results. Any help would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
