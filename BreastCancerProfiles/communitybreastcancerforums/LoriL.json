But, that is something you definitely would NOT want to do postop as I'm sure that deep tissue massage probably increases the risk for damaging the lymph system. So, I would suggest getting an accurate diagnosis and then taking it from there. No, I don't have lymphedema. I just check out this forum every now and then as I'm trying to learn all I can to prevent it. :-) Best wishes to you!",

Have you by chance had any pressure or injury to your elbow? The ulner nerve lies along the inner side of the elbow, and if irritated will often cause pain in the pinkie finger and ring finger. A while back (before surgery) I had a tendon issue in my elbow (\"tennis elbow\") which caused my forearm to swell a tiny amount and my pinkie and ring fingers to tingle. Resting my elbow on a hard surface for a long time made it worse. Just a thought... ",

Ironically, I have an appointment with my Oncologist tomorrow, but wanted to get your input. Backround: bilat. mast 5/09, 2 sentinetl lymph nodes removed on left side, radiation to left side due to margins not wide enough, Bicycle injury to left side 7/10- torn open my left elbow. My elbow healed nicely, and I'm very active and have been doing yoga, weight lifting, running, cycling, etc. No signs of lymphedema anywhere.  About a month ago I had some pain in the palm of my left hand- felt like a bruise, but never any swelling. I thought maybe it was a soft tissue injury in my hand, as I felt it primarily when I lifted weights. I tried not to use it too much, and the pain went away after a few days. Now a few days ago I noticed the pain again when lifting weights. I had a quite challenging yoga class the following evening, but it didn't seem to cause pain in my hand. Yesterday, however, I noticed some visible swelling only in the palm of my hand. It again feels like a \"bruise\" in the center of the palm of my hand when I push on it. I should note that I tend to be quite prone to \"overuse\" athletic injuries, and have always been that way. My dad, sister and I get things like tendonitis/bursitis and other \"itis's\" at the drop of a hat. I'm also battling some knee issues where my knee swells up periodically from a tendonitis. :-( Anyway, just today it dawned on me that this might be lymphedema and not a soft tissue injury like I had suspected. Any thoughts? Would lyphedema feel like a \"bruise\" when I push on it? Would it be odd to have swelling only in the palm but not the fingers and not the wrist/arm/elbow/chest? Please help me...

My incision from the mastectomy stops at almost exactly where the mass was. On Friday I went in for simulation and tatoo placement. I didn't really get a chance to talk to the Radiation Oncologist at that time. He just came in briefly to show the Dosimetrist where she should mark my chest, and they she did the rest of the scanning and marking. I know that I'm probably just being paranoid, but I am really worried that they are going to completely miss radiating the area where the mass was because they are purposely avoiding the axillary area! If I look at the tatoo that is over on that side, and visually draw a perpendicular line up, the area where the cancer was is OUTSIDE of that line. Is this normal? Is the radiated area ONLY withint the tatoo markings, or is it outside of there as well?

I found out the type of radiation that I'll be receiving (3D), that it will be 5 weeks to the entire chest wall where the breast used to be and then an additional week to the suture line, and that the radiation field is not necessarily located between the tattos. The mass was right at the outer edge of the mastectomy suture line, so the boost to that area should cover it.  I think to further put my mind at ease I will have them show me exactly what that radiated area will be before we start. Thanks again, everyone! ",

Both my medical oncologist and radiation oncologist said that they prefer that Tamoxifen be NOT started during rads- for the same reason that Kleenex mentioned. They said that they don't want the Tamoxifen to subdue any possible cancer cells as the radiation will be better apt to kill it if it is \"active.\" From the research that I've read, this is an area of some controversary and ends up being more of a \"provider preference\" instead of any hard fast solid research to support it. ",

I've been very careful about avoiding injuries, blood draws, BP readings on that side and have never noticed any swelling of any nature.  Well, this past Wednesday I had a bicycle accident and badly injured my left elbow. They cleaned it out and stitched it up as best as they could, and so far it seems to be healing nicely. The ER doc said that I'm not out of the woods yet as far as possibly needing surgery to further remove gravel and dead tissue. I also have a good amount of \"road rash\" on my entire left arm. I'm diligently taking the high doses of antibiotic that I've been prescribed, keeping the wounds dressed with ointment and sterile gauze, and elevating and icing my arm on a regular basis. Is there anything else I should be doing to hopefully prevent lymphedema in this arm? Thanks much in advance! Bilateral Mastectomy without reconstruction 5/28/09; Oncotype Dx 16- no chemo; Close margins so 6 weeks of rads followed by Tamoxifen for 1.5 years (discontinued due to side effects) Dx 4/22/2009, ILC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
