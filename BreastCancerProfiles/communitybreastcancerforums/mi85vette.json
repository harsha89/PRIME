Always remember Cancer is fightable but that's up to you what and how you take care of it .My doctor called me while I was working and told me I had cancer in my right breast. I went to see that surgeon to see what my plan was to take care of it. I then asked if I could get a second opinion. VERY IMPORTANT !!! The results may be the same but atleast you have other options and the care plan may be different and might mean saving your life...I was given a book called Breast caner treatment by one of my doctors and ill tell you that book was my bible, I recommend that to EVERYONE !! It has everything you need to know about treatments and the options, all the medicines they use for Chemotherapy and what they do with side effects if any. All the treatments they use or options are explained with pictures, Every step I went through with my care was in this book and explained all of it, I was so informed I knew exactly what was coming and how it would go down, made it much more do able for me. I am now 1 year cancer free and on my arimidex for hormone therapy. After I was told I had cancer on 1 side my second opinion doctor recommended a MRI and glad she did because they found 2 tumors on my left side that the mammo gram did not pick up, so I had a double lumpectomy and I chose to keep my breast because I was told either way I had a 50 - 50 chance of it not coming back so I stayed conservative and decided not to remove them. Good choice I believe and after radiation my scars look really good and the chemo wasn't as bad as I thought it would be...They give you medicine so you don't get sick which helps a lot.. You will lose your hair but that's about all that happened to me.. I forget sometimes but that will go away they said, cant wait for that to happen..lol Hold your head up and be strong, you can do this and make sure you have a good set of doctors cause you will have many and listen to them, they are there to help you. The drugs they have out there now days are so different then way back when and they help make this ride much easier for most !!!! It sucks having to spend so much time at the doctors but in the end it will be worth it.....My 1st year flew by so fast I had 111 doctor visits and now its every 6 months...Hang in there and be STRONG !!!!!! You can do this !!!!!!",
