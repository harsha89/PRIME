I have been using websites such as this one to educate myself, but the information I seek the most I cant seem to find.  Before any of you were diagnosed did your doctors order blood tests for \"tumor markers\"?  My surgeon did and the only information I can find on these tests (CA-29-27 and CEA) is that they are run for those who have already been diagnosed with bc.  This is the last piece of information I'd like to have before I go into surgery so if anyone can help I'd greatly appreciate it!",
