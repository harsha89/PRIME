I had a mammogram back in December and everything was fine, however, I have dense breasts and a family history so she recommended the breast MRI. For about two weeks my left breast has been feeling weird, kind of heavy and pain that comes and goes, it is not consistent. I also have pain under my arm but I am not able to feel a lump. I do have pain that radiates down my left arm and across my shoulders into my neck. I tend to have neck and shoulder issues because I have a desk job and am on the compute all day so that didn't concern me until I googled. The biggest thing that scares me is a couple of nights ago I noticed blue veins on my breast which I had never noticed. I have called my doctor and have an appointment on Monday for a breast exam. I have made myself a nervous wreck because these symptoms all point to IBC. The good thing is I have no redness, itchyness or discharge. Just wondering if anyone else has ever had this. I am 53 and was wondering if some of this could be menopause related. Log in to post a reply",
