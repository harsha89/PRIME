I didn't have tattoes but I can imagine that one in the middle would hurt...yikes! I'm glad that you were able to get the time you wanted. My first day the girl asked me how I was and I answered I was nervous and she said I shouldn't be, it wasn't a big deal, and it doesn't hurt. I wanted to ask her if she had ever had radiation but I didn't. I think burning my skin and exposing my breast, heart, and lung to radiation is a big deal, and from what I've read, at some point it may very well hurt.  So I'm pretty quiet when I go in. Today was quick...I was there for only 15 minutes which counted waiting, changing,and treatment. I'm just gritting my teeth and wanting to get it over with too.",

My doctor is different in that she has you get the WBRs and then gives you a two week break before the boosts. I finshed the WBRs on July 28th and the next week my skin got worse and the soreness increased and then it rapidly started to improve. I started my boosts on August 15th and the rad techs were amazed at how well my skin looked. I finished my boosts yesterday and the only pink I have left is the boost area. It is feeling a bit stingy and burning a little but definitely bearable.

One down, 30 to go!! I thought I was doing great dealing with having to have the radiation treatments but yesterday it hit me and I got all emotional and had some crying jags. My poor husband was so wonderful. He called into work this morning and told them he would be late so that he could go with me to my first treatment. Definitely made it easier though I know he can't do it everyday. Thank you for the great list GmaFoley...that will be a big help. I had lost 11 pounds this spring before my diagnosis but I have gained a few back this past month...stress eating, I suppose. I guess I'll have to be careful through radiation though no one told me at the RO's office that I shouldn't lose weight. I hope all of you ladies have a blessed day!",

I have two more WBR treatments this week and then I get a break until August 15th when I'll start getting my 8 boosts. It seems I have an old-fashioned RO that likes to give you a break inbetween to give the skin time to heal. My rads techs were telling me that many people at first complain because they want to get finished but after it happens, they're glad they had the break. They said the skin does much better. They explained how the skin keeps getting worse for around 5-7 days after you finish treatment which I hadn't realized so I am really looking forward to the break. It is so nice to have these forums to read and write on. If I write anything about being tired or such on facebook, my friends and family are calling me and offering to bring dinner and then I never get any sleep...hehe....",

It may sound crazy but it's true. I hate the fact that the radiation is hitting my lung and my heart and that I'm going to probably be turning red soon and possibly being burned. I really hate the thought of the possibilities with the hormonal treatment.

Where I go, the doctor can order a screening mammo that takes several days to get a result or they can order a diagnostic mammo where you get the results right away. I don't know if it's different in Canada. My doctor never ordered a diagnostic one unless there was a concern on their part. And I'm glad you're talking to the doctor about your depression/anxiety. Hopefully, the meds he gives you will help!",

A friend of ours had that test done, and they sent him immediately to the hospital because they knew there was a problem....no going home first! My FIL also had that test done and the doctor called within minutes of him arriving home and told him to get to the hospital so in my experience, they usually act quickly if the techs see something they don't like.",
