My grade was I, but only by a smidge.  I think one more notch on one of those characteristics and it would have been 2 (my DCIS was grade 2).  Our pathologies are fairly similar other than the PR status and of course size. Thanks for sharing the info about my what the plan would be prior to the Oncotype data.  That is good to know and I didn't really know what the standard of care was prior to having this additional info.  I'm signed up with a super Onc, Dr. George Sledge, really a leader in breast cancer so I'm lucky he is here in Indy.  I meet with him on Feb 20.  Regarding your question on recurrence vs residual tumor..... don't really know.  I think my surgeon was sweating bullets initally since he hasn't seen this too much.  From this past lumpectomy, he ended up taking the skin and everything down to the muscle under the biopsy area, plus he scraped underneath the skin beyond that area and sent it all for pathology.  They did an incredibly thorough job of inking with four different colors and sliced the sample 3 times over what they usually do.  They found NO native breast cells in that sample.  Doc was relieved to know he did a \"good mastectomy\" and I think to me, that still leaves the question open as to if it recurred or was left behind. You would think it could be residual if found with breast cells.  A good question for my Oncologist.  Regarding the nodes, 1 was removed in 2007 and 5 more removed last month.  All were clear so that was a big relief.  I think my \"issue\" is, I no longer trust the odds.  During the initial investigation, follow up, biopsy, I kept hearing \"9 times out of 10 this is nothing\".  I kept being that dang 1 of 10. Then with this recurrence, I hear it happens 1% of the time.  So now I'm the 1 out of 100.  I don't want to be the \"1\" anymore.   I'm sure all of us relate to that.  Even having a low Oncotype score and having a 5-10% recurrence rate, I think I'll be thinking about this the rest of my life!  At least I'll be vigilant about paying attention and thank god I was paying attention when I found that tiny lump!  Thanks for listening and your advice.  p.s.  Yes, I still feel fortunate this is an early non-aggressive cancer.  I'm still one of the lucky ones here.
