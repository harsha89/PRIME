So unexpected considering I haven't had more than a minute of it here and there. I have Zofran, Compazine and Ativan on hand. I have been using Ativan to help me sleep. Today I tried Zofran for the nausea and it barely helped. Has anyone tried Compazine? Does it work? Does it make you sleepy? Thanks for any advise. I don't know what I would do without this website.",

The good news is that the Claritin DID help with the bone pain that kept me in bed for 3 days after TX#1. I still had bone pain but it was manageable and did not keep me in bed. The bloating was worse and so was the fatigue and weakness. One new symptom this time is dizziness. My onc had me come in today for 2 hrs of hydration. My BP is very low and my pulse is very high (racing heart). They said high pulse is my body/heart working overtime to compensate for low BP. They want me back in tmrw for more hydration and think that the low BP/high pulse is dehydration. Feeling depressed now and having a hard time seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, even though I know it's there....it better be after all this S&%T!! Boy, this stinks!! Sorry for venting....party of one.... Has anyone experienced low BP/high heart rate??",

I had four rounds of TC and after each round my brows thinned more and more. 3 weeks after the last treatment they were down to a single line of hair and I HATED it. It changed my whole face and I looked sick. Luckily my wig has bangs so they did a good job of covering up. Nothing grew in for 4 weeks then...five o'clock shadow, then stubble and 2 weeks later I had to have them waxed and shaped. Now they look like I never lost them.  The eyelashes went too in the same pattern although when they fell the new short ones were right behind so I never looked like I didn't have lashes. Before mine fell they got VERY long, it seems because they were being pushed out. The eyelash situation did not bother me at all. Some woman on this forum have said that they fall out again at 4/5 months but I have read many posts were woman did not experience loss a second time...so we shall see. ",

I had a custom human hair wig made that looks amazing (hard to tell its not a wig) The wig stays on with five adhesive strips (3 along my hair line and 2 along the back of my neck. Problem is that every time I take it off the adhesive strips pull out more and more of my five oclock shadow stubble and OUCH! The wigmaker said that eventually all those hairs will be gone and my scalp will be completely bald and smooth so the tape will not hurt BUT what about when my hair starts to grow back?? I don't want the tape to pull out whatever new hair is trying to com back. Is it true that all the stubble will fall out too??  Has anyone experienced something like this before??  Thanks for any input. ",

I get so many compliments on my hair... it's crazy....and from strangers! It looks like an intentionally VERY short pixie. Felt so great to put away the wig...in the back of a drawer. Today I bought a few pairs of new earrings, necklaces and scarves to accessorize and make my look more feminine. I'm actually looking forward to the different stages and styles that my hair will grow into. For all of you waiting for the hair growth, it will come back and it will surprise you how fast it grows. Each week I notice a difference. I will post pics. Feel good everyone!",
