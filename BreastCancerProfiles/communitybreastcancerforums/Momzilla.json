I had a routine mammogram this month and was called back for additional spot magnification mammogram pictures because a 'loose grouping of microcalcifications' was observed. I got the second mammogram done and was told I had calcifications and that a biopsy was recommended. My internist was out of the office that day, so he couldn't be reached for an order. The imaging center would call him that next Monday and set up the appointment for a stereotactic biopsy. The nurse gave me a brochure for the biopsy and told me not to worry. Easier said... :-) The biopsy is now scheduled for this coming Monday and I just received the report. NO Bi Rad score. 'Findings: ...cluster of microcalcifications are redemonstrated and appear to be somewhat pleomorphic and amorphous in appearance. These likely extend over approximately 7 x 11 x 10 mm. Given the appearance and the fact that these are new stereotactic biopsy is recommended. Impression: 1. Cluster of microcalcifications in the upper outer mid left breast. Stereotactic biopsy is recommended. The results were given to the patient.' I am 52, have five sons whom I nursed. My mother is a long-time breast cancer survivor. She was diagnosed at the age of 57. I have had a biopsy proven fibroadenoma in my opposite breast, as well as calcifications which were watched, but did not change. I have 'densities' in both breasts. Any thoughts or ideas to calm me for the weekend?! :-) Thanks!! Blessings, Momzilla Log in to post a reply",
