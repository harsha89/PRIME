Immediately I was concerned, but considering that I already had an (unrelated) appointment with my PCP scheduled... I continued on with my daily life. Two weeks later my PCP ordered an ultrasound, which I unfortunately missed due to sick step children. It didn\u2019t happen over night but from here I completely blew off the lump as \u201cunimportant\u201d and \u201cdefinitely a just cyst anyway\u201d. I mean... I\u2019m only 21 right? Fast forward to last week, laying in bed. I won\u2019t lie and say that there aren\u2019t points in my day that I don\u2019t enjoy just touching my own breasts - luckily (or unluckily maybe) this act lead into into a self exam... where I felt two more, smaller lumps. The next morning I rescheduled my ultrasound and there they were. I have three lumps ranging in size from about 1.2 - 3.4cm and two swollen lymph nodes.... and now I am officially scared. They haven\u2019t given me any indication of whether they believe it\u2019s cancer or not, but we have scheduled a CN biopsy for the 16th. I do wish I would have followed through we the initial evaluation... goes to show that age doesn\u2019t always mean something Log in to post a reply",
