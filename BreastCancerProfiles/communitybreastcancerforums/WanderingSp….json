I edited my 1st post because for some reason I missed the part where she said she's already on Fentanyl.",

They GREATLY help the pain!!! And they don't have the weird side effects of pills. The medicine is released slowly into your skin. I started with 12 mcg patches and now wear a 25 mcg. My mets are in the bones (a LOT of bones) which is pretty painful. I don't know what I'd do without these patches! Edited: apparently I missed the part that you are already on Fentanyl. Thanks Romansma for pointing that out. I just had my first Faslodex shots today and I'm a little out of it! Sorry! ",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2015 05:49PM WanderingSpirit wrote: I found it. Hi All. Well chemo could not be delayed so I had my first chemo of Carbo/Abraxane this morning. I remember I DID see my dr. in June, I forgot about that. And the Pet Scan was in April and fine for the liver. Dr. wanted to give Faslodex a chance to work in May,June and July and I had a long vacation planned from June 28 to July 6. So I told him to wait on the PET scan till I got back. My mistake. He did the TM test the week I came back in July and the markers were so high he called me himself and told me he ordered the PET for that same week. So he got right on it. Then he called me himself about the PET scan. He was very honest and I asked if he could operate on the liver and he said it wouldn't do any good because I have multiple lesions, one being pretty big and very active. Well today the chemo nurse got the PET results and I read them. So now I know. It was very scary. I have a 1.1 x 1.1 lesion that is \"intense\" and \"avid\" high on the dome of the liver (this is all from the Radiologist). I have another 1 cm lesion on another section of my liver. And on the back side I also have a 8 mm lesion. Those 2 are not \"FGD\" which I was told tonight means not active- yet. And apparently I have more than that, that are too small yet. My oncologist said this was not \"sudden\" like I thought. Because my bone mets kept lighting up and my TMs kept rising despite all the hormonal treatments, which he wanted to try first to not \"burn out\" all my chemos too soon. I had the onc. call me tonight. He explained that the lesions were probably there and not visible last PET scan in April and this was not as rapid as I believed. And that only 1, the big one was \"active\" which was called \"avid\". The other too, FGD, he says means not lighting up. He said he had to start the most aggressive chemo he could right away because not only was my liver lighting up, the report that I read also said I had more bone lesions that HAD been calmed down, lighting up again, some pretty bad. The bad ones were neck, upper left arm, upper left thigh, and Sacrum. I also have had some that aren't lighting up again in my spine, ribs, skull, pelvis, and I forget where else. In other words, my bone lesions are extensive. He answered all my questions and I know he's doing the best he can. I called when first DX'd to a \"hot shot\" dr. in Charlotte that is in the same big group but in another hospital. That one reviewed all my charts and told me that my dr. was following the protocol he would. So Duke would be the only other option. However, I have now had one chemo done. I forgot all about asking him about if my cancer has changed. I will call back tomorrow and tell them to check however they can. Maybe one of the posters is right (I'm sorry I got lost in your names, I'm fuzzy now) and they can't biopsy? Crap. I forgot. My pleural effusion on my right lung that I had at the beginning and they drew off (almost a full liter with cancer cells in June 2013) now shows a slight increase too. And I have a slight increase in my pericardial effusion. The onc. had a cardiologist look at my heart early this year and he said he didn't think the peridcardial effusion looked cancerous on the tests. The onc. tonight explained about my pleural effusion,he said yes, I do have the cancer cells in the lining, but NOT in the lungs. So I guess, I'm a mess. And it's my fault for ignoring all those aches and pains in 2012 when it probably came back as stage IV. I wasn't honest with my onc on my visits. I kept thinking it was from \"old age\" or arthritis. Stupid me.",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2014 07:25AM - edited Feb 28, 2014 07:28AM by WanderingSpirit Star, in May of 2001 I had my cervix and uterus removed for fibroids, def not cancerous. In  October 2002 I got diagnosed stage IIIa breast cancer (shock!). I was ER+, PR-, Her2- (and still am).  I had a lumpectomy, 8 rounds of chemo (4 A/C, 4 Taxotere), and 33 rads. Then I spent 5 years on Arimidex. In 2004 I had my ovaries removed because I didn't want to risk anything that could produce yet more estrogen that I clearly didn't need! In 2013 I was DXed with stage IV after going from 2002 to 2013 \"cancer free\" (well it may have come back stage IV in 2011 or 12, we'll never know,  but that's still a long time). My onc put me right back on Arimidex (actually the generic this time, Anastrazole) on June 28, 2013. I am still on that today, with Xgeva shots I started last October. It is beating the cancer down. Last Friday my PET scan showed NO active cancer cells anywhere. I still have some slight effusion around my rt lung and heart, but nothing else. Tumor markers are still high at 134 but last June they were 898 (and dropped dramatically every 2 months) and I lit up like a Christmas tree on the July 2nd Pet scan (lesions and cancer on my skull, sternum, ribs, spine, pelvis, tailbone, upper left arm). So in just 7 1/2 months that little pill has put me into ALMOST remission. My onc won't say remission until my tumor markers drop, and he says they may never drop to the normal range of 0-40. So he's excited about the PET scan and okay with the markers at \"stable\" (they dropped 1 point from October). Don't discount Arimidex/Anastrazole. BUT I would say ask your doctor about an ooverectomy. You don't really need your ovaries do you? All they are doing is producing MORE estrogen that any drug has to fight. Removing them doesn't remove all estrogen because unfortunately, the heavier you are the more estrogen your body will produce from the fat cells! And I think adrenal glands may produce some estrogen as well. But if you can take out a big factor in estrogen production, I'd go for it. My dr. feels I made the right decision in getting mine out. Easy operation, outpatient and laparoscopic. Oh- another thing. I saw my onc. Tuesday and he said that if I were to go off medication, I could expect the cancer to come back pretty soon, and possibly MUCH worse!!! Don't take chances, please.",

Is that worse? I had pleural effusion in June 2013, which is how they found that my cancer had come back as stage IV. My dr. said the fluid (they drained 900ml) had cancer cells in it and that's how he diagnosed me as \"Stage IV\" I did have the fluid drained immediately and only a SMALL amount has ever returned. I was unaware that malignant fluid is a \"death sentence\" pretty quickly, if this is what you are trying to say? Should I be even more worried? My last visit, Feb 2014, he was still pleased because no bone mets were lighting up at all but he did say that I still had some \"fluid around your heart\". And I said My HEART? It thought it was always my right lung? And he said \"it's all one area\". YIKES. HELP!",

Of course, I still have stage IV breast cancer & that's still incurable in modern medicine. My tumor markers are merely \"stable\". They only went down 1 point after huge drops last year & I'm still in the higher than normal range. Normal's 0-40 & mine is 134. The dr.said mine may always be high due to how extensive the bone metastasis was last year. However, there's the PET scan. Last year I lit up like a Christmas tree with active cancer in my skull, sternum, spine, ribs, pelvis, tailbone & upper left arm. I had positive lymph nodes in my chest & pleural effusion on my right lung but my organs were clear. I was put on Arimidex & then Xgeva shots to strengthen my bones. The 2nd scan in October showed no positive lymph nodes, minimal effusion & \"significant regression\" in all but the tailbone & upper left arm. This past Friday's scan shows NO active cancer AT ALL anywhere. Nothing lit up. Nothing! The doctor can't say \"remission\" (& may never say that) because of the tumor markers being up. But he did say this PET scan was \"damn good news\" & he never uses that language! So for now, I'm taking the great PET scan & the stable tumor markers & I'm happy. He did say that there is some mild effusion around the right lung still (this time he included \"right lung and heart\") but he says this is not  lighting up and he is not concerned and neither is the radiologist. This next part you can skip if you are offended by Christians but I have to say it: I still believe in miracles from the Holy Trinity & I still have faith!",

I have never been on anything but Arimidex since my DX last June. The dr. feels that I'm getting good results so he won't change a thing. He just added the Xgeva to it to strengthen my bones he said. At the request of my husband's \"step daughter in law\" who also has bone mets (she just has one spot and was DXed with Stage IV at the outset) I consulted with a \"hot shot\" doctor in the next, bigger city. I didn't see him but called his nurse. They are all part of HUGE hospital/medical conglomerate here where I am (North Carolina, U.S.A.) so he was able to see all my scans. This was last July. He gave a message to his nurse who relayed it to me and said that he agreed with my dr, and would see me if I wanted, but he \"wouldn't change a thing\" regarding my treatment. This helped me too. Oh- I am on a 25 mcg Fentanyl patch for pain (since last September) and I take oxycodone for breakthrough pain (but not much). Tonight I just had a medical massage on my back, that helps, when I can afford it I indulge. Please keep your replies coming because I was feeling like I was the only with bone mets this bad.

Every time I have a panic attack, he's not there. So his nurse read it to me \"Small pericardial effusion and small pleural effusion around right lung that had decreased\". I told her I know NOTHING about the Pericardial effusion. She said they don't normally worry so much about that and don't normally test that. I asked if this meant I had Progression anyway, or something bad and she said she can't say anything because she isn't sure!!! So since Feb I have ASSumed I'm doing fine! Now I have to wait till next week when the onc comes back! She only said they see this \"sometimes\" and it doesn't \"always\" mean cancer cells in the fluid or something bad or progression. Great!

Then Wednesday night my head was COVERED in a red rash and itchy, burning red bumps. I saw my onc's PA on Thursday who wasn't concerned, gave me a RX for Keflex for 7 days, and told me to put hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl on my head. It's now Saturday night and no change. I was told not to wear anything on my head. I look like Frankenstein. My onc is very busy according to his staff, I feel that they think I'm whining. I go this Monday for my 2nd cycle of chemo, 3 weeks on, 1 off. What should I do? My head is painful, itchy and embarassing. I look and feel terrible. Maybe I should see my primary doctor because my onc is really, really busy and it's expensive to see him. My specialist copay is $70 per visit, and I already see him about once a month. I have insurance but it's not good. We are going broke paying the out of pocket expenses and dr. visits don't even count towards the out of pocket. Plus the meds, prescribed and OTC. I just don't know what to do. I can't sleep, I don't want to go out, I am so depressed and it's Saturday night. I can't go to the ER,my copay is $233 plus 20% of the bill! Has anyone had this problem with their scalp? When I had cancer years ago I lost my hair in clumps on A/C and shaved my head once and no problems at ALL. Thanks",

I got all my dental work done before I began Xgeva and had a month of no problems at all afterward before my oral surgeon allowed me to start. My oncologist  never said Xgeva was a \"cure\" for bone mets. I even re-read my original post. I simply asked if it was healing my bones, because he did say that Xgeva was to \"strengthen\" the bones, which to me means a \"healing\" of sorts. I apologize if some of you took that to mean that my oncologist calls Xgeva a \"cure\". There is no cure for stage IV breast cancer or bone mets or anything,  he's told me that many, many times. There are only drugs we can be put on to prolong our lives. So Xgeva is working for my bones because they are getting stronger and the \"holes\" where the cancer was attached to seem to be improving from what I've been told. Stronger bones is a great thing for anyone. Very little spots were lighting up now on the PET scan in February compared to the one in October and the initial one in July. I had thought the onc said \"nothing\" was lighting up but last week the nurse practitioner told me that I misunderstood, that \"some\" spots (pelvic area and tail bone) still had a \"dull\" light not a bright one.  Apparently they take that to mean healing has taken place and is still going on, and the onc continues to tell me this is \"great news\" and the Arimidex is working.",

So Dr. cancelled Faslodex, I had a medport put in yesterday. now chemo starts Monday. New Pet Scan this week showed 1 spot high on the dome of my liver lighting up, and multiple smaller spots not lighting up. Some bones lighting up again. He's going for Carboplatin/Abraxane, which no one here has had in that combo! 3 weeks on, 1 off, indefinitely. I asked about operating on my liver, he said it wouldn't work (I guess too many spots?). I haven't seen him since May, and won't until the end of August. Now I read here about liver biopsy, which he's never mentioned. About things \"changing\". What changes?

What is liver ablation? I'm having zero luck finding anything out. I'm just getting ready for my chemo the day after tomorrow. And I just read to \"insist\" on a liver biopsy BEFORE chemo?

Around here, there is ONE group in my city and ONE group in the next largest city and they are ALL under the same big group! ONE hospital swallowed up 2 other hospitals years ago and took over ALL the doctor offices! So going to another onc will solve nothing. They will not disagree with each other. I would have to drive 3 hours to find the nearest large hospital, which is Duke University. I'm in North Carolina near Charlotte now. A 3 hour drive every week is just not financially possible for me and my husband cannot take time off. I have NO ONE else to help me. I am currently on disability from work because of the terrible pain from the bone mets. I wear a Fentanyl patch of 25 mcg 24/7",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2015 08:42PM - edited Jul 27, 2015 08:48PM by WanderingSpirit Hi All. Well chemo could not be delayed so I had my first chemo of Carbo/Abraxane this morning. I remember I DID see my dr. in June, I forgot about that. And the Pet Scan was in April and fine for the liver. Dr. wanted to give Faslodex a chance to work in May,June and July and I had a long vacation planned from June 28 to July 6. So I told him to wait on the PET scan till I got back. My mistake. He did the TM test the week I came back in July and the markers were so high he called me himself and told me he ordered the PET for that same week. So he got right on it. Then he called me himself about the PET scan. He was very honest and I asked if he could operate on the liver and he said it wouldn't do any good because I have multiple lesions, one being pretty big and very active. Well today the chemo nurse got the PET results and I read them. So now I know. It was very scary. I have a 1.1 x 1.1 lesion that is \"intense\" and \"avid\" high on the dome of the liver (this is all from the Radiologist). I have another 1 cm lesion on another section of my liver. And on the back side I also have a 8 mm lesion. Those 2 are not \"FGD\" which I was told tonight means not active- yet. And apparently I have more than that, that are too small yet. My oncologist said this was not \"sudden\" like I thought. Because my bone mets kept lighting up and my TMs kept rising despite all the hormonal treatments, which he wanted to try first to not \"burn out\" all my chemos too soon. I had the onc. call me tonight. He explained that the lesions were probably there and not visible last PET scan in April and this was not as rapid as I believed. And that only 1, the big one was \"active\" which was called \"avid\". The other too, FGD, he says means not lighting up. He said he had to start the most aggressive chemo he could right away because not only was my liver lighting up, the report that I read also said I had more bone lesions that HAD been calmed down, lighting up again, some pretty bad. The bad ones were neck, upper left arm, upper left thigh, and Sacrum. I also have had some that aren't lighting up again in my spine, ribs, skull, pelvis, and I forget where else. In other words, my bone lesions are extensive. He answered all my questions and I know he's doing the best he can. I called when first DX'd to a \"hot shot\" dr. in Charlotte that is in the same big group but in another hospital. That one reviewed all my charts and told me that my dr. was following the protocol he would. So Duke would be the only other option. However, I have now had one chemo done. I forgot all about asking him about if my cancer has changed. I will call back tomorrow and tell them to check however they can. Maybe one of the posters is right (I'm sorry I got lost in your names, I'm fuzzy now) and they can't biopsy? Crap. I forgot. My pleural effusion on my right lung that I had at the beginning and they drew off (almost a full liter with cancer cells in June 2013) now shows a slight increase too. And I have a slight increase in my pericardial effusion. The onc. had a cardiologist look at my heart early this year and he said he didn't think the peridcardial effusion looked cancerous on the tests. The onc. tonight explained about my pleural effusion,he said yes, I do have the cancer cells in the lining, but NOT in the lungs. So I guess, I'm a mess. And it's my fault for ignoring all those aches and pains in 2012 when it probably came back as stage IV. I wasn't honest with my onc on my visits. I kept thinking it was from \"old age\" or arthritis. Stupid me.",

      "Content": "Jul 28, 2015 06:15PM - edited Jul 28, 2015 06:17PM by WanderingSpirit Thank you all so much. I called my onc back today and talked to the nurse. She spoke to him (he's on call today and super busy) but answered all my questions about \"status change\" and the nurse wrote it down this time,lol. He said when I was first Dx'd with mets in 2013, they drew fluid from the lining of my right lung, almost a liter. The cells tested were exactly the same as they were when I had breast cancer and a breast tumor in 2002. ER+, PR-, Her2-. And I had lesions all through my bones at the same time. So I really had 2 mets back in 2013! He said when mets first appear that's when status usually changes and that's why he hasn't tested the liver, which is brand new. He said it's unlikely my status would now change after having pleural effusion and bone mets. And that he didn't want to put my liver and body through a biopsy that wouldn't do any good and instead could harm me. I'm 56 and the mets are now in my pleura, bones and liver. :( But he is glad I research and question and will always answer any question I have and discuss treatments and options with me. I feel much better now. He's on a well deserved vacation next week, and I see him on August 17th so I can wait. He said if I have any concerns while he's gone, to tell his nurse and the on call dr. can help unless it can wait till he returns. He's in his 40's and a former Army doctor. His specialty is hematology oncology but he's a whiz at breast cancer as well. He gave me many years when I was stage IIIA back in 2002 that no one expected me to have, by the way he treated me. I'm also on edge because most don't know me, so you don't know this. I have 3 wonderful children: a daughter who's 30, married with 3 children (my grands) ages 1, 3 and 5. A son who would have been 23 in May and a daughter who turned 21 in May. I love them all dearly as they are the best children you could ever ask for and the nicest, kindest people you'd ever want to meet. They were with me during my first cancer, I was a single mom for 9 1/2 years before I remarried in 2011. Last year, my son and youngest daughter who were both in college moved out together into a house their father, my ex, rented to them. Well when my son was 22 years, 2 months, 3 weeks and 6 days old, on August 1st, 2014, he had a terrible accident when he was home alone and passed away. This Saturday marks one year since he went to Heaven. He is my heart. He is a great son, never gave me a minute's trouble, and was graduating college in December with a degree in Anthropology. He was going on to get his master's as well as work for the FBI. He had 2 classes to take in the fall, just 4 credit hours, and they were electives. Instead he never made it. The university awarded his degree posthumously last December under the provision they have for this. If a student has good grades (he was 3.6), and is so close to graduating (he had completed 116 of the 120 hours required) and was in good standing (his professors praised him), they award the degree. His father and I accepted on his behalf. He earned every bit of that degree. That's not the reason I miss him, not for his intelligence which he had in abundance. I miss him for HIM. He is the kindest, sweetest, most loving, most compassionate, funniest, wittiest, finest man I have EVER known. I will miss him every second until the day I die, when I know I will see his handsome, smiling face again. So excuse my nervousness over this stupid liver mets thing. I have already endured the worst thing anyone ever could. I am not saying this to get sympathy, but to explain my jumpiness, and to honor the best man I will ever meet, my son Josh. So this cancer is really \"no big thing\" in the scheme of my entire life now. Thank you all for your kindness. Wanda",

I was in a car accident last November, a lady rear ended us VERY hard. My husband was driving and as the passenger, my shoulder belt  caught me somewhat. I've thought that this bony knot was the result of my accident. Now I'm wondering. I don't plan on stopping Xgeva because it with the Arimidex (which I started June 28 last year) seems to be working for all the bone mets. I have been wondering if the Xgeva is causing me to gain weight. Since beginning it last October, I just keep gaining weight although nothing else has changed. I wonder now if the Xgeva is causing such a thickening of bones it's making me weigh more? Or it could be that  I'm just getting fatter, lol. Anyone else with weird SEs from Xgeva? Thanks for starting this thread kshammond1!",
