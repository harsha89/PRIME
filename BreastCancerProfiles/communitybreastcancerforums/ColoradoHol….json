I have completed 2/6 cycles of neoadjuvant TCHP and am already wanting to quit. The side effects (nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, lack of appetite/taste issues, weight loss, and just generally feeling like crap) linger for me for up to 10 days after a treatment. I hate being confined to the bed or couch all day. I'm normally very athletic and this regimen has basically shut me down. I've just started experiencing neuropathy in my fingertips. I'm seriously depressed and cannot imagine doing this four more times!!! I've noticed major shrinkage of my tumor but it isn't completely gone. I really just want to have surgery and get this over with, I want the cancer removed from my body! I'm seriously conflicted and don't know what to do. Some days I just resign myself to the fact that my cancer is going to come back regardless (I'm young, HER2+, and already have it in my lymph nodes), so why bother completing this regimen and suffering the quality of life issues. I guess this post is really more venting than anything productive. I'm just not sure what to do!  Holly  ",
