My freaking stomach looks like I am eight months pregnant. There has to be a better way. Also the skin under my breast is inflamed all summer. When I was going through radiation I felt like I was in Frankenstein's lab. Am I the only one who is so bitter about this bitch of a diagnosis and the treatment that was required? I feel like my life ended the day I was told you have triple positive breast cancer. No man would want to be with me,a can and can you blame them. ",

      "Content": "Aug 10, 2018 04:53AM - edited Aug 10, 2018 04:55AM by 814911 This is interesting information. The skin around and under my breast got terribly blistered and burned. I often develop a rash and irritation as a result of the radiation. A lipoma formed in my upper arm shortly after the removal of lymph nodes and lumpectomy. I also developed a frozen shoulder on the side of the lumpectomy. The orthopedic surgeon told me it was a result of the breast cancer surgery. I have just started PT shoulder is thawing. I think the worst part of this treatment is now feeling like a fat slob as a result of the tamoxifen. I'm tearful all the time, I can't sleep, and often feel irritated. ",
