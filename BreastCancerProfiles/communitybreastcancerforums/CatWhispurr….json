I hope it works, if not, let me know.   I have only been taking it since Monday, but so far, I feel good.  They will retest my blood next Monday.   http://forum.tnbcfoundation.org/milk-thistle-and-elevated-liver-enzymes_topic7803.html I found a great document on the American Cancer website to keep track of side effects.  I started using them yesterday and plan to take them with me when I see my MO at the next chemo so we can go over it together and talk about any of it.  It helps to write it down each day so you don't forget what happened/when.    You can find it at  http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@nho/documents/document/acsq-009502.pdf",

Sleepless - I did see that study from years ago and I think that is why they don't do taxol every three weeks anymore.   What I am trying to figure out is why/who decided DDx4 (every 2 weeks) is better or as good as 12 weeklies.   All in all, you are getting only 8 weeks worth of taxol not 12 weeks too.   It is interesting that a few people and studies are now getting DDx6 cycles which would be the same as 12 weeklies.

BarbDenise- Taxol hit me really hard too, especially the first dose.  It got a little better after that.   I felt the same way after the first dose - that I couldn't go on.   Thankfully, it got better, except the neuropathy in my feet.  So, hang in there and come here to vent or get support.    I also have nodes in my neck, sternum, supraclavicles and lungs.  I usually felt crummy on days 3-5.  Taking oxycotin really helped. Are you taking anything for pain? What kind of schedule are you on?  I was supposed to get taxol 3 weeks on, one week off, but since my nodules weren't going down much, I ended up getting weekly taxol for 18 weeks when progression of my neck nodules happened.  The rest of my nodules did go down during the treatment.  Hope you get good results to make the misery worthwhile.  When do you get scans?",

I think it is a one of those that all of us will probably get at one time so please keep us posted about se. Hope it is gentle on you. I got the results of my brain MRI and I've had a good, but not total, response. There are 3 lesions left but very reduced in size, 0.8x0.9 cm, 5 mm, 3 mm. My rad doc called today and said he wanted to do a \"boost\" on those spots tomorrow. I said yes, but have a call into my onc because I finally chose a trial I want to get into at UAB (Birmingham). I am scared that this may delay getting into the trial because one of the requirements is that the brain mets must be stable and off steroids for 3 months before entry into trial. March 24 was my last steroid, so hoping this \"boost\" doesn't require any more steroids. EDIT: My onc just called and said I will not be doing the boost tomorrow because I would have to go on steroids again and it would delay the trial. So, we will wait and do another brain MRI in a few months. I am really excited about this trial. One drug is Veliparib (PARP inhibitor that many TN mets women are showing promising result on) and Lapatinib (Tykerb) which is approved for skin cancer but is showing promise for TN as well. I had my genes tested by Foundation One, and Lapatinib was one drug they recommended trying because I over-express EGFR. This trial only allows 2 prior treatments in the mets setting. I have had two (Taxol & cisplatin) so if I go onto another/different treatment, I would be ineligible for this trial. This is my last chance to get into it!",

The results today showed nothing new, and the nodules in my lungs had shrunk some more (about 7 mm now). The thing that bothered me is that the radiologist who read the report said my neck scan was clear!! I have several large nodules in the left side of my neck and they actually feel bigger with a few smaller ones that I now feel below them, so I have NO confidence in whoever read the scans. My doctor is going to contact the radiologist and ask for some explanation and call me back. So, got #12 of the taxol today and continuing on. The pain is probably from the accumulating effects of chemo. My feet are a little more numb too but tolerable right now. I didn't go to Emory U as they were in a hurry to get started and I am not ready at this point in my treatment.",
