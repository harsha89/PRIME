    "Content": "2tonTony wrote: Greetings All, My dear mom was recently diagnosed (late September) with invasive ductal carcinoma. There is not one minute that I don't think about it. As her youngest son and baby of the family, I am currently seeking the best treatment options for her. We had treatment consultations at an NCI center (City of Hope) and NAPBC accredited center (Huntington Hospital). Both places seemed very optimistic about her treatment. Now we just need to decide where she will be receiving treatment. Do you ladies have any advice? Both facilities recommended a breast MRI, but the NAPBC doctor said she won't need additional scans. My understanding is that older ladies have slower growing tumors. However, I want reassurance that it hasn't spread. She has had pains in there left calf and knees. This may be attributable to her age (>70) and arthritis. Most of the pain occurs at night. I just need the peace of mind. If I push for additional scans, what is the likelihood they will do it? Thanks, Tony Log in to post a reply",
