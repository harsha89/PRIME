And give yourself little treats.  You are Shopping mommy, after all.  Favorite tea which is usually too expensive.  Lip gloss.  Aromatherapy pedicure (doctor permitting).  Favorite Starbucks treat.  Magazines!  I swear, whenever a new round of surgery starts for me, I order up about a thousand magazine subscriptions.  And then I take them either to a friend who just had treatments, or I take them to the breast center at my hospital.  And so... the magazines are actually a charitable thing, right?  I can have as many as I want.  :) In the bag!  You are going to do a great job.

I get it -- FH= future husband! I have to tell you, I wasn't going to go the recon route. First sx in 2008 -- partial mx -- I always knew that when it came to be my turn for full mx, I wouldn't recon. But a couple of things changed my mind recently. I'm trying to look on the bright side -- and I feel the same way about nipples! There's something of a madcap quality to building nipples! Really looking forward to your full report. Plus your flowers report. Thinking of flowers right now, with my little city hall wedding. I feel the flowers will be important: plus, for us, where we will go to lunch after. Yes -- interested in getting out of bed and off the couch with BMX, since I'm going to be on my own a lot (by choice). How bad can it be? Have no idea how I'm going to get up without pushing up. Carebear and I are thinking about what we'll bring to the hospital. Karoline? How long were you in for? Don't want to stay forever, but I would dread being \"out on the street\" within 24 hours...

Why do we have to be so sober for everything all the time?! :) I have had sooo many biopsies and other procedures completely sober. I did not know to ask for Ativan, etc. When I (finally) brought it up (at a bx), I was told I should have asked my PCP. It took me years to get up the courage to figure this out! So if one of our sisters is worried about pain, or scared, and asks for a numbing shot, why can't they just give it? I do believe this might not be bad (the drain removal), in the scheme of things. I'm just siding with you on principle! Okay, I will now get off my soapbox and add you to our schedule. XXX",

That will be excellent. CareBear, what are you having? I'm having BMX with tissue expanders. I'm hoping they'll do the entire fill during that surgery -- in fact, the PS says he will. I do not want the drama of going back for multiple fills. Hooray! I'm going to change the first message to reflect our schedule. CareBear, if your sx date turns out not to be the 6th, I will change your date. You guys make me feel so much better! So let's talk about this. What are you packing to wear at the hospital. I know there is a great thread on prepping for surgery -- I've read it thoroughly -- but I want to discuss among us. What are you bringing with you? PJs, or the hospital pjs? Slippers? A comfy blanket, or are you worried about hospital germs? Perhaps you're bringing none of this, since you'll be home before you know it... I think I will be in for a couple of days at least. Sending you hugs! XXXXXOOOOO",

Rare cancer in breast 2008 -- not ductal or lobular -- a large one. Partial mx 2008. Tested like crazy since then. Seven punch biopsies, stereotactic wire biopsy. 11 cm lumpectomy in April of this year: benign. All in the same breast. Each time Mx was on the table. This time I'm going to be the one putting things on the table. Reducing my risk of bc to one percent. No more MRIs! No more lumpectomies! I have to tell you the truth: I can't wait. I'm 43. So, welcome Laurie! I'm going to put your sx on the schedule. December 9th it is! CareBear -- my children are 7 and 8. I know this year I won't want to go do that the day after Christmas. But you and your husband are so clever to do that! Have not had genetic testing. My maternal gm died from bc when she was my age, but that wasn't enough for them to warrant testing (plus my other surgeries)! Am currently on their radar for endometrial biopsies, though, since I've had some abnormal bleeding. Not dealing with that this month. So glad you guys are here! I have been lonely. Laurie, are you doing your Christmas shopping right now? :) XXX",

Geesh, I turn my back for one minute to work a 10-hour day and we get all of these new folks! I am going to put you in our schedule. Swimmom, it's so normal to have anxiety. Xanax sounds perfect. Your PCP might give you Ativan instead. I think Xanax is pretty strong stuff (depending on the dosage) -- you might want to take half and see. Ativan, in my opinion, is better for daytime, although many people take it at night if they can't sleep. You know you can always talk to me, or to us. PM me if you want, anytime. My anxiety is taking the form of crazy amounts of trying to get everything done. And, you know, it's the end of the semester, so I have a really good excuse to work like crazy. Carebear, I wish I had a very tall bed! Although I don't wish it right at the moment. Hey Karoline! Thanks so much for joining us and offering to answer Qs. I have one right off the bat -- why so long between exchange and nipple recon? Don't know much about that part of it yet. It makes total sense to have put off the wedding planning... but now that you are in full planning mode, I so look forward to details! My LLP and I are getting married in MA in March. We've been together 17 years. Ours will be a small city hall wedding with a lunch, just for the Federal benefits. And we will have our two seven year olds with us! I like the way our thread is including sx scheduling/anxiety/nipple recon Qs/Christmas updates/wedding planning. You guys are making me feel so much better.",

He said accidentally turning over was no problem, but it just wouldn't be comfortable for me. They do emphasize sleeping somewhat sitting up for a few days. Not all the way, but with many pillows. That's for the swelling and the drainage. My old BS said you could run at four weeks, but really, she said, it depends on the bra. If you have a snug-fitting sport bra -- or two of them, one over the other -- and if you can run without bounce, she said that was okay. What's not okay is running before drains or stitches or steri-strips are out. Don't want sweat and bacteria in the 'wound' -- want it to heal as soon as possible. Keep me posted, though. I want real-world examples too!",

It may seem too elementary for your 11-year-old, but I think she might appreciate it too. I second the sister on here with the story of herself as a child worrying about what she did not know. It sounds like you have a good plan to tell the children. Just wanted to add my two cents to your situation with the gossipy mothers. Don't forget -- no matter what your treatment plan is -- you do not have to tell anyone anything. Are you British? I thought you might be, from the word 'mum' in your post. I think you Brits are great at deflecting nosy people with a quick word or two :) I didn't tell anyone at work anything. I just decided to start there, not knowing what I would do. I didn't have chemo, but I have had many obvious things. For example, I once had 34DDD breasts, and then I walked into work with no breasts, completely flat, no foobs, and did not say anything. It felt so good to keep it out of the workplace that I just stuck with it. I have never regretted it. I did not even tell colleagues to whom I feel close. I just did not want the drama. I felt I needed quiet space to keep going. Don't forget -- you are welcome to tell anyone you want, of course -- exbrnx girl is right. People will want to help, and that can be great -- AND you are also welcome to not talk about it with some other people. You are in charge!",

Obviously, the whole thing has to come out, no matter what anyone says. So I'm facing full mx.  Obviously, given my history, even a biopsy is not enough.  Oh, and my grandmother died of BC at 42 -- my age now.  I know she's not immediate family. I am worried I'm going to have to fight and fight for someone to listen to me.  I'm worried I'm going to be pushed to the side, like before.  And then it seems I'm fighting to have my breast cut off -- in fact, I'll probably do them both, for symmetry if nothing else.  It seems strange to have to fight for that. I'm writing for help.  If my pathology looks strange, or 'inconclusive,' or 'stable,' -- I don't know what to do.  I need help.  I know something's not right with this lump.  I'm facing the consequences of that.  But I can't face the possibility of fighting with doctors in this way.

I don't want to worry my little ones by bringing a hospital bed in, but I don't want to not be able to sleep either.. I'm unnecessarily worried about this one detail. Or should I just get one of those bed wedges? ",
