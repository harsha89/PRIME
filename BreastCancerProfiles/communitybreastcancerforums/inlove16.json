It looks like a button up top that a cafeteria lady would wear. It has pockets at the bottom with slits up the sides so that the drains fit in the pockets perfectly and are concealed. it is made out of scrub material that nurses use. Another option was given to me at the hospital..........a litttle pouch with ribbons that tied around my neck but the top was so much more comfortable for wearing around the house.",
