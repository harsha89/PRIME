Yesterday I was trying on a new bra I purchased and noticed a red/pink blotch or spot on my left breast right above the areola. I would say that it's about the size of half dollar, maybe bigger. The area feels hot, sore and a bit stiff/hard. I googled my symptoms and the farthest thing from my mind was that the word \"cancer\" would appear. I am a huge researcher and read anything and everything on IBC and it made me worry big time. I told my sister about it and she got me an appointment today to see a breast surgeon. The results of that appointment was exactly what I read on the Internet about misdiagnosis, the doctor said its an infection and gave me rx for antibiotic. My mind does not feel better about that, he said that he felt what could be a nodule on the \"infected\" breast and my right breast hurt when he examined it. He also said \"that does not look like ibc\", which did not sit well with me since it can not be detected just by looking at it, mammogram or ultrasound. I've compared pictures and symptoms online and I must say, I have quite a few ibc symptoms. Any thoughts from ladies who have been misdiagnosed or know of anyone? Log in to post a reply",
