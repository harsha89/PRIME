I want to thank all of you for your support through Oct 2011 - the move we all want to have far back in our rearview mirror. ____ update on me...  yesterday I had my herceptin IV and then I meet with ONC (first time since I ended chemo Aug 29).  She was so excited by how well the chemo had worked based on my surgical path report.  She also told me that my post chemo muga (heart test) was better then my pre-chemo one.  Which really shocked me because before chemo I was working out 10 hours per week.  After all that I went to PS for my 2nd fill.  I told him last week's fill (60cc) wasn't too bad to deal with so to fill me with as much as he could.  He put 75cc in left and 80cc in right.  I told him I would rather deal with the muscle spasms and discomfort rather then take longer to get my chest ready for exchange.   At this rate I will be done with fills around Nov 22 and have my exchange early Jan.  I can not wait to get these TE out of my chest.  As I told my PS yesterday these TE are the worst part so far of my cancer journey and that includes 4 months of chem and BMX.",

Fingers crossed I make it back home tonight we no issues :) Update on TE. Friday is hopefully my last fill (as long as no more of the dissolving stitches that are deep in my tissue don't work their way out through my incision - that's what delayed my last fill last wek). I am at approx 360 cc. The two implants we are looking at are 350cc or 460cc. I think I make my decision and then change my mind. DH suggested we have PS do the fill for the 460cc and see what we think. I guess the upside to having theTE we can try on sizes - heehee",

As for the hair I had it cut short a few days prior to starting Chemo and donated it. It made me feel a little better but I have days that I get mad that I want me hair back. It does grow back I promise. I am 6 1/2 week post Chemo and have stubble. You just have to stay focus on the main goal kicking cancers butt. CLC-- the two drains i had out hurt a little, but not much. Funny your DH commented on all the tubing inside you -mine had the same comment. Today I am a bit down. I was scheduled to have my last two drains removed this morning but they are still putting out 30+ml per day and they have to below 25ml for. My PS to remove them. So now aim scheduled for next Tues. My DH has never missed and appointment but he has to so out of town next week so I have to get a friend to take me :(",

Ladies take time for yourself if that time includes crying then cry.

Kim - There are so many variables and opinions when dealing with treatment opitions.  My recommendation  is take your time making your decision on treatment.  My 2nd opinion was in conflict with my BS and ONC treatment plan.  I went with the recommendation of my BS and ONC who I trust and I am happy I did. I hope everyone is healing and we all have a week of fewer complications and more comfort. Margie",

I tried on a bunch of wigs on found one we all like. I didn't buy it that day - it was very over whelming (I started Chemo 3 weeks after diagnosis so I was still trying to come to terms with everything). I got the style name, brand and color thinking I would go back and purchase it. My BF went online and found the same wig on sale it saved me $75 my insurance doesn't pay for wigs. I also got a couple cheaper wigs at the American cancer society website www.tlcdirect.org. I am wearing one of my cheaper ones in my avatar. I will tell you I didn't wear my wigs much. I did mostly bandanas. I only wore wigs when I a store or where there were people I didn't know.",

Tomorrow I will be wearing you all on my back :)  I have a team doing the Susan G race for a cure here in Charlotte.  We have signs they give you to write names that you race in celebration for and I will have my Oct sisters on it.

Dawn --  that is great of your OBGYN.  I cannot thank my OBGYN and a friend who works there enough for their help when I was diagnosed.  The way I was notified of my cancer was a phone call from the Dr who did the biopsy.  I got that call on Thurs of Easter weekend.  My DH and I felt lost.  Luckily for us a friend had gotten the same phone call 2 years earlier so we talked to them over the weekend and they suggested a group of Dr at one of the hospitals in Charlotte.  This group of Dr specialize in breast cancer and are oncology surgeons.  My OBGYN started trying to get me an appointment with then, but due to the holiday and spring break they were not getting a call back (no one ever found out what the issue was).  I made an appointment with my OBGYN to talk to her about my diagnosis and my frustration in getting an appointment with the surgeon's office.  I dind't realize a wife of one of my DH golfing buddies worked at my OBGYN.  She saw my name on the schedule to come in (she knew about my diagnosis) she popped into the exam room while I was waiting and I told her of my frustration.  When my OBGYN came in we went over my biopsy results and we talked about the group of surgeons we were trying to get me into.  I asked her if this was your diagnosis who would you trust your life with.  She named off the women surgeon in the group we were trying to get into.  I then told her that her staff had been trying for a couple of days to get my an appointment and hadn't gotten a call back.  That is when my OBGYN thankfully stepped in and call the surgeon herself and I had an appointment a week and half later.  No one knows why there was the issues getting the appointment and I have not experience any other issues.  When I went in for the first appointment I had a chip on my shoulder that I had to go to such lengths to get an appointment.  That soon changed.  I love my surgeon and she is ranked as the best breast cancer surgeon in the area.  We meet with her on a Wed at 3pm.  We discussed that I had 2 IDC tumors, a larger area of DCIS and was HER2+ and that I had to have a mastectomy.   I explain that I was extremely worried that I had cancer all through my body (the Internet can be a bad thing - we had done a bunch of research while waiting for an appointment and had ourselves scared to death).  By the end of the appointment I had a bone and cat scan scheduled to 7am the next morning, a consult that afternoon with a plastic surgeon and the next day I had an appointment with ONC Dr.  I had to make a decision of chemo first or surgery first.  Due to my case the Dr's were leaning towards chemo first but I had to make that decision.  We did go with chemo first (due to the fact that I had progressive cancer).  I was diagnosed Apr 21,  first appointment with the BS May 4 and had my first chemo May 13 and BMX Oct 4.    I can not thank my OBGYN enough for stepping in and getting me that first appointment.  --  sorry for babbling.",

CLC- massages are great.  just lay there and let you mind go.  Gamegirl - house cleaning is wonderful when going through this.  There is a service cleaning for a reason that you can apply to for cleaning while going through chemo.  You get 4 cleanings.  I had 3 during chemo and the last one will be 10 after my surgery - I have never had my house professionally cleaned and it is so nice when you are dealing with cancer. I can't believe my surgery is a week away.  It has been 5 month since I got that call that my biosy showed IDC cancer in two areas and then my MRI showed an additional area of DCIS.  I have completed 6 TCH chemo treatments and now just waiting.  I am anxious to get surgery over with, but scared to death too.  Between working full time, working out (it helps when doing chemo to do some working out), teaching Pilates one night per week and our friends and family I have kept pretty busy through all this and the 5 months have gone by pretty quickly.  I think I have stay really busy so I do not think about what's next.  Surgery is scary for me since it is the unknown, plus I will not be able to stay busy. This Sat I will be thinking about all my breast cancer sisters.  Myself and a group of friends are walking in the Susan G Komen race for a cure here in Charlotte.  That evening we are having dinner with friends and then a BBB party (by by boobies)  once again my friends are keeping me very busy. For those of you who are working while getting ready for surgery.  I suggest you think about taking some time off prior to surgery.  I am a huge workaholic who has taken 2 sicks days in 14 years.  I even worked while sitting in the chemo chair.  My last day at work is this Thursday and surgery is the following Tuesday.  Friday I have an appointment with my BS so I figured I am going to be out half the day for that so i might as well start me leave then.  My friends and DH have a number of fun things for me to do over the 4 day weekend, in additional the 4 day weekend gives me time to get my home organized for post surgery (having clothes/dishes/etc in places where I do not have to reach up). For those of you out there who have friends and family planning to bring food post surgery I recommend www.mealtrain.com  This website gives the ability to have a calendar so not everyone is bring food on the same day.  One of my best friends set it up for me and manages it.  We have someone bring food every other day for 2 weeks after surgery. have a great Monday everyone.... ",

Since my counts were really good my Dr oked for us to take a planned vacation to Jamaica May 29-June 5.  It was so nice to get away with friends and just relax.  Of course my hair started coming out Monday May 30 on Thursday my good friend came to my room and used our clippers and cut my hair really short.  I still have hair just thin (my hair started coming out on day 17 from my first TCH treatment). Yesterday I went to see my Dr and had chemo round 2.  I am doing chemo prior to surgery and yesterday my Dr could barely feel my two tumors.  she was very excited as was I.  Word of advise to anyone having chemo without a port.  (I currently do not have one since I had a trip planned.  I will be getting one at some point.)   advise --  drink a ton of liquids for a couple of days leading up to your chemo session to plump up your veins.  I did that prior to session 1 but didn't get in as many fluids before session 2 and they had to try twice to get my IV line in. So far I am symptom free from session 2.  I am doing everything I have been told by my Dr and it has been working for me. Hope everyone has a sympton free day.",

I have my first chemo (TCH) this Fri May 13.  We are doing chemo first and then surgery.  Today we go to our 2nd opinion board, tomorrow we have our pre chemo meeting (they tell you everything to expect and give you a tour of the infusion center) and my heart test.  Thurs I am getting the hair curt short and donating it.  Then Fri is the big day.  I have chemo every 3 weeks for 18 weeks.  Then once that is done surgery and hopefully reconstruction at the same time. I plan to work through my treatments.  I work remotely so I have no commute to deal with.  My Dr feels I should continue my workouts (within reason). Any suggestion for foods to have on hand for this weekend after first chemo treatment?  I am scared but ready.",
